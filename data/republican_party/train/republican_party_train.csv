Trump touted his plan , saying it ’ s a “ strong bill , but it ’ s a very fair bill . ”
“ If the Democrats choose to filibuster a framework that includes a generous path to citizenship or something that is not fair , we are not going to approve it , ” he said .
Trump added in a tweet that Democrats “ just aren ’ t calling ” on DACA and “ we have a great chance to make a deal or , blame the Dems ! ”

House Republicans , who ’ ve pounded the agency for more than a year , are now scoffing at calls to crack down on tax cheats .
They ’ re balking at a Senate plan to go after doctors who owe back taxes and another to make it easier to figure out if someone is overstating the mortgage interest deduction . They also won ’ t accept an effort to cut the number of people wrongly claiming a child tax credit .
That ’ s a major change from just a few years ago , when Republicans led a bid to help the IRS clamp down on tax shelters and backed efforts to require foreign banks to help U.S. authorities catch Americans stashing income abroad and make it harder for people to misreport their capital gains .
But that was before an inspector general report in May 2013 blasted the IRS for excessively scrutinizing tea party groups seeking tax breaks . More than 20 congressional hearings later , Republicans are in no mood to give the IRS any more authority .
“ There ’ s not a whole lot of confidence right now about what the Internal Revenue Service does among the American people , let alone members of Congress , ” said Rep. Pat Tiberi ( R-Ohio ) , who sits on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee . “ Why should we give them more tools to harass taxpayers ? ”
There are also political considerations . Cracking down on tax dodgers would step on House Republicans ’ campaign message this election year , said Floyd Williams , the IRS ’ s former director of legislative affairs .
“ If you want a simple message , and a focus on how bad the IRS is , it ’ s hard to vote to give them more tools , ” said Williams .
The dispute not only threatens efforts to collect the approximately $ 400 billion in taxes that go unpaid every year , it also puts in peril unrelated legislation because lawmakers have long turned to tax-compliance measures to raise money when they were deadlocked on tax increases and spending cuts .
A highway budget bill including several of the provisions is set to die in the Senate this week because of House Republican opposition . Another Senate measure offering tax cuts to startup companies , other small businesses , bike-sharing programs and theatrical productions that lawmakers had also hoped to finance by clamping down on unpaid taxes is also threatened .
The position puts House Republicans at odds with those in the Senate , who have never been as zealous as their House counterparts in pursuing the agency .
“ I don ’ t think Senate Republicans on the [ Finance ] committee have a big problem with just making sure taxes that are owed are being collected , ” said Sen. John Thune ( R-S.D . ) , who sits on the panel . “ It ’ s just a function of enforcing the law . ”
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden ( D-Ore. ) complained House Republicans are walling off what has long been an area of bipartisan cooperation .
“ This has been a traditional position supported by both sides of the aisle , ” he said . “ Certainly , this is a departure that needs to be addressed . ”
Before the tea party scandal hit , lawmakers had quietly agreed to raise tens of billions of dollars by improving tax collections . Wary of inconveniencing individual taxpayers , Congress often turned to banks , credit card companies and others to corroborate what people had claimed on their returns . That raised money because it not only made it easier for the IRS to detect errors , but because people are more likely to report accurate information if they know someone else will also be reporting on them .","Republicans are in no mood to give the IRS any more authority. | John Shinkle/POLITICO GOP rejects tax crackdown

The IRS-tea party scandal is claiming some collateral damage.

House Republicans, who’ve pounded the agency for more than a year, are now scoffing at calls to crack down on tax cheats.

They’re balking at a Senate plan to go after doctors who owe back taxes and another to make it easier to figure out if someone is overstating the mortgage interest deduction. They also won’t accept an effort to cut the number of people wrongly claiming a child tax credit.

That’s a major change from just a few years ago, when Republicans led a bid to help the IRS clamp down on tax shelters and backed efforts to require foreign banks to help U.S. authorities catch Americans stashing income abroad and make it harder for people to misreport their capital gains.

But that was before an inspector general report in May 2013 blasted the IRS for excessively scrutinizing tea party groups seeking tax breaks. More than 20 congressional hearings later, Republicans are in no mood to give the IRS any more authority.

“There’s not a whole lot of confidence right now about what the Internal Revenue Service does among the American people, let alone members of Congress,” said Rep. Pat Tiberi (R-Ohio), who sits on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. “Why should we give them more tools to harass taxpayers?”

There are also political considerations. Cracking down on tax dodgers would step on House Republicans’ campaign message this election year, said Floyd Williams, the IRS’s former director of legislative affairs.

“If you want a simple message, and a focus on how bad the IRS is, it’s hard to vote to give them more tools,” said Williams.

The dispute not only threatens efforts to collect the approximately $400 billion in taxes that go unpaid every year, it also puts in peril unrelated legislation because lawmakers have long turned to tax-compliance measures to raise money when they were deadlocked on tax increases and spending cuts.

A highway budget bill including several of the provisions is set to die in the Senate this week because of House Republican opposition. Another Senate measure offering tax cuts to startup companies, other small businesses, bike-sharing programs and theatrical productions that lawmakers had also hoped to finance by clamping down on unpaid taxes is also threatened.

The position puts House Republicans at odds with those in the Senate, who have never been as zealous as their House counterparts in pursuing the agency.

“I don’t think Senate Republicans on the [Finance] committee have a big problem with just making sure taxes that are owed are being collected,” said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), who sits on the panel. “It’s just a function of enforcing the law.”

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) complained House Republicans are walling off what has long been an area of bipartisan cooperation.

“This has been a traditional position supported by both sides of the aisle,” he said. “Certainly, this is a departure that needs to be addressed.”

Before the tea party scandal hit, lawmakers had quietly agreed to raise tens of billions of dollars by improving tax collections. Wary of inconveniencing individual taxpayers, Congress often turned to banks, credit card companies and others to corroborate what people had claimed on their returns. That raised money because it not only made it easier for the IRS to detect errors, but because people are more likely to report accurate information if they know someone else will also be reporting on them.",www.politico.com,left,O5J98IJoqGKskIFY

Their chances of doing so are 76 percent , according to ███ ’ s Senate forecast , which is principally based on an analysis of the polls in each state and the historical accuracy of Senate polling .
But they are not necessarily favored to have the race “ called ” for them on Tuesday night . Because of a variety of circumstances like possible runoffs in Georgia and Louisiana and the potential decision of Kansas independent Greg Orman about which party he chooses to caucus with , the outcome of the Senate may not be determined until days or weeks from now . The forecast refers only to the probability that Republicans will eventually claim control of the Senate by the time it convenes in January .
Still , for Republicans , it would be worth the wait after failed attempts to win the Senate in 2010 and 2012 . They ’ ve been modest favorites in the ███ forecast all year , in part because the national environment is favorable for them : the group of states holding key Senate elections lean red ; several Democratic incumbents have retired and the others were last elected in 2008 , a high-water mark for the Democratic party ; President Obama is unpopular and midterm elections have a long history of being challenging for the president ’ s party .
Unlike in 2010 or 2012 , however , the polls have moved toward Republicans in the closing days of the campaign — making their position more robust . The movement has been clearest in states like Kentucky , Arkansas and Georgia that typically vote Republican , suggesting the election may be converging toward the “ fundamentals ” of each state .
The uncertainty in the forecast is fairly high . Compared to Republicans ’ roughly 75 percent chance , President Obama had about a 90 percent chance of being reelected in 2012 , while Democrats had a 95 percent chance of keeping the Senate that year , according to the ███ forecast . And Republicans had about an 85 percent chance of winning the House on Election Day in 2010 .
For Democrats to make good on their 25 percent chance of keeping the Senate , they would need to win two or three races where they are underdogs according to the polls . Nevertheless , the GOP ’ s advantage is narrow in many states . Furthermore , polls in midterms and other elections have sometimes proved to have a systematic bias , overestimating the performance of one or the other party in most or all competitive races . If the polls underrate Democrats , they could win .
The uncertainty runs in both directions , however . Historically , the polls have been just as likely to be biased toward Democrats as they are to be biased toward Republicans . If Republicans beat their polls , they could win North Carolina and New Hampshire , which only narrowly favor Democrats , and finish with as many as 55 Senate seats — a potential 10-seat swing .
It has sometimes been hard this cycle to place the states into neat groupings . Republicans need to win a net of six seats from Democrats . But at least three of these — Montana , South Dakota and West Virginia — are all but guaranteed Republican pickups , while a fourth , Arkansas , has become increasingly certain . On the other hand , Republicans could easily lose Georgia and Kansas , meaning that they ’ d need to win a gross of seven or eight Democratic seats to finish with a net of six .
The battle will mostly be concentrated in the eight states which neither party has established more than a 95 percent probability of winning . These are Alaska , Colorado , Iowa , Georgia , Kansas , Louisiana , New Hampshire and North Carolina . Other states — particularly Arkansas , Kentucky and Michigan — were once competitive but would now require pronounced polling errors for the trailing candidate to win .
Still , eight is a large number of competitive states . The good news for Republicans is that they ’ ll win the Senate if they split them 4-4 . The better news is that the forecast favors Republicans in five of them — Alaska , Colorado , Georgia , Iowa and Louisiana — while it gives even odds in a sixth , Kansas . Only New Hampshire and North Carolina favor Democrats . The math is not impossible for Democrats — but it ’ s difficult .
That may be why some Democrats have begun to hope the polls are “ skewed ” against them .
Indeed , the ███ model accounts for the possibility that the polls could have an overall bias toward one party . But suppose they do not . In the final set of simulations we ran , Democrats won just 14 percent of the time when the overall bias in the polls was less than one point in either direction . This represents what we ’ ve called the “ squeaker ” scenario — Democrats eke out victories in just enough of the competitive states to win , even though the polls do a reasonably good job overall .
The Democrats ’ alternative is the “ shocker ” scenario — the case where the polls do prove to be skewed against them . In the simulations where the polls had at least a 1-point Republican bias , Democrats won the Senate 61 percent of the time . ( As should be obvious , Democrats will have no chance at all if the polls prove to have a Democratic bias ; instead , Republicans will finish with something like 54 seats . ) At this point , most of the Democrats ’ 24 percent overall win probability comes from the “ shocker ” scenario . Their situation is not as bad as Mitt Romney ’ s was in 2012 , but their chances are slim if the polls are basically telling the right story .
Although the polls could be wrong , there isn ’ t much disagreement about what they ’ re saying . Of the seven forecasting models tracked by The New York Times , all point to a Republican win , and most with about the same probability ( 75 percent ) as ███ ’ s forecast . Furthermore , they agree on the outcome of all states but Kansas . These include models that rely on polls alone and those like ███ ’ s that account for polls along with other factors .
Those other factors — the so-called “ fundamentals ” — have tended to converge with the polls over the course of the year . If used properly , they can make a forecast more stable and reduce the statistical noise associated with polling . But they make little difference now , since even those models that once used the fundamentals no longer weigh them heavily . The modest exceptions are in Kansas and Alaska , where the polling has been sparse and ( especially in Alaska ’ s case ) potentially unreliable ; the ███ model sees the fundamentals as favoring Republicans in each state . But it would still have Republicans favored on the basis of the polls alone in Alaska . And in Kansas , the fundamentals are not enough to make Republican Pat Roberts the favorite .
Expect A Long Night — Unless Republicans Get A Big Win Early
Even if Republicans win , the outcome may not be determined quickly . David Perdue , their candidate in Georgia , has gained in the polls — but the model still has the race going to a runoff about half the time . Louisiana will almost certainly require a runoff . Alaska ’ s vote may take days or weeks to count , as it has in the past . The ███ model — even with its optimistic forecast for Republicans overall — estimates there ’ s just a one in three chance that the election will be called for them on Tuesday night or early in the day on Wednesday . For Democrats , meanwhile , there ’ s almost no chance to win without going to “ overtime ; ” the party will hope to extend the race for as long as possible .
There are two Republican wins , however , that could end the race quickly . Pay attention to races in North Carolina and New Hampshire . Both states have early poll-closing times ( 7:30 EST for North Carolina and 8:00 EST for New Hampshire ) and a Republican win in either state would require Democrats to run the table in almost every other competitive race . But Republican wins would simultaneously indicate that the polls might be biased toward Democrats rather than against them , making a Democratic sweep the rest of the night very unlikely .
Although this represents ███ ’ s pre-election forecast , we ’ ll be tracking the elections for as long as it takes on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning .

republican_party,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/6/9114731/who-is-carly-fiorina,Carly Fiorina: What you need to know about the winner of the early Republican debate,2015-08-06,"Timothy B. Lee, Sigal Samuel, Terry Nguyen, Rebecca Jennings, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz, Theodore Schleifer","███ 's Ezra Klein says that Carly Fiorina won the first Republican debate on Thursday , which featured candidates who did n't make the cut for the top-tier debate later in the evening . And lots of other pundits — on the left and right — agree . Her strong debate performance will cause many voters , donors , and political pundits to give her candidacy a second look , and could propel her onto the main stage for future debates .
Fiorina is an unorthodox presidential candidate with an interesting life story . In the 1990s , she broke the glass ceiling to become one of the first women to lead a Fortune 500 company . But she had a rocky tenure there and was fired after six years on the job . Since then , she 's battled cancer and made an unsuccessful run for US Senate .
Fiorina argues that her experience running a Fortune 500 company gives her executive skills and an outsider 's perspective that would be valuable in the presidency . But she still faces an uphill battle to convince voters to choose her over candidates with a more conventional background in elected office .
With no experience in elected office and a limited base of political support , Fiorina has fared poorly in the polls , so she was not able to participate in Thursday 's prime time debate . Instead , she was relegated to the earlier debate alongside long shots like George Pataki , Jim Gilmore , and Lindsey Graham .
But her clear , confident answers to the moderators ' questions , and her attacks on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump , helped her stand out from the crowd .
`` Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi , she lies about emails , '' Fiorina said . `` She is still defending Planned Parenthood . And she is still her party 's frontrunner . ''
`` I did n't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race , '' she said . `` Maybe it 's because I had n't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife 's Senate campaign . ''
Fiorina was widely hailed as the winner of the early debate by pundits . `` Carly Fiorina won the ‘ Happy Hour ’ debate . By a lot , '' gushed the Washington Post 's Chris Cillizza . Chris Wallace and George Will on Fox News both concurred .

''","Vox's Ezra Klein says that Carly Fiorina won the first Republican debate on Thursday, which featured candidates who didn't make the cut for the top-tier debate later in the evening. And lots of other pundits — on the left and right — agree. Her strong debate performance will cause many voters, donors, and political pundits to give her candidacy a second look, and could propel her onto the main stage for future debates.

Fiorina is an unorthodox presidential candidate with an interesting life story. In the 1990s, she broke the glass ceiling to become one of the first women to lead a Fortune 500 company. But she had a rocky tenure there and was fired after six years on the job. Since then, she's battled cancer and made an unsuccessful run for US Senate.

Fiorina argues that her experience running a Fortune 500 company gives her executive skills and an outsider's perspective that would be valuable in the presidency. But she still faces an uphill battle to convince voters to choose her over candidates with a more conventional background in elected office.

What did Carly Fiorina say in the debate?

With no experience in elected office and a limited base of political support, Fiorina has fared poorly in the polls, so she was not able to participate in Thursday's prime time debate. Instead, she was relegated to the earlier debate alongside long shots like George Pataki, Jim Gilmore, and Lindsey Graham.

But her clear, confident answers to the moderators' questions, and her attacks on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, helped her stand out from the crowd.

""Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about emails,"" Fiorina said. ""She is still defending Planned Parenthood. And she is still her party's frontrunner.""

Fiorina also attacked Republican frontrunner Donald Trump.

""I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race,"" she said. ""Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.""

Fiorina was widely hailed as the winner of the early debate by pundits. ""Carly Fiorina won the ‘Happy Hour’ debate. By a lot,"" gushed the Washington Post's Chris Cillizza. Chris Wallace and George Will on Fox News both concurred.

Who is Carly Fiorina?

Fiorina is best known as the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard. Fiorina was named to that post in 1999, after two decades as an executive at AT&T and its spinoff, Lucent. Her appointment to run HP instantly made her one of the most prominent women in the business world.

Does Fiorina have political experience?

In 2010, two successful Republican businesswomen ran high office in California. Meg Whitman, former CEO of eBay, ran for governor. Fiorina ran to represent California in the US Senate. Both women lost.

Fiorina ran against incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA). She ran in a good year for Republicans — it was the year a Tea Party wave gave Republicans control of the House — but she was running in heavily Democratic California against a popular incumbent.

Daniel Horowitz , a conservative strategist and editor of the site ConservativeReview.com , said that now that Republicans have control of Congress , `` there 's nowhere to run , and nowhere to hide '' for those who have n't kept their promises to the GOP base .

Paul Lindsay , spokesman for the establishment-friendly outside group American Crossroads , said nominating strong candidates takes on added urgency because of the tough political terrain for Republicans .

Building on lessons from that cycle and 2010 , national Republicans this year decided to aggressively engage in primary fights to help nominate strong candidates , and the strategy brought the GOP great success .
But their primary successes took huge amounts of resources from the establishment , both financial and human , and considerable message discipline across the GOP .

The Republican establishment won big during this year's midterm elections, fending off far-right candidates in primary races who might have threatened the party's bid to retake full control of Congress.

2016 will be tougher.

GOP leaders will have to keep an eye on a wide-open presidential primary, along with internal party fights at the House, Senate and gubernatorial levels.

republican_party,Reason,2,http://reason.com/blog/2018/04/20/tariffs-and-political-consequences-gop,Republicans Could Face Political Consequences Over Trump's Tariffs,2018-04-20,"Eric Boehm, Josh Blackman, Xander Peters, Charles Oliver, Veronique De Rugy, Christian Britschgi, Cosmo Wenman, Joe Setyon, Zuri Davis","Tariffs have economic consequences , both intended and unintended . They also have political consequences , as Republicans will likely learn in the months ahead .
At the intersection of the economic and political fallout from a potential trade war with China lies the soybean . America is the world 's top producer of the crop , and China is the world 's largest consumer . China bought more than $ 14 billion of American-grown soy last year , accounting for 61 percent of total U.S. soybean exports and more than 30 percent of overall U.S. soybean production . In response to President Donald Trump 's decision to impose tariffs on more than 1,300 Chinese-made goods last month , China has threatened a 25 percent tariff on soybeans and other American agricultural products .
If soybeans were commonly grown in Brooklyn or San Francisco , Republicans probably would n't have to worry about upsetting the people who produce them . But as the GOP tries to keep control of Congress this year , the fact that Iowa , Minnesota , Missouri , and North Dakota are some of the nation 's top soybean-producing states is creating some headaches for the party of Trump . Key congressional races across the Midwest could tip the scales in the House , and Republicans are eyeing Democrat-held Senate seats in Missouri and North Dakota to pad a slim 51–49 majority in the upper chamber .
With that in mind , The New York Times has dispatched a reporter to soybean country—specifically to Cass County , North Dakota , the nation 's top soybean-producing county—to see what farmers think about Trump 's trade skirmishes with China .
`` If he does n't understand what he 's doing to the nation by doing what he 's doing , he 's going to be a one-term president , plain and simple , '' Robert Runck , a fourth-generation farmer , informs the paper . Runck tells the Times that tariffs would `` cost Kevin Cramer some votes '' too . Cramer is the Republican congressman who currently represents all of North Dakota , and he 's hoping to unseat Sen. Heidi Heitkamp ( D–N.D . ) in November .
An analysis from the Brookings Institution shows that Trump 's tariffs figure to do the most damage to the economies of red states including Iowa , Missouri , Ohio , and Pennsylvania . ( Missouri , remember , is hosting a key Senate race this year . )
When it comes to Chinese tariffs on American agricultural products , Brookings found that much of the pain is again concentrated in the Midwest .
Trump 's tariffs are his way of fulfilling a campaign-trail promise to revive American steel plants . But the protectionist policies that might help boost steel mills come at the expense of a much larger group within the president 's political coalition . For every steel-producing job in the country , there are about 46 steel-consuming jobs—many of which are now on shakier ground because of the higher costs created by tariffs .
And on the agriculture front , the president `` has little to no understanding of the farm coalition , '' Republican strategist Karl Rove tells the Times .
Trump is New Yorker who ran hotels and casinos , then became a TV star . Nothing about that résumé suggests that he would have a detailed understanding of the concerns of a North Dakota farmer—no , Trump Steaks do not count—or an Ohio machine shop worker . But Trump supporters have never seemed to care that the president is n't like them . Indeed , Trump 's unwillingness to make phony attempts at courting rural voters is one of the things that made him stand out during the campaign .
But it 's one thing to support a candidate who is nothing like you . It 's another to keep supporting him , and his party , when he is actively making your job more difficult or your lifestyle more costly .

They also have political consequences, as Republicans will likely learn in the months ahead.

At the intersection of the economic and political fallout from a potential trade war with China lies the soybean. America is the world's top producer of the crop, and China is the world's largest consumer. China bought more than $14 billion of American-grown soy last year, accounting for 61 percent of total U.S. soybean exports and more than 30 percent of overall U.S. soybean production. In response to President Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs on more than 1,300 Chinese-made goods last month, China has threatened a 25 percent tariff on soybeans and other American agricultural products.

If soybeans were commonly grown in Brooklyn or San Francisco, Republicans probably wouldn't have to worry about upsetting the people who produce them. But as the GOP tries to keep control of Congress this year, the fact that Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, and North Dakota are some of the nation's top soybean-producing states is creating some headaches for the party of Trump. Key congressional races across the Midwest could tip the scales in the House, and Republicans are eyeing Democrat-held Senate seats in Missouri and North Dakota to pad a slim 51–49 majority in the upper chamber.

With that in mind, The New York Times has dispatched a reporter to soybean country—specifically to Cass County, North Dakota, the nation's top soybean-producing county—to see what farmers think about Trump's trade skirmishes with China.

""If he doesn't understand what he's doing to the nation by doing what he's doing, he's going to be a one-term president, plain and simple,"" Robert Runck, a fourth-generation farmer, informs the paper. Runck tells the Times that tariffs would ""cost Kevin Cramer some votes"" too. Cramer is the Republican congressman who currently represents all of North Dakota, and he's hoping to unseat Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D–N.D.) in November.

An analysis from the Brookings Institution shows that Trump's tariffs figure to do the most damage to the economies of red states including Iowa, Missouri, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. (Missouri, remember, is hosting a key Senate race this year.)

When it comes to Chinese tariffs on American agricultural products, Brookings found that much of the pain is again concentrated in the Midwest.

Trump's tariffs are his way of fulfilling a campaign-trail promise to revive American steel plants. But the protectionist policies that might help boost steel mills come at the expense of a much larger group within the president's political coalition. For every steel-producing job in the country, there are about 46 steel-consuming jobs—many of which are now on shakier ground because of the higher costs created by tariffs.

And on the agriculture front, the president ""has little to no understanding of the farm coalition,"" Republican strategist Karl Rove tells the Times.

Trump is New Yorker who ran hotels and casinos, then became a TV star. Nothing about that résumé suggests that he would have a detailed understanding of the concerns of a North Dakota farmer—no, Trump Steaks do not count—or an Ohio machine shop worker. But Trump supporters have never seemed to care that the president isn't like them. Indeed, Trump's unwillingness to make phony attempts at courting rural voters is one of the things that made him stand out during the campaign.

But it's one thing to support a candidate who is nothing like you. It's another to keep supporting him, and his party, when he is actively making your job more difficult or your lifestyle more costly.

Trump won the American heartland in part by promising to end a regulatory war on agricultural and industrial jobs, and he has been following through on that promise. But he now risks replacing one set of oppressive economic policies with another, putting farmers and manufacturers on the front lines of a trade war. The fact that he's not directly responsible for Chinese tariffs on soybeans might not save Trump, or the rest of his party, from the ire of those who suffer the consequences of these myopic trade policies.

Donald Trump is shrugging off the refusal of some Republican leaders to endorse him, saying most of the party will back his nomination and new voters will compensate for the rest.

""Look, I'm going to get millions and millions of votes more than the Republicans would have gotten,"" Trump said an interview broadcast Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press.

Trump was addressing questions raised by House Speaker Paul Ryan, who is scheduled to meet with the presumptive presidential nominee on Thursday.

In an interview on ABC's This Week, Trump said he is a ""very different"" kind of candidate, and party unity may not be as big a factor because of new Republicans.

""I think it would be better if it were unified,"" Trump said, adding that ""I don't think it actually has to be unified"" in the more traditional sense.

""It's not called the Conservative Party,"" he told ABC. ""This is called the Republican Party.""

Ryan has said he is not yet ready to endorse Trump because of doubts about his conservatism, while other party members have flatly come out against the nominee-in-waiting. That group includes 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney as well as former 2016 GOP hopefuls Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham. They cited issues ranging from Trump's abrasive language to his comments about women and Hispanics.

Trump lacks the ""temperament or strength of character"" to be president, Bush wrote in a Facebook post on Friday. The former Florida governor added that ""he has not displayed a respect for the Constitution. And, he is not a consistent conservative.""

Bush's brother and father, the two former presidents, have announced they would not attend the July convention that crowns Trump and had no plans to endorse, while Romney has denounced the New York businessman as a ""phony"" and a ""fraud.""

Graham, the South Carolina senator who like Bush lost to Trump in the Republican nomination fight, told CNN: ""Good luck with Paul Ryan trying to find a conservative agenda with this guy.""

In his NBC interview, Trump said Romney is ""ungrateful"" for his support in 2012, and that the former Massachusetts governor ""choked"" on his chance to beat President Obama. Trump said that Bush and Graham are angry that he beat them during the nomination fight, and he noted that both once backed a pledge to support the nominee.

""Now they're breaking,"" Trump said. ""You know, that's a question of honor.”

The presumptive Republican nominee said he was ""blindsided"" by Ryan's reluctance to endorse, saying he thought he had a good relationship with the House speaker.

Ryan told CNN he wants to back the nominee, but ""I'm not there right now.""

Democrats are enjoying all the GOP in-fighting — particularly likely presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who is targeting anti-Trump Republicans for the fall general election.

""Obviously I'm reaching out to Democrats, Republicans, Independents — all voters who want a candidate who is running a campaign based on issues,"" Clinton told CBS' Face the Nation.

Trump, saying he will beat ""Crooked Hillary"" easily in the fall, says most Republicans will wind up backing his candidacy.

Since the Republican State Leadership Committee burst into national politics , it ’ s become one of the most influential outside players on the right : It spent tens of millions of dollars to flip state legislative chambers and redraw the congressional map in Republicans ’ favor — and is poised to pump millions more this fall into locking down state capitals for the GOP .
But the group ’ s swift ascent has not come without controversy — or lingering legal hazard . At the height of its political emergence , the RSLC was implicated in a risky campaign finance scheme that an internal report warned could trigger “ possible criminal penalties ” and “ ultimately threaten the organization ’ s continued existence , ” according to a confidential document ███ obtained from a source .
The September 2011 report , prepared by the prominent Washington law firm BakerHostetler , was presented to an RSLC board then helmed by former Republican Party Chairman Ed Gillespie — RSLC ’ s chief financial rainmaker starting in 2010 and now a candidate for the U.S. Senate .
Never disclosed until now , the document detailed an investigation into alleged misconduct by multiple RSLC officials during the crucial 2010 election cycle : It charged that national RSLC leaders conspired improperly with the leader of the Alabama Republican Party to use the RSLC as a pass-through for controversial Indian tribe donations , essentially laundering “ toxic ” money from the gaming industry by routing it out of state and then back into Alabama .
“ If these events are made public , the resulting media frenzy will be a political disaster for Alabama Republicans , a disaster with which RSLC will forever be associated , ” the report concluded of the alleged plot in Alabama .
The RSLC has faced no legal or criminal consequences in connection with its Alabama activities . But the RSLC report ’ s conclusions — furiously contested at the time and firmly denied to this day by three officials named in the report — inflamed an explosive internal confrontation at the organization .
The group parted ways with two senior advisers , who have denounced the RSLC probe as a calculated power grab by internal competitors . RSLC leaders approved a severance deal for the group ’ s former chairman , Tim Barnes , who resigned and inked a confidentiality agreement to keep the arrangement private .
The confidential report , bearing the logo of BakerHostetler , offers a rare window into the Wild West of unrestricted campaign spending . That sector of the political world has aroused widespread suspicion among campaign finance watchdogs even as powerfully funded outside groups and their leaders have become increasingly part of the political mainstream .
The RSLC is a prime example of the rise of free-spending and largely opaque groups that have taken center stage in national politics over the last few election cycles . Though more than a decade old , the state-oriented political committee broke out in a major way during the conservative wave of 2010 as it helped Republicans seize control of legislatures long held by Democrats , including Alabama ’ s .
Riding a tide of big-donor money and Beltway acclaim , RSLC leaders have gone on to positions of increasing political prominence : Gillespie , RSLC ’ s lead fundraiser and later its board chairman , is seeking to oust Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia in this year ’ s midterms . Mike Hubbard , who chaired the Alabama Republican Party in 2010 , became speaker of the Alabama House .
The RSLC ’ s current president , Matt Walter , declined to comment on the details of the BakerHostetler report and described it as a “ stolen ” document . He said the RSLC has a “ very detailed and thorough enforcement process ” to ensure it operates on the right side of the law .
“ That is an internal report that is now a couple administrations old at the RSLC and was designed to be an internal report , ” Walter said . “ It appears that a thorough review was done and , again , this is several administrations ago . All of the decision-makers cited in it are no longer employed by the RSLC . ”
Walter said the group no longer has a relationship with Hubbard , who remains one of the most powerful Republicans in Alabama . “ We have not talked to Mike Hubbard in some time , ” he said .
According to the BakerHostetler report , the questionable campaign finance scheme went something like this : Hubbard would raise Alabama money into the national RSLC account , including from the deep-pocketed Poarch Creek Indian Tribe . In return , the national group would put every dollar Hubbard raised back into Alabama , obscuring the original source of the money .
RSLC raised some $ 1.1 million from Alabama between January 2009 and March 2011 , according to the report . IRS records show the group took in $ 550,000 from the Poarch Creek tribe during that period : $ 350,000 during the 2010 election campaign and an additional $ 200,000 in January 2011 .
During the same time period , RSLC ’ s Alabama PAC directed some $ 1.4 million to the Alabama GOP and several other state groups , including multiple PACs controlled by Hubbard . It also sent $ 100,000 to a group , Citizens for a Better Alabama , that the report describes as “ the renamed ‘ Citizens Against Legalized Lottery ’ ( ‘ CALL ’ ) , one of the Christian groups through which Jack Abramoff funneled Choctaw Indian-money . ”
The RSLC board report , dated Sept. 14 , 2011 , and authored by BakerHostetler election attorney Mark Braden and two other lawyers , warned that the path of the Alabama money could trip over a state law that bans “ making or accepting a contribution by one person in the name of another. ” Violation of that law would be a misdemeanor .
“ It is … common knowledge and wisdom in Alabama that taking a contribution directly from the tribe is political suicide for a Republican candidate or public official , ” the report stated . “ Here RSLC appears to have served as both a recipient of the funds in question and as a donor of the funds back to Alabama , thereby permitting Mike Hubbard to do indirectly that which he could not do directly . ”
The report continued : “ RSLC-AL [ the group ’ s Alabama PAC ] would mail contributions directly to Hubbard at his office , and he would personally deliver these contributions . It would appear , then , to an outside observer that Hubbard was raising money for RSLC that was either politically toxic or in excess of Alabama contribution limits , and then channeling that money through RSLC back to himself in order to get around the governing Alabama campaign finance laws . ”
The document , referred to casually as the “ Braden memo ” by several Republicans involved with RSLC , said that one senior RSLC official — the group ’ s former president , Scott Ward — confirmed the existence of a “ one-for-one deal , under which Hubbard would raise money for RSLC in return for which RSLC would contribute the same amount of money back into Alabama . ”
Ward denies that he offered any such confirmation and called the report a “ [ Chris ] Jankowski political document ” — referring to the strategist who took over as the RSLC ’ s president in 2011 — “ intended to smear Mike Hubbard and Tim Barnes . ”
“ I deny the conclusions of the report and stand behind what we did in Alabama . And the statements attributed to me in the report are false , ” said Ward , who no longer has a relationship with RSLC .
According to the BakerHostetler report and several RSLC officials with direct knowledge of the internal investigation , the probe began after multiple botched donations in Alabama came to light in the spring of 2011 . Running afoul of a newly enacted state law barring so-called PAC-to-PAC donations , RSLC transferred $ 150,000 to a pair of political entities supporting Republican candidates in the state .

The confidential report, bearing the logo of BakerHostetler, offers a rare window into the Wild West of unrestricted campaign spending. That sector of the political world has aroused widespread suspicion among campaign finance watchdogs even as powerfully funded outside groups and their leaders have become increasingly part of the political mainstream.

The RSLC is a prime example of the rise of free-spending and largely opaque groups that have taken center stage in national politics over the last few election cycles. Though more than a decade old, the state-oriented political committee broke out in a major way during the conservative wave of 2010 as it helped Republicans seize control of legislatures long held by Democrats, including Alabama’s.

Riding a tide of big-donor money and Beltway acclaim, RSLC leaders have gone on to positions of increasing political prominence: Gillespie, RSLC’s lead fundraiser and later its board chairman, is seeking to oust Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia in this year’s midterms. Mike Hubbard, who chaired the Alabama Republican Party in 2010, became speaker of the Alabama House.

The RSLC’s current president, Matt Walter, declined to comment on the details of the BakerHostetler report and described it as a “stolen” document. He said the RSLC has a “very detailed and thorough enforcement process” to ensure it operates on the right side of the law.

All of the decision-makers cited in it are no longer employed by the RSLC.”

Walter said the group no longer has a relationship with Hubbard, who remains one of the most powerful Republicans in Alabama. “We have not talked to Mike Hubbard in some time,” he said.

‘The Braden memo’

According to the BakerHostetler report, the questionable campaign finance scheme went something like this: Hubbard would raise Alabama money into the national RSLC account, including from the deep-pocketed Poarch Creek Indian Tribe. In return, the national group would put every dollar Hubbard raised back into Alabama, obscuring the original source of the money.

Running afoul of a newly enacted state law barring so-called PAC-to-PAC donations, RSLC transferred $150,000 to a pair of political entities supporting Republican candidates in the state. Both donations were returned amid a spate of negative publicity.",www.politico.com,left,L2FiGyNh7IZIvjW3

President Obama and Congress will not solve America’s problems unless the people force them to. Washington is America’s problem. We are the solution.

America remains a conservative nation. But the people crave leadership — champions who will stand up to the progressives, take on the liberal media and push back against the Republican leadership when they go wobbly. They are tired of politicians. They want leaders of genuine conviction and passion, willing to take a principled stand.

We saw an example of this quite recently. Sen. Rand Paul’s filibuster demonstrated that one person with the courage of his convictions can truly inspire the American people — including young people, women and minorities.

That’s good news for the conservative movement.

As we move ahead, we must remember that there is a distinction between the Republican Party and the conservative movement. National Republican leaders have not advanced a conservative agenda for almost 20 years.

Not since the first few years of the Republican revolution in the 1990s — when welfare reform and a balanced budget were passed — have congressional Republicans seriously championed conservative ideas. By the time I arrived in the House in 1998, my party was increasing spending and handing out earmarks like candy.

The spending binge continued. By 2006, Americans had seen enough, and Republicans lost the majority in both houses. This was not a rejection of conservative policies. It was a rejection of unprincipled governance.

In 2008, things got even worse as Republicans helped pass bailouts for big banks on Wall Street, and for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Barack Obama was elected, and Republicans lost even more seats in Congress.

It wasn’t long before the far-left policies of Mr. Obama and a rudderless GOP finally woke Americans from their apathy. Conservatives, libertarians, independents and even recovering liberals came together in groups called Tea Parties all across the country. They had a unified, simple message: “Stop the spending, borrowing, bailouts and government takeovers — and restore constitutional, limited government.”

The majority of Americans agreed with these ideas. This was the opportunity for Republicans to embrace the movement and build that big tent our leaders have been talking about for years. Instead, the national Republican leadership rejected the Tea Party and joined the liberal media in vilifying it.

Many Republican candidates, though, did embrace the Tea Party ideas. In 2010, they helped the GOP retake the House and gain seats in the Senate.

Yet in 2012, with the presidency on the line, national Republican leadership rejected the lessons of 2010 and went back to the old way of campaigning — relying on big-budget, negative TV rather than painting a bold, positive vision of a better America.

There are important lessons to draw from that disappointing campaign. First: Conservatives need to take control of the message. Our ideas don’t need high-priced spinmeisters to massage and doll them up — just plain-spoken champions who have the courage of their convictions.

We don’t need the bells and whistles, because our ideas work. They’ve been proved in states such as Tennessee, where the income tax was eliminated and the economy boomed. We’ve seen states such as North Dakota open their energy resources to development and create tens of thousands of new, well-paying jobs. We’ve seen states such as Texas pass tort reforms that encouraged doctors to move in — improving health care and lowering costs for everyone.

We also know that liberal policies fail. Look at Greece and Cyprus. Look at California and Illinois. Look at Detroit. Controlled by liberals for more than 50 years, Detroit is now bankrupt. Its population has shrunk by more than half. Only 7 percent of eighth-graders read at grade level. Unemployment for Hispanics and blacks is near 40 percent.

Liberal policies destroy lives and bankrupt cities, states and nations. Conservative policies work for everyone.

Just ask Joe Kelley, a single father in Washington, about school choice. He calls the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program a “blessing” for his children. Trapped in the public school system, his son Rashawn was three years behind where he should have been by fifth grade. Worse, the school was so bad, he recalls, that “eight police officers patrolled it every day, yet kids were still scared of getting jumped.”

But an Opportunity Scholarship allowed Rashawn to switch to a private school. Within two years, he had caught up to grade level. Today, he is pursuing a college degree.

There are so many more Rashawns out there who need our help. Conservative policies can benefit all Americans. That’s why conservatives cannot rest until every American can reach the ladder of opportunity and climb as high as they can dream.

We must take our message of freedom and opportunity for all and connect with every neighborhood in America. We can and must make our ideas so winsome to the American people that they become irresistible to politicians, no matter what their party.

Obama even said he’d be willing to “drink Kentucky bourbon” with McConnell and try other things to improve his terrible relationship with congressional Republicans, including “letting [House Speaker] John Boehner beat me at golf again.”

It almost sounded like they were ready to work together — unless you actually listened closely to the words that they said.

Both Obama and McConnell mentioned trade and tax reform as two possible areas of agreement. Beyond that, Obama made it clear that the next move was up to McConnell and John Boehner. “What I’d like to do is hear from the Republicans to find out what they’d like to see happen,” Obama said at the White House, as if he hadn’t heard anything they had said for the last six years.

( AP Photo/Evan Vucci , File )
Presidential politics move fast . What we ’ re watching heading into a new week on the 2020 campaign :
President Donald Trump ’ s reelection is facing growing headwinds less than six months before Election Day .
Coronavirus has breached the White House walls . The U.S. unemployment rate is at a 90-year high . And the death toll in the U.S. has surged past 80,000 , far more than the Republican president ’ s projections . Meanwhile , medical experts are warning of a major second wave of infections as states begin to reopen portions of their economies with Trump ’ s blessing .
Democrat Joe Biden has political challenges of his own , but no incumbent president has faced anything like this in almost a century .
Just a few short months ago , Trump planned to campaign for reelection on the back of a robust economy . That ’ s a distant memory after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April , leading to an unemployment rate of 14.7 % , the highest since the Great Depression .
Economists suggest the genuine unemployment number is much higher . Trump is encouraging states to reopen their economies to help reverse the slide , even as health experts warn that reopening too soon could lead to a second wave that would wreak greater economic devastation .
High-profile Democrats have begun voicing public concerns over the direction of Biden ’ s presidential campaign as Trump enjoys major organizational advantages .
Trump has more money , a more sophisticated digital operation and a big staffing advantage . Last week , former Obama strategists David Axelrod and David Plouffe , in addition to Pete Buttigieg strategist Lis Smith , wrote separate op-eds offering their own suggestions for Biden ’ s political strategy .
At the same time , the Trump campaign is unleashing a $ 10 million anti-Biden advertising blitz . Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said the massive round of attack ads represents the first major shot for what he called a juggernaut “ Death Star ” campaign . Biden ’ s team is supremely confident in his ability to compete , yet Democrats are decidedly playing catch-up .
Will voters hold Trump accountable for the rising death toll ?
Trump and his allies have repeatedly declared success in the fight against the coronavirus , even as the U.S. death toll blows past his own projections .
As recently as April 20 Trump predicted during his daily press briefing that between 50,000 and 60,000 Americans would ultimately die as a result of COVID-19 . The number of deaths has already exceeded 80,000 . Trump has been forced to adjust his projections on the fly . He told a Fox News audience over the weekend that the final tally could reach 100,000 deaths . It ’ s uncomfortable to think about the political ramifications of such horror , but the death toll represents one of the few pieces of quantitative evidence of Trump ’ s job performance .
Former President Barack Obama called Trump ’ s handling of the coronavirus an “ absolute chaotic disaster ” in a Friday conference call in which he encouraged his former team to embrace Biden ’ s presidential bid .
It was Obama ’ s latest step into the 2020 contest , albeit a modest one , having maintained regular private contact with Biden and other Democratic candidates in recent months .
Yet the former president ’ s 2020 political star , at least for now , may be overshadowed by former first lady Michelle Obama , who starred in a Netflix documentary released last week exploring her life and rise in politics .
Coinciding with the release , a new group emerged to encourage the former first lady to embrace a role as Biden ’ s running mate . Michelle Obama has sent strong signals that she has no interest in returning to the White House . But even if she stands firm , the Obamas are reminding the political world that they still hold tremendous political power .
Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee . But the process of making it official is anything but settled .
First , it ’ s far from clear whether host site Milwaukee will be open for even a scaled-down convention , said Melissa Baldauff , a spokeswoman for Democratic Gov . Tony Evers .
“ We are really just in a place where the disease sets the timeline , ” Baldauff said . “ Everyone would love to have the convention here in Milwaukee , even if it ’ s in a limited capacity . But from our perspective , it ’ s too soon to tell . ”
A month ago , the state Supreme Court overruled Evers ’ order to reschedule the primary election , despite a shortage of election workers in Milwaukee that forced officials to slash the city ’ s 180 polling places to just five .
At least 67 Wisconsin residents were diagnosed with COVID-19 after voting in person or working at the polls April 7 , though it wasn ’ t clear how many of the infections were direct results of the election , state officials said .
An important next step in the altered nominating process comes Tuesday , when the Democratic National Committee ’ s powerful Rules and Bylaws Committee meets — virtually , of course — to discuss granting waivers to states that missed deadlines by postponing their primaries due to the pandemic .
His campaign has massive organizational advantages , but they may not matter much if Trump can not effectively govern the nation when it matters most . The death toll , unemployment and public confidence in his administration is moving in the wrong direction . Congress has passed multiple economic rescue packages already , but the president has yet to offer or execute a clear , comprehensive nationwide plan to take control of the health crisis .

THE NARRATIVE

President Donald Trump’s reelection is facing growing headwinds less than six months before Election Day.

Coronavirus has breached the White House walls. The U.S. unemployment rate is at a 90-year high. And the death toll in the U.S. has surged past 80,000, far more than the Republican president’s projections. Meanwhile, medical experts are warning of a major second wave of infections as states begin to reopen portions of their economies with Trump’s blessing.

Democrat Joe Biden has political challenges of his own, but no incumbent president has faced anything like this in almost a century.

THE BIG QUESTIONS

Has the U.S. economy hit bottom?

Just a few short months ago, Trump planned to campaign for reelection on the back of a robust economy. That’s a distant memory after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April, leading to an unemployment rate of 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression.

Economists suggest the genuine unemployment number is much higher. Trump is encouraging states to reopen their economies to help reverse the slide, even as health experts warn that reopening too soon could lead to a second wave that would wreak greater economic devastation.

The president needs things to start turning around quickly.

Can Biden’s campaign compete with the Death Star?

High-profile Democrats have begun voicing public concerns over the direction of Biden’s presidential campaign as Trump enjoys major organizational advantages.

Trump has more money, a more sophisticated digital operation and a big staffing advantage. Last week, former Obama strategists David Axelrod and David Plouffe, in addition to Pete Buttigieg strategist Lis Smith, wrote separate op-eds offering their own suggestions for Biden’s political strategy.

At the same time, the Trump campaign is unleashing a $10 million anti-Biden advertising blitz. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said the massive round of attack ads represents the first major shot for what he called a juggernaut “Death Star” campaign. Biden’s team is supremely confident in his ability to compete, yet Democrats are decidedly playing catch-up.

Will voters hold Trump accountable for the rising death toll?

Trump and his allies have repeatedly declared success in the fight against the coronavirus, even as the U.S. death toll blows past his own projections.

As recently as April 20 Trump predicted during his daily press briefing that between 50,000 and 60,000 Americans would ultimately die as a result of COVID-19. The number of deaths has already exceeded 80,000. Trump has been forced to adjust his projections on the fly. He told a Fox News audience over the weekend that the final tally could reach 100,000 deaths. It’s uncomfortable to think about the political ramifications of such horror, but the death toll represents one of the few pieces of quantitative evidence of Trump’s job performance.

Are the Obamas back?

Former President Barack Obama called Trump’s handling of the coronavirus an “absolute chaotic disaster” in a Friday conference call in which he encouraged his former team to embrace Biden’s presidential bid.

It was Obama’s latest step into the 2020 contest, albeit a modest one, having maintained regular private contact with Biden and other Democratic candidates in recent months.

Yet the former president’s 2020 political star, at least for now, may be overshadowed by former first lady Michelle Obama, who starred in a Netflix documentary released last week exploring her life and rise in politics.

Coinciding with the release, a new group emerged to encourage the former first lady to embrace a role as Biden’s running mate. Michelle Obama has sent strong signals that she has no interest in returning to the White House. But even if she stands firm, the Obamas are reminding the political world that they still hold tremendous political power.

How do Democrats recalibrate their convention?

Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee. But the process of making it official is anything but settled.

First, it’s far from clear whether host site Milwaukee will be open for even a scaled-down convention, said Melissa Baldauff, a spokeswoman for Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.

“We are really just in a place where the disease sets the timeline,” Baldauff said. “Everyone would love to have the convention here in Milwaukee, even if it’s in a limited capacity. But from our perspective, it’s too soon to tell.”

A month ago, the state Supreme Court overruled Evers’ order to reschedule the primary election, despite a shortage of election workers in Milwaukee that forced officials to slash the city’s 180 polling places to just five.

At least 67 Wisconsin residents were diagnosed with COVID-19 after voting in person or working at the polls April 7, though it wasn’t clear how many of the infections were direct results of the election, state officials said.

An important next step in the altered nominating process comes Tuesday, when the Democratic National Committee’s powerful Rules and Bylaws Committee meets — virtually, of course — to discuss granting waivers to states that missed deadlines by postponing their primaries due to the pandemic.

THE FINAL THOUGHT

His campaign has massive organizational advantages, but they may not matter much if Trump cannot effectively govern the nation when it matters most. The death toll, unemployment and public confidence in his administration is moving in the wrong direction. Congress has passed multiple economic rescue packages already, but the president has yet to offer or execute a clear, comprehensive nationwide plan to take control of the health crisis.

Republicans out-performed their poll numbers in race after race Tuesday, raising questions about pro-Democratic bias in this year's election's polls — a major turnaround from the pro-GOP bias in 2012's polls.

The series of misses caused at least one political forecaster — Larry Sabato of the widely read Center for Politics' Crystal Ball — to call for changes to the industry Wednesday.

Sabato said on Fox News that he wanted an investigation of polls in Virginia that showed a double-digit lead for Democratic Sen. Mark Warner — who wound up winning re-election by less than a point.

""Boy, is that an industry that needs some housecleaning,"" Sabato said.

In all eight of this year's marquee Senate races, Republican candidates beat the polling averages compiled by Real Clear Politics, and in two of the races — North Carolina and Kansas — Republicans pulled off upset victories. Results were similar for governor races, including Republican wins in three states — Florida, Illinois and Maryland — where polls generally showed Democrats in the lead.

Nate Silver, whose FiveThirtyEight website pioneered the averaging of polls to help produce predictions in major races, reported that the average Senate poll in the past three weeks overestimated the Democratic performance by 4 points. That's a major turnaround from two years ago, when Senate polls in the final weeks of the campaign overestimated Republican performance by 3.4 points.

FiveThirtyEight missed on two Senate predictions. North Carolina's incumbent Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan was given a 69% chance of winning. She lost by 1.7 points. Greg Orman, an independent candidate for the Kansas Senate, was given a 53% chance of victory. He lost by 10.7 points.

The wave of Republican victories caught many Democrats — who were hoping the polls this year were once again undercounting Democrats — by surprise. Several poll analysts this year had speculated that the factors causing 2012 polls to underestimate Democrats' performances would re-occur — specifically citing the possibility that not enough Hispanics were included in Colorado polling and that whites were overrepresented in polls across the South.

Both problems of underestimating Republican performance in 2014 and overestimating it in 2012 can be traced to the difficulties pollsters have in trying to identify who will vote, according to Evans Witt, CEO of Princeton Survey Research.

Pollsters use a variety of techniques to build a ""likely voter"" model that excludes those seen as unlikely to cast a ballot. A major component of the models has traditionally been the past voting behavior of the respondents, along with interest in the upcoming election. But Ann Selzer, whose polling firm has won plaudits in recent elections for its accuracy, points to the fabled get-out-the-vote organization of Barack Obama in 2012 as changing the dynamics of who votes.

""The Obama campaign proved that if they can find you, they can get you to the polls,"" she said.

Witt cautions, however, that pollsters might have been ""seduced by the story of the Obama campaign getting uninterested voters to vote."" Pollsters took 2012 into account in creating their models of likely voters for this campaign, he said, because ""you want to look at the last few elections, and say, 'Does my likely-voter model agree with that?' ""

Pollsters who altered their models to give less credence to interest in the election or past voting behavior may have given Democrats too much credit for being able to turn out the vote in a midterm election, Witt said.

It ’ s not a phrase that Republicans and conservatives want to hear , but it ’ s one that , in this case , suits them all too well : argument from ignorance .
Example : “ Although we have proven that the moon is not made of spare ribs , we have not proven that its core can not be filled with them ; therefore , the moon ’ s core is filled with spare ribs . ”
This is precisely the “ logic ” behind the assertion , thundered Monday night by Rudy Giuliani among others ( and hey , I want some of what he was on ! ) , that Hillary Clinton lied to the faces of the Benghazi families . This is a line that took on a life of its own shortly after the tragedy happened on Sept. 11 , 2012 . It has been repeated ever since and it will continue to be repeated until the end of time precisely for the above reason : It can ’ t be disproven , so , knowing that evil Hillary , it must be true .
The GOP version is this : On Sept. 14 , 2012 , at Joint Base Andrews outside of Washington , Clinton and President Obama met with family members of the four men killed in the Benghazi attack . Clinton is said to have lied in this meeting because she blamed the infamous video Innocence of Muslims for the attack . It was later demonstrated that the video had little to do with the attack , although debate over what role , if any , it played continues to this day .
Of course , the fact-checkers have looked into it , and they ’ ve found no evidence to support the claim that Clinton lied . Politifact recounted the whole “ controversy ” in great detail , and found that some family members say Clinton mentioned the video , while others ( Clinton included ) don ’ t remember it that way . But Politifact emphasizes that even if she did blame the video for the deaths , calling that a deliberate lie is unsupported by any chain of facts . A clearer picture came into focus the following day , Sept. 15 .
The Washington Post ’ s Glenn Kessler looked into it too , after Marco Rubio called Clinton a liar in a debate last fall . Kessler gave Rubio only two Pinocchios out of four because of the conflicting accounts of what was said in the meeting and the confusion at the time in intelligence circles about what was behind the attack , but Kessler concluded that Rubio “ does not have enough evidence to label Clinton a liar . ”
Obviously , the Kool-Aid caucus has a ready answer for this , which is that Politifact and The Washington Post are both in on the pro-Clinton conspiracy . Because that conspiracy ’ s tentacles reach everywhere , you see . Paul Manafort even said on CNN this morning that Hillary is behind the Melania plagiarism thing .

It’s not a phrase that Republicans and conservatives want to hear, but it’s one that, in this case, suits them all too well: argument from ignorance.

Example: “Although we have proven that the moon is not made of spare ribs, we have not proven that its core cannot be filled with them; therefore, the moon’s core is filled with spare ribs.”

This is precisely the “logic” behind the assertion, thundered Monday night by Rudy Giuliani among others (and hey, I want some of what he was on!), that Hillary Clinton lied to the faces of the Benghazi families. This is a line that took on a life of its own shortly after the tragedy happened on Sept. 11, 2012. It has been repeated ever since and it will continue to be repeated until the end of time precisely for the above reason: It can’t be disproven, so, knowing that evil Hillary, it must be true.

The GOP version is this: On Sept. 14, 2012, at Joint Base Andrews outside of Washington, Clinton and President Obama met with family members of the four men killed in the Benghazi attack. Clinton is said to have lied in this meeting because she blamed the infamous video Innocence of Muslims for the attack. It was later demonstrated that the video had little to do with the attack, although debate over what role, if any, it played continues to this day.

Of course, the fact-checkers have looked into it, and they’ve found no evidence to support the claim that Clinton lied. Politifact recounted the whole “controversy” in great detail, and found that some family members say Clinton mentioned the video, while others (Clinton included) don’t remember it that way. But Politifact emphasizes that even if she did blame the video for the deaths, calling that a deliberate lie is unsupported by any chain of facts. A clearer picture came into focus the following day, Sept. 15.

The Washington Post’s Glenn Kessler looked into it too, after Marco Rubio called Clinton a liar in a debate last fall. Kessler gave Rubio only two Pinocchios out of four because of the conflicting accounts of what was said in the meeting and the confusion at the time in intelligence circles about what was behind the attack, but Kessler concluded that Rubio “does not have enough evidence to label Clinton a liar.”

Obviously, the Kool-Aid caucus has a ready answer for this, which is that Politifact and The Washington Post are both in on the pro-Clinton conspiracy. Because that conspiracy’s tentacles reach everywhere, you see. Paul Manafort even said on CNN this morning that Hillary is behind the Melania plagiarism thing. Next thing, Clinton will be revealed to have been behind the Turkish coup. Incredibly, a Google search for “Clinton behind coup in Turkey” didn’t turn up much, though Fetullah Gulen’s expressed admiration for Clinton has been noted with suspicion in some quarters.

I won’t go into detail rebutting the Rubio-Giuliani argument. Follow the links above if you want that. This column is about argument from ignorance. It’s the basis of about 80 or 85 percent of the Clinton “scandals” you’ve read about over the years. Not 100 percent. Hillary brought the email thing on herself. But surely 80 or 85.

Take an ambiguous set of facts. Add in some innuendo. Arrange the facts in the most suspicious-seeming way. Then level an allegation that cannot be disproven. Then try to convert the allegation into “fact” by constant repetition. Then get either a highly partisan special prosecutor (Ken Starr) or a hyper-politicized congressional committee—or in fact several of them!—to spend many millions of taxpayer dollars and wreck any number of salaried staffers’ lives to try to emboss some seal of officialdom on the created “fact.”

It’s all argument from ignorance. It is separate and distinct from the usual political b.s. that both parties do and that all political parties have done since the beginning of political parties. This includes exaggeration, embellishment, obfuscation, and unfair distortion of an opponents’ words and record. Everybody does that all the time. And sometimes people tell outright lies.

But trying to convert an allegation that can’t be disproven into fact isn’t something everyone does. It’s a specialty of the right in this country, from Joe McCarthy to Trey Gowdy. And we’re going to hear more of it tonight, as Chris Christie bumbles his way to the podium. Fortunately, it seems that most Americans aren’t buying the idea that a secretary of state, even that one, would sit there and lie right to the faces of grieving family members.

Nevada's Changing Character

Washoe County is probably the best example in Nevada of a place where those two worlds meet. With nearly a half-million residents, it's the second-most populated county in the state. In its southern end are Reno and Sparks, the only two incorporated towns in the county. Further north it's rural.

Washington (CNN) - After weaknesses in its ground game were badly exposed in 2012, the Republican National Committee is taking a page straight out of the Democratic playbook and launching an ambitious “50 state strategy” that will steer party resources and staffers to every corner of the country as it works to repair its voter contact effort before the next presidential election.

The party’s short-term vision with the project is to help the GOP win key races this November and in next year’s midterm elections.



But that’s only part of a larger and more important goal for Republicans: rebuilding a broken and outdated get-out-the-vote operation that seemed dominant during the George W.

Led by the re-election campaign of President Barack Obama and aided by independent liberal groups and labor outfits, Republican organizers were badly out-hustled by their Democratic counterparts in the race to get their supporters to the polls, in early voting and on Election Day.

Pollak,"California governor Jerry Brown is riding so high in the polls that there is virtually no political force that can stop him . In retrospect , his success was almost guaranteed once he convinced California voters to approve a “ temporary ” tax hike in 2012 ’ s Proposition 30 ( one that Democrats now want to make permanent ) . That , plus a modest economic recovery , increased revenues enough to allow him to concoct a widely-hailed surplus .
Republicans considered the 2014 elections a chance to rebuild and rebrand the party–to make the most of a losing scenario by angling the party for long-term growth . Wealthy donors poured money into the gubernatorial primary , for example , boosting millennial-friendly Treasury official Neel Kashkari past firebrand Assemblyman Tim Donnelly . Yet as Nov. 4 nears , the state GOP is adrift , politically and ideologically , more broken than ever .
Kashkari turned in a solid debate performance last month but has since wasted that momentum . His latest gambit , an ad portraying a drowning child , bespeaks a an inability to look past Election Day to the party ’ s future ( or his own ) . Meanwhile , other statewide Republican candidates who led early in the polls are fading rapidly as Election Day approaches , and as voter identification with the party continues to drop dramatically .
Fresno mayor Ashley Swearengin , who seemed to have a decent chance at the office of Controller , has found herself at odds with voters over high-speed rail ( she supports it , they don ’ t ) and with her party over Kashkari , who made himself unwelcome by highlighting the economic woes of her town .
Pete Peterson , running for Secretary of State , is perhaps the most likable ( and highly qualified ) of the party ’ s new figures , but has struggled to raise money .
In addition , the GOP has neglected statewide races to focus on preventing Democrats from regaining the supermajority in the State Senate that they enjoyed until a string of recent corruption scandals put them back below the two-thirds mark .
Yet while that supermajority is critical to holding Brown and the Democrats in check , it is not something most California voters know or care about . The GOP is simply not speaking to them .
Worse , too many in the Republican Party establishment–particularly voices on high in Washington–believe the road back to political relevance lies through liberal policies . They urge California conservatives to relax their opposition to illegal immigration , to soften their approach to affirmative action , to reject social conservatism .
All of that is a way of saying that Republican voters are the problem , because those are issues they care about .
Many efforts have been invested over the years in more serious attempts to devise alternative policies for the GOP . These include : school choice ; fossil fuels ; labor reform ; new dams ; and a flat tax .
The challenge , however , is unifying the party around a common agenda–and weaning elected Republicans from the temptations big-spending Democrats offer .
For example , while Kashkari opposes Brown ’ s high-speed rail plan , Swearingen backs the “ crazy train ” as a boost to Fresno .
California Republicans failed to resolve such conflicts in 2014 . They focused on isolated legislative races and ignored the state level . The donors that unified against Donnelly showed little interest in rallying around a rising star like Peterson . Instead , they are often reduced to persuading Republicans to vote for the least offensive Democrats .
The question now is not just whether the California GOP can rebuild , but whether it can survive .","California governor Jerry Brown is riding so high in the polls that there is virtually no political force that can stop him. In retrospect, his success was almost guaranteed once he convinced California voters to approve a “temporary” tax hike in 2012’s Proposition 30 (one that Democrats now want to make permanent).

Republicans considered the 2014 elections a chance to rebuild and rebrand the party–to make the most of a losing scenario by angling the party for long-term growth. Wealthy donors poured money into the gubernatorial primary, for example, boosting millennial-friendly Treasury official Neel Kashkari past firebrand Assemblyman Tim Donnelly. Yet as Nov. 4 nears, the state GOP is adrift, politically and ideologically, more broken than ever.

Kashkari turned in a solid debate performance last month but has since wasted that momentum. His latest gambit, an ad portraying a drowning child, bespeaks a an inability to look past Election Day to the party’s future (or his own). Meanwhile, other statewide Republican candidates who led early in the polls are fading rapidly as Election Day approaches, and as voter identification with the party continues to drop dramatically.

Fresno mayor Ashley Swearengin, who seemed to have a decent chance at the office of Controller, has found herself at odds with voters over high-speed rail (she supports it, they don’t) and with her party over Kashkari, who made himself unwelcome by highlighting the economic woes of her town.

Pete Peterson, running for Secretary of State, is perhaps the most likable (and highly qualified) of the party’s new figures, but has struggled to raise money.

In addition, the GOP has neglected statewide races to focus on preventing Democrats from regaining the supermajority in the State Senate that they enjoyed until a string of recent corruption scandals put them back below the two-thirds mark.

Yet while that supermajority is critical to holding Brown and the Democrats in check, it is not something most California voters know or care about. The GOP is simply not speaking to them.

Worse, too many in the Republican Party establishment–particularly voices on high in Washington–believe the road back to political relevance lies through liberal policies. They urge California conservatives to relax their opposition to illegal immigration, to soften their approach to affirmative action, to reject social conservatism.

All of that is a way of saying that Republican voters are the problem, because those are issues they care about.

Many efforts have been invested over the years in more serious attempts to devise alternative policies for the GOP. These include: school choice; fossil fuels; labor reform; new dams; and a flat tax.

The challenge, however, is unifying the party around a common agenda–and weaning elected Republicans from the temptations big-spending Democrats offer.

For example, while Kashkari opposes Brown’s high-speed rail plan, Swearingen backs the “crazy train” as a boost to Fresno.

California Republicans failed to resolve such conflicts in 2014. They focused on isolated legislative races and ignored the state level. The donors that unified against Donnelly showed little interest in rallying around a rising star like Peterson. Instead, they are often reduced to persuading Republicans to vote for the least offensive Democrats.

The question now is not just whether the California GOP can rebuild, but whether it can survive.",www.breitbart.com,right,wlPxRGkTDTibY6Fq

As the Trump campaign struggles to regain its footing after a massive loss of support from prominent Republicans , the candidate ’ s spinner-in-chief Kellyanne Conway sat down with the CNN host on The Situation Room Wednesday afternoon and for nearly 30 minutes attempted to deny everything we know to be true about her boss .
On Monday , Conway was trying to explain away Trump ’ s debate threats about sending Hillary Clinton to “ jail ” if he becomes president by saying it was nothing more than a “ quip ” ( a defense echoed by Mike Pence earlier today ) . But then , at a rally in Florida on Wednesday , Trump repeated his sentiments even more forcefully . “ She has to go to jail ! ” he declared to cheers from his supporters .
Confronted by Keilar about those remarks on CNN , Conway again repeated her “ quip ” line before quickly pivoting to an attack on Clinton for “ imperiling our national security. ” As Keilar continued to press Conway to explain why Trump insists on talking about “ jailing your political opponent , ” the campaign manager stopped her .
“ You 're taking it literally , ” Conway said . “ You 're stuck on this one thing . ”
“ I 'm talking about what your candidate is saying , which is more important than what you are saying about this , ” Keilar said . “ He is saying she has to go to jail . He is not talking about she has to stand and be judged . He is saying she has to go to jail . ”
Conway attempted to use her rhetorical gymnastics to escape the question , listing off some of things Clinton has said about Trump , but Keilar kept hammering her . “ He is saying , if he were president , she would be in jail , ” the host said .
Later in the interview , Keilar also did not let Conway get away with denying that Trump has been “ attacking ” House Speaker Paul Ryan after the Republican leader said he would no longer defend the candidate . “ Come on , Kellyanne , he tweeted repeatedly . He called him weak and ineffective . So I mean , you want to give him credit for not attacking him at one rally ? ” she asked . “ Is he done attacking the House Speaker then ? ”
As the interview progressed , Conway resorted to attacking CNN for ignoring the “ substance ” of Trump ’ s campaign . “ You 're doing a disservice to the American people by not telling them exactly everything , fully and fairly , of what one of the presidential candidates actually the only one who goes out and talks to voters on a daily basis about issues , ” she said .
Miraculously , despite the tension and animosity between the two women , Conway stuck around during a commercial break , something she may have regretted when Keilar opened the next segment with accusations from a former Miss Arizona who accused Trump of walking in on her changing backstage before one of his pageants , something Trump himself bragged about doing on The Howard Stern Show .
“ I ca n't comment on what she is saying because I am not her and I was n't in the pageant or any other pageant , ” Conway said . Like , Trump , she tried to shift the conversation to Bill Clinton .
“ The fact is that all you want to do , it seems , is talk about something he said ten , 15 years ago and , yet , we never ever want to talk , particularly CNN , where we offered up these women to you , '' Conway said , referring to the pre-debate press conference Trump held , flanked by women who had accused the former president of sexual assault and harassment . `` We never want to talk to the women shamed and blamed by Hillary Clinton because they had sexual contact with her husband . ”
“ Maybe you want to ask me who it is I see day by day , this intelligent , clever , gracious , gentleman , frankly , whose family is making a huge sacrifice to run for president , ” Conway said , entering full-on rant mode . “ Nobody wants to talk about that . You want me to comment on something he said to Howard Stern in 15 second ten years ago and somehow I am an expert on it .

He brings these things up himself , ” she said . “ You 're saying this should be discussed . Why does n't he make a pivot ?

Story Continued Below

It’s just that there are inherent limits to any such exercise. The party is not going to be saved by committee. The autopsy inevitably reflects the lowest common denominator of establishment Republican thinking on policy, recommending comprehensive immigration reform and hinting at surrender on gay marriage.

It is more interesting and useful when suggesting process changes that are the RNC’s core competency, especially fewer primary debates.

There were more than 20 of them last time. Can’t every Republican agree that two debates moderated by Diane Sawyer are two debates too many? By all means, the party should have enough debates so dark horses can emerge and the flashes-in-the-pan can be exposed. Any candidate who needs more than 20 of them, though, has a problem. It wasn’t, for instance, that Newt Gingrich relied on the debates to catch fire. His entire campaign was the debates.

The RNC autopsy has stirred up another round in an intraparty debate that is yeasty and entertaining and will surely prove largely irrelevant to the Republican future.

One facet of that ongoing debate is the fight between the grass roots and establishment over Senate primaries, which has been raging for months and got more fuel when speakers at CPAC savaged the Republican consultant class. Rarely has so much heat been generated with so little light.

Some of the same grass-roots conservative leaders banging on the consultants believed, or (in some cases, I suspect) pretended to believe, that Christine O’Donnell would sweep to victory in the Delaware Senate race in 2010. Every time they are about to congratulate themselves on their electoral acuity, they should have to listen to three hours of Chris Coons floor speeches on their iPods.

On the other hand, the establishment was eager to deliver a Florida Senate seat to Charlie Crist, who is as real as a spray-on tan and as appealing as a cheesy billboard for legal services (which he appeared on after Marco Rubio unceremoniously dispatched him back to legal practice).",www.politico.com,left,KwDGHOJ5dWxq8c2e

It’s time to reclaim guns from the right.,2019-07-01,"Kim Kelly, Shirin Ghaffary, Peter Kafka, Rebecca Heilweil, Aja Romano, Allegra Frank, Jen Kirby","Right-wingers have held an unearned monopoly on gun culture for too long . Whether it ’ s in the halls of legislative power or in the comments under “ gun bunny ” photos on Instagram , there is a prevailing narrative that pegs guns and armed self-defense exclusively to Republicans , racist libertarians , and other generally Constitution-obsessed weirdos . It maintains that those on the left want to take away everyone ’ s guns and swathe the entire country in bubble wrap . But I ’ m an anarchist , and I call bullshit .
I ’ m of the firm opinion that it ’ s time to not only arm the left but challenge the narrative that all leftists are anti-gun . Many are , and that ’ s a position I can understand and respect . But there is also a long history of armed community self-defense among the radical left that is often glossed over or forgotten entirely in favor of the Fox News-friendly narrative that all liberals hate guns . That ’ s simply not the case — though as history has proven , the only thing that scares the reactionary right more than the idea of losing their guns is the thought of us having them .
I grew up with guns , and my familiarity with them is a big part of why l view things the way I do . My family hunts for sustenance , and gun safety was taught to me before I was tall enough to see over my dad ’ s workbench . I can understand why people who weren ’ t raised around them would view firearms with fear and loathing , but for me , a gun in the hands of someone I trust is a comforting sight , because I know the power it holds .
When I was in Charlottesville , Virginia , protesting the Unite the Right rally in 2017 , the only time I truly felt safe was when members of Redneck Revolt — a working-class , anti-fascist , anti-racist armed community defense group — showed up open-carrying and secured the park where a number of us were gathered . The police may have stood by and done nothing as a neo-Nazi murdered one of us , but Redneck Revolt was there to offer protection — and the fascists steered clear of that park because of it .
In Stone Mountain , Georgia , when a group of us marched through the streets to celebrate the cancellation of a Klan rally on February 2 , we were accompanied by local activists with rifles and ARs slung over their shoulders ; the police kept their distance , which was an extraordinary sight for someone used to New York City ’ s ultra-aggressive , hyper-militarized NYPD . As the black militant liberation group the Black Panthers showed back in the 1960s , as the Zapatistas showed in the ’ 90s , and as anarchists in New Orleans showed during the aftermath of Katrina , when cops and other fascists see that they ’ re not the only ones packing , the balance of power shifts , and they tend to reconsider their tactics .
To be honest , the thought of a world in which the state and their running dogs are the only entities with access to firearms sends a shudder down my spine .
Not everyone should have access to guns — domestic abusers , for example , have proven by their actions that they can not be trusted with that kind of responsibility — and not everyone needs it . No one without a significant amount of training should be handling a firearm at all , which is why I think designated community patrols made up of well-trained , highly trusted individuals who are chosen by and held accountable to said community ( and who do not hold any or less power than anyone else due to their position ) is a far better and more equitable defense model than messy “ everyone gets a gun ! ” rhetoric .
I ’ m also not interested in creating a parallel cultural universe wherein balaclava-clad “ gun bunnies ” pose for the ’ gram ( I ’ d much rather shore up support for Rojava ’ s all-women YPG Women ’ s Defense Unit ) . I ’ m interested in reclaiming the notion of armed self-defense from those who have long used it as a cudgel to repress dissent and terrorize marginalized communities , and emphasizing its potential as a transformative tool toward collective liberation .
There is a long history of leftist gun ownership , and a concurrent theme of state repression against it . As author and anarchist scott crow notes , “ our current gun control laws disproportionately hobble poor communities and communities of color. ” As far as the state is concerned , black people were never meant to own guns at all ; the Second Amendment was intended in part as a means of controlling the enslaved black population and suppressing possible uprisings .
That sentiment has proven to have quite a bit of staying power . In 1967 , the Black Panthers staged an armed demonstration on the steps of the California state courthouse and launched an occupation in protest of the Mulford Act , which banned open carry in the state . Said law was written by a Republican Assembly member in response to the Panthers ’ cop-watching “ police patrols ” ; shortly after the protest , state legislators rushed to enact tougher gun control laws , with the full support of Republican President Ronald Reagan and the National Rifle Association .
In a stark contrast to its current bloodthirsty propagandizing , the NRA was once a firm proponent of gun control , and was a key component of the passage of 1934 ’ s National Firearms Act , which imposed restrictions on machine guns . That began to change in the 1960s ; the NRA continued to support gun control , but its members — who had begun buying guns more for protection than for hunting — started to protest . The shift crystallized in 1977 with the ascent of Harlon Carter , a former immigration agent who ’ d killed a Mexican teenager in his youth and went on to shape what still fraudulently insists on referring to itself as “ the oldest civil rights organization in the country ” in his racist image .
Now the NRA ’ s insistence that it fights for the civil rights of legal gun owners rings hollow . Lest we forget , Philando Castile — a legal gun owner — was still killed by cops , inches from his partner and child . He ’ d informed them that he was carrying , and it proved to be a death sentence .
With that , as well as the endless extrajudicial killings of black people by cops in this country in mind , some may wonder how anyone can responsibly suggest that more guns are the answer . I defer to the work of groups like the Huey P. Newton Gun Club , the now-defunct Black Women ’ s Defense League ( who approached the issue through a black feminist lens ) , and Denver ’ s Brothas Against Racist Cops ( BARC ) , who frame gun ownership as a civil rights issue and emphasize the need to protect their communities from those who wish them harm . As BWDL organizer Niecee X told Vice in 2017 , “ At the end of the day , we have a common goal , and that common goal is ultimately liberation , but at the very least the well-being and safety of our sisters . ”
Marginalized communities know best how to keep themselves safe ; depending on law enforcement to protect them from racist and fascist attacks is a losing strategy ( especially considering how often that particular call is coming from inside the house ) . “ The problem is guns , bullets come from guns , ” BARC founder Eric Randall told the Guardian in 2016 . “ But the main problem is who is holding the damn gun . No one had a problem with people killing us until we started arming ourselves . ”
I don ’ t have all the answers , but the bare fact of the matter here is that violent right-wing extremism is a continuing threat that has been allowed to spread unabated in this country — a country that is itself rooted in the oppression of people of color . The police will not protect us ; neither will the military , or well-meaning liberals , or your favorite oh-so-progressive politicians . It is not in their interest to do so , and recognizing that is imperative to the survival of those who reject this vile status quo .
The way that leftists engage with the subject of firearms , conflict , and power within our own communities needs to shift toward a place where guns are considered just another tool in our struggle for collective liberation , not the sole focus . Until we live in a world with no police , no military , and no state , we ’ re at the mercy of all three — and I , at least , don ’ t think it ’ s fair to expect us to confront them empty-handed .

Leftist gun ownership is about protecting marginalized communities

Not everyone should have access to guns — domestic abusers, for example, have proven by their actions that they cannot be trusted with that kind of responsibility — and not everyone needs it. No one without a significant amount of training should be handling a firearm at all, which is why I think designated community patrols made up of well-trained, highly trusted individuals who are chosen by and held accountable to said community (and who do not hold any or less power than anyone else due to their position) is a far better and more equitable defense model than messy “everyone gets a gun!” rhetoric.

In a stark contrast to its current bloodthirsty propagandizing, the NRA was once a firm proponent of gun control, and was a key component of the passage of 1934’s National Firearms Act, which imposed restrictions on machine guns. That began to change in the 1960s; the NRA continued to support gun control, but its members — who had begun buying guns more for protection than for hunting — started to protest. The shift crystallized in 1977 with the ascent of Harlon Carter, a former immigration agent who’d killed a Mexican teenager in his youth and went on to shape what still fraudulently insists on referring to itself as “the oldest civil rights organization in the country” in his racist image.

Now the NRA’s insistence that it fights for the civil rights of legal gun owners rings hollow. Lest we forget, Philando Castile — a legal gun owner — was still killed by cops, inches from his partner and child. He’d informed them that he was carrying, and it proved to be a death sentence.

With that, as well as the endless extrajudicial killings of black people by cops in this country in mind, some may wonder how anyone can responsibly suggest that more guns are the answer. I defer to the work of groups like the Huey P. Newton Gun Club, the now-defunct Black Women’s Defense League (who approached the issue through a black feminist lens), and Denver’s Brothas Against Racist Cops (BARC), who frame gun ownership as a civil rights issue and emphasize the need to protect their communities from those who wish them harm. As BWDL organizer Niecee X told Vice in 2017, “At the end of the day, we have a common goal, and that common goal is ultimately liberation, but at the very least the well-being and safety of our sisters.”

We can’t depend on the police to protect us

Marginalized communities know best how to keep themselves safe; depending on law enforcement to protect them from racist and fascist attacks is a losing strategy (especially considering how often that particular call is coming from inside the house). “The problem is guns, bullets come from guns,” BARC founder Eric Randall told the Guardian in 2016. “But the main problem is who is holding the damn gun. No one had a problem with people killing us until we started arming ourselves.”

I don’t have all the answers, but the bare fact of the matter here is that violent right-wing extremism is a continuing threat that has been allowed to spread unabated in this country — a country that is itself rooted in the oppression of people of color. The police will not protect us; neither will the military, or well-meaning liberals, or your favorite oh-so-progressive politicians. It is not in their interest to do so, and recognizing that is imperative to the survival of those who reject this vile status quo.

The way that leftists engage with the subject of firearms, conflict, and power within our own communities needs to shift toward a place where guns are considered just another tool in our struggle for collective liberation, not the sole focus. Until we live in a world with no police, no military, and no state, we’re at the mercy of all three — and I, at least, don’t think it’s fair to expect us to confront them empty-handed.

For far too long , according to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus , his committee was nothing more than `` a U-Haul trailer of money for a presidential nominee '' who lacked a permanent , sustainable presence in crucial states .

Less than a year after the report was released and as Republicans nationally venture to Washington for the group 's winter confab , Priebus and other Republican leaders are looking back on 2013 and heralding the moves they made in implementing their plan .
`` A lot of it comes down to mechanics , '' Priebus said . `` Here is the point , if you are not in Hispanic communities on a year-round basis . If you do n't represent those congressional districts , if you do n't represent those Senate districts , who is there ? Who is there telling the story of the Republican Party , of opportunity and freedom . ''

There are fundamental areas that RNC re-tooling has focused on : improving a lackluster ground game , growing Republican standing in minority communities , investing in a data infrastructure and revamping the GOP primary system .
All of this , Priebus and others said , is in an effort to turn into a year-round organization with a sustainable presence in crucial states .
After President Barack Obama beat Republican nominee Mitt Romney on the way to winning reelection in 2012 , many in the party felt changes needed to be made .
As the GOP report touts on one of its first pages , it had `` lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections '' and Obama just won the Hispanic vote by a whopping 44 % , African Americans by over 80 % and Asians by 47 % .
In response to these losses , according to Jennifer Korn , the RNC 's deputy political director and the head of demographic specific outreach , the party has put minority engagement staff in sixteen states .
The RNC is especially proud of that - pointing out that 78 % of the RNC 's political staff is outside of Washington , D.C. , -- but not fully satisfied . If they had their way , the RNC would have this demographic specific staff in all 50 states .
And Korn believes this plan has already been a success , pointing to the fact that Gov . Chris Christie of New Jersey won 50 % of the Hispanic vote on the way to his reelection in 2013 .
Korn , who came to the RNC after running similar outreach programs in the George W. Bush White House , said the results were particularly stark in heavily Hispanic Passaic County , New Jersey , a county Christie turned red in 2013 .
`` This is a permanent , year round effort , '' Korn said . `` We will be in these communities to not only ask for their vote , but to build relationships and listen to their concerns . ''
But not all recommendations outlined in the report have been followed . On the top of that list : the report 's suggestion that Republicans should `` embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform . ''
`` If we do not , our party 's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only , '' wrote the five Republican authors of the report , which also stated that the RNC believes `` comprehensive immigration reform '' is `` consistent '' with Republican policies to `` promote job growth and opportunity for all . ''
After passing the Senate , immigration reform has stalled in the Republican controlled House . What 's more , Republican 's who supported the measure - like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio - have taken a beating with the party 's base for that support .
The other much talked about suggestion , that Republicans need to alter their tone when talking about certain issues , has proven hard to change .
`` It 's not just what we say ; it 's how we say it , '' Priebus said when the report was published .
But a number of high profile comments have undermined the GOP effort .
Examples : When Rep. Steve King of Iowa told Newsmax that Mexican immigrants have `` calves the size of cantaloupes because they 're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert '' or when Rep. Trent Frank of Arizona said `` the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low . ''
Priebus , who has called out some of the more outlandish comments , seems to just shrug this off with the fact that the RNC has only been at this for less than a year .
`` This idea that somehow the committee itself is taking on the entire world upon its shoulders and has to carpet the world '' is not realistic , Preibus told CNN on Wednesday , the first day of the meeting . `` In one year , is the world carpeted ? No . But we are making fundamental changes at a historic level that no one can deny . ''
Every time someone like King makes an eye-popping statement or when the RNC , like it is doing this week , considers a resolution that encourages candidates to be more vocal on the anti-abortion stance , Democrats have questioned the validity of the plan .
In an e-mail on Tuesday , Marcy Stech , spokeswoman for Emily 's List , a liberal woman 's group , said the RNC abortion proposal shows the party is `` misfiring on that rebrand '' and `` Republicans are yet again focusing on rhetoric over reason . ''
`` This is yet another example of the Republican Party being tone-deaf to American voters and trying to solve a policy problem with a fake , PR solution , '' Stech wrote . `` Maybe , in 2014 , they should be taking a stronger look at the policies that women and their families actually want , and not how much or how little to talk to them about the ones they do n't . ''
Priebus , quite expectedly , does n't see it that way . Instead of saying the resolution pushes Republicans to talk about their pro-life stances , the chairman said the idea is that `` the point of the resolution is do n't stand there like s sitting duck , like a fool , and get punched in the face '' when Democrats challenge Republican on abortion .
While tone and demographic outreach have been the most talked about aspects of the RNC changes , the committee has also tried to shore up other deficiencies that hurt them in 2012 .
Kirsten Kurkowski , the RNC 's spokeswoman , said the party has `` fundamentally reshaped our ground game structure to be community-based and bottom up , '' is `` closing the digital divide with a multi-million dollar investment in technology '' and has `` united behind the need for changes in the debate system . ''
The debate system as been an important , albeit quiet , focus of the RNC after the 2012 loss .
For much of 2013 , a handful of party officials pushed batch rules aimed at streamlining a chaotic presidential nominating process that many party insiders viewed as damaging to the their campaign for the White House in 2012 . Those rules are to be considered and voted on at this week 's RNC meeting .
`` I do n't think we need a six-month slice and dice festival on our party , '' Priebus said . `` I think we need some compression on both ends to shorten the time period of the primary . And like I said , look I ca n't always control people 's mouths but we can have some control over how long we have to kill each other. ``
As for more comments that strike a tone the RNC would rather not take , most GOP committee members in Washington for the winter meeting know they are inevitable .
`` We wrote a report and certainly we advocated people being smart about what they say , but we do n't have a magic wand , '' said RNC Committeeman Henry Barbour . `` I think that is where we have to keep fighting that fight . We have to keep educating our members , or governors , as well as our candidates , to think about what you say and how you say it . ''
His advice to members who have a penchant for strong statements : `` Speak in a way that unites people and is not shrill . Shrill does n't sell . ''","Story highlights After losses in 2012, RNC Chair Reince Priebus ordered a review of the GOP at the national level

In 2013, the RNC released a report titled the ""Growth & Opportunity Plan""

Nearly a year after the report's release, the GOP has increased minority outreach efforts

But it hasn't embraced immigration reform and is struggling with messaging directed at women voters

For far too long, according to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, his committee was nothing more than ""a U-Haul trailer of money for a presidential nominee"" who lacked a permanent, sustainable presence in crucial states.

""We had been a party that has shown up once every four years about five months before an election,"" Priebus told CNN, arguing that no matter how much money you have, that model won't work and hasn't worked in recent years.

So after the drubbing the party took at the ballot box in 2012 -- failing to win the White House and losing seats in the House -- Priebus ordered a much-talked about top-down review of the party in an effort to stop Republicans for taking big losses during presidential elections.

The report -- titled the ""Growth & Opportunity Plan"" -- was stark and blunt, challenging the Republican Party to make substantial changes to the way it interacted with voters.

Less than a year after the report was released and as Republicans nationally venture to Washington for the group's winter confab, Priebus and other Republican leaders are looking back on 2013 and heralding the moves they made in implementing their plan.

""A lot of it comes down to mechanics,"" Priebus said. ""Here is the point, if you are not in Hispanic communities on a year-round basis. If you don't represent those congressional districts, if you don't represent those Senate districts, who is there? Who is there telling the story of the Republican Party, of opportunity and freedom.""

JUST WATCHED GOP plans on using abortion in 2014 Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH GOP plans on using abortion in 2014 04:47

There are fundamental areas that RNC re-tooling has focused on: improving a lackluster ground game, growing Republican standing in minority communities, investing in a data infrastructure and revamping the GOP primary system.

All of this, Priebus and others said, is in an effort to turn into a year-round organization with a sustainable presence in crucial states.

After President Barack Obama beat Republican nominee Mitt Romney on the way to winning reelection in 2012, many in the party felt changes needed to be made.

As the GOP report touts on one of its first pages, it had ""lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections"" and Obama just won the Hispanic vote by a whopping 44%, African Americans by over 80% and Asians by 47%.

In response to these losses, according to Jennifer Korn, the RNC's deputy political director and the head of demographic specific outreach, the party has put minority engagement staff in sixteen states.

The RNC is especially proud of that - pointing out that 78% of the RNC's political staff is outside of Washington, D.C., -- but not fully satisfied. If they had their way, the RNC would have this demographic specific staff in all 50 states.

And Korn believes this plan has already been a success, pointing to the fact that Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey won 50% of the Hispanic vote on the way to his reelection in 2013.

Korn, who came to the RNC after running similar outreach programs in the George W. Bush White House, said the results were particularly stark in heavily Hispanic Passaic County, New Jersey, a county Christie turned red in 2013.

""This is a permanent, year round effort,"" Korn said. ""We will be in these communities to not only ask for their vote, but to build relationships and listen to their concerns.""

But not all recommendations outlined in the report have been followed. On the top of that list: the report's suggestion that Republicans should ""embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.""

""If we do not, our party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only,"" wrote the five Republican authors of the report, which also stated that the RNC believes ""comprehensive immigration reform"" is ""consistent"" with Republican policies to ""promote job growth and opportunity for all.""

After passing the Senate, immigration reform has stalled in the Republican controlled House. What's more, Republican's who supported the measure - like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio - have taken a beating with the party's base for that support.

The other much talked about suggestion, that Republicans need to alter their tone when talking about certain issues, has proven hard to change.

""It's not just what we say; it's how we say it,"" Priebus said when the report was published.

But a number of high profile comments have undermined the GOP effort.

Examples: When Rep. Steve King of Iowa told Newsmax that Mexican immigrants have ""calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert"" or when Rep. Trent Frank of Arizona said ""the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low.""

Priebus, who has called out some of the more outlandish comments, seems to just shrug this off with the fact that the RNC has only been at this for less than a year.

""This idea that somehow the committee itself is taking on the entire world upon its shoulders and has to carpet the world"" is not realistic, Preibus told CNN on Wednesday, the first day of the meeting. ""In one year, is the world carpeted? No. But we are making fundamental changes at a historic level that no one can deny.""

Democrats have watched this rebranding with amusement.

Every time someone like King makes an eye-popping statement or when the RNC, like it is doing this week, considers a resolution that encourages candidates to be more vocal on the anti-abortion stance , Democrats have questioned the validity of the plan.

In an e-mail on Tuesday, Marcy Stech, spokeswoman for Emily's List, a liberal woman's group, said the RNC abortion proposal shows the party is ""misfiring on that rebrand"" and ""Republicans are yet again focusing on rhetoric over reason.""

""This is yet another example of the Republican Party being tone-deaf to American voters and trying to solve a policy problem with a fake, PR solution,"" Stech wrote. ""Maybe, in 2014, they should be taking a stronger look at the policies that women and their families actually want, and not how much or how little to talk to them about the ones they don't.""

Priebus, quite expectedly, doesn't see it that way. Instead of saying the resolution pushes Republicans to talk about their pro-life stances, the chairman said the idea is that ""the point of the resolution is don't stand there like s sitting duck, like a fool, and get punched in the face"" when Democrats challenge Republican on abortion.

While tone and demographic outreach have been the most talked about aspects of the RNC changes, the committee has also tried to shore up other deficiencies that hurt them in 2012.

Kirsten Kurkowski, the RNC's spokeswoman, said the party has ""fundamentally reshaped our ground game structure to be community-based and bottom up,"" is ""closing the digital divide with a multi-million dollar investment in technology"" and has ""united behind the need for changes in the debate system.""

The debate system as been an important, albeit quiet, focus of the RNC after the 2012 loss.

For much of 2013, a handful of party officials pushed batch rules aimed at streamlining a chaotic presidential nominating process that many party insiders viewed as damaging to the their campaign for the White House in 2012. Those rules are to be considered and voted on at this week's RNC meeting.

""I don't think we need a six-month slice and dice festival on our party,"" Priebus said. ""I think we need some compression on both ends to shorten the time period of the primary. And like I said, look I can't always control people's mouths but we can have some control over how long we have to kill each other. ""

As for more comments that strike a tone the RNC would rather not take, most GOP committee members in Washington for the winter meeting know they are inevitable.

""We wrote a report and certainly we advocated people being smart about what they say, but we don't have a magic wand,"" said RNC Committeeman Henry Barbour. ""I think that is where we have to keep fighting that fight. We have to keep educating our members, or governors, as well as our candidates, to think about what you say and how you say it.""

His advice to members who have a penchant for strong statements: ""Speak in a way that unites people and is not shrill. Shrill doesn't sell.""",www.cnn.com,left,UhaD63i08uCW7xIv

Republicans face a gender gap in November’s midterms that Democrats are trying to widen with claims of a GOP “war on women.” So in recent days, several Republican candidates have countered by releasing ads on a topic generating headlines thanks to the Ray Rice scandal: domestic violence.

The spots, which often feature heart-wrenching testimonials of female victims, are among the most memorable of the cycle.

“My ex-husband beat me with a baseball bat, threw me in a garbage can filled with snow and left me in a frozen storage locker to die,” Teri Jendusa-Nicolai says to the camera in an ad on behalf of the Republican governor of Wisconsin. “At that time, I was pregnant, and I lost the child I was carrying.

Democrats also have discussed domestic violence — and violence against women more broadly — in several recent ads. But the subject is especially sensitive for the GOP. The party, eager to win the Senate this year, is trailing by double digits among women in some races amid Democrats’ focus on topics such as abortion and personhood legislation.

Republican candidates’ gender-related gaffes in 2012 cost the party key Senate races in Missouri and Indiana.

Operatives on the right say they mistakenly believed in the past that voters would never buy the suggestion that Republicans condone sexual assault or the unfair treatment of women in the workplace. But as the narrative that the GOP is anti-woman seemed to stick, officials at the National Republican Senatorial Committee promised this year would be different.

They’ve urged GOP candidates to be proactive in showing their support for women and quickly respond to claims otherwise.

“Democrats across the country — mostly men, by the way — have sunk to new lows, exploiting deeply personal issues and crimes, ranging from birth control to sexual assault, domestic violence to discrimination in the workforce for their own political gain,” NRSC spokeswoman Brook Hougesen said.

Democrats say the GOP is trying to muddle an issue on which there is a clear contrast between the parties.

They point in particular to resistance among some Republicans to reauthorize VAWA, which was renewed in 2013 with added protections for gays and Native Americans after lengthy haggling between the House and Senate. The act covers domestic violence and other forms of danger to women.

“The Ray Rice incident elevated domestic violence in the public debate again, and there’s no question that voters want strong laws to prevent abuse and help women, not partisanship,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokeswoman Emily Bittner said. “Pointing to Republicans’ 500-day ideological obstruction against the Violence Against Women Act is effective shorthand for the many, many ways that they’re far outside the mainstream.”

Top Republicans took to the airwaves and social media over the weekend to encourage Americans to go to bars and restaurants and socialize in what critics said was a dangerous break from advice from top public-health officials to avoid large crowds to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

On Saturday night, Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma tweeted a picture of himself and his family enjoying a night out at a crowded local restaurant with the caption: ""Eating with my kids and all my fellow Oklahomans at the @CollectiveOKC. It's packed tonight!""

He later deleted the message after a backlash to the tweet. On Sunday he declared a state of emergency in Oklahoma in response to the crisis.

The advice from the three prominent backers of the president came as top public-health officials issued new advice meant to stem the virus' spread, as the number of COVID-19 infections in the US rose past 3,000.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and top public-health officials are urging Americans to practice ""social distancing"" in the fight against the spread of the disease. On Sunday, the CDC issued new advice urging American to avoid social gatherings of 50 people or more, as states and cities across the US ordered restaurants and bars to do takeout only while closing schools.

""Events of any size should only be continued if they can be carried out with adherence to guidelines for protecting vulnerable populations, hand hygiene, and social distancing,"" the CDC said. ""When feasible, organizers could modify events to be virtual.""

Dr. Antony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, in an interview on CNN on Sunday said he was not ruling out a national closing of bars and restaurants in the fight against the disease and would ""like to see a dramatic diminution of the personal interaction that we see"" in those places.

""We need to be very serious about — for a while, life is not going to be the way it used to be in the United States,"" he said. ""We have to just accept that if we want to do what's best for the American public.""

In a sign of the partisan divide that is influencing even how Americans respond to the pandemic, a poll by NBC News Sunday found that while 61% of Democrats would avoid gatherings during the crisis, only 30% of Republicans would, and while 36% of Democrats would avoid restaurants, whis was a measure only 12% of Republicans were taking.

Critics have accused the Republicans of spreading irresponsible messages during the crisis.

Speaking on MSNBC Dr Leana Wen, a former health commissioner for Baltimore, said that Nunes' advice is ""exactly the opposite of what we should be doing right now.""

""Irresponsible, dangerous, stupid,"" tweeted Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell in response Nunes' claims.

There was also pushback to Stitt's tweet before he removed it.

Clarke's tweet also attracted widespread criticism.",www.businessinsider.com,center,r6YN2vSCVethxz7U

The phone call was open-and-shut collusion . Trump had asked a foreign government to investigate his opponent , and the request was recorded in a White House transcript . When the transcript was released on Sept. 25 , it put Republican senators in a bind . They had to choose between country and party , between abandoning Trump and defending collusion .

In a phone call, Trump reminded Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that his country, besieged and partially occupied by Russia, depended on U.S. military aid. “We do a lot for Ukraine,” said Trump.

Bill Bolling feels Ken Cuccinelli jumped line to run for state 's top office
Gov . Bob McDonnell has been embroiled in scandal over gifts to him and his family
Cuccinelli is backed by the tea party ; Bolling had support from establishment
The prospect of Virginia Gov . Bob McDonnell resigning as he copes with a federal investigation into the nearly $ 150,000 worth of lavish gifts the Republican and his family received from a wealthy executive is unlikely , people close to the governor insist .
Yet the topic remains a tantalizing conversation piece around Richmond these days , mainly because it would be an act without modern precedent .
While Virginia has had its fair share of tumultuous politics over the years , not since Reconstruction has the commonwealth been forced to grapple with a question of succession . No Virginia governor has resigned , or been impeached , in the last century .
But there 's another reason some Virginia political watchers are buzzing about the hypothetical : McDonnell 's resignation , however unlikely , would elevate his lieutenant governor , Republican Bill Bolling , to the state 's highest office .
And Bolling has made it abundantly clear he has little tolerance for the Republican running to succeed McDonnell -- Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli .
`` I have serious reservations about his ability to effectively and responsibly govern our state , '' Bolling said of Cuccinelli in a recent interview with CNN .
Here 's the backstory : Bolling has served as lieutenant governor since 2006 , and had long eyed this election year as his moment to make the leap to governor . Bolling had McDonnell 's endorsement , and campaign backing from other establishment leaders and members of Virginia 's influential business community .
JUST WATCHED McDonnell : GOP 'has work to do ' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH McDonnell : GOP 'has work to do ' 04:25
JUST WATCHED New strategy for the GOP Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH New strategy for the GOP 05:01
The ambitious Fairfax native , an uncompromising social conservative and tea party darling , also had designs on the governorship -- and he had no time for the succession plan orchestrated by Bolling , McDonnell and other GOP leaders . So last year , Cuccinelli 's allies in the Republican Party re-wired the GOP 's nominating process so that the 2013 gubernatorial nominee would be selected by convention instead of a primary .
Since conventions tend to attract only a small slice of the electorate -- the most committed and vocal conservatives who revel in spending their spring weekends at political conventions -- that left Bolling , who views the tea party movement with a mixture of scorn and exotic bewilderment , with little option but to drop out of the race .
An exasperated Bolling left the race , and Cuccinelli easily captured the GOP gubernatorial nomination in May with the support of roughly 8,000 delegates who showed up at the Richmond Coliseum to support him ( and two other conservatives , attorney general candidate Mark Obenshain and a bombastic pastor named E.W . Jackson , the party 's nominee for lieutenant governor ) .
Clearly incensed at Cuccinelli for dashing his gubernatorial hopes , Bolling soon embarked on a media tour lamenting the rightward drift of the Republican Party . He used his remaining campaign funds to launch an initiative called `` The Virginia Mainstream Project '' to recruit pragmatic Republican candidates and advance `` responsible conservative policy solutions . ''
Bolling 's message was clear : hard-liners like Cuccinelli are eating away at the Republican Party from the inside , and hindering legislative compromise in Richmond .
Cuccinelli 's allies think Bolling is a sore loser , bordering on irrelevance .
Bolling , freed from the pressures of campaign politics for the first time in nearly two decades , says he 's just speaking his mind .
`` Frankly , I do n't care what they think of me , '' Bolling said last month over lunch at a Greek restaurant in the Richmond suburbs , several weeks before The Washington Post revealed some of the more explosive details of the unfolding McDonnell controversy .
Picking at a salad , the lieutenant governor characterized himself as a conservative , explaining that his first taste of politics came as a teenager in the coalfields of West Virginia , when he toiled on the 1972 re-election campaign of Gov . Arch Moore , a Republican in what was then a heavily Democratic state .
`` The definition of what a conservative is has changed so much that now all of a sudden I look like a moderate , '' he said . `` The truth is that Bill Bolling is a conservative guy , always has been , always will be .

Bill Bolling feels Ken Cuccinelli jumped line to run for state's top office

Gov. Bob McDonnell has been embroiled in scandal over gifts to him and his family

Cuccinelli is backed by the tea party; Bolling had support from establishment

The prospect of Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell resigning as he copes with a federal investigation into the nearly $150,000 worth of lavish gifts the Republican and his family received from a wealthy executive is unlikely, people close to the governor insist.

Yet the topic remains a tantalizing conversation piece around Richmond these days, mainly because it would be an act without modern precedent.

While Virginia has had its fair share of tumultuous politics over the years, not since Reconstruction has the commonwealth been forced to grapple with a question of succession. No Virginia governor has resigned, or been impeached, in the last century.

But there's another reason some Virginia political watchers are buzzing about the hypothetical: McDonnell's resignation, however unlikely, would elevate his lieutenant governor, Republican Bill Bolling, to the state's highest office.

And Bolling has made it abundantly clear he has little tolerance for the Republican running to succeed McDonnell -- Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli.

""I have serious reservations about his ability to effectively and responsibly govern our state,"" Bolling said of Cuccinelli in a recent interview with CNN.

Here's the backstory: Bolling has served as lieutenant governor since 2006, and had long eyed this election year as his moment to make the leap to governor. Bolling had McDonnell's endorsement, and campaign backing from other establishment leaders and members of Virginia's influential business community.

Then Cuccinelli stepped in.

The ambitious Fairfax native, an uncompromising social conservative and tea party darling, also had designs on the governorship -- and he had no time for the succession plan orchestrated by Bolling, McDonnell and other GOP leaders. So last year, Cuccinelli's allies in the Republican Party re-wired the GOP's nominating process so that the 2013 gubernatorial nominee would be selected by convention instead of a primary.

Since conventions tend to attract only a small slice of the electorate -- the most committed and vocal conservatives who revel in spending their spring weekends at political conventions -- that left Bolling, who views the tea party movement with a mixture of scorn and exotic bewilderment, with little option but to drop out of the race.

An exasperated Bolling left the race, and Cuccinelli easily captured the GOP gubernatorial nomination in May with the support of roughly 8,000 delegates who showed up at the Richmond Coliseum to support him (and two other conservatives, attorney general candidate Mark Obenshain and a bombastic pastor named E.W. Jackson, the party's nominee for lieutenant governor).

Clearly incensed at Cuccinelli for dashing his gubernatorial hopes, Bolling soon embarked on a media tour lamenting the rightward drift of the Republican Party. He used his remaining campaign funds to launch an initiative called ""The Virginia Mainstream Project"" to recruit pragmatic Republican candidates and advance ""responsible conservative policy solutions.""

Bolling's message was clear: hard-liners like Cuccinelli are eating away at the Republican Party from the inside, and hindering legislative compromise in Richmond.

Cuccinelli's allies think Bolling is a sore loser, bordering on irrelevance.

Bolling, freed from the pressures of campaign politics for the first time in nearly two decades, says he's just speaking his mind.

""Frankly, I don't care what they think of me,"" Bolling said last month over lunch at a Greek restaurant in the Richmond suburbs, several weeks before The Washington Post revealed some of the more explosive details of the unfolding McDonnell controversy.

Picking at a salad, the lieutenant governor characterized himself as a conservative, explaining that his first taste of politics came as a teenager in the coalfields of West Virginia, when he toiled on the 1972 re-election campaign of Gov. Arch Moore, a Republican in what was then a heavily Democratic state.

""The definition of what a conservative is has changed so much that now all of a sudden I look like a moderate,"" he said. ""The truth is that Bill Bolling is a conservative guy, always has been, always will be. But I am not an anti-government guy. I believe there is a role for government to play.""

The conversation pivoted to Bolling's central criticism of Cuccinelli -- that he is an ideologue uninterested in the sort of compromises needed to govern.

""This is not just the most conservative ticket, but it is the most ideologically driven ticket that we have seen in the history of our state,"" Bolling said of the Cuccinelli-Jackson-Obenshain tea party troika.

Bolling says he has ""tried to be measured"" in his public comments about Cuccinelli. But that's not really true.

""The difference between us is the kinds of issues we focus on, the leadership style and demeanor that we demonstrate,"" Bolling said. ""Our willingness to compromise, to get things done. Mr. Cuccinelli will have to run his campaign, and to win this election, he is going to have to convince people that he has the ability to govern Virginia in a mainstream way. Whether he can do that or not remains to be seen.""

All of this, mind you, is coming from the man who would become chief executive if McDonnell were to leave office prematurely.

To the delight of Democrats, it's conceivable that the governor's mansion could be occupied by a Republican who happens to be openly contemptuous of the Republican running to succeed him.

Democrats might enjoy that scenario almost as much as the one they have now, with Cuccinelli having to answer questions about his own ties to Star Scientific CEO Jonnie Williams, the embattled executive who provided McDonnell and his family with undisclosed gifts like a Rolex watch, a $15,000 Bergdorf Goodman shopping spree and pricey catering for the wedding of the governor's daughter.

Cuccinelli also accepted gifts from Williams and owned stock in his company, though an investigation last week found he did not violate the state's conflict of interest laws.

""This is a no-win situation for Cuccinelli,"" said Democratic strategist Mo Elleithee, a veteran of Virginia campaigns. ""If Bob McDonnell somehow is able to remain in office, he'll be a daily reminder of Cuccinelli's own ethical challenges with Star Scientific. If Bolling assumes the governorship, not only will Cuccinelli still be under an ethical cloud, but the new governor will be a daily reminder of how even mainstream Republicans view him as too extreme.""

Bolling's comments over the last few months to a spate of news organizations seem tailor-made for negative television ads and mail pieces: ""Don't believe us? Here's what Virginia's own Republican governor had to say about Ken Cuccinelli ...""

Bolling has even left the door open to voting for Cuccinelli's Democratic opponent, Terry McAuliffe, who, he kindly pointed out, ""takes a more pragmatic approach to politics and to governing.""

At the moment, it doesn't seem the Bolling-as-governor scenario will come to pass.

Bolling is close with McDonnell and certainly isn't angling for the job. Though he's had designs on the governorship for years, taking over for McDonnell in the wake of scandal, with regular legislative business wrapped for the year, isn't much of a prize. Nor could Bolling suddenly decide to run for a full term -- the filing deadline to run in November passed in June.

Those aren't the actions of a man preparing to step aside.

The far-fetched idea is the latest reflection of a campaign cycle that has been anything but ordinary , and stems from a continuing dissatisfaction among some conservative stalwarts with how Trump is behaving and running his campaign . But two longtime GOP veterans says they would n't bet on the effort working .
The effort comes at a rough time for the GOP . As the Democratic Party 's heaviest hitters , including President Barack Obama , Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , line up behind Hillary Clinton and against Trump , Republicans have been forced to criticize their own nominee . Recent comments from Trump about a federal judge 's Mexican heritage have drawn widespread rebuke and put GOP leaders in a corner as they defend their endorsement of Trump while disavowing his comments .
One of the vocal advocates for a delegate revolt is conservative commentator and Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol , who has also been actively seeking a candidate to mount an independent bid against Trump , thus far to no avail .
Kristol tweeted late Thursday that the idea of a `` conscience convention , '' where delegates are free to vote for whomever they want to , is also appealing .
`` I 've been focused on independent candidacy , & still am . But struck by sudden level of interest in possible delegate revolt at convention , '' Kristol tweeted . He added : `` A Convention of Conscience in Cleveland would be quite something . Made easier by fact Trump only won minority of total primary votes anyway . ''

He also linked to an op-ed in the conservative National Review from attorney David French , who was Kristol 's pick for an independent bid until French quashed the idea , in which the conservative writer argued that not a single delegate to Cleveland was actually `` bound '' to Trump .
Bob Vander Plaats , the head of The Family Leader , an influential social conservative group in Iowa , told CNN 's Kate Bolduan Friday morning that `` everything does need to be on the table '' at the convention , though he stopped short of calling for a revolt on the convention floor .
`` We want a principled conservative and disciplined candidate who is the standard-bearer of this party , '' said Vander Plaats , who backed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz during the primaries . He said Trump has time before the convention to `` have the concerns laid to rest . ''
A Colorado delegate bound to Cruz who will serve on the GOP Rules Committee told ABC News that she plans to introduce a clause that would allow delegates to vote their conscience .

`` All I 'm doing is adapting to the circumstances , '' Kendal Unruh told ABC . `` I certainly believe Trump 's demagogic racist comments are hurting him . ''
The rules enacted by the previous convention , which govern in 2016 until delegates pass a new set of rules , state that even if a delegate casts a ballot for a candidate other than one they are bound to , the convention secretary will record their bound vote .
In order to change that rule , the 112 delegates ( two from each state and territory ) on the Rules Committee would have to pass different rules and bring those to the floor of the convention , where a majority of delegates present would have to approve them .
Rules expert and RNC veteran Jim Bopp , an Indiana delegate who serves as special counsel to the RNC Rules Committee , said he has spoken with people who want to `` keep the option open to manipulate the rules in some way to deny Trump the nomination , '' but he said he would n't bet on any changes .
`` I would put money on no rules changes that would affect the outcome of the nominating process , '' Bopp told CNN . `` I think it 's highly likely that no rules changes would be adopted that would affect the nomination . ''
Bopp said there 's also a counter movement within Rules insiders to pass a rule that would prevent any other rules changes from going into effect until the close of the convention .
Rules Committee and Oregon RNC member Solomon Yue is behind that effort , and has been pushing the RNC this year to adopt rules that give less power to the party and more to the delegates . He tried but failed to get the party to adopt rules that would require bigger majorities to pass business at the convention .
Yue says with roughly 80 % of the convention delegates being either Trump or Cruz backers , the anti-Trump forces do n't have much strength .
`` The common denominator of the delegates is anti-establishment , anti-Washington , '' Yue said . `` And if you think about 'Never Trump ' people , they are representing Washington and the establishment . ''

Part of the philosophy for a delegate revolt comes from longtime RNC veteran Curly Haugland , from North Dakota , and a book he co-wrote with public policy consultant Sean Parnell . `` Unbound '' uses the history of the RNC to make the case that RNC rules dictate that delegates be allowed to vote their conscience .
`` What Curly and I are contending is that because of RNC rules , there is no such thing as binding , '' Parnell told CNN , saying the binding rules that currently are in place are in a part of the rules package that govern pre-convention during the delegate selection process .
But Parnell also acknowledged that any effort to make the interpretation stick would require at the very least a handful of state delegations if not a majority of delegates on the floor .
`` It would be messy . Good television though , '' Parnell said . `` I would not call it likely . My hope is that delegates are free to vote however they want to vote , and it 's going to be up to the chair whether or not to allow that . But I think unless Donald Trump actually does go shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue , I do n't think this is going to cost him the nomination . ''
Neither the Trump campaign nor Republican National Committee immediately responded to a request for comment on the chatter about a delegate revolt .
There has been intense focus on the Rules Committee for months , going back to when there was a possibility of no Republican candidate getting enough delegates to clinch the nomination outright . With the prospect of a contested convention , the Cruz campaign made a concerted effort to stock the Rules Committee and state delegations with loyalists who would support Rules that would benefit Cruz in a bid to win the nomination on multiple ballots .
But after Cruz lost Indiana soundly and suspended his campaign , the prospect of a contested convention vanished and Trump rolled to the magic number to clinch the nomination .
Meanwhile , the Cruz campaign urged supporters to continue to become delegates and earn leadership spots to influence the platform at the convention .
Though some in the party have never warmed to Trump , the intensity of finding a way to prevent his formal nomination has grown in recent days after Trump 's comments about a federal judge inflamed even the leaders of his own party .
Trump questioned the impartiality of the district court judge overseeing a lawsuit related to his venture Trump University , saying the Indiana-born judge 's Mexican ancestry could bias him against Trump . The mogul cited his campaign promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico in making the comments .
Though the presumptive nominee has repeatedly stood behind and doubled down on the comments , his stance has drawn outrage from the likes of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan , who called the remarks `` the textbook definition of a racist comment . ''
Still , only a small handful of Republicans have withdrawn or withheld their endorsements of Trump . Vulnerable Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk disavowed Trump this week and said he could not endorse the party 's nominee after all , but Ryan , McConnell and others have stood by their endorsements , saying Clinton would be a worse choice .","Washington (CNN) The faction of the GOP that is unhappy with Donald Trump as the party's presumptive nominee has one last plan to stop the mogul: staging an all-out delegate revolt at the Republican National Convention.

Rules expert and RNC veteran Jim Bopp, an Indiana delegate who serves as special counsel to the RNC Rules Committee, said he has spoken with people who want to ""keep the option open to manipulate the rules in some way to deny Trump the nomination,"" but he said he wouldn't bet on any changes.

""I would put money on no rules changes that would affect the outcome of the nominating process,"" Bopp told CNN. ""I think it's highly likely that no rules changes would be adopted that would affect the nomination.""

Bopp said there's also a counter movement within Rules insiders to pass a rule that would prevent any other rules changes from going into effect until the close of the convention.

Rules Committee and Oregon RNC member Solomon Yue is behind that effort, and has been pushing the RNC this year to adopt rules that give less power to the party and more to the delegates. He tried but failed to get the party to adopt rules that would require bigger majorities to pass business at the convention.

Yue says with roughly 80% of the convention delegates being either Trump or Cruz backers, the anti-Trump forces don't have much strength.

""The common denominator of the delegates is anti-establishment, anti-Washington,"" Yue said. ""And if you think about 'Never Trump' people, they are representing Washington and the establishment.""

Part of the philosophy for a delegate revolt comes from longtime RNC veteran Curly Haugland, from North Dakota, and a book he co-wrote with public policy consultant Sean Parnell. ""Unbound"" uses the history of the RNC to make the case that RNC rules dictate that delegates be allowed to vote their conscience.

""What Curly and I are contending is that because of RNC rules, there is no such thing as binding,"" Parnell told CNN, saying the binding rules that currently are in place are in a part of the rules package that govern pre-convention during the delegate selection process.

But Parnell also acknowledged that any effort to make the interpretation stick would require at the very least a handful of state delegations if not a majority of delegates on the floor.

""It would be messy. Good television though,"" Parnell said. ""I would not call it likely. My hope is that delegates are free to vote however they want to vote, and it's going to be up to the chair whether or not to allow that. But I think unless Donald Trump actually does go shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue, I don't think this is going to cost him the nomination.""

Neither the Trump campaign nor Republican National Committee immediately responded to a request for comment on the chatter about a delegate revolt.

There has been intense focus on the Rules Committee for months, going back to when there was a possibility of no Republican candidate getting enough delegates to clinch the nomination outright. With the prospect of a contested convention, the Cruz campaign made a concerted effort to stock the Rules Committee and state delegations with loyalists who would support Rules that would benefit Cruz in a bid to win the nomination on multiple ballots.

But after Cruz lost Indiana soundly and suspended his campaign, the prospect of a contested convention vanished and Trump rolled to the magic number to clinch the nomination.

Meanwhile, the Cruz campaign urged supporters to continue to become delegates and earn leadership spots to influence the platform at the convention.

Though some in the party have never warmed to Trump, the intensity of finding a way to prevent his formal nomination has grown in recent days after Trump's comments about a federal judge inflamed even the leaders of his own party.

Trump questioned the impartiality of the district court judge overseeing a lawsuit related to his venture Trump University, saying the Indiana-born judge's Mexican ancestry could bias him against Trump. The mogul cited his campaign promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico in making the comments.

Though the presumptive nominee has repeatedly stood behind and doubled down on the comments, his stance has drawn outrage from the likes of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who called the remarks ""the textbook definition of a racist comment.""

Still, only a small handful of Republicans have withdrawn or withheld their endorsements of Trump. Vulnerable Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk disavowed Trump this week and said he could not endorse the party's nominee after all, but Ryan, McConnell and others have stood by their endorsements, saying Clinton would be a worse choice.",www.cnn.com,left,cRuxYqYKDjzqiVPE

The House , Boehner said on Sunday , is a `` rambunctious place . ''
`` We have 435 members . A lot of members have different ideas about what we should and should n't be doing , '' he said during an appearance on CBS 's `` Face the Nation . ''
Asked if he 's capable of leading the chamber , Boehner said : `` I think so . I 'm not going to suggest it 's easy , because it 's not . ''
The disagreements among conservatives on procedures and tactics -- and the way those divides have hobbled Boehner -- was on vivid public display Friday when the House , faced with a midnight deadline to keep DHS from a shutdown , failed to pass a three-week extension of its funding .
The party 's right flank insisted that it not cave on its demand that any Homeland Security measure also include provisions to undo President Barack Obama 's executive actions on immigration . But Democrats blocked that bill from advancing in the Senate , instead sending back a version with all of the immigration portions stripped out and leaving Boehner with few options to mollify his party .
The three-week funding measure , intended to save face and avoid the embarrassment of a shutdown , wound up embarrassing his leadership team anyway . And the House was left to pass a one-week measure instead , pushing the same fight back just several more days .
`` Could we have done better Friday ? Yes . Will we ? Yes , we will , '' House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy R-California , a key Boehner ally , said Sunday on NBC 's `` Meet the Press . ''

Boehner 's allies feared that if he allowed a vote on the Senate 's `` clean '' bill to fund Homeland Security for months without including an attack on Obama over immigration , conservatives would call for a vote to remove him as speaker .
Rep. Charlie Dent , a moderate Pennsylvania Republican , acknowledged on Friday that he 'd heard talk of ousting Boehner .

It would n't be the first time some conservatives sought to remove Boehner -- but they 've never had any success before .
Twenty-five Republicans refused to back him for speaker at the start of the new Congress , but they did n't coalesce around a single challenger , and Boehner ultimately won with 216 of the 408 total votes cast .
But a leading House conservative who 's often mentioned as a potential Boehner alternative insisted there 's no move afoot to unseat the speaker .
Rep. Jim Jordan , the Ohio Republican who chairs the hard-liner House Freedom Caucus , said Sunday that Boehner 's decision to advance a one-week measure wo n't cost the speaker his job .

Jordan said he has n't had conversations with any conservative House colleagues about overthrowing Boehner .

Scalise said conservatives who are frustrated about Friday 's outcome should instead turn their ire toward Senate Democrats and pressure the minority party in that chamber to allow the House-passed measure that funds Homeland Security and unravels Obama 's immigration actions to receive a vote .
`` They need to light up the Senate switchboard , '' Scalise said , `` and make those Senate Democrats feel the heat who have been standing with the president on his illegal actions . ''

“It’s one thing to vote against impeachment, but instead of owning up to his constituents and explaining to them why he’s doing what he’s doing, he’s now decided to just completely abandon the Democratic Party and switch,” Suleiman said. “It’s just unconscionable.”

GOP presidential hopefuls spent Saturday night serving up ice cream , cheese and political red meat to potential Iowa caucus voters .
At the Iowa Republican Party 's annual Lincoln Day Dinner fundraiser , the first part of the evening was rigid . Each of the 11 possible candidates present was given a strictly enforced 10 minutes to make their pitch before later wooing voters at their hospitality suites downstairs with home-state fare in a more relaxed environment .
Some candidates served up surprises to the crowd , too , which could make a critical lasting impression for underdog candidates .
Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , got the most laughs of the evening , declaring he was the `` halftime '' entertainment as he took the stage
`` The more you drink , the better I sound , so keep drinking , '' he joked . `` If you need to go to the bathroom , go ahead . Wo n't bother me a bit . ''
He jabbed at Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley 's famously frugal ways : `` The one thing I learned about this dinner is it was free for Chuck or he would n't have been here ! ''
He also ribbed freshman Sen. Joni Ernst 's memorable 2014 `` hog castration '' ad : `` When I saw that ad with the pigs , I made sure I 'd never offend Joni . ''
But the hawkish senator quickly turned serious , taking a jab at his frequent foe , Rand Paul , the libertarian-leaning Kentucky senator . Paul , who has already officially announced his candidacy , had used his own time to reiterate his opposition to the NSA 's controversial wiretaps , telling voters , `` I want to catch terrorists , but I also want to protect the Constitution . ''
Graham , who could announce his 2016 plans June 1 , promised that if someone under his watch as president was thinking of joining ISIS or planning a terrorist attack , `` I 'm not calling a judge '' to get a warrant , as Paul called for , `` I 'm calling a drone and we 're going to kill you . ''
Graham also gave cover to another potential 2016 rival — former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush , who fumbled questions this week on whether he would invaded Iraq .
The former U.S. Air Force JAG Corps lawyer blamed the deterioration in the Middle East on Obama 's withdrawal of troops in the region , not on former President George W. Bush .
`` If you fought in Iraq , '' Graham said , `` it 's not your fault it 's going to hell . It 's Obama 's fault . ''
But Paul did n't spare Bush that scrutiny . Without mentioning his likely rival by name , he said the question of whether the Iraq War was a good idea was a `` valid question . Not because we 're talking about history , but because we 're talking about the Middle East , where history repeats itself . ''
Paul said the same question should be asked of Hillary Clinton . `` If she ever takes any questions , '' he quipped . He then pivoted to an indictment of Clinton 's reaction to the 2012 consulate attacks in Benghazi , Libya , which he said should `` disqualify '' her as president .
When Bush took the stage , he began by acknowledging his family in a nod to the controversy of this week .
`` You all know me as George and Barbara 's boy , for which I 'm proud , '' he said . `` Some of you all may know that Dubya is my brother . I 'm proud of that , too . ''
Earlier on Saturday , Bush defended his answers this week when he was asked by Fox News ' Megyn Kelly , `` Knowing what we know now , would you have authorized the invasion '' in Iraq ? After saying he would , Bush tried to clarify the next day , saying he `` interpreted the question wrong '' before finally fully walking back the answer Thursday , saying he would not have gone into Iraq .
`` I misstepped , for sure . I answered a question that was n't asked , '' he told voters at a town hall at Loras College in Dubuque on Saturday morning .
Later that afternoon , when taking questions from reporters in Iowa City , he said all candidates were going to make mistakes .
`` If you 're looking for a perfect candidate , '' he said , `` he probably existed 2,000 years ago . ''
At the Lincoln Dinner , Bush took aim at Obama 's foreign policy , echoing part of his stump speech .
`` Name a country where the relationship is better than the day that Barack Obama came into office ? '' he asked . `` Iran . Cuba . I rest my case . ''
Foreign policy hits against both Obama and Clinton were familiar refrains from other speakers , too .
`` Iran , enemy . Israel , friend . It 's real simple , '' said former Sen. Rick Santorum , R-Pa. , who won Iowa in 2012 .
Gov . Bobby Jindal , R-La. , assailed Obama for what he saw as not standing up for religious liberty in the face of threats abroad . `` The United States of America did not create religious liberty , '' he said . `` Religious liberty created the United States . ''
Ben Carson , who has never held political office , but is a Tea Party favorite , saw his first lead in a poll of Republican primary voters . `` While our enemies are magnifying and metastasizing , we 're shrinking back , '' said Carson , a retired pediatric neurosurgeon .
Former Texas Gov . Rick Perry tried to offer a hopeful historical reminder : `` We made it through Jimmy Carter . We 'll make it through Barack Obama . ''
His speech ran long , and like a scene out of an Academy Awards ceremony , music began to play .
Another candidate , who got the proverbial hook , was Carly Fiorina , the former Hewlett-Packard CEO . Her microphone was cut off to the verbal frustration of the crowd . She briefly continued to speak while the audience could not hear her .
Her speech , though , was well received , including getting the loudest applause of the night with this jab , recalling how she was asked when she announced her official campaign last week if a woman 's hormones would affect her ability to do the job as president .
`` Can anyone think of a single instance where a man 's judgment was clouded by his hormones ? And in the Oval Office , '' she said , a not-so-subtle shot at former President Bill Clinton .

republican_party,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/11/03/what-would-gop-do-with-senate-majority-immigration-keystone-and-more-at-stake/,"What would GOP do with Senate majority? Immigration, Keystone and more at stake",2014-11-03,Kelley Beaucar Vlahos,"While all the pre-Election Day chatter centers on whether Republicans will retake the Senate , the bigger question is : If they succeed , what will they do with the power ?
More than bragging rights are on the line . Important debates over issues ranging from immigration to the Keystone Pipeline to Iran ’ s nuclear program to taxes – perhaps even parts of ObamaCare -- remain unresolved heading into President Obama ’ s final two years in office .
The balance of power in Congress could shape all of them , in the relatively narrow window before 2016 politics grind everything , once again , to a halt .
Should Mitch McConnell both survive his general election challenge and ascend to majority leader – with his party holding the House majority , as it most likely will – Republicans would find themselves in an enviable position . They ’ d have the obvious perks of majority-hood , able to pressure the administration with investigations and hearings from both chambers ; to hold up Obama nominees to key appointments even more ; and , when able to cobble together a filibuster-proof majority , to pass bills and repeal laws of their choosing , if only to force the president to employ his veto pen .
But there ’ s also the possibility that a Washington with power so evenly divided could yield some key agreements , in the spirit of the Gingrich-Clinton era . Or at least , could compel the president to dial back his approach in the final two years .
Conservatives are gleeful at the prospect of full control of one branch of government .
“ This is an opportunity for the Republican Party to demonstrate that it has a governing agenda , ” said Dan Holler , spokesman for the conservative Heritage Action for America . “ Americans think the whole system in Washington is broke . This is [ Republicans ’ ] time to change that bad perception – not only of Washington , but of the Republican Party . ''
On immigration , for example , a big Republican win could set up a standoff with Obama as he prepares to move forward on some type of major executive action . The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the White House is weighing criteria for letting up to 4 million illegal immigrants stay in the country .
All of this could easily come during the lame-duck session .
Republicans , though , are eager to be in a position where they can challenge or undermine this action , even after the fact . Republican senators who were involved in crafting bipartisan immigration legislation in 2013 wrote a letter to the president last Thursday saying that “ [ executive action ] would be the most divisive action you could take – completely undermining any good-faith effort to meaningfully address this important issue . ”

Some analysts believe that there are some issues that carry less political recoil – at least for the president and moderates in both parties – that might see a chance for reconciliation under a new Republican majority . There are enough overlapping interests in tax reform , pending trade agreements , infrastructure spending , and maybe even the Keystone Pipeline , which has been a political hot potato for six years .
The administration consistently has delayed a decision on the pipeline , which would take as much as 830,000 barrels per day of Alberta tar sands crude to refineries on Texas ' Gulf Coast . Both sides of the contentious issue have used it as a wedge in the midterm campaigns .
So far , Senate Democrats have staved off any binding legislation that would green-light the pipeline ( in 2013 the Senate passed a non-binding resolution in favor of Keystone ) . That might change in January if Republicans take control . At that point , the president might have to negotiate , perhaps as part of some broader energy legislation that gives Democrats and their environmental interests some grist , like increased coal emission standards .
“ It all depends on what [ Obama ] gets out of it , ” said Sean Evans , chairman of the political science department at Tennessee ’ s Union University . “ It ’ s all about making sure both Republicans and Obama can claim a win . ”
A Republican majority also could cause problems for the administration ’ s negotiations with Iran , as a GOP-controlled Senate would be in a position to lead the charge on a bipartisan sanctions bill and make noise should the administration try initially to circumvent Congress on a nuclear pact .
Analysts differ on how much the GOP could push through and how they might do it if they win the majority . The 2016 presidential election and even that year ’ s Senate elections would color most legislative debates . A number of senators are showing interest in running for the White House – including Sens . Rand Paul , Marco Rubio and Cruz – which complicates the picture even more .
Further , most polls indicate that if Republicans win the Senate , they ’ d only have a slim majority . ( Democrats now hold a 55-45 majority , with two Independents caucusing with them . )
Conservatives say Republicans in the Senate “ should stand for something , ” and even with a slight advantage use the ability to bring bills to the floor to introduce measures that would both show they can govern , and raise ideological issues to help differentiate themselves from their opponents whether legislation passes or not .
“ They will have two years to prove they aren ’ t just anti-Obama , but even so , they can still make political stands , ” said Craig Shirley , a Reagan biographer and longtime conservative strategist .
“ They should definitely raise immigration , corruption , tax reform , government reform , defunding some left-wing institutions – that will bring them together at the very least , ” he said . “ If they can ’ t get anything passed legislatively , at least it will make a political point . ”
The last time a Democrat was in the White House with two Republican-controlled chambers was when President Bill Clinton was in office . Political historians give him credit for negotiating a number of Republican initiatives , including welfare reform . Some wonder if Obama has the same kind of political savvy – or inclination -- to pull the same thing off today .
“ Clinton is the most brilliant politician in my lifetime , ” said Peter Burns , political science professor at Loyola University . “ I don ’ t know if Obama has the ability to do that. ” Plus , he added , “ Bill Clinton was one of the few presidents who got more popular over time . Obama is down very low right now ” and not in the best negotiating position .
Though an all-Republican majority on Capitol Hill would no doubt frustrate Obama , there is one potential bright spot for him . To date , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has blocked a vote on legislation to give the president special authority to negotiate certain trade deals , worried about the impact on U.S. jobs . But Obama wants that authority for a potential Asia-Pacific trade pact – and Republicans might be willing to give it to him .
Meanwhile , Holler said Heritage Action will encourage Republicans to “ focus on the big things , ” like repealing ObamaCare , rather than chipping away at the law by overturning its more unpopular measures , like the medical device tax , or finding common ground in the appropriations process . He is undeterred by reports that even McConnell believes repeal is dead in the water .
He and other conservatives believe they should fight for it , and other issues – like tax reform or entitlement reform – that will show clear alternatives to the Democrats ’ platform . “ They can play small ball and do some of these small things and draw contrasts a little , but that ’ s not why people are going to say , 'let ’ s give you another chance ' , ” he said . “ They ’ re going to give you another chance when they see a big agenda . ”","While all the pre-Election Day chatter centers on whether Republicans will retake the Senate, the bigger question is: If they succeed, what will they do with the power?

More than bragging rights are on the line. Important debates over issues ranging from immigration to the Keystone Pipeline to Iran’s nuclear program to taxes – perhaps even parts of ObamaCare -- remain unresolved heading into President Obama’s final two years in office.

The balance of power in Congress could shape all of them, in the relatively narrow window before 2016 politics grind everything, once again, to a halt.

Should Mitch McConnell both survive his general election challenge and ascend to majority leader – with his party holding the House majority, as it most likely will – Republicans would find themselves in an enviable position. They’d have the obvious perks of majority-hood, able to pressure the administration with investigations and hearings from both chambers; to hold up Obama nominees to key appointments even more; and, when able to cobble together a filibuster-proof majority, to pass bills and repeal laws of their choosing, if only to force the president to employ his veto pen.

But there’s also the possibility that a Washington with power so evenly divided could yield some key agreements, in the spirit of the Gingrich-Clinton era. Or at least, could compel the president to dial back his approach in the final two years.

Conservatives are gleeful at the prospect of full control of one branch of government.

“This is an opportunity for the Republican Party to demonstrate that it has a governing agenda,” said Dan Holler, spokesman for the conservative Heritage Action for America. “Americans think the whole system in Washington is broke. This is [Republicans’] time to change that bad perception – not only of Washington, but of the Republican Party.""

On immigration, for example, a big Republican win could set up a standoff with Obama as he prepares to move forward on some type of major executive action. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the White House is weighing criteria for letting up to 4 million illegal immigrants stay in the country.

All of this could easily come during the lame-duck session.

Republicans, though, are eager to be in a position where they can challenge or undermine this action, even after the fact. Republican senators who were involved in crafting bipartisan immigration legislation in 2013 wrote a letter to the president last Thursday saying that “[executive action] would be the most divisive action you could take – completely undermining any good-faith effort to meaningfully address this important issue.”

Holler said conservative senators like Texas’ Ted Cruz and others might try to reverse the president’s actions through the appropriations process.

republican_party,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/apr/5/donald-trump-nancy-pelosi-clash-over-mail-voting-c/,"Trump, Pelosi clash over mail-in voting as virus looms over election",2020-04-05,"Kevin Freking, Colleen Long, Nicholas Riccardi","WASHINGTON — While Wisconsin struggles to hold its primary on Tuesday , President Donald Trump and Democrats are bickering over how to provide voters with safe and secure access to a ballot as the coronavirus pandemic rages in the U.S. and threatens to extend into the fall , affecting the general election .
With another economic rescue package in the works , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she wants money to give more voters the chance to cast their ballot by mail , an option that would allow people to vote without the concern over the safety of polling places .
But Trump opposes voting by mail and is leading Republicans in a battle to limit its use , arguing that it would encourage fraud and lead to so many people voting that his party could not win .
But the 2020 presidential election is creeping ever closer , and there are no signs yet of the pandemic abating , nor any word on when Americans on orders to stay home can resume normal life , so lawmakers are trying to figure out how to allow for voting in a world where face-to-face contact causes anxiety at the least and possibly sickness and death .
The debate is playing out now in Wisconsin . It stands apart from other states that have delayed primaries because of the virus , though Democratic Gov . Tony Evers has issued a statewide stay-at-home order .
Evers initially joined Republican leaders in seeking to hold the primary as planned on Tuesday , but he now favors an all-mail election with absentee voting well into May . Republicans maintain that in-person voting should go on as planned and have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block extended absentee voting .
The election features the Democratic presidential primary between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders , but a bigger concern for Republicans is a state Supreme Court race that pits a conservative incumbent against a liberal challenger .
In recent weeks , as Democrats nationwide have argued the country must prepare for voting largely by mail , Republicans have objected to or blocked expansions of such voting in Arizona , Georgia and Pennsylvania .
“ It shouldn ’ t be mail-in voting . It should be you go to a booth and you proudly display yourself , ” Trump told reporters Friday evening . Earlier this week on Fox News Channel ’ s “ Fox & Friends , ” he claimed the Democrats had a plan “ that if you ever agreed to it you ’ d never have a Republican elected in this country again . ”
More than 290,000 people in the United States have tested positive for the virus so far , prompting more than a dozen states to delay their presidential primaries . Health officials are warning that the virus has the potential to return with a second wave during the next flu season , putting voters and poll workers in a dilemma where fulfilling a civic duty means putting their health at greater risk .
Colorado , Hawaii , Oregon and Washington already provide registered voters with a ballot in the mail for all their elections , according to a Congressional Research Service report . California and Utah are among the states that give counties the option of mail-in voting .
Proponents say it can improve participation , particularly with voters who have to work on election day , go to school or have mobility issues , such as the elderly or the sick .

With another economic rescue package in the works, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she wants money to give more voters the chance to cast their ballot by mail, an option that would allow people to vote without the concern over the safety of polling places.

But Trump opposes voting by mail and is leading Republicans in a battle to limit its use, arguing that it would encourage fraud and lead to so many people voting that his party could not win.

But the 2020 presidential election is creeping ever closer, and there are no signs yet of the pandemic abating, nor any word on when Americans on orders to stay home can resume normal life, so lawmakers are trying to figure out how to allow for voting in a world where face-to-face contact causes anxiety at the least and possibly sickness and death.

The debate is playing out now in Wisconsin. It stands apart from other states that have delayed primaries because of the virus, though Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has issued a statewide stay-at-home order.

Evers initially joined Republican leaders in seeking to hold the primary as planned on Tuesday, but he now favors an all-mail election with absentee voting well into May. Republicans maintain that in-person voting should go on as planned and have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block extended absentee voting.

The election features the Democratic presidential primary between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, but a bigger concern for Republicans is a state Supreme Court race that pits a conservative incumbent against a liberal challenger.

In recent weeks, as Democrats nationwide have argued the country must prepare for voting largely by mail, Republicans have objected to or blocked expansions of such voting in Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania.

“It shouldn’t be mail-in voting. It should be you go to a booth and you proudly display yourself,” Trump told reporters Friday evening. Earlier this week on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends,” he claimed the Democrats had a plan “that if you ever agreed to it you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.”

More than 290,000 people in the United States have tested positive for the virus so far, prompting more than a dozen states to delay their presidential primaries. Health officials are warning that the virus has the potential to return with a second wave during the next flu season, putting voters and poll workers in a dilemma where fulfilling a civic duty means putting their health at greater risk.

Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington already provide registered voters with a ballot in the mail for all their elections, according to a Congressional Research Service report. California and Utah are among the states that give counties the option of mail-in voting.

Proponents say it can improve participation, particularly with voters who have to work on election day, go to school or have mobility issues, such as the elderly or the sick. It could reduce the number of poll workers needed, as well as the long lines that often arise during a presidential election.

“It just makes us more democratic,” Pelosi told reporters this week. “It just gives more people the opportunity to vote. So that is something we would like to see.”

Trump contends fraud would increase with more mail-in voting, declaring, “I think a lot of people cheat.”

A North Carolina congressional election had to be rerun last year because the Republican candidate’s campaign had engaged in widespread fraud through mail ballots.

But some Republicans have come to embrace the format, arguing it can be done securely and is cheaper and fairer than in-person elections. Utah, a GOP stronghold, is a recent convert to mail-in voting.

Evidence shows it is Republicans, rather than Democrats, who are most likely to vote by mail, said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor who tracks balloting.

State and local governments are responsible for determining whether or how to offer mail-in voting. A few bills introduced during the current session of Congress would require states to allow for early or mail-in voting for federal elections. Others would require states to allow mail-in voting during national emergencies and authorize the funds to help defray the costs.

The $2.2 trillion rescue package that Congress passed included $400 million for states to invest in the next election so they could expand early voting, move to mail-in voting, or increase safety measures at polling sites.

That’s a meager investment compared with the $2 billion that the Brennan Center for Justice recently said is needed to ensure the pandemic does not jeopardize a free and fair election.

MEMPHIS, Tennessee — Not that long ago, most Republican leaders saw Rand Paul as the head of an important faction who, like his father, ultimately had no shot at becoming the party’s presidential nominee.

Now the question is no longer whether Paul can win the nomination, but whether he can win a general election.

Story Continued Below

The shift follows a year in which the Kentucky senator has barnstormed the country, trying to expand the party’s base beyond older, white voters and attract a following beyond than the libertarian devotees of his father, Ron Paul. Although the job is far from complete, Paul has made undeniable progress, judging from interviews with more than 30 Republican National Committee members meeting here this week.

That he has struck a chord with this crowd is all the more telling because it is heavy with GOP establishment-types who tend to prefer mainstream candidates.

“I don’t see how anyone could say it’s not possible he’d win the nomination,” Texas GOP chairman Steve Munisteri said. “His mission is to convince people of what his coalition would be in November” 2016.

During a speech Friday to the RNC gathering, Paul received a standing ovation after saying that the GOP didn’t need to dilute its message but that it had to communicate it better to non-traditional audiences — and suggesting implicitly that he’s the guy to do it.

( QUIZ: Do you know Rand Paul?)

“To paraphrase Captain Kirk, we need to go boldly to where Republicans haven’t been going,” he said. “We need to go from Harlem to Berkeley, to East Los Angeles and Laredo.”

Paul has not officially declared he’s running for president, he has plenty of critics and also has suffered a series of stumbles that could haunt him down the line. But the pervasive mood here at the RNC spring meeting was that there’s no frontrunner for the nomination, which means there’s an opening for the 51-year-old Paul.

The senator clearly understands this, and he has kept up as aggressive a travel schedule as any other likely candidate, and not just to early voting states.

Missouri Chairman Ed Martin said Paul quickly sold out the party’s Lincoln Day dinner in Springfield. Martin was amazed at how it was not just 500 libertarian true-believers who filled a ballroom, but people from every wing of the party.

“He’s a mainstream candidate,” Martin said. “A big question for 2016 is who can draw new people in. Rand has an attraction … My wife’s not a political person, but she likes Rand a lot.”

Paul, who was elected to the Senate on the tea party wave of 2010, has spent much of his time since schmoozing with the GOP establishment.

The weekend before, he went to the Maine Republican state convention to call for party unity.

“We had some folks that are categorized as ‘establishment’ or whatever, who told me that if Rand Paul could speak at every convention, I think everyone would see him as a mainstream guy,” Maine national committeeman Alex Willette said.

The day before that Maine speech, Paul was in Boston to speak at the Harvard Institute of Politics. He squeezed in a lunch with several members of 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s brain trust.

Cory Gardner , the Republican challenging Mark Udall of Colorado for his Senate seat , finally met his match : the yes-or-no question .
In a debate Tuesday night , the Colorado candidate was asked to give a simple , one-word answer to the question of whether `` humans are contributing significantly to climate change . ''
He could n't do it . Even though , as the debate 's monitor explained to him , he 'd later get a full minute to explain his answer . Even though the scientific community overwhelmingly agrees that human activity is the main cause of climate change .
`` Look , this is an important issue and I do n't think you can say yes or no , '' Gardner plead . He got the first part right .
Also this week , over in Kentucky , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell spent an excruciating 14 minutes on a sports radio program , which only got more awkward when host Matt Jones asked him whether or not he believes in global warming .
“ What I have said repeatedly is I ’ m not a scientist , '' he replied , getting off to an inauspicious start . `` But what I can tell you is , even if you thought that was important -- and there are some scientists who do and some scientists who don ’ t -- but even if you thought that was important , the United States doing this by itself is going to have zero impact . ''
`` Senator , that 's a 'yes or no ' question , '' Jones pushed . `` Do you believe in global warming ? ''
`` No it is n't . It is not a yes or no question , '' McConnell snapped . `` There are differences of opinion among scientists . My job is to try to protect jobs in Kentucky now , not speculate about science in the future . ''
In New Hampshire , meanwhile , Senate candidate Scott Brown had some difficulty defining his own stance on climate : Is climate change `` absolutely '' real and caused by a combination of man-made and natural factors , as he claimed in 2012 , not scientifically proven , as he asserted in late August , or , wait , actually , the first one : Monday night , Brown was back to the `` real and caused by a combination of factors '' stance , which his campaign confirms is his actual position .
These pols may not be scientists , but they 're not stupid . Gardner himself acknowledged , just a day before the debate , that `` there is no doubt that pollution contributes to the climate changing around us . '' And McConnell ... well , he still denies , against all evidence to the contrary , that the climate is even changing . But if anything , we should probably just call him stubborn .
Privately , Bloomberg recently reported , many Republicans in office do believe that humans are causing climate change -- as do 52 percent of their constituency -- and that something needs to be done . But what these self-contradicting Republicans , so keen to boast of their lack of scientific education , seem to be realizing that when it comes to climate change , there 's no safe place to stand .
Things were n't always so complicated . Legend has it , prominent Republicans once readily believed that man-made climate change was happening and , having accepted the science , took the natural next step of supporting climate action . `` We stand warned by serious and credible scientists across the world that time is short and the dangers are great , '' John McCain said during his 2008 presidential campaign . And so , `` we need to think straight about the dangers ahead and to meet the problem with all the resources of human ingenuity at our disposal . ''
Obviously , things have changed . By March of this year , McCain had dialed things way back , telling Time that , while he 's still interested in climate change , `` I just leave the issue alone because I don ’ t see a way through it . '' So much for the power of human ingenuity .
According to Bloomberg , McCain 's current position is the one most Republicans have found themselves caught in : believing that not much is going to happen , legislatively , to make a significant difference in greenhouse gas emissions . So they 're better off , the thinking goes , keeping the Tea Party happy by bowing out of the debate entirely -- by trying to change the subject , by using their lack of scientific degree to disqualify them from stating an opinion and by hedging , avoiding , at all costs , that yes-or-no question .
But here 's the problem for these politicians : 400,000 people marching in the streets of New York say leaders can no longer ignore the issue and hope it goes away . What we 're seeing now is politicians confronted with the awkwardness of finding a position on climate that 's both politically tenable and yet not entirely mockable . They 're damned if they do , damned if they do n't : Answer the question with a no , and they 'll be slapped with the cold , hard facts , their anti-science stance putting them at risk of alienating moderate and younger voters . But acknowledge that there is a problem , and they 're basically making the de-facto admission that something has to be done to solve it .
That 's what Gardner was trying to get around in his wordy answer to a simple question . The congressman understands that a `` yes '' implies a need for action , and as such had to qualify his response with the assertion that climate change , while happening , is n't the big deal the media makes it out to be . It 's why McConnell , in the same breath in which he was disavowing the reality of climate change , also argued that any steps the U.S. took to reduce emissions would n't have a significant impact .
But those qualifiers , too , fall apart under scrutiny . The `` highly conservative '' U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found , in its most recent report , that we 're already feeling the effects of climate change , and that , barring significant action to reduce emissions , they 're only going to get worse . Even in the best-case scenario , the one seized upon by Gardner in Brown , in which humans turn out to have the least possible effect on the climate , we 'll still only be able to avoid the most dangerous effects of warming if our extremely good luck is coupled with aggressive steps taken to reduce emissions . A failure to take action on the part of the U.S. , regardless of how effective that action turns out to be , is tantamount to throwing in the towel , and allowing us all to continue on a course we might not be able to recover from .
And a defeatist attitude like that does not make for a very electable candidate .
So what 's a Republican hoping to stake out a viable position on climate change to do ? None of the candidates seem to have figured that out , hence all the stammering , bumbling and self-contradiction every time the issue is raised . Perhaps the answer is simply that there is n't an answer ; at least , not one that 's both based in reality and tenable for the party as it currently operates . But seeing as how the science is only getting stronger , and the impacts of climate change more and more apparent , the GOP had best get busy working on an answer they can live with .

Trump loves to tout results and bash lawmakers when they do not move fast enough on his priorities .
Trump warned Senate Republicans through Twitter a week ago that they should get the annual spending bills passed before the August recess , a high bar for a chamber that didn ’ t pass any regular appropriations bills in 2017 .
He also slammed the Senate ’ s pace on approving nominees as “ the worst in history . ”
A few days before that , he dinged Congress for a lack of progress on immigration reform .
“ We are going to demand Congress secure the border in the upcoming CR , ” he tweeted , referring to a continuing resolution that would provide government funding . “ Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws . ”
Earlier this month , he poked GOP lawmakers for not being more vocally critical of special counsel Robert Mueller Robert ( Bob ) Swan MuellerSpeier says impeachment inquiry shows 'very strong case of bribery ' by Trump Gowdy : I '100 percent ' still believe public congressional hearings are ' a circus ' Comey : Mueller 'did n't succeed in his mission because there was inadequate transparency ' MORE ’ s investigation , warning “ Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late ! ”
This flurry of criticism has some Republicans worried that Trump could dampen enthusiasm among the GOP base , hurting turnout for the midterm elections .
“ It would be very helpful with our base if rather than suggesting we weren ’ t doing anything , that he acknowledged what we are getting done , ” said Sen. Mike Rounds Marion ( Mike ) Michael RoundsHillicon Valley : Facebook launches 'News Tab ' | Senate passes bill to take on 'deepfakes ' | Schumer outlines vision for electric cars Senate passes legislation to combat 'deepfake ' videos America 's newest comedy troupe : House GOP MORE ( R-S.D . ) .
Rounds said this message was communicated to Trump at a meeting on Capitol Hill this past week .
“ I think it was well received by the president , ” he said .
Republicans say that Trump ’ s complaints about lack of accomplishments in Congress , such as the failure to pass legislation to repeal and replace ObamaCare , have overshadowed accomplishments , such as passing a $ 1.5 trillion tax cut last year .
“ When I sit down with a small group of Republicans in Tennessee , they say , ‘ Why don ’ t you guys do anything ? ’ ” said Sen. Lamar Alexander Andrew ( Lamar ) Lamar AlexanderPelosi aide hopeful White House will support drug-pricing bill despite criticism Overnight Energy : BLM staff face choice of relocation or resignation as agency moves | Trump says he 's 'very much into climate ' | EPA rule would expand limits on scientific studies Juan Williams : Republicans flee Trump MORE ( R-Tenn. ) .
Alexander said he has gotten so many questions and complaints about the ObamaCare failure he has printed out cards that he hands to constituents that list all the accomplishments of the 115th Congress .
They include tax reform , confirming 21 circuit court judges , opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling , repealing ObamaCare ’ s individual mandate and using the Congressional Review Act to repeal 14 Obama-era federal regulations .
Sen. John Hoeven John Henry HoevenBottom Line Poll : McConnell is most unpopular senator McConnell ups pressure on White House to get a budget deal MORE ( R-N.D. ) did Alexander one better and gave Trump one of those cards during his meeting with the GOP conference .
Alexander told Trump that Republicans ’ chances of keeping control of the Senate and House after November will depend on him rallying the base .
That means touting its accomplishments , not panning it for the backlog of executive and judicial branch nominations or stalemate on immigration .
“ He has the biggest megaphone and the more he talks about that , the better off we think we are , ” he said .
Republicans have a slim 51-49 majority in the Senate and hope to expand it as Democrats must defend 26 seats in November while Republicans have to worry about only nine .
But Democrats have hopes of seizing the majority because the president ’ s party tends to fare badly in the first midterm election and polls show them leading Republicans by an average of 5 points on the generic ballot .
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison ( Mitch ) Mitchell McConnellGOP senators balk at lengthy impeachment trial Graham : Senate trial 'must expose the whistleblower ' Graham says Schiff should be a witness in Trump impeachment trial MORE ( R-Ky. ) warned on Thursday that control of the chamber is “ absolutely ” up for grabs .
GOP strategists think Senate Republicans are right to ask Trump to be more positive .
“ One , Trump has great clout with the Republican base . Two , hammering Republicans [ in Congress ] undermines their central argument in the midterm election , which is , ‘ the president needs reinforcements — look at the great results , he needs more Republicans not Democrats , ’ ” said Republican strategist Ford O ’ Connell .
Gallup reported it reached an 11-month high at the end of April , with 42 percent of respondents nationwide saying they liked the job he was doing .
A CNN poll released earlier this month found his job approval rating at 41 percent , with 53 percent disapproving .
While more people disapprove than approve of Trump ’ s job performance , he ’ s doing significantly better in the public ’ s opinion than Congress .
A Gallup poll conducted earlier this month showed Congress with a 17 percent job approval rating .
Strategists say Trump will be key to turning out Republican voters in November .

Trump loves to tout results and bash lawmakers when they do not move fast enough on his priorities.

Trump warned Senate Republicans through Twitter a week ago that they should get the annual spending bills passed before the August recess, a high bar for a chamber that didn’t pass any regular appropriations bills in 2017.

He also slammed the Senate’s pace on approving nominees as “the worst in history.”

A few days before that, he dinged Congress for a lack of progress on immigration reform.

“We are going to demand Congress secure the border in the upcoming CR,” he tweeted, referring to a continuing resolution that would provide government funding. “Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws.”

Trump’s criticism extends to matters beyond legislation and nominees.

Earlier this month, he poked GOP lawmakers for not being more vocally critical of special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerSpeier says impeachment inquiry shows 'very strong case of bribery' by Trump Gowdy: I '100 percent' still believe public congressional hearings are 'a circus' Comey: Mueller 'didn't succeed in his mission because there was inadequate transparency' MORE’s investigation, warning “Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!”

This flurry of criticism has some Republicans worried that Trump could dampen enthusiasm among the GOP base, hurting turnout for the midterm elections.

“It would be very helpful with our base if rather than suggesting we weren’t doing anything, that he acknowledged what we are getting done,” said Sen. Mike Rounds Marion (Mike) Michael RoundsHillicon Valley: Facebook launches 'News Tab' | Senate passes bill to take on 'deepfakes' | Schumer outlines vision for electric cars Senate passes legislation to combat 'deepfake' videos America's newest comedy troupe: House GOP MORE (R-S.D.).

Rounds said this message was communicated to Trump at a meeting on Capitol Hill this past week.

“I think it was well received by the president,” he said.

Republicans say that Trump’s complaints about lack of accomplishments in Congress, such as the failure to pass legislation to repeal and replace ObamaCare, have overshadowed accomplishments, such as passing a $1.5 trillion tax cut last year.

“When I sit down with a small group of Republicans in Tennessee, they say, ‘Why don’t you guys do anything?’ ” said Sen. Lamar Alexander Andrew (Lamar) Lamar AlexanderPelosi aide hopeful White House will support drug-pricing bill despite criticism Overnight Energy: BLM staff face choice of relocation or resignation as agency moves | Trump says he's 'very much into climate' | EPA rule would expand limits on scientific studies Juan Williams: Republicans flee Trump MORE (R-Tenn.).

Alexander said he has gotten so many questions and complaints about the ObamaCare failure he has printed out cards that he hands to constituents that list all the accomplishments of the 115th Congress.

They include tax reform, confirming 21 circuit court judges, opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, repealing ObamaCare’s individual mandate and using the Congressional Review Act to repeal 14 Obama-era federal regulations.

Sen. John Hoeven John Henry HoevenBottom Line Poll: McConnell is most unpopular senator McConnell ups pressure on White House to get a budget deal MORE (R-N.D.) did Alexander one better and gave Trump one of those cards during his meeting with the GOP conference.

Alexander told Trump that Republicans’ chances of keeping control of the Senate and House after November will depend on him rallying the base.

That means touting its accomplishments, not panning it for the backlog of executive and judicial branch nominations or stalemate on immigration.

“He has the biggest megaphone and the more he talks about that, the better off we think we are,” he said.

Republicans have a slim 51-49 majority in the Senate and hope to expand it as Democrats must defend 26 seats in November while Republicans have to worry about only nine.

But Democrats have hopes of seizing the majority because the president’s party tends to fare badly in the first midterm election and polls show them leading Republicans by an average of 5 points on the generic ballot.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellGOP senators balk at lengthy impeachment trial Graham: Senate trial 'must expose the whistleblower' Graham says Schiff should be a witness in Trump impeachment trial MORE (R-Ky.) warned on Thursday that control of the chamber is “absolutely” up for grabs.

GOP strategists think Senate Republicans are right to ask Trump to be more positive.

“One, Trump has great clout with the Republican base. Two, hammering Republicans [in Congress] undermines their central argument in the midterm election, which is, ‘the president needs reinforcements — look at the great results, he needs more Republicans not Democrats,’ ” said Republican strategist Ford O’Connell.

Trump’s approval rating has climbed in recent months.

Gallup reported it reached an 11-month high at the end of April, with 42 percent of respondents nationwide saying they liked the job he was doing.

A CNN poll released earlier this month found his job approval rating at 41 percent, with 53 percent disapproving.

While more people disapprove than approve of Trump’s job performance, he’s doing significantly better in the public’s opinion than Congress.

A Gallup poll conducted earlier this month showed Congress with a 17 percent job approval rating.

Strategists say Trump will be key to turning out Republican voters in November.

“The megaphone that President Trump has to fire up the base and get them to vote on election day is crucial for Republicans to win,” said Ron Bonjean, a strategist and former Senate GOP leadership aide.

He noted that Republicans held onto the Senate majority in 2016, despite predictions that Democrats would win back control, because of Trump’s ability to motivate voters.

''
“ If Senate Republicans don ’ t get rid of the Filibuster Rule and go to a 51 % majority , few bills will be passed . 8 Dems control the Senate ! ” Trump tweeted .
The president repeatedly has pressed Senate GOP leaders to change the rules so controversial legislation can pass with a simple majority , as opposed to 60 votes .
The president ’ s tweet comes amid a feud with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell . The tension began when McConnell criticized the president for having “ excessive expectations ” about the legislative process , after Congress failed to deliver the votes on a plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare ahead of their August recess . Trump said he was “ very disappointed in Mitch , ” and reportedly had a “ profane shouting match ” over the phone on August 9 .
Both the White House and McConnell have publicly attempted to ease the tensions to portray unity between the GOP leader and the president .
TRUMP SLAMS MCCONNELL , RYAN , CLAPPER , THE 'FAKE NEWS ' IN SERIES OF TWEETS
McConnell is likely reluctant to pursue a change in the filibuster rules for legislation , mindful that the move could hurt his own party whenever Democrats are in control . Further , it 's unclear whether the rule change would help Trump pass health care legislation , as the last bill to fail was not subject to the 60-vote standard .

“If Senate Republicans don’t get rid of the Filibuster Rule and go to a 51% majority, few bills will be passed. 8 Dems control the Senate!” Trump tweeted.

The president repeatedly has pressed Senate GOP leaders to change the rules so controversial legislation can pass with a simple majority, as opposed to 60 votes.

The president’s tweet comes amid a feud with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The tension began when McConnell criticized the president for having “excessive expectations” about the legislative process, after Congress failed to deliver the votes on a plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare ahead of their August recess. Trump said he was “very disappointed in Mitch,” and reportedly had a “profane shouting match” over the phone on August 9.

Both the White House and McConnell have publicly attempted to ease the tensions to portray unity between the GOP leader and the president.

TRUMP SLAMS MCCONNELL, RYAN, CLAPPER, THE 'FAKE NEWS' IN SERIES OF TWEETS

McConnell is likely reluctant to pursue a change in the filibuster rules for legislation, mindful that the move could hurt his own party whenever Democrats are in control. Further, it's unclear whether the rule change would help Trump pass health care legislation, as the last bill to fail was not subject to the 60-vote standard.

Minutes after his first tweet of the day, the president also went on to praise his new chief of staff, former Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who took his post in the White House last month amid a White House staff shake-up.

Oklahoma 's two Republican senators , Jim Inhofe and Tom Coburn , opposed a bill that provided more than $ 60 billion in emergency aid after Superstorm Sandy devastated the East Coast . In addition , three members of Oklahoma 's House delegation joined with most Republicans in opposing the legislation .
Nearly all of the lawmakers have pledged that whatever assistance Oklahomans need will be provided , but the devil will be in the details .
Coburn , who opposed the Sandy bill because it did not identify spending cuts to offset the cost of the legislation , said in the immediate aftermath of the tornado that he would `` absolutely '' demand spending cuts in exchange for aid .
A spokesman for Coburn confirmed this morning that he would not change his position on demanding spending cuts in order to fund disaster aid .
Other Republicans opposed what they considered to be unrelated spending in the Sandy bill .
`` When a disaster occurs in America and emotions are high , everybody all of a sudden wants to pour money on it , '' Inhofe said on the Senate floor in 2012 .
Asked about his past vote against Sandy funding , Inhofe said that funding for tornado relief would be `` totally different . ''
`` That was totally different , '' Inhofe said on MSNBC this morning . `` They were getting things -- for instance , that was supposed to be for New Jersey . They had things in the Virgin Islands . They were fixing roads there . They were putting roofs on houses in Washington , D.C . ''
`` Everybody was getting in and exploiting the tragedy that took place . That wo n't happen in Oklahoma , '' he added .
But the $ 60.4 Sandy relief bill , which languished in Congress because of opposition from Republican lawmakers , may be a cautionary tale .

republican_party,Daily Beast,0,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/05/22/how-the-gop-went-south.html,How the GOP Went South,2016-05-22,"Matt Lewis, Senior Columnist","By joining the Republican Party , once hated in Dixie for being the party of Lincoln and subsequent carpetbaggers , the South helped transform the GOP into the dominant national party for decades .
The conservative movement ’ s founders might have been intellectuals and the GOP establishment once might have been Northeastern elites , but that arrangement was always tenuous . When Willie Sutton was asked why he robbed banks , the infamous outlaw supposedly replied , “ Because that ’ s where the money is. ” Likewise , anyone who seeks to understand why conservatism became what it is can only expect this answer : “ Because that ’ s where the votes were. ” Indeed , after the 2014 midterms , almost half of the Republican congressional delegation represented Southern districts . But what happens when you build your political coalition around a constituency that is no longer sufficient ? What is more , what happens when appeasing your base and growing your coalition become mutually exclusive goals ?
Times change , and yesterday ’ s solution becomes tomorrow ’ s challenge . Such is the case with today ’ s GOP and the South . The South helped fuel Richard Nixon ’ s romp over George McGovern and Ronald Reagan ’ s 49—1 rout of Walter Mondale . It did its part in saving us from a President Dukakis or Kerry . It would be hard to overestimate the importance of the GOP aligning with Southern values . Redskins coach George Allen was famous for saying , “ The future is now. ” Sometimes , to borrow a phrase from Donald Rumsfeld , you go to war with the army you have . That ’ s the tradeoff Republicans made , and it was perfectly rational . But there were also unintended consequences . A political party inevitably reflects its constituents ’ attitudes and biases . The notion that any party can change its voter base without changing its philosophy and its politicians is naive ; pandering inevitably becomes a self‑fulfilling prophecy . Republicans captured the South , yes , but the South also captured the GOP .
The addition of the South and rural communities in states like South Carolina , Alabama , and Mississippi as a reliable bloc of the Republican coalition was one of the many factors leading to the GOP ’ s image as both the stupid party and the party of white men with Confederate flag stickers on the backs of their trucks . This may not be fair—it certainly plays to stereotypes . But that hardly matters . Today , this is increasingly seen as a liability .
You ’ ve probably heard of the Southern strategy , but you might not know exactly what it means or how the Republican Party allegedly employed it . The Southern strategy , as Mike Allen defined it in The W a shin g to n Post , “ described Republican efforts to use race as a wedge issue—on matters such as desegregation and busing—to appeal to white Southern voters . ”
Whether you believe this was an overt scheme or just how things shook out , this much is true : at some point around 1972 , the once reliably solid Democratic South became a Republican stronghold . We may differ about what this means and about whether the GOP deserves culpability for stirring up racial animus to achieve it . But the key takeaway is that the addition of the South to the Republican fold , followed by the party ’ s abandonment of urban areas , the northeast , and then the Pacific Coast dramatically changed the face of conservatism—and not just because it fairly or not associated the GOP with segregationists—an ironic turn of events for the party of Lincoln .
It helps to consider just who the Southerners who joined the GOP in the ’ 60s were . Viewed in the most negative light , they were segregationists who felt betrayed when Democrats like Lyndon Johnson pursued the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ( which Barry Goldwater opposed ) . It would also be fair to say that , putting aside the race issue , these Southern Democrats also saw the degree to which the American Left was lurching in a radical cultural direction and jumped ship . “ Nixon won the South , ” wrote his former aide Pat Buchanan , “ not because he agreed with them on civil rights—he never did—but because he shared the patriotic values of the South and its antipathy to liberal hypocrisy . ”
While some on the Right want to downplay the race angle , others on the Left suggest that the entire success of the modern GOP was premised on exploiting Southern racism . Interestingly , though , much of what both sides t h i n k we know about this trend appears to be wrong . Elections analyst Sean Trende recently argued that “ while the dominant narrative continues to insist that the South began to realign toward the Republicans in the wake of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , in fact , Southern loyalties had begun to weaken during the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt. ” As evidence , Trende notes that the South voted increasingly Republican every year of FDR ’ s presidency , and that although Eisenhower lost Dixie , he did so by only t h r e e points . What is more , while Eisenhower was gaining support in the South , he was simultaneously pushing civil rights legislation . So why did the South become increasingly Republican starting in the 1940s ? According to Trende , “ Southern whites simply became wealthy enough to start voting Republican. ” This , of course , flies in the face of everything we think we know about why the South became solidly Republican . This is not to suggest that race wasn ’ t involved in the shift that really began to reach a tipping point after the ’ 60s , but it does suggest that history is more complex than the R e ader ’ s Digest ( or , rather , the M ot h er Jones ) version many of us are taught in school .
S o u th e r n D o m i n a t i on
After the post—Civil Rights Act “ Dixiecrat ” shift , economics and air‑conditioning conspired to send American voters fleeing the Rust Belt for the Sun Belt , further eroding the power of the Northeast Republican establishment , personified by the New York governors and presidential aspirants Thomas Dewey and Nelson Rockefeller . ( This is a trend that is still under way ; according to the U.S. census , the city of Austin , Texas—the liberal enclave in a deeply red state—was , by far , the fastest growing city in America from 2010 to 2013 . ) It ’ s unwise to write off an entire swath of the nation , but that ’ s just what Barry Goldwater , who represented Arizona in the U.S. Senate , seemed to do when he declared that “ sometimes I think the country would be better off if we could just saw off the Eastern seaboard and let it float out to sea. ” The Johnson campaign turned that line into a devastating ad in which the eastern side of a U.S. map , floating in water , is literally sawed off .
Truth be told , the South ’ s influence came to dominate both parties . Democrats soon saw that the only way they could win would be to cut into the GOP ’ s base . For a while , it looked like the only path to Democratic victory was through nominating a son of the South . From Texan Lyndon Johnson to Georgia peanut farmer Jimmy Carter to Arkansas ’ s Bill Clinton ( and even to , yes , Al Gore ) , seemingly only Southern Democrats could win the White House—and even that trend was not very recent ; consider Virginia‑born segregationist Woodrow Wilson or Harry Truman , the descendants of slaveholders and Confederate sympathizers , or even Warm Springs , Georgia , resident FDR . In the post‑Reagan years , Southerners so dominated both parties that at one point , we had a president from Arkansas ( Clinton ) , a vice president from Tennessee ( Gore ) , a Majority Leader from Mississippi ( Trent Lott ) , and a House Speaker from Georgia ( Newt Gingrich ) . The chairman of the GOP was Haley Barbour , from Mississippi . President George W. Bush of Texas , Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee , and House Majority Leaders Dick Armey and Tom DeLay ( Texans ) soon followed in what was , perhaps , the apex of Southern domination of the GOP , and simultaneously , of Republican triumphalism . Talk circulated that the GOP had achieved a “ permanent governing majority . ”
All the while , Southern Republicanism , having descended from Southern Democrats , churned out culturally conservative , yet big‑spending , governmental policies . In the 2000s , deficits ballooned and unfunded entitlements like Medicare Part D were enacted . Meanwhile , some of the GOP ’ s most prominent Southern governors also played to type . In 2008 , the fiscally conservative Club for Growth issued a white paper slamming then Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee for having raised sales taxes , state spending , and the minimum wage . And then it all came crashing down . Republicans forfeited their congressional majority in 2006 , victims of a faltering war in Iraq , incompetent handling of Hurricane Katrina , mounting debt , and a slew of corruption and sex scandals that exploded just in time for the midterms . Presidents almost always suffer bad second‑term midterms , but George W. Bush ’ s mishandling of so many high‑profile issues undoubtedly exacerbated voters ’ “ Bush fatigue. ” Simply put , the Bush shtick had worn thin .
Ronald Reagan downplayed his intellectual and cosmopolitan credentials to accentuate his everyman persona . In similar fashion , Dwight Eisenhower , the former supreme commander of Allied forces in Europe and president of Columbia University , dodged questions by employing bumbling answers at press conferences . “ In public he wore a costume of affability , optimism , and farm‑boy charm , ” wrote David Brooks in The Road to Character . “ As president , he was perfectly willing to appear stupider than he really was if it would help him perform his assigned role . He was willing to appear tongue‑tied if it would help him conceal his true designs. ” Biographer Andrew Sinclair said much the same thing about the much‑maligned Warren Harding ’ s “ mute your own horn ” leadership style . In this regard , George W. Bush simply followed a long‑standing tradition—albeit with a Texas twang . Tevi Troy , the former Bush aide who authored W h a t Jefferson Read , Ike Watched , and Obama Tweeted , believes that “ Bush probably read more history than [ Jack ] Kennedy. ” If that sounds absurd , it ’ s partly because Kennedy highlighted his intellectual credentials , while the Yale‑educated Bush downplayed his . As a result , we consider Kennedy ( no dummy , but no genius , either ) smarter . Is this only the result of a liberal media painting Republicans as illiterate Babbitts ? Hardly . “ To be fair , ” Troy writes , “ Bush was not blameless in acquiring a reputation for not reading . ”
Playing down his Ivy League credentials helped him get elected governor of Texas and president of the United States—two times each—but the cost was being treated like a bumpkin by the media .
In 2000 , the N e w York Times ’ Nicholas Kristoff wrote that Kent Hance believes he “ helped teach Mr. Bush the need to be more folksy. ” As Mr. Hance put it , “ He wasn ’ t going to be out‑Christianed or out‑good‑old‑boyed again. ” If this is true ( and one suspects it is ) , then it ’ s hard to fault Bush for doing what he h a d to do to win . And let ’ s not forget that he wasn ’ t just trying to forge his own comeback ; he was also attempting to avenge his father ’ s defeat at the hands of Bill Clinton in 1992 . What is more , his father , former President George H. W. Bush , had been mocked as a tax‑raiser and a preppy wimp . George W. Bush did everything possible to be the opposite of that . The adoption of the Texas persona helped , but the younger Bush overswaggered and overtwanged . But hey , he managed to win two elections , and winning is everything , right ?
The younger Bush might have benefited from being “ misunder‑estimated ” by his adversaries , but the “ bumpkin ” label stuck to the rest of us . To the extent conservatives are now associated with this stereotype , one wonders to what degree this was self‑inflicted by past w innin g Republican leaders who posed as the bumbling everyman , going all the way back to Ike .
The problem was , although this is a bipartisan phenomenon , it just happens to have disproportionately impacted the Right . Again , Republicans are thought of as the stupid party . Both sides of the political aisle occasionally genuflect at the altar of rural superiority , even if Republicans are decidedly better at it . Although President Obama ’ s appeal to urbanites and minorities is obvious , he is not above the affectation of droppin ’ his gs and prattlin ’ on about “ folks. ” Likewise , prep school—bred John Kerry ( “ Can I get me a hunting license here ? ” ) experimented with some downright , down‑home Forrest Gump elocution during his 2004 race . Hillary Clinton has been known to affect a Southern accent when convenient . Even less subtle was the over‑the‑top , twangy country music song “ Stand With Hillary ” released in late 2014— “ Put your boots on and let ’ s smash this ceilin ’ ” —where all the gs were dropped . The producer of the “ Stand With Hillary ” song also produced a 2008 viral mariachi video , “ Viva Obama. ” Nothing happens by accident in politics . Hillary ’ s pandering is a transparent attempt to woo the “ real America. ” Noting the dichotomy between Obama ’ s pop‑culture outreach—which featured the Will.I.Am song “ Yes We Can ” and Hillary ’ s—Ben Domenech , publisher of The Federalist website , observed , “ The attempt to pander to the white working class voters left out by the Democratic agenda for so many years is obvious and clumsy , but also revealing , signaling their perception of what ’ s happened to the electorate in the course of the Obama era . ”
For all the GOP ’ s problems , it is perhaps instructive to remember that Democrats also face their own challenges , which include struggles to win white votes—and their own gender gap with men . Putting aside politics , the notion that America should have one de facto white party and one de facto minority party strikes me as unhealthy . We should all resist this sort of racial balkanization . And , of course , just as Republicans confront regional geographic problems , the Democrats missed winning the White House in 2000 , at least partly because Al Gore couldn ’ t deliver his home state of Tennessee . Just a dozen years ago , former senator Zell Miller , a conservative Democrat , penned a book titled A National Party No More , lamenting the fact that his beloved party had written off the South , and would continue to pay an electoral price . “ Today , our national Democratic leaders look south and say , ‘ I see one‑third of a nation and it can go to hell , ’ ” he wrote . This is a good example of how political fortunes can quickly change . Just as Miller ’ s book hasn ’ t aged well ( electorally speaking , the Democrats seem to have made the right political moves ) , a dozen years from now t h i s book might seem antiquated . I won ’ t be at all upset if that happens . Still , almost all the long‑term trends ( including demographic shifts and shifts in public opinion ) seem to suggest the GOP is in trouble if it doesn ’ t adapt and overcome .
The Republican electoral shift transcends the deep South . While the GOP became the Southern Party , it also became the Rural Party . That ’ s a big part of this story , too .
In the introduction of this book , I wrote about my rural background in western Maryland and the deep abiding respect I have for rural Americans who have done much to make this a great country . I don ’ t want to see an America where everyone is huddled into cities . In the words of Hank Williams Jr. , we need Americans who still know how to “ skin a buck ” and “ run a trotline. ” But one of the many challenges confronting conservatives is that America has transitioned from the agrarian age to the industrial age to the information age . Unlike the industrial age , where the top‑down assembly line model favored liberals , the tech revolution may favor the rugged individualism embraced by libertarian‑leaning conservatives . Regardless , given these trends , it makes little sense for a movement or a party to allow the rural‑versus‑urban paradigm—and the many cultural issues tied up in that—to define and assign membership status . So long as Republicans could win this way , it made perfect sense to exploit the cleavage between city folks and “ Real America. ” Not only was this smart politics , but it also tapped into deep‑seated beliefs .
So where did this traditional deification of rural areas come from ?

F re e Market Dynamists versus Populist C a t a s t r o p h i s t s
This brings us to a contradiction within conservatism . Much of conservatism—a belief in free markets , for instance—is premised on the dynamic notion that more people equal more ideas . But while optimistic free marketeers adhering to this Reagan and Kemp model subscribe to this theory , most populists do not . The more optimistic worldview made major strides when economists like Julian Simon and Ester Boserup took on the Malthusian catastrophe argument , which erroneously predicted that global overpopulation would lead to mass starvation , and demonstrated that more people equals more ideas , innovation , and prosperity . When you think about it , it makes sense . Rural societies tend to work on subsistence ( you eat what you grow— be careful what you wish for , “ local foods ” advocates ! ) , but cities , by their very nature , demand free market economic skills such as cooperation , specialization , and trade . These things make us rich . And cities are the areas where these things are appreciated and magnified . And let us not forget that great cities , after all , not only have fostered great hedge funds , but have also built great cathedrals stone by stone .
More people—constantly bumping into one another—lead to all sorts of entrepreneurial inventions and progress . Cities , it has been said , are where “ ideas have sex. ” Indeed , some optimistic cosmopolitan conservatives , such as the late Jack Kemp and his protégé , Wisconsin representative and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan , have embraced a pro‑urban philosophy in a consistent manner , which can be reflected in their support for policies like enterprise zones , which encourage growth and development with lower taxes and fewer regulations in urban communities . But since President Obama ’ s election in 2008 , these ideas have been on the outs with conservatives .
The greatest irony of the conservative adoption of an anticity worldview is that it is based largely on a philosophy advanced by the high priest of romanticism , Jean‑Jacques Rousseau . Instead of following the Christian understanding of creation that views man as a fallen creature due to original sin , Rousseau envisioned early man as a sort of noble savage . It wasn ’ t until man recognized the concept of property and ownership , Rousseau argued , that he became greedy and corrupted .
According to this way of thinking , a simple life is good and pure , while a modern urban life is dirty and unnatural . “ Many scholars have pointed out the romanticists ’ idea that somehow cities are breeders of sinful behavior and people who live in the country are more virtuous is actually something that ’ s been passed into the American psyche and actually into the American Christian psyche so that we have a tendency to have a very negative view of cities , ” says Pastor Tim Keller .

— L y n y r d Skynyrd

By joining the Republican Party, once hated in Dixie for being the party of Lincoln and subsequent carpetbaggers, the South helped transform the GOP into the dominant national party for decades.

The conservative movement’s founders might have been intellectuals and the GOP establishment once might have been Northeastern elites, but that arrangement was always tenuous. When Willie Sutton was asked why he robbed banks, the infamous outlaw supposedly replied, “Because that’s where the money is.” Likewise, anyone who seeks to understand why conservatism became what it is can only expect this answer: “Because that’s where the votes were.” Indeed, after the 2014 midterms, almost half of the Republican congressional delegation represented Southern districts. But what happens when you build your political coalition around a constituency that is no longer sufficient? What is more, what happens when appeasing your base and growing your coalition become mutually exclusive goals?

Times change, and yesterday’s solution becomes tomorrow’s challenge. Such is the case with today’s GOP and the South. The South helped fuel Richard Nixon’s romp over George McGovern and Ronald Reagan’s 49—1 rout of Walter Mondale. It did its part in saving us from a President Dukakis or Kerry. It would be hard to overestimate the importance of the GOP aligning with Southern values. Redskins coach George Allen was famous for saying, “The future is now.” Sometimes, to borrow a phrase from Donald Rumsfeld, you go to war with the army you have. That’s the tradeoff Republicans made, and it was perfectly rational. But there were also unintended consequences. A political party inevitably reflects its constituents’ attitudes and biases. The notion that any party can change its voter base without changing its philosophy and its politicians is naive; pandering inevitably becomes a self‑fulfilling prophecy. Republicans captured the South, yes, but the South also captured the GOP.

The addition of the South and rural communities in states like South Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi as a reliable bloc of the Republican coalition was one of the many factors leading to the GOP’s image as both the stupid party and the party of white men with Confederate flag stickers on the backs of their trucks. This may not be fair—it certainly plays to stereotypes. But that hardly matters. Today, this is increasingly seen as a liability.

The Southern Strategy

You’ve probably heard of the Southern strategy, but you might not know exactly what it means or how the Republican Party allegedly employed it. The Southern strategy, as Mike Allen defined it in The W a shin g to n Post, “described Republican efforts to use race as a wedge issue—on matters such as desegregation and busing—to appeal to white Southern voters.”

Whether you believe this was an overt scheme or just how things shook out, this much is true: at some point around 1972, the once reliably solid Democratic South became a Republican stronghold. We may differ about what this means and about whether the GOP deserves culpability for stirring up racial animus to achieve it. But the key takeaway is that the addition of the South to the Republican fold, followed by the party’s abandonment of urban areas, the northeast, and then the Pacific Coast dramatically changed the face of conservatism—and not just because it fairly or not associated the GOP with segregationists—an ironic turn of events for the party of Lincoln.

It helps to consider just who the Southerners who joined the GOP in the ’60s were. Viewed in the most negative light, they were segregationists who felt betrayed when Democrats like Lyndon Johnson pursued the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (which Barry Goldwater opposed). It would also be fair to say that, putting aside the race issue, these Southern Democrats also saw the degree to which the American Left was lurching in a radical cultural direction and jumped ship. “Nixon won the South,” wrote his former aide Pat Buchanan, “not because he agreed with them on civil rights—he never did—but because he shared the patriotic values of the South and its antipathy to liberal hypocrisy.”

While some on the Right want to downplay the race angle, others on the Left suggest that the entire success of the modern GOP was premised on exploiting Southern racism. Interestingly, though, much of what both sides t h i n k we know about this trend appears to be wrong. Elections analyst Sean Trende recently argued that “while the dominant narrative continues to insist that the South began to realign toward the Republicans in the wake of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in fact, Southern loyalties had begun to weaken during the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt.” As evidence, Trende notes that the South voted increasingly Republican every year of FDR’s presidency, and that although Eisenhower lost Dixie, he did so by only t h r e e points. What is more, while Eisenhower was gaining support in the South, he was simultaneously pushing civil rights legislation. So why did the South become increasingly Republican starting in the 1940s? According to Trende, “Southern whites simply became wealthy enough to start voting Republican.” This, of course, flies in the face of everything we think we know about why the South became solidly Republican. This is not to suggest that race wasn’t involved in the shift that really began to reach a tipping point after the ’60s, but it does suggest that history is more complex than the R e ader’s Digest (or, rather, the M ot h er Jones) version many of us are taught in school.

S o u th e r n D o m i n a t i on

After the post—Civil Rights Act “Dixiecrat” shift, economics and air‑conditioning conspired to send American voters fleeing the Rust Belt for the Sun Belt, further eroding the power of the Northeast Republican establishment, personified by the New York governors and presidential aspirants Thomas Dewey and Nelson Rockefeller. (This is a trend that is still under way; according to the U.S. census, the city of Austin, Texas—the liberal enclave in a deeply red state—was, by far, the fastest growing city in America from 2010 to 2013.) It’s unwise to write off an entire swath of the nation, but that’s just what Barry Goldwater, who represented Arizona in the U.S. Senate, seemed to do when he declared that “sometimes I think the country would be better off if we could just saw off the Eastern seaboard and let it float out to sea.” The Johnson campaign turned that line into a devastating ad in which the eastern side of a U.S. map, floating in water, is literally sawed off.

Truth be told, the South’s influence came to dominate both parties. Democrats soon saw that the only way they could win would be to cut into the GOP’s base. For a while, it looked like the only path to Democratic victory was through nominating a son of the South. From Texan Lyndon Johnson to Georgia peanut farmer Jimmy Carter to Arkansas’s Bill Clinton (and even to, yes, Al Gore), seemingly only Southern Democrats could win the White House—and even that trend was not very recent; consider Virginia‑born segregationist Woodrow Wilson or Harry Truman, the descendants of slaveholders and Confederate sympathizers, or even Warm Springs, Georgia, resident FDR. In the post‑Reagan years, Southerners so dominated both parties that at one point, we had a president from Arkansas (Clinton), a vice president from Tennessee (Gore), a Majority Leader from Mississippi (Trent Lott), and a House Speaker from Georgia (Newt Gingrich). The chairman of the GOP was Haley Barbour, from Mississippi. President George W. Bush of Texas, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee, and House Majority Leaders Dick Armey and Tom DeLay (Texans) soon followed in what was, perhaps, the apex of Southern domination of the GOP, and simultaneously, of Republican triumphalism. Talk circulated that the GOP had achieved a “permanent governing majority.”

All the while, Southern Republicanism, having descended from Southern Democrats, churned out culturally conservative, yet big‑spending, governmental policies. In the 2000s, deficits ballooned and unfunded entitlements like Medicare Part D were enacted. Meanwhile, some of the GOP’s most prominent Southern governors also played to type. In 2008, the fiscally conservative Club for Growth issued a white paper slamming then Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee for having raised sales taxes, state spending, and the minimum wage. And then it all came crashing down. Republicans forfeited their congressional majority in 2006, victims of a faltering war in Iraq, incompetent handling of Hurricane Katrina, mounting debt, and a slew of corruption and sex scandals that exploded just in time for the midterms. Presidents almost always suffer bad second‑term midterms, but George W. Bush’s mishandling of so many high‑profile issues undoubtedly exacerbated voters’ “Bush fatigue.” Simply put, the Bush shtick had worn thin.

A “Stupid” Stereotype

Ronald Reagan downplayed his intellectual and cosmopolitan credentials to accentuate his everyman persona. In similar fashion, Dwight Eisenhower, the former supreme commander of Allied forces in Europe and president of Columbia University, dodged questions by employing bumbling answers at press conferences. “In public he wore a costume of affability, optimism, and farm‑boy charm,” wrote David Brooks in The Road to Character. “As president, he was perfectly willing to appear stupider than he really was if it would help him perform his assigned role. He was willing to appear tongue‑tied if it would help him conceal his true designs.” Biographer Andrew Sinclair said much the same thing about the much‑maligned Warren Harding’s “mute your own horn” leadership style. In this regard, George W. Bush simply followed a long‑standing tradition—albeit with a Texas twang. Tevi Troy, the former Bush aide who authored W h a t Jefferson Read, Ike Watched, and Obama Tweeted, believes that “Bush probably read more history than [Jack] Kennedy.” If that sounds absurd, it’s partly because Kennedy highlighted his intellectual credentials, while the Yale‑educated Bush downplayed his. As a result, we consider Kennedy (no dummy, but no genius, either) smarter. Is this only the result of a liberal media painting Republicans as illiterate Babbitts? Hardly. “To be fair,” Troy writes, “Bush was not blameless in acquiring a reputation for not reading.”

Playing down his Ivy League credentials helped him get elected governor of Texas and president of the United States—two times each—but the cost was being treated like a bumpkin by the media.

In 2000, the N e w York Times’ Nicholas Kristoff wrote that Kent Hance believes he “helped teach Mr. Bush the need to be more folksy.” As Mr. Hance put it, “He wasn’t going to be out‑Christianed or out‑good‑old‑boyed again.” If this is true (and one suspects it is), then it’s hard to fault Bush for doing what he h a d to do to win. And let’s not forget that he wasn’t just trying to forge his own comeback; he was also attempting to avenge his father’s defeat at the hands of Bill Clinton in 1992. What is more, his father, former President George H. W. Bush, had been mocked as a tax‑raiser and a preppy wimp. George W. Bush did everything possible to be the opposite of that. The adoption of the Texas persona helped, but the younger Bush overswaggered and overtwanged. But hey, he managed to win two elections, and winning is everything, right?

The younger Bush might have benefited from being “misunder‑estimated” by his adversaries, but the “bumpkin” label stuck to the rest of us. To the extent conservatives are now associated with this stereotype, one wonders to what degree this was self‑inflicted by past w innin g Republican leaders who posed as the bumbling everyman, going all the way back to Ike.

The problem was, although this is a bipartisan phenomenon, it just happens to have disproportionately impacted the Right. Again, Republicans are thought of as the stupid party. Both sides of the political aisle occasionally genuflect at the altar of rural superiority, even if Republicans are decidedly better at it. Although President Obama’s appeal to urbanites and minorities is obvious, he is not above the affectation of droppin’ his gs and prattlin’ on about “folks.” Likewise, prep school—bred John Kerry (“Can I get me a hunting license here?”) experimented with some downright, down‑home Forrest Gump elocution during his 2004 race. Hillary Clinton has been known to affect a Southern accent when convenient. Even less subtle was the over‑the‑top, twangy country music song “Stand With Hillary” released in late 2014—“Put your boots on and let’s smash this ceilin’ ”—where all the gs were dropped. The producer of the “Stand With Hillary” song also produced a 2008 viral mariachi video, “Viva Obama.” Nothing happens by accident in politics. Hillary’s pandering is a transparent attempt to woo the “real America.” Noting the dichotomy between Obama’s pop‑culture outreach—which featured the Will.I.Am song “Yes We Can” and Hillary’s—Ben Domenech, publisher of The Federalist website, observed, “The attempt to pander to the white working class voters left out by the Democratic agenda for so many years is obvious and clumsy, but also revealing, signaling their perception of what’s happened to the electorate in the course of the Obama era.”

For all the GOP’s problems, it is perhaps instructive to remember that Democrats also face their own challenges, which include struggles to win white votes—and their own gender gap with men. Putting aside politics, the notion that America should have one de facto white party and one de facto minority party strikes me as unhealthy. We should all resist this sort of racial balkanization. And, of course, just as Republicans confront regional geographic problems, the Democrats missed winning the White House in 2000, at least partly because Al Gore couldn’t deliver his home state of Tennessee. Just a dozen years ago, former senator Zell Miller, a conservative Democrat, penned a book titled A National Party No More, lamenting the fact that his beloved party had written off the South, and would continue to pay an electoral price. “Today, our national Democratic leaders look south and say, ‘I see one‑third of a nation and it can go to hell,’ ” he wrote. This is a good example of how political fortunes can quickly change. Just as Miller’s book hasn’t aged well (electorally speaking, the Democrats seem to have made the right political moves), a dozen years from now t h i s book might seem antiquated. I won’t be at all upset if that happens. Still, almost all the long‑term trends (including demographic shifts and shifts in public opinion) seem to suggest the GOP is in trouble if it doesn’t adapt and overcome.

R u r a l Deification

The Republican electoral shift transcends the deep South. While the GOP became the Southern Party, it also became the Rural Party. That’s a big part of this story, too.

In the introduction of this book, I wrote about my rural background in western Maryland and the deep abiding respect I have for rural Americans who have done much to make this a great country. I don’t want to see an America where everyone is huddled into cities. In the words of Hank Williams Jr., we need Americans who still know how to “skin a buck” and “run a trotline.” But one of the many challenges confronting conservatives is that America has transitioned from the agrarian age to the industrial age to the information age. Unlike the industrial age, where the top‑down assembly line model favored liberals, the tech revolution may favor the rugged individualism embraced by libertarian‑leaning conservatives. Regardless, given these trends, it makes little sense for a movement or a party to allow the rural‑versus‑urban paradigm—and the many cultural issues tied up in that—to define and assign membership status. So long as Republicans could win this way, it made perfect sense to exploit the cleavage between city folks and “Real America.” Not only was this smart politics, but it also tapped into deep‑seated beliefs.

So where did this traditional deification of rural areas come from? Among other things, credit (or blame) the influence of religion (think the Garden of Eden versus the Tower of Babel), philosophy (Rousseau’s notion about noble savages, and later, transcendentalists like Ralph Waldo Emerson—and Walden Woods-loving Henry David Thoreau), and various ideas conceived during the time of America’s founding, such as Thomas Jefferson’s agrarianism. “I think our governments will remain virtuous for many centuries,” Jefferson wrote Madison, “as long as they are chiefly agricultural; and this will be as long as there shall be vacant lands in any part of America. When they get piled upon one another in large cities, as in Europe, they will become corrupt as in Europe.” This was bipartisan. Believe it or not, in the run‑up to his 1932 election, Groton‑ and Harvard‑educated Franklin Roosevelt enjoyed far more support from rural and Southern voters than with big‑city types—and painted himself not as a former Wall Street lawyer but rather as a simple “farmer.”

It’s hard to deny that Americans—particularly traditional or conservative Americans—internalized a worldview that lionizes rural areas and comes close to demonizing urban ones. Look no further than our national myths and heroes. Alan Crawford, author of the 1980 book Thunder on the Right, argued that it all goes back to the cowboy mythology. “The great cult figure of the New Right is John Wayne,” he writes, “the swaggering, tough‑talking loner motivated by duty, principle, and a deep sense of justice. Wayne feared no man, respected all women. He displayed the ma cho qualities that are admired and emulated in the political and cultural heroes of the New Right.” Top that, pil gr i m!

The entire concept of rural superiority is built on questionable premises. Sometimes the Bible holds up desolate areas as ideal (Jesus would often withdraw to the wilderness or desert), but as Tim Keller, pastor of New York City’s Redeemer Presbyterian Church, notes, “When God sends the people of Israel from Egypt into Canaan, he will not let them be exclusively agrarian. He commands them to build cities in the book of Numbers.”

“The reason [the Bible is] positive about cities,” continues Keller, “is that when God made Adam and Eve creative . . . it was inevitable that they would build cities. Cities are places of creativity. Cities are places where culture is forged. That’s the reason why culture does not begin to happen until there’s a city.”

For small government conservatives, even before the plague of inner‑city crime in the ’60s, there were other inherent reasons to fear the city. As Steven Conn, author of A m e r i c a ns Against the City: Anti- Urbanism in the Twentieth Century, noted, “The idea that in New York City now eight million people can turn on their tap and get drinkable water, that’s a miracle. The efficiencies that government manages to deliver in cities become anathema to this kind of antigovernment tradition that I see as part and parcel of the anti‑urban tradition.”

F re e Market Dynamists versus Populist C a t a s t r o p h i s t s

This brings us to a contradiction within conservatism. Much of conservatism—a belief in free markets, for instance—is premised on the dynamic notion that more people equal more ideas. But while optimistic free marketeers adhering to this Reagan and Kemp model subscribe to this theory, most populists do not. The more optimistic worldview made major strides when economists like Julian Simon and Ester Boserup took on the Malthusian catastrophe argument, which erroneously predicted that global overpopulation would lead to mass starvation, and demonstrated that more people equals more ideas, innovation, and prosperity. When you think about it, it makes sense. Rural societies tend to work on subsistence (you eat what you grow— be careful what you wish for, “local foods” advocates!), but cities, by their very nature, demand free market economic skills such as cooperation, specialization, and trade. These things make us rich. And cities are the areas where these things are appreciated and magnified. And let us not forget that great cities, after all, not only have fostered great hedge funds, but have also built great cathedrals stone by stone.

More people—constantly bumping into one another—lead to all sorts of entrepreneurial inventions and progress. Cities, it has been said, are where “ideas have sex.” Indeed, some optimistic cosmopolitan conservatives, such as the late Jack Kemp and his protégé, Wisconsin representative and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, have embraced a pro‑urban philosophy in a consistent manner, which can be reflected in their support for policies like enterprise zones, which encourage growth and development with lower taxes and fewer regulations in urban communities. But since President Obama’s election in 2008, these ideas have been on the outs with conservatives.

The greatest irony of the conservative adoption of an anticity worldview is that it is based largely on a philosophy advanced by the high priest of romanticism, Jean‑Jacques Rousseau. Instead of following the Christian understanding of creation that views man as a fallen creature due to original sin, Rousseau envisioned early man as a sort of noble savage. It wasn’t until man recognized the concept of property and ownership, Rousseau argued, that he became greedy and corrupted.

According to this way of thinking, a simple life is good and pure, while a modern urban life is dirty and unnatural. “Many scholars have pointed out the romanticists’ idea that somehow cities are breeders of sinful behavior and people who live in the country are more virtuous is actually something that’s been passed into the American psyche and actually into the American Christian psyche so that we have a tendency to have a very negative view of cities,” says Pastor Tim Keller. When one looks at the meth epidemic that is springing up in many of our rural communities or considers the inherent temptations and boredom that arise from being a latchkey kid living in some sterile suburb, the city begins to look less dystopian.

The New South

Something horrible happened while I was writing this book. On June 17, 2015, a young white man shot and killed nine worshippers at Mother Emanuel, a storied African Methodist Episcopal church with one of the oldest black congregations, in Charleston, South Carolina. Among the dead lay Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who also had served in the South Carolina state senate. Pictures of the shooter flaunting a Confederate battle flag soon emerged, as did calls for rebel flags to come down from statehouses across the nation.

Leaders emerge during times of tragedy and crisis, and it was at this moment that Nikki Haley, the female, Indian American governor of South Carolina, who also happens to be a conservative Republican, seized the moment. “Today we are here in a moment of unity in our state without ill will to say it is time to remove the flag from our capitol grounds,” Haley said at a press conference on June 22, 2015. “This flag, while an integral part of our past, does not represent the future of our great state.” She was flanked by Republican senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, who is one of only two African Americans in the U.S. Senate. And, in a way, the South Carolina governor and these senators represent a changing Republican Party, as well as a changing South. Graham, the only white representative, is probably the least conservative of the three. But they bring diverse perspectives that not very long ago were absent from Republican politics in the South. “The biggest reason I asked for that flag to come down was I couldn’t look my children in the face and justify it staying there,” Haley later told CNN’s Don Lemon. “What I realized now more than ever is people were driving by and they felt hurt and pain. No one should feel pain … My father wears a turban. My mother, at the time, wore a sari. It was hard growing up in South Carolina.”

Haley’s leadership deservedly drew acclaim. “South Carolina Republican governor Nikki Haley stared down hate and history this summer, turning an impassioned debate over the Confederate flag into a political launching pad,” wrote CNN’s Nia‑Malika Henderson. The governor provided crucial leadership at an important moment. But Haley couldn’t unilaterally remove the flag; she could only sign a bill to do so after it passed the Republican‑dominated state house and senate—which it did. On July 10, the flag was removed from state capitol grounds and placed in a museum.

Considering the stereotypes against Southern Republicans, it is equally notable that while controlling the senate, the house, and the governorship in the Palmetto State, Republicans did the right thing. The good news is that Haley and a generation of conservative Republican leaders like her are taking steps to bring their party into the 21st century, and they are resisting calls to hold on to baggage that was never theirs to begin with. In fact, it was an all‑white, Democrat‑controlled legislature that raised the flag in 1962. And it was Republican David Beasley who fought to have it removed from the capitol dome in the ’90s.

That’s not to say that there weren’t plenty of Republicans who supported flying the flag. But it is to say that there’s absolutely nothing inherently Republican or conservative about the Confederate battle flag.

If conservatives are going to thrive in the New South, they will have to embrace an inclusive conservative message like Nikki Haley’s—and they can’t afford to be bogged down by carrying the offensive baggage that they, after all, had nothing to do with.

Gavin Newsom has reportedly decided to sign a controversial bill requiring that all presidential candidates publish their tax returns to appear on the state’s primary ballot.

The bill is targeted at President Donald Trump, who has not published his tax returns.

According to Yashar Ali, who broke the story in his newsletter, Newsom decided to sign the bill into law by the Tuesday deadline — even though he had been expected not to do so.

As Breitbart News noted on Sunday:

The bill, SB 27, passed both houses of the California state legislature earlier this month, thanks in part to Democrats’ super-majority in each. It now awaits Newsom’s signature. Analysts describe it as a political “freebie” for Newsom — but it could be declared unconstitutional, and it could jeopardize the few areas in which Trump has cooperated with Newsom’s administration.

The move is likely to lose in court, and will jeopardize California’s precarious relationship with the Trump administration.

Jay Sekulow, a personal attorney for President Trump, suggested legal action will be taken in response to the move by Newsom. “The state of California’s attempt to circumvent the Constitution will be answered in court,” Sekulow stated.

Though the Golden State has often sued the Trump administration over its policies, California is also dependent on federal aid in a number of areas. Earlier this year, Trump canceled nearly $1 billion of funds for California’s now-defunct high-speed rail project, which Newsom had still hoped to use despite canceling the project.

Newsom shared his own tax returns during the 2018 race for governor. Ali notes that Newsom’s predecessor, Jerry Brown, did not publish his tax returns. California’s new law will largely be symbolic.

It will not matter if Trump does not appear on the California primary ballot, because he will still appear on the ballot in the general election. California exempts the presidential primary from its usual “jungle primary” process, in which only the top two candidates advance to the general election, regardless of party.

The bill could, however, inspire other Democrat-governed states to do the same. It will almost certainly boost Newsom’s national profile as well.

republican_party,Salon,0,http://www.salon.com/2013/12/22/how_the_gop_became_the_white_mans_party/,"How the GOP became the ""White Man's Party""",2013-12-22,Ian Haney-Lopez,"Few names conjure the recalcitrant South , fighting integration with fire-breathing fury , like that of George Wallace . The central image of this “ redneck poltergeist , ” as one biographer referred to him , is of Wallace during his inauguration as governor of Alabama in January 1963 , before waves of applause and the rapt attention of the national media , committing himself to the perpetual defense of segregation . Speaking on a cold day in Montgomery , Wallace thundered his infamous call to arms : “ Today I have stood , where once Jefferson Davis stood , and took an oath to my people . It is very appropriate then that from this Cradle of the Confederacy , this very Heart of the Great Anglo-Saxon Southland ... we sound the drum for freedom . ... In the name of the greatest people that have ever trod this earth , I draw the line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny . . . and I say ... segregation now ... segregation tomorrow ... segregation forever ! ”
The story of dog whistle politics begins with George Wallace . But it does not start with Wallace as he stood that inauguration day . Rather , the story focuses on who Wallace was before , and on whom he quickly became .
Before that January day , Wallace had not been a rabid segregationist ; indeed , by Southern standards , Wallace had been a racial moderate . He had sat on the board of trustees of a prominent black educational enterprise , the Tuskegee Institute . He had refused to join the walkout of Southern delegates from the 1948 Democratic convention when they protested the adoption of a civil rights platform . As a trial court judge , he earned a reputation for treating blacks civilly—a breach of racial etiquette so notable that decades later J.L . Chestnut , one of the very few black lawyers in Alabama at the time , would marvel that in 1958 “ George Wallace was the first judge to call me ‘ Mr. ’ in a courtroom. ” The custom had been instead to condescendingly refer to all blacks by their first name , whatever their age or station . When Wallace initially ran for governor in 1958 , the NAACP endorsed him ; his opponent had the blessing of the Ku Klux Klan .
In the fevered atmosphere of the South , roiled by the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision forbidding school segregation , the moderate Wallace lost in his first campaign for governor . Years later , the victor would reconstruct the campaign , distilling a simple lesson : the “ primary reason I beat [ Wallace ] was because he was considered soft on the race question at the time . That ’ s the primary reason. ” 4 This lesson was not lost on Wallace , and in turn , would reshape American politics for the next half-century . On the night he lost the 1958 election , Wallace sat in a car with his cronies , smoking a cigar , rehashing the loss , and putting off his concession speech . Finally steeling himself , Wallace eased opened the car door to go inside and break the news to his glum supporters . He wasn ’ t just going to accept defeat , though , he was going to learn from it . As he snuffed out his cigar and stepped into the evening , he turned back : “ Well , boys , ” he vowed , “ no other son-of-a-bitch will ever out-nigger me again . ”
Four years later , Wallace ran as a racial reactionary , openly courting the support of the Klan and fiercely committing himself to the defense of segregation . It was as an arch-segregationist that Wallace won the right to stand for inauguration in January 1963 , allowing him to proclaim segregation today , tomorrow , and forever . Summarizing his first two campaigns for governor of Alabama , Wallace would later recall , “ you know , I started off talking about schools and highways and prisons and taxes—and I couldn ’ t make them listen . Then I began talking about niggers—and they stomped the floor . ”
Wallace was far from the only Southern politician to veer to the right on race in the 1950s . The mounting pressure for black equality destabilized a quiescent political culture that had assumed white supremacy was unassailable , putting pressure on all public persons to stake out their position for or against integration . Wallace figures here for a different reason , one that becomes clear in how he upheld his promise to protect segregation .
During his campaign , Wallace had vowed to stand in schoolhouse doorways to personally bar the entrance of black students into white institutions .
In June 1963 , he got his chance . The federal courts had ordered the integration of the University of Alabama , Tuscaloosa , and US Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach flew down from Washington , DC , to enforce the order . More than 200 national reporters and all three of the major broadcast networks were on hand for the promised confrontation . From behind a podium , Wallace stood in the June heat and raised his hand to peremptorily bar the approach of Katzenbach . Then he read a seven-minute peroration that avoided the red-meat language of racial supremacy and instead emphasized “ the illegal usurpation of power by the Central Government. ” In footage carried on all three networks , the nation watched as Wallace hectored Katzenbach , culminating with Wallace declaiming , “ I do hereby denounce and forbid this illegal and unwarranted action by the Central Government. ” 8 It was pure theater , even down to white lines chalked on the ground to show where the respective thespians should stand ( Katzenbach approached more closely than expected , but ultimately that only heightened the drama ) . Wallace knew from the start that he would back down , and after delivering his stem-winder , that is what he did . Within two hours , as expected , the University of Alabama ’ s first two black students were on campus .
Over the next week , the nation reacted . More than 100,000 telegrams and letters flooded the office of the Alabama governor . More than half of them were from outside of the South . Did they condemn him ? Five out of every 100 did . The other 95 percent praised his brave stand in the schoolhouse doorway .
The nation ’ s reaction was an epiphany for Wallace , or perhaps better , three thunderbolts that together convinced Wallace to reinvent himself yet again . First , Wallace realized with a shock that hostility toward blacks was not confined to the South . “ He had looked out upon those white Americans north of Alabama and suddenly been awakened by a blinding vision : ‘ They all hate black people , all of them . They ’ re all afraid , all of them . Great god ! That ’ s it ! They ’ re all Southern . The whole United States is Southern. ’ ” Wallace suddenly knew that overtures to racial resentment would resonate across the country .
His second startling realization was that he , George Wallace , had figured out how to exploit that pervasive animosity . The key lay in seemingly non-racial language . At his inauguration , Wallace had defended segregation and extolled the proud Anglo-Saxon Southland , thereby earning national ridicule as an unrepentant redneck . Six months later , talking not about stopping integration but about states ’ rights and arrogant federal authority—and visually aided by footage showing him facing down a powerful Department of Justice official rather than vulnerable black students attired in their Sunday best—Wallace was a countrywide hero . “ States ’ rights ” was a paper-thin abstraction from the days before the Civil War when it had meant the right of Southern states to continue slavery . Then , as a rejoinder to the demand for integration , it meant the right of Southern states to continue laws mandating racial segregation—a system of debasement so thorough that it “ extended to churches and schools , to housing and jobs , to eating and drinking ... to virtually all forms of public transportation , to sports and recreations , to hospitals , orphanages , prisons , and asylums , and ultimately to funeral homes , morgues , and cemeteries. ” That ’ s what “ states ’ rights ” defended , though in the language of state-federal relations rather than white supremacy . Yet this was enough of a fig leaf to allow persons queasy about black equality to oppose integration without having to admit , to others and perhaps even to themselves , their racial attitudes .
“ Wallace pioneered a kind of soft porn racism in which fear and hate could be mobilized without mentioning race itself except to deny that one is a racist , ” a Wallace biographer argues . The notion of “ soft porn racism ” ties directly to the thesis of `` Dog Whistle Politics . '' Wallace realized the need to simultaneously move away from supremacist language that was increasingly unacceptable , while articulating a new vocabulary that channeled old , bigoted ideas . He needed a new form of racism that stimulated the intended audience without overtly transgressing prescribed social limits . The congratulatory telegrams from across the nation revealed to Wallace that he had found the magic formula . Hardcore racism showed white supremacy in disquieting detail . In contrast , the new soft porn racism hid any direct references to race , even as it continued to trade on racial stimulation . As a contemporary of Wallace marveled , “ he can use all the other issues—law and order , running your own schools , protecting property rights—and never mention race . But people will know he ’ s telling them ‘ a nigger ’ s trying to get your job , trying to move into your neighborhood. ’ What Wallace is doing is talking to them in a kind of shorthand , a kind of code . ”
Finally , a third bolt of lightening struck Wallace : he could be the one ! The governor ’ s mansion in Montgomery need not represent his final destination . He could ride the train of revamped race-baiting all the way to the White House . Wallace ran for president as a third-party candidate in 1964 , and then again in 1968 , 1972 , and 1976 . It ’ s his 1968 campaign that most concerns us , for there Wallace ran against a consummate politician who was quick to appreciate , and adopt , Wallace ’ s refashioned racial demagoguery : Richard Nixon . We ’ ll turn to the Wallace-Nixon race soon , but first , another set of weathered bones must be excavated—the remains of Barry Goldwater .
The Republican Party today , in its voters and in its elected officials , is almost all white . But it wasn ’ t always like that . Indeed , in the decades immediately before 1964 , neither party was racially identified in the eyes of the American public . Even as the Democratic Party on the national level increasingly embraced civil rights , partly as a way to capture the growing political power of blacks who had migrated to Northern cities , Southern Democrats—like George Wallace— remained staunch defenders of Jim Crow . Meanwhile , among Republicans , the racial antipathies of the rightwing found little favor among many party leaders . To take an important example , Brown and its desegregation imperative were backed by Republicans : Chief Justice Earl Warren , who wrote the opinion , was a Republican , and the first troops ordered into the South in 1957 to protect black students attempting to integrate a white school were sent there by the Republican administration of Dwight Eisenhower and his vice president , Richard Nixon . Reflecting the roughly equal commitment of both parties to racial progress , even as late as 1962 , the public perceived Republicans and Democrats to be similarly committed to racial justice . In that year , when asked which party “ is more likely to see that Negroes get fair treatment in jobs and housing , ” 22.7 percent of the public said Democrats and 21.3 percent said Republicans , while over half could perceive no difference between the two .
The 1964 presidential election marked the beginning of the realignment we live with today . Where in 1962 both parties were perceived as equally , if tepidly , supportive of civil rights , two years later 60 percent of the public identified Democrats as more likely to pursue fair treatment , versus only 7 percent who so identified the Republican Party . What happened ?
Groundwork for the shift was laid in the run-up to the 1964 election by rightwing elements in the Republican Party , which gained momentum from the loss of the then-moderate Nixon to John F. Kennedy in 1960 . This faction of the party had never stopped warring against the New Deal . Its standard bearer was Barry Goldwater , a senator from Arizona and heir to a department store fortune . His pampered upbringing and wealth notwithstanding , Goldwater affected a cowboy ’ s rough-and-tumble persona in his dress and speech , casting himself as a walking embodiment of the Marlboro Man ’ s disdain for the nanny state . Goldwater and the reactionary stalwarts who rallied to him saw the Democratic Party as a mortal threat to the nation : domestically , because of the corrupting influence of a powerful central government deeply involved in regulating the marketplace and using taxes to reallocate wealth downward , and abroad in its willingness to compromise with communist countries instead of going to war against them . Goldwater himself , though , was no racial throwback . For instance , in 1957 and again in 1960 he voted in favor of federal civil rights legislation . By 1961 , however , Goldwater and his partisans had become convinced that the key to electoral success lay in gaining ground in the South , and that in turn required appealing to racist sentiments in white voters , even at the cost of black support . As Goldwater drawled , “ We ’ re not going to get the Negro vote as a bloc in 1964 and 1968 , so we ought to go hunting where the ducks are . ”
This racial plan riled more moderate members of the Republican establishment , such as New York senator Jacob Javits , who in the fall of 1963 may have been the first to refer to a “ Southern Strategy ” in the context of repudiating it . By then , however , the right wing of the party had won out . As the conservative journalist Robert Novak reported after attending a meeting of the Republican National Committee in Denver during the summer of 1963 : “ A good many , perhaps a majority of the party ’ s leadership , envision substantial political gold to be mined in the racial crisis by becoming in fact , though not in name , the White Man ’ s Party . ‘ Remember , ’ one astute party worker said quietly . . . ‘ this isn ’ t South Africa . The white man outnumbers the Negro 9 to 1 in this country. ’ ” The rise of a racially-identified GOP is not a tale of latent bigotry in that party . It is instead a story centered on the strategic decision to use racism to become “ the White Man ’ s Party . ”
That same summer of 1963 , as key Republican leaders strategized on how to shift their party to the far right racially , the Democrats began to lean in the other direction . Northern constituents were increasingly appalled by the violence , shown almost nightly on broadcast television , of Southern efforts to beat down civil rights protesters . Reacting to the growing clamor that something be done , President Kennedy introduced a sweeping civil rights bill that stirred the hopes of millions that segregation would soon be illegal in employment and at business places open to the public . Despite these hopes , however , prospects for the bill ’ s passage seemed dim , as the Southern Democrats were loath to support civil rights and retained sufficient power to bottle up the bill . Then on November 22 , 1963 , Kennedy was assassinated . His vice president , Lyndon Johnson , assumed the presidency vowing to make good on Kennedy ’ s priorities , chief among them civil rights . Only five days after Kennedy ’ s death , Johnson in his first address to Congress implored the assembly that “ no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy ’ s memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long. ” Even under these conditions , it took Johnson ’ s determined stewardship to overcome three months of dogged legislative stalling before Kennedy ’ s civil rights bill finally passed the next summer . Known popularly as the 1964 Civil Rights Act , it still stands as the greatest civil rights achievement of the era .
Indicating the persistence of the old , internally divided racial politics of both parties , the act passed with broad bipartisan support and against broad bipartisan opposition—the cleavage was regional , rather than in terms of party affiliation . Roughly 90 percent of non-Southern senators supported the bill , while 95 percent of Southern senators opposed it . Yet , heralding the incipient emergence of the new politics of party alignment along racial lines , Barry Goldwater also voted against the civil rights bill . He was one of only five senators from outside the South to do so . Goldwater claimed he saw a looming Orwellian state moving to coerce private citizens to spy on each other for telltale signs of racism . “ To give genuine effect to the prohibitions of this bill , ” Goldwater contended from the Senate floor , “ bids fair to result in the development of an ‘ informer ’ psychology in great areas of our national life—neighbor spying on neighbor , workers spying on workers , businessmen spying on businessmen. ” This all seemed a little hysterical . More calculatingly , it could not have escaped Goldwater ’ s attention that voting against a civil rights law associated with blacks , Kennedy , and Johnson would help him “ go hunting where the ducks are . ”
Running for president in 1964 , the Arizonan strode across the South , hawking small-government bromides and racially coded appeals . In terms of the latter , he sold his vote against the 1964 Civil Rights Act as a bold stand in favor of “ states ’ rights ” and “ freedom of association. ” States ’ rights , Goldwater insisted , preserved state autonomy against intrusive meddling from a distant power—though obviously the burning issue of the day was the federal government ’ s efforts to limit state involvement in racial degradation and group oppression . Freedom of association , Goldwater explained , meant the right of individuals to be free from government coercion in choosing whom to let onto their property—but in the South this meant first and foremost the right of business owners to exclude blacks from hotels , restaurants , movie theaters , and retail establishments . Like Wallace , Goldwater had learned how to talk about blacks without ever mentioning race .
No less than Wallace , Goldwater also demonstrated a flair for political stagecraft . A reporter following Goldwater ’ s campaign through the South captured some of the spectacle : “ to show the country the ‘ lily-white ’ character of Republicanism in Dixie , ” party flaks filled the floor of the football stadium in Montgomery , Alabama , with “ a great field of white lilies—living lilies , in perfect bloom , gorgeously arrayed. ” To this tableau , the campaign added “ seven hundred Alabama girls in long white gowns , all of a whiteness as impossible as the greenness of the field. ” Onto this scene emerged Goldwater , first moving this way and then that way through “ fifty or so yards of choice Southern womanhood , ” before taking the stand to give his speech defending states ’ rights and freedom of association . If these coded terms were too subtle for some , no one could fail to grasp the symbolism of the white lilies and the white-gowned women . Much of the emotional resistance to racial equality centered around the fear that black men would become intimate with white women . This scene represented “ what the rest of his Southern troops—the thousands in the packed stands , the tens of thousands in Memphis and New Orleans and Atlanta and Shreveport and Greenville—passionately believed they were defending. ” Goldwater made sure white Southerners understood he was fighting to protect them and their women against blacks .
How would Goldwater fare in the South ? Beyond his racial pandering , that depended on how his anti-New Deal message was received . The Great Depression had devastated the region , which lagged behind the North in industry . Federal assistance to the poor as well as major infrastructure projects , such as the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) that brought electricity for the first time to millions , made Southerners among the New Deal ’ s staunchest supporters . Yet despite the New Deal ’ s popularity in the South , Goldwater campaigned against it . While he was willing to pander racially , Goldwater also prided himself on telling audiences what he thought they needed to hear , at least as far as the bracing virtues of rugged individualism were concerned . Thus he made clear , for instance , that he favored selling off the TVA , and also attacked other popular programs . As recounted by Rick Perlstein , a Goldwater political biographer , at one rally in West Virginia , Goldwater “ called the War on Poverty ‘ plainly and simply a war on your pocketbooks , ’ a fraud because only ‘ the vast resources of private business ’ could produce the wealth to truly slay penury. ” Perlstein singled out the tin-eared cruelty of this message : “ In the land of the tar-paper shack , the gap-toothed smile , and the open sewer—where the ‘ vast resources of private business ’ were represented in the person of the coal barons who gave men black lung , then sent them off to die without pensions—the message just sounded perverse . As he left , lines of workmen jeered him . ”
Another factor also worked against Goldwater : he was a Republican , and the South reviled the Party of Lincoln . If across the nation neither party was seen as more or less friendly toward civil rights , the South had its own views on the question . There , it was the local Democratic machine that represented white interests , while the GOP was seen as the proximate cause of the Civil War and as the party of the carpetbaggers who had peremptorily ruled the South during Reconstruction . The hostility of generations of white Southerners toward Republicans only intensified with the Republican Eisenhower ’ s decision to send in federal troops to enforce the Republican Warren ’ s ruling forbidding school segregation in Brown . Most white Southerners had never voted Republican in their lives , and had vowed—like their parents and grandparents before them— that they never would .
Ultimately , however , these handicaps barely impeded Goldwater ’ s performance in the South . He convinced many Southern voters to vote Republican for the first time ever , and in the Deep South , comprised of those five states with the highest black populations , Goldwater won outright . The anti-New Deal Republican carried Louisiana , Georgia , Alabama , Mississippi , and South Carolina , states in which whites had never voted for a Republican president in more than miniscule numbers . This was a shocking transformation , one that can only be explained by Goldwater ’ s ability to transmit a set of codes that white voters readily understood as a promise to protect racial segregation . It seemed that voters simply ignored Goldwater ’ s philosophy of governance as well as his party affiliation and instead rewarded his hostility toward civil rights . In this sense , Goldwater ’ s conservatism operated in the South less like a genuine political ideology and more like Wallace ’ s soft porn racism : as a set of codes that voters readily understood as defending white supremacy . Goldwater didn ’ t win the South as a small-government libertarian , but rather as a racist .
If in the South race trumped anti-government politics , in the North Goldwater ’ s anti-civil rights attacks found much less traction . Opposing civil rights smacked too much of Southern intransigence , and while there was resistance to racial reform in the North , it had not yet become an overriding issue for many whites . That left Goldwater running on promises to end the New Deal , and this proved wildly unpopular . To campaign against liberalism in 1964 was to campaign against an activist government that had lifted the country out of the throes of a horrendous depression still squarely in the rear view mirror , and that had then launched millions into the middle class . More than that , though , to campaign against liberalism in 1964 was to attack government programs still largely aimed at whites—and that sort of welfare was broadly understood as legitimate and warranted
Goldwater ’ s anti-welfare tirades produced a landslide victory , but for Lyndon Johnson . Voters crushed Goldwater ’ s last-gasp attack on the New Deal state . Outside of the South , he lost by overwhelming numbers in every state except his Arizona home . Voters were offended by his over-the-top attacks on popular New Deal programs as well as by his penchant for saber rattling when it came to foreign policy . Goldwater especially suffered after the release of “ Daisy , ” a Johnson campaign ad that juxtaposed a little girl picking the petals off a flower with footage of a spiraling mushroom cloud , sending the message that Goldwater ’ s militarism threatened nuclear Armageddon . In the end , the Democrats succeeded in making Goldwater look like a loon . “ To the Goldwater slogan ‘ In Your Heart , You Know He ’ s Right , ’ the Democrats shot back , ‘ In Your Guts , You Know He ’ s Nuts. ’ ” The country as a whole , it seemed , had solidly allied itself with progressive governance , and big-money/small-government conservatism was finally , utterly dead .
Or at least , this was the lesson most people took from the 1964 election . But like the clang of a distant alarm barely perceptible against the buzzing din of consensus , a warning was rising from the South : racial entreaties had convinced even the staunchest Democrats to abandon New Deal liberalism . If race-baiting had won over Southern whites to anti-government politics , could the same work across the country ?
Notwithstanding the emerging racial strategy initiated by Goldwater , when Richard Nixon secured the Republican nomination in 1968 , the new racial politics of his party had not yet gelled , either within the party generally , or in Nixon himself . Indeed , the moderate Nixon ’ s emergence as the party ’ s presidential candidate reflected the extent to which the Goldwater faction had lost credibility in the wake of their champion ’ s disastrous drubbing . Nevertheless , the dynamics of the presidential race would quickly push Nixon toward race-baiting . Nixon ’ s principal opponent in 1968 was Johnson ’ s vice president , Hubert Humphrey . But running as an independent candidate , George Wallace was flanking Nixon on the right . By October 1 , just a month before the election , Wallace was polling more support in the South than either Humphrey or Nixon . Nor was his support limited to that region . Wallace was siphoning crucial votes across the country , and staging massive rallies in ostensibly liberal strongholds , for instance drawing 20,000 partisans to Madison Square Garden in New York , and 70,000 faithful to the Boston Common—more than any rally ever held by the Kennedys , Wallace liked to crow . Republican operatives guessed that perhaps 80 percent of the Wallace voters in the South would otherwise support Nixon , and a near-majority in the North as well .
Late in the campaign , Nixon opted to publicly tack right on race . He had already reached a backroom deal with South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond— an arch-segregationist who had led the revolt against the Democratic Party in 1948 when it endorsed a modest civil rights plank , and who switched to become a Republican in 1964 to throw his weight behind Goldwater . Nixon bought Thurmond ’ s support during the primary season by secretly promising that he would restrict federal enforcement of school desegregation in the South . Now he would make this same promise to the nation . On October 7 , Nixon came out against “ forced busing , ” an increasingly potent euphemism for the system of transporting students across the boundaries of segregated neighborhoods in order to integrate schools . Mary Frances Berry pierces the pretense that the issue was putting one ’ s child on a bus : “ African-American attempts to desegregate schools were confronted by white flight and complaints that the problem was not desegregation , but busing , oftentimes by people who sent their children to school every day on buses , including mediocre white private academies established to avoid integration. ” “ Busing ” offered a Northern analog to states ’ rights . The language may have referred to transportation , but the emotional wallop came from defiance toward integration .
Nixon also began to hammer away at the issue of law and order . In doing so , he drew upon a rhetorical frame rooted in Southern resistance to civil rights . From the inception of the civil rights movement in the 1950s , Southern politicians had disparaged racial activists as “ lawbreakers , ” as indeed technically they were . In the Jim Crow regions , African Americans had long pressed basic equality demands precisely by breaking laws mandating segregation : sit-ins and freedom rides purposefully violated Jim Crow statutes in order to challenge white supremacist social norms . Dismissing these protesters as criminals shifted the issue from a defense of white supremacy to a more neutral-seeming concern with “ order , ” while simultaneously stripping the activists of moral stature . Demonstrators were no longer Americans willing to risk beatings and even death for a grand ideal , but rather criminal lowlifes disposed toward antisocial behavior . Ultimately , the language of law and order justified a more “ quiet ” form of violence in defense of the racial status quo , replacing lynchings with mass arrests for trespassing and delinquency .
Nixon had mastered Wallace ’ s dark art . Forced bussing , law and order , and security from unrest as the essential civil right of the majority—all of these were coded phrases that allowed Nixon to appeal to racial fears without overtly mentioning race at all . Yet race remained the indisputable , intentional subtext of the appeal . As Nixon exulted after watching one of his own commercials : “ Yep , this hits it right on the nose . . . it ’ s all about law and order and the damn Negro-Puerto Rican groups out there . ”
Nixon didn ’ t campaign exclusively on racial themes ; notably , he also stressed his opposition to anti-war protesters , while simultaneously portraying himself as the candidate most likely to bring the war to an end . Nevertheless , racial appeals formed an essential element of Nixon ’ s ’ 68 campaign . Nixon ’ s special counsel , John Ehrlichman , bluntly summarized that year ’ s campaign strategy : “ We ’ ll go after the racists. ” According to Ehrlichman , the “ subliminal appeal to the anti-black voter was always present in Nixon ’ s statements and speeches . ”
Nixon barely won in 1968 , edging Humphrey by less than one percent of the national vote . Wallace , meanwhile , had captured nearly 14 percent of the vote . Had Nixon ’ s coded race-baiting helped ? Initially there was uncertainty , and in his first two years in office Nixon governed as if he still believed the federal government had some role to play in helping out nonwhites . For instance , Nixon came into office proposing the idea of a flat wealth transfer to the poor , which would have gone a long way toward breaking down racial inequalities . But over the course of those two years , a new understanding consolidated regarding the tidal shift that had occurred .
On the Democratic side , in 1970 two pollsters , Richard Scammon and Ben Wattenberg , published The Real Majority , cautioning their party that “ Social Issues ” now divided the base . “ The machinist ’ s wife in Dayton may decide to leave the Democratic reservation in 1972 and vote for Nixon or Wallace or their ideological descendants , ” Scammon and Wattenberg warned . “ If she thinks the Democrats feel that she isn ’ t scared of crime but that she ’ s really a bigot , if she thinks that Democrats feel the police are Fascist pigs and the Black Panthers and the Weathermen are just poor , misunderstood , picked-upon kids , if she thinks that Democrats are for the hip drug culture and that she , the machinist ’ s wife , is not only a bigot , but a square , then good-bye lady—and good-bye Democrats. ” How , then , could the party get ahead of these issues ? Scammon and Wattenberg were frank : “ The Democrats in the South were hurt by being perceived ( correctly ) as a pro-black national party. ” The solution was clear : the Democratic Party had to temper its “ pro-black stance . ”
On the Republican side , a leading Nixon strategist had come to the same conclusion about race as a potential wedge issue—though , predictably , with a different prescription . In 1969 , Kevin Phillips published The Emerging Republican Majority , arguing that because of racial resentments a historical realignment was underway that would cement a new Republican majority that would endure for decades . A young prodigy obsessed with politics , Phillips had worked out the details of his argument in the mid-1960s , and then had gone to work helping to elect Nixon . When the 1968 returns seemed to confirm his thesis , he published his research—nearly 500 pages , with 47 maps and 143 charts . Beneath the details , Phillips had a simple , even deterministic thesis : “ Historically , our party system has reflected layer upon layer of group oppositions. ” Politics , according to Phillips , turned principally on group animosity— “ the prevailing cleavages in American voting behavior have been ethnic and cultural . Politically , at least , the United States has not been a very effective melting pot . ”
As to what was driving the latest realignment , Phillips was blunt : “ The Negro problem , having become a national rather than a local one , is the principal cause of the breakup of the New Deal coalition. ” For Phillips , it was almost inevitable that most whites would abandon the Democratic Party once it became identified with blacks . “ Ethnic and cultural division has so often shaped American politics that , given the immense midcentury impact of Negro enfranchisement and integration , reaction to this change almost inevitably had to result in political realignment. ” Phillips saw his emerging Republican majority this way : “ the nature of the majority—or potential majority—seems clear . It is largely white and middle class . It is concentrated in the South , the West , and suburbia . ”
The number crunchers had spoken . The Southern strategy , incipient for a decade , had matured into a clear route to electoral dominance . The old Democratic alliance of Northeastern liberals , the white working class , Northern blacks , and Southern Democrats , could be riven by racial appeals . Beginning in 1970 , Richard Nixon embraced the politics of racial division wholeheartedly . He abandoned the idea of a flat wealth transfer to the poor . Now , Nixon repeatedly emphasized law and order issues . He railed against forced busing in the North . He reversed the federal government ’ s position on Southern school integration , slowing the process down and making clear that the courts would have no help from his administration . But perhaps nothing symbolized the new Nixon more than his comments in December 1970 . Reflecting his initially moderate position on domestic issues , early in his administration Nixon had appointed George Romney—a liberal Republican and , incidentally , Mitt Romney ’ s father—as his secretary of housing and urban development . In turn , Romney had made integration of the suburbs his special mission , even coming up with a plan to cut off federal funds to communities that refused to allow integrated housing . By late 1970 , however , when these jurisdictions howled at the temerity , Nixon took their side , throwing his cabinet officer under the bus . In a public address , Nixon baldly stated : “ I can assure you that it is not the policy of this government to use the power of the federal government . . . for forced integration of the suburbs . I believe that forced integration of the suburbs is not in the national interest. ” 41 That dog whistle blasted like the shriek of an onrushing train .
In 1963 , Robert Novak had written that many Republican leaders were intent on converting the Party of Lincoln into the White Man ’ s Party . The following year , Goldwater went down in crushing defeat , winning only 36 percent of the white vote . Even so , less than a decade later , the racial transmogrification of the Republicans was well underway . In 1972 , Nixon ’ s first full dog whistle campaign netted him 67 percent of the white vote , leaving his opponent , George McGovern , with support from less than one in three whites . Defeated by the Southern strategy , McGovern neatly summed it up : “ What is the Southern Strategy ? It is this . It says to the South : Let the poor stay poor , let your economy trail the nation , forget about decent homes and medical care for all your people , choose officials who will oppose every effort to benefit the many at the expense of the few—and in return , we will try to overlook the rights of the black man , appoint a few southerners to high office , and lift your spirits by attacking the ‘ eastern establishment ’ whose bank accounts we are filling with your labor and your industry. ” 42 McGovern erred in supposing that the Southern strategy pertained only to the South . Nixon had already learned from Wallace , and then later from the number crunchers , that coded racial appeals would work nationwide . Other than that , especially in its class and race dimensions , McGovern had dog whistle politics dead to rights .

The central image of this “redneck poltergeist,” as one biographer referred to him, is of Wallace during his inauguration as governor of Alabama in January 1963, before waves of applause and the rapt attention of the national media, committing himself to the perpetual defense of segregation. Speaking on a cold day in Montgomery, Wallace thundered his infamous call to arms: “Today I have stood, where once Jefferson Davis stood, and took an oath to my people. It is very appropriate then that from this Cradle of the Confederacy, this very Heart of the Great Anglo-Saxon Southland ... we sound the drum for freedom. ... In the name of the greatest people that have ever trod this earth, I draw the line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny . . . and I say ... segregation now ... segregation tomorrow ... segregation forever!”

The story of dog whistle politics begins with George Wallace. But it does not start with Wallace as he stood that inauguration day. Rather, the story focuses on who Wallace was before, and on whom he quickly became.

Before that January day, Wallace had not been a rabid segregationist; indeed, by Southern standards, Wallace had been a racial moderate. He had sat on the board of trustees of a prominent black educational enterprise, the Tuskegee Institute. He had refused to join the walkout of Southern delegates from the 1948 Democratic convention when they protested the adoption of a civil rights platform. As a trial court judge, he earned a reputation for treating blacks civilly—a breach of racial etiquette so notable that decades later J.L. Chestnut, one of the very few black lawyers in Alabama at the time, would marvel that in 1958 “George Wallace was the first judge to call me ‘Mr.’ in a courtroom.” The custom had been instead to condescendingly refer to all blacks by their first name, whatever their age or station. When Wallace initially ran for governor in 1958, the NAACP endorsed him; his opponent had the blessing of the Ku Klux Klan.

In the fevered atmosphere of the South, roiled by the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision forbidding school segregation, the moderate Wallace lost in his first campaign for governor. Years later, the victor would reconstruct the campaign, distilling a simple lesson: the “primary reason I beat [Wallace] was because he was considered soft on the race question at the time. That’s the primary reason.”4 This lesson was not lost on Wallace, and in turn, would reshape American politics for the next half-century. On the night he lost the 1958 election, Wallace sat in a car with his cronies, smoking a cigar, rehashing the loss, and putting off his concession speech. Finally steeling himself, Wallace eased opened the car door to go inside and break the news to his glum supporters. He wasn’t just going to accept defeat, though, he was going to learn from it. As he snuffed out his cigar and stepped into the evening, he turned back: “Well, boys,” he vowed, “no other son-of-a-bitch will ever out-nigger me again.”

Four years later, Wallace ran as a racial reactionary, openly courting the support of the Klan and fiercely committing himself to the defense of segregation. It was as an arch-segregationist that Wallace won the right to stand for inauguration in January 1963, allowing him to proclaim segregation today, tomorrow, and forever. Summarizing his first two campaigns for governor of Alabama, Wallace would later recall, “you know, I started off talking about schools and highways and prisons and taxes—and I couldn’t make them listen. Then I began talking about niggers—and they stomped the floor.”

Wallace was far from the only Southern politician to veer to the right on race in the 1950s. The mounting pressure for black equality destabilized a quiescent political culture that had assumed white supremacy was unassailable, putting pressure on all public persons to stake out their position for or against integration. Wallace figures here for a different reason, one that becomes clear in how he upheld his promise to protect segregation.

During his campaign, Wallace had vowed to stand in schoolhouse doorways to personally bar the entrance of black students into white institutions.

In June 1963, he got his chance. The federal courts had ordered the integration of the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, and US Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach flew down from Washington, DC, to enforce the order. More than 200 national reporters and all three of the major broadcast networks were on hand for the promised confrontation. From behind a podium, Wallace stood in the June heat and raised his hand to peremptorily bar the approach of Katzenbach. Then he read a seven-minute peroration that avoided the red-meat language of racial supremacy and instead emphasized “the illegal usurpation of power by the Central Government.” In footage carried on all three networks, the nation watched as Wallace hectored Katzenbach, culminating with Wallace declaiming, “I do hereby denounce and forbid this illegal and unwarranted action by the Central Government.”8 It was pure theater, even down to white lines chalked on the ground to show where the respective thespians should stand (Katzenbach approached more closely than expected, but ultimately that only heightened the drama). Wallace knew from the start that he would back down, and after delivering his stem-winder, that is what he did. Within two hours, as expected, the University of Alabama’s first two black students were on campus.

Over the next week, the nation reacted. More than 100,000 telegrams and letters flooded the office of the Alabama governor. More than half of them were from outside of the South. Did they condemn him? Five out of every 100 did. The other 95 percent praised his brave stand in the schoolhouse doorway.

The nation’s reaction was an epiphany for Wallace, or perhaps better, three thunderbolts that together convinced Wallace to reinvent himself yet again. First, Wallace realized with a shock that hostility toward blacks was not confined to the South. “He had looked out upon those white Americans north of Alabama and suddenly been awakened by a blinding vision: ‘They all hate black people, all of them. They’re all afraid, all of them. Great god! That’s it! They’re all Southern. The whole United States is Southern.’” Wallace suddenly knew that overtures to racial resentment would resonate across the country.

His second startling realization was that he, George Wallace, had figured out how to exploit that pervasive animosity. The key lay in seemingly non-racial language. At his inauguration, Wallace had defended segregation and extolled the proud Anglo-Saxon Southland, thereby earning national ridicule as an unrepentant redneck. Six months later, talking not about stopping integration but about states’ rights and arrogant federal authority—and visually aided by footage showing him facing down a powerful Department of Justice official rather than vulnerable black students attired in their Sunday best—Wallace was a countrywide hero. “States’ rights” was a paper-thin abstraction from the days before the Civil War when it had meant the right of Southern states to continue slavery. Then, as a rejoinder to the demand for integration, it meant the right of Southern states to continue laws mandating racial segregation—a system of debasement so thorough that it “extended to churches and schools, to housing and jobs, to eating and drinking ... to virtually all forms of public transportation, to sports and recreations, to hospitals, orphanages, prisons, and asylums, and ultimately to funeral homes, morgues, and cemeteries.” That’s what “states’ rights” defended, though in the language of state-federal relations rather than white supremacy. Yet this was enough of a fig leaf to allow persons queasy about black equality to oppose integration without having to admit, to others and perhaps even to themselves, their racial attitudes.

“Wallace pioneered a kind of soft porn racism in which fear and hate could be mobilized without mentioning race itself except to deny that one is a racist,” a Wallace biographer argues. The notion of “soft porn racism” ties directly to the thesis of ""Dog Whistle Politics."" Wallace realized the need to simultaneously move away from supremacist language that was increasingly unacceptable, while articulating a new vocabulary that channeled old, bigoted ideas. He needed a new form of racism that stimulated the intended audience without overtly transgressing prescribed social limits. The congratulatory telegrams from across the nation revealed to Wallace that he had found the magic formula. Hardcore racism showed white supremacy in disquieting detail. In contrast, the new soft porn racism hid any direct references to race, even as it continued to trade on racial stimulation. As a contemporary of Wallace marveled, “he can use all the other issues—law and order, running your own schools, protecting property rights—and never mention race. But people will know he’s telling them ‘a nigger’s trying to get your job, trying to move into your neighborhood.’ What Wallace is doing is talking to them in a kind of shorthand, a kind of code.”

Finally, a third bolt of lightening struck Wallace: he could be the one! The governor’s mansion in Montgomery need not represent his final destination. He could ride the train of revamped race-baiting all the way to the White House. Wallace ran for president as a third-party candidate in 1964, and then again in 1968, 1972, and 1976. It’s his 1968 campaign that most concerns us, for there Wallace ran against a consummate politician who was quick to appreciate, and adopt, Wallace’s refashioned racial demagoguery: Richard Nixon. We’ll turn to the Wallace-Nixon race soon, but first, another set of weathered bones must be excavated—the remains of Barry Goldwater.

The Rise of Racially Identified Parties

The Republican Party today, in its voters and in its elected officials, is almost all white. But it wasn’t always like that. Indeed, in the decades immediately before 1964, neither party was racially identified in the eyes of the American public. Even as the Democratic Party on the national level increasingly embraced civil rights, partly as a way to capture the growing political power of blacks who had migrated to Northern cities, Southern Democrats—like George Wallace— remained staunch defenders of Jim Crow. Meanwhile, among Republicans, the racial antipathies of the rightwing found little favor among many party leaders. To take an important example, Brown and its desegregation imperative were backed by Republicans: Chief Justice Earl Warren, who wrote the opinion, was a Republican, and the first troops ordered into the South in 1957 to protect black students attempting to integrate a white school were sent there by the Republican administration of Dwight Eisenhower and his vice president, Richard Nixon. Reflecting the roughly equal commitment of both parties to racial progress, even as late as 1962, the public perceived Republicans and Democrats to be similarly committed to racial justice. In that year, when asked which party “is more likely to see that Negroes get fair treatment in jobs and housing,” 22.7 percent of the public said Democrats and 21.3 percent said Republicans, while over half could perceive no difference between the two.

The 1964 presidential election marked the beginning of the realignment we live with today. Where in 1962 both parties were perceived as equally, if tepidly, supportive of civil rights, two years later 60 percent of the public identified Democrats as more likely to pursue fair treatment, versus only 7 percent who so identified the Republican Party. What happened?

Groundwork for the shift was laid in the run-up to the 1964 election by rightwing elements in the Republican Party, which gained momentum from the loss of the then-moderate Nixon to John F. Kennedy in 1960. This faction of the party had never stopped warring against the New Deal. Its standard bearer was Barry Goldwater, a senator from Arizona and heir to a department store fortune. His pampered upbringing and wealth notwithstanding, Goldwater affected a cowboy’s rough-and-tumble persona in his dress and speech, casting himself as a walking embodiment of the Marlboro Man’s disdain for the nanny state. Goldwater and the reactionary stalwarts who rallied to him saw the Democratic Party as a mortal threat to the nation: domestically, because of the corrupting influence of a powerful central government deeply involved in regulating the marketplace and using taxes to reallocate wealth downward, and abroad in its willingness to compromise with communist countries instead of going to war against them. Goldwater himself, though, was no racial throwback. For instance, in 1957 and again in 1960 he voted in favor of federal civil rights legislation. By 1961, however, Goldwater and his partisans had become convinced that the key to electoral success lay in gaining ground in the South, and that in turn required appealing to racist sentiments in white voters, even at the cost of black support. As Goldwater drawled, “We’re not going to get the Negro vote as a bloc in 1964 and 1968, so we ought to go hunting where the ducks are.”

This racial plan riled more moderate members of the Republican establishment, such as New York senator Jacob Javits, who in the fall of 1963 may have been the first to refer to a “Southern Strategy” in the context of repudiating it. By then, however, the right wing of the party had won out. As the conservative journalist Robert Novak reported after attending a meeting of the Republican National Committee in Denver during the summer of 1963: “A good many, perhaps a majority of the party’s leadership, envision substantial political gold to be mined in the racial crisis by becoming in fact, though not in name, the White Man’s Party. ‘Remember,’ one astute party worker said quietly . . . ‘this isn’t South Africa. The white man outnumbers the Negro 9 to 1 in this country.’ ” The rise of a racially-identified GOP is not a tale of latent bigotry in that party. It is instead a story centered on the strategic decision to use racism to become “the White Man’s Party.”

That same summer of 1963, as key Republican leaders strategized on how to shift their party to the far right racially, the Democrats began to lean in the other direction. Northern constituents were increasingly appalled by the violence, shown almost nightly on broadcast television, of Southern efforts to beat down civil rights protesters. Reacting to the growing clamor that something be done, President Kennedy introduced a sweeping civil rights bill that stirred the hopes of millions that segregation would soon be illegal in employment and at business places open to the public. Despite these hopes, however, prospects for the bill’s passage seemed dim, as the Southern Democrats were loath to support civil rights and retained sufficient power to bottle up the bill. Then on November 22, 1963, Kennedy was assassinated. His vice president, Lyndon Johnson, assumed the presidency vowing to make good on Kennedy’s priorities, chief among them civil rights. Only five days after Kennedy’s death, Johnson in his first address to Congress implored the assembly that “no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy’s memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long.” Even under these conditions, it took Johnson’s determined stewardship to overcome three months of dogged legislative stalling before Kennedy’s civil rights bill finally passed the next summer. Known popularly as the 1964 Civil Rights Act, it still stands as the greatest civil rights achievement of the era.

Indicating the persistence of the old, internally divided racial politics of both parties, the act passed with broad bipartisan support and against broad bipartisan opposition—the cleavage was regional, rather than in terms of party affiliation. Roughly 90 percent of non-Southern senators supported the bill, while 95 percent of Southern senators opposed it. Yet, heralding the incipient emergence of the new politics of party alignment along racial lines, Barry Goldwater also voted against the civil rights bill. He was one of only five senators from outside the South to do so. Goldwater claimed he saw a looming Orwellian state moving to coerce private citizens to spy on each other for telltale signs of racism. “To give genuine effect to the prohibitions of this bill,” Goldwater contended from the Senate floor, “bids fair to result in the development of an ‘informer’ psychology in great areas of our national life—neighbor spying on neighbor, workers spying on workers, businessmen spying on businessmen.” This all seemed a little hysterical. More calculatingly, it could not have escaped Goldwater’s attention that voting against a civil rights law associated with blacks, Kennedy, and Johnson would help him “go hunting where the ducks are.”

Running for president in 1964, the Arizonan strode across the South, hawking small-government bromides and racially coded appeals. In terms of the latter, he sold his vote against the 1964 Civil Rights Act as a bold stand in favor of “states’ rights” and “freedom of association.” States’ rights, Goldwater insisted, preserved state autonomy against intrusive meddling from a distant power—though obviously the burning issue of the day was the federal government’s efforts to limit state involvement in racial degradation and group oppression. Freedom of association, Goldwater explained, meant the right of individuals to be free from government coercion in choosing whom to let onto their property—but in the South this meant first and foremost the right of business owners to exclude blacks from hotels, restaurants, movie theaters, and retail establishments. Like Wallace, Goldwater had learned how to talk about blacks without ever mentioning race.

No less than Wallace, Goldwater also demonstrated a flair for political stagecraft. A reporter following Goldwater’s campaign through the South captured some of the spectacle: “to show the country the ‘lily-white’ character of Republicanism in Dixie,” party flaks filled the floor of the football stadium in Montgomery, Alabama, with “a great field of white lilies—living lilies, in perfect bloom, gorgeously arrayed.” To this tableau, the campaign added “seven hundred Alabama girls in long white gowns, all of a whiteness as impossible as the greenness of the field.” Onto this scene emerged Goldwater, first moving this way and then that way through “fifty or so yards of choice Southern womanhood,” before taking the stand to give his speech defending states’ rights and freedom of association. If these coded terms were too subtle for some, no one could fail to grasp the symbolism of the white lilies and the white-gowned women. Much of the emotional resistance to racial equality centered around the fear that black men would become intimate with white women. This scene represented “what the rest of his Southern troops—the thousands in the packed stands, the tens of thousands in Memphis and New Orleans and Atlanta and Shreveport and Greenville—passionately believed they were defending.” Goldwater made sure white Southerners understood he was fighting to protect them and their women against blacks.

How would Goldwater fare in the South? Beyond his racial pandering, that depended on how his anti-New Deal message was received. The Great Depression had devastated the region, which lagged behind the North in industry. Federal assistance to the poor as well as major infrastructure projects, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) that brought electricity for the first time to millions, made Southerners among the New Deal’s staunchest supporters. Yet despite the New Deal’s popularity in the South, Goldwater campaigned against it. While he was willing to pander racially, Goldwater also prided himself on telling audiences what he thought they needed to hear, at least as far as the bracing virtues of rugged individualism were concerned. Thus he made clear, for instance, that he favored selling off the TVA, and also attacked other popular programs. As recounted by Rick Perlstein, a Goldwater political biographer, at one rally in West Virginia, Goldwater “called the War on Poverty ‘plainly and simply a war on your pocketbooks,’ a fraud because only ‘the vast resources of private business’ could produce the wealth to truly slay penury.” Perlstein singled out the tin-eared cruelty of this message: “In the land of the tar-paper shack, the gap-toothed smile, and the open sewer—where the ‘vast resources of private business’ were represented in the person of the coal barons who gave men black lung, then sent them off to die without pensions—the message just sounded perverse. As he left, lines of workmen jeered him.”

Another factor also worked against Goldwater: he was a Republican, and the South reviled the Party of Lincoln. If across the nation neither party was seen as more or less friendly toward civil rights, the South had its own views on the question. There, it was the local Democratic machine that represented white interests, while the GOP was seen as the proximate cause of the Civil War and as the party of the carpetbaggers who had peremptorily ruled the South during Reconstruction. The hostility of generations of white Southerners toward Republicans only intensified with the Republican Eisenhower’s decision to send in federal troops to enforce the Republican Warren’s ruling forbidding school segregation in Brown. Most white Southerners had never voted Republican in their lives, and had vowed—like their parents and grandparents before them— that they never would.

Ultimately, however, these handicaps barely impeded Goldwater’s performance in the South. He convinced many Southern voters to vote Republican for the first time ever, and in the Deep South, comprised of those five states with the highest black populations, Goldwater won outright. The anti-New Deal Republican carried Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and South Carolina, states in which whites had never voted for a Republican president in more than miniscule numbers. This was a shocking transformation, one that can only be explained by Goldwater’s ability to transmit a set of codes that white voters readily understood as a promise to protect racial segregation. It seemed that voters simply ignored Goldwater’s philosophy of governance as well as his party affiliation and instead rewarded his hostility toward civil rights. In this sense, Goldwater’s conservatism operated in the South less like a genuine political ideology and more like Wallace’s soft porn racism: as a set of codes that voters readily understood as defending white supremacy. Goldwater didn’t win the South as a small-government libertarian, but rather as a racist.

If in the South race trumped anti-government politics, in the North Goldwater’s anti-civil rights attacks found much less traction. Opposing civil rights smacked too much of Southern intransigence, and while there was resistance to racial reform in the North, it had not yet become an overriding issue for many whites. That left Goldwater running on promises to end the New Deal, and this proved wildly unpopular. To campaign against liberalism in 1964 was to campaign against an activist government that had lifted the country out of the throes of a horrendous depression still squarely in the rear view mirror, and that had then launched millions into the middle class. More than that, though, to campaign against liberalism in 1964 was to attack government programs still largely aimed at whites—and that sort of welfare was broadly understood as legitimate and warranted

Goldwater’s anti-welfare tirades produced a landslide victory, but for Lyndon Johnson. Voters crushed Goldwater’s last-gasp attack on the New Deal state. Outside of the South, he lost by overwhelming numbers in every state except his Arizona home. Voters were offended by his over-the-top attacks on popular New Deal programs as well as by his penchant for saber rattling when it came to foreign policy. Goldwater especially suffered after the release of “Daisy,” a Johnson campaign ad that juxtaposed a little girl picking the petals off a flower with footage of a spiraling mushroom cloud, sending the message that Goldwater’s militarism threatened nuclear Armageddon. In the end, the Democrats succeeded in making Goldwater look like a loon. “To the Goldwater slogan ‘In Your Heart, You Know He’s Right,’ the Democrats shot back, ‘In Your Guts, You Know He’s Nuts.’ ” The country as a whole, it seemed, had solidly allied itself with progressive governance, and big-money/small-government conservatism was finally, utterly dead.

Or at least, this was the lesson most people took from the 1964 election. But like the clang of a distant alarm barely perceptible against the buzzing din of consensus, a warning was rising from the South: racial entreaties had convinced even the staunchest Democrats to abandon New Deal liberalism. If race-baiting had won over Southern whites to anti-government politics, could the same work across the country?

Richard Nixon

Notwithstanding the emerging racial strategy initiated by Goldwater, when Richard Nixon secured the Republican nomination in 1968, the new racial politics of his party had not yet gelled, either within the party generally, or in Nixon himself. Indeed, the moderate Nixon’s emergence as the party’s presidential candidate reflected the extent to which the Goldwater faction had lost credibility in the wake of their champion’s disastrous drubbing. Nevertheless, the dynamics of the presidential race would quickly push Nixon toward race-baiting. Nixon’s principal opponent in 1968 was Johnson’s vice president, Hubert Humphrey. But running as an independent candidate, George Wallace was flanking Nixon on the right. By October 1, just a month before the election, Wallace was polling more support in the South than either Humphrey or Nixon. Nor was his support limited to that region. Wallace was siphoning crucial votes across the country, and staging massive rallies in ostensibly liberal strongholds, for instance drawing 20,000 partisans to Madison Square Garden in New York, and 70,000 faithful to the Boston Common—more than any rally ever held by the Kennedys, Wallace liked to crow. Republican operatives guessed that perhaps 80 percent of the Wallace voters in the South would otherwise support Nixon, and a near-majority in the North as well.

Late in the campaign, Nixon opted to publicly tack right on race. He had already reached a backroom deal with South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond— an arch-segregationist who had led the revolt against the Democratic Party in 1948 when it endorsed a modest civil rights plank, and who switched to become a Republican in 1964 to throw his weight behind Goldwater. Nixon bought Thurmond’s support during the primary season by secretly promising that he would restrict federal enforcement of school desegregation in the South. Now he would make this same promise to the nation. On October 7, Nixon came out against “forced busing,” an increasingly potent euphemism for the system of transporting students across the boundaries of segregated neighborhoods in order to integrate schools. Mary Frances Berry pierces the pretense that the issue was putting one’s child on a bus: “African-American attempts to desegregate schools were confronted by white flight and complaints that the problem was not desegregation, but busing, oftentimes by people who sent their children to school every day on buses, including mediocre white private academies established to avoid integration.” “Busing” offered a Northern analog to states’ rights. The language may have referred to transportation, but the emotional wallop came from defiance toward integration.

Nixon also began to hammer away at the issue of law and order. In doing so, he drew upon a rhetorical frame rooted in Southern resistance to civil rights. From the inception of the civil rights movement in the 1950s, Southern politicians had disparaged racial activists as “lawbreakers,” as indeed technically they were. In the Jim Crow regions, African Americans had long pressed basic equality demands precisely by breaking laws mandating segregation: sit-ins and freedom rides purposefully violated Jim Crow statutes in order to challenge white supremacist social norms. Dismissing these protesters as criminals shifted the issue from a defense of white supremacy to a more neutral-seeming concern with “order,” while simultaneously stripping the activists of moral stature. Demonstrators were no longer Americans willing to risk beatings and even death for a grand ideal, but rather criminal lowlifes disposed toward antisocial behavior. Ultimately, the language of law and order justified a more “quiet” form of violence in defense of the racial status quo, replacing lynchings with mass arrests for trespassing and delinquency.

By the mid-1960s, “law and order” had become a surrogate expression for concern about the civil rights movement. Illustrating this rhetoric’s increasingly national reach, in 1965 FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover denounced the advocacy of nonviolent civil disobedience by civil rights leaders as a catalyst for lawbreaking and even violent rioting: “‘Civil disobedience,’ a seditious slogan of gross irresponsibility, has captured the imagination of citizens. ... I am greatly concerned that certain racial leaders are doing the civil rights movement a great disservice by suggesting that citizens need only obey the laws with which they agree. Such an attitude breeds disrespect for the law and even civil disorder and rioting.” This sense of growing disorder was accentuated by urban riots often involving protracted battles between the police and minority communities. In addition, large and increasingly angry protests against the Vietnam War also added to the fear of metastasizing social strife. Exploiting the growing panic that equated social protest with social chaos, one of Nixon’s campaign commercials showed flashing images of demonstrations, riots, police, and violence, over which a deep voice intoned: “Let us recognize that the first right of every American is to be free from domestic violence. So I pledge to you, we shall have order in the United States.” A caption stated boldly: “This time. . . . vote like your whole world depended on it ... NIXON.”

Nixon had mastered Wallace’s dark art. Forced bussing, law and order, and security from unrest as the essential civil right of the majority—all of these were coded phrases that allowed Nixon to appeal to racial fears without overtly mentioning race at all. Yet race remained the indisputable, intentional subtext of the appeal. As Nixon exulted after watching one of his own commercials: “Yep, this hits it right on the nose . . . it’s all about law and order and the damn Negro-Puerto Rican groups out there.”

Nixon didn’t campaign exclusively on racial themes; notably, he also stressed his opposition to anti-war protesters, while simultaneously portraying himself as the candidate most likely to bring the war to an end. Nevertheless, racial appeals formed an essential element of Nixon’s ’68 campaign. Nixon’s special counsel, John Ehrlichman, bluntly summarized that year’s campaign strategy: “We’ll go after the racists.” According to Ehrlichman, the “subliminal appeal to the anti-black voter was always present in Nixon’s statements and speeches.”

Nixon’s Southern Strategy

Nixon barely won in 1968, edging Humphrey by less than one percent of the national vote. Wallace, meanwhile, had captured nearly 14 percent of the vote. Had Nixon’s coded race-baiting helped? Initially there was uncertainty, and in his first two years in office Nixon governed as if he still believed the federal government had some role to play in helping out nonwhites. For instance, Nixon came into office proposing the idea of a flat wealth transfer to the poor, which would have gone a long way toward breaking down racial inequalities. But over the course of those two years, a new understanding consolidated regarding the tidal shift that had occurred.

On the Democratic side, in 1970 two pollsters, Richard Scammon and Ben Wattenberg, published The Real Majority, cautioning their party that “Social Issues” now divided the base. “The machinist’s wife in Dayton may decide to leave the Democratic reservation in 1972 and vote for Nixon or Wallace or their ideological descendants,” Scammon and Wattenberg warned. “If she thinks the Democrats feel that she isn’t scared of crime but that she’s really a bigot, if she thinks that Democrats feel the police are Fascist pigs and the Black Panthers and the Weathermen are just poor, misunderstood, picked-upon kids, if she thinks that Democrats are for the hip drug culture and that she, the machinist’s wife, is not only a bigot, but a square, then good-bye lady—and good-bye Democrats.” How, then, could the party get ahead of these issues? Scammon and Wattenberg were frank: “The Democrats in the South were hurt by being perceived (correctly) as a pro-black national party.” The solution was clear: the Democratic Party had to temper its “pro-black stance.”

On the Republican side, a leading Nixon strategist had come to the same conclusion about race as a potential wedge issue—though, predictably, with a different prescription. In 1969, Kevin Phillips published The Emerging Republican Majority, arguing that because of racial resentments a historical realignment was underway that would cement a new Republican majority that would endure for decades. A young prodigy obsessed with politics, Phillips had worked out the details of his argument in the mid-1960s, and then had gone to work helping to elect Nixon. When the 1968 returns seemed to confirm his thesis, he published his research—nearly 500 pages, with 47 maps and 143 charts. Beneath the details, Phillips had a simple, even deterministic thesis: “Historically, our party system has reflected layer upon layer of group oppositions.” Politics, according to Phillips, turned principally on group animosity—“the prevailing cleavages in American voting behavior have been ethnic and cultural. Politically, at least, the United States has not been a very effective melting pot.”

As to what was driving the latest realignment, Phillips was blunt: “The Negro problem, having become a national rather than a local one, is the principal cause of the breakup of the New Deal coalition.” For Phillips, it was almost inevitable that most whites would abandon the Democratic Party once it became identified with blacks. “Ethnic and cultural division has so often shaped American politics that, given the immense midcentury impact of Negro enfranchisement and integration, reaction to this change almost inevitably had to result in political realignment.” Phillips saw his emerging Republican majority this way: “the nature of the majority—or potential majority—seems clear. It is largely white and middle class. It is concentrated in the South, the West, and suburbia.”

The number crunchers had spoken. The Southern strategy, incipient for a decade, had matured into a clear route to electoral dominance. The old Democratic alliance of Northeastern liberals, the white working class, Northern blacks, and Southern Democrats, could be riven by racial appeals. Beginning in 1970, Richard Nixon embraced the politics of racial division wholeheartedly. He abandoned the idea of a flat wealth transfer to the poor. Now, Nixon repeatedly emphasized law and order issues. He railed against forced busing in the North. He reversed the federal government’s position on Southern school integration, slowing the process down and making clear that the courts would have no help from his administration. But perhaps nothing symbolized the new Nixon more than his comments in December 1970. Reflecting his initially moderate position on domestic issues, early in his administration Nixon had appointed George Romney—a liberal Republican and, incidentally, Mitt Romney’s father—as his secretary of housing and urban development. In turn, Romney had made integration of the suburbs his special mission, even coming up with a plan to cut off federal funds to communities that refused to allow integrated housing. By late 1970, however, when these jurisdictions howled at the temerity, Nixon took their side, throwing his cabinet officer under the bus. In a public address, Nixon baldly stated: “I can assure you that it is not the policy of this government to use the power of the federal government . . . for forced integration of the suburbs. I believe that forced integration of the suburbs is not in the national interest.”41 That dog whistle blasted like the shriek of an onrushing train.

In 1963, Robert Novak had written that many Republican leaders were intent on converting the Party of Lincoln into the White Man’s Party. The following year, Goldwater went down in crushing defeat, winning only 36 percent of the white vote. Even so, less than a decade later, the racial transmogrification of the Republicans was well underway. In 1972, Nixon’s first full dog whistle campaign netted him 67 percent of the white vote, leaving his opponent, George McGovern, with support from less than one in three whites. Defeated by the Southern strategy, McGovern neatly summed it up: “What is the Southern Strategy? It is this. It says to the South: Let the poor stay poor, let your economy trail the nation, forget about decent homes and medical care for all your people, choose officials who will oppose every effort to benefit the many at the expense of the few—and in return, we will try to overlook the rights of the black man, appoint a few southerners to high office, and lift your spirits by attacking the ‘eastern establishment’ whose bank accounts we are filling with your labor and your industry.”42 McGovern erred in supposing that the Southern strategy pertained only to the South. Nixon had already learned from Wallace, and then later from the number crunchers, that coded racial appeals would work nationwide. Other than that, especially in its class and race dimensions, McGovern had dog whistle politics dead to rights.

There’s a simple reason President Barack Obama is using his bully pulpit to focus the nation’s attention on the battle over the budget: In this fight, he’s watching Republicans take swings at each other.

And that GOP fight is a lifeline for an administration that had been scrambling to gain control its message after battling congressional Democrats on the potential use of military force in Syria and the possible nomination of Larry Summers to run the Federal Reserve.

If House Republicans and Obama can’t cut even a short-term deal for a continuing resolution, the government’s authority to spend money will run out on Oct. 1. Within weeks, the nation will default on its debt if an agreement isn’t reached to raise the federal debt limit.

For some Republicans, those deadlines represent a leverage point that can be used to force Obama to slash his health care law. For others, they’re a zero hour at which the party will implode if it doesn’t cut a deal.

Meanwhile, “on the looming fiscal issues, Democrats — both liberal and conservative, executive and congressional — are virtually 100 percent united,” said Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.).

Just a few days ago, all that Obama and his aides could talk about were Syria and Summers. Now, they’re bringing their party together and shining a white hot light on Republican disunity over whether to shut down the government and plunge the nation into default in a vain effort to stop Obamacare from going into effect.

And it’s so important to the president’s strategy that White House officials didn’t consider postponing Monday’s rollout of the most partisan and high-stakes phase even when a shooter murdered a dozen people at Washington’s Navy Yard that morning.

The basic storyline, well under way over the summer, was to have the president point to parts of his agenda, including reducing the costs of college and housing, designed to strengthen the middle class; use them to make the case that he not only saved the country from economic disaster but is fighting to bolster the nation’s finances on both the macro and household level; and then argue that Republicans’ desire to lock in the sequester and leverage a debt-ceiling increase for Obamacare cuts would reverse progress made.

The president is on firm ground, White House officials say, because he stands with the public in believing that the government shouldn’t shut down and that the country should pay its bills.

Democrats say their Syria fight looked like Yalta compared to the GOP’s “civil war” over Obamacare, the continuing resolution and the debt limit. Still, Obama spent the first weeks of September making the case for a military strike that was unpopular not just with the public but with his own Democratic allies in Congress. At worst, it was a demonstration that he has lost influence on Capitol Hill and within his own party. At best, it was a major message distraction.

Carney alluded to the lost Syria weeks on Monday when he said “time is short” for the president to make his case before the deadline for extending government funding.

But over the past 10 years, immigration has become a partisan issue.

This change isn't just a shift in where politicians take certain policy questions. It's also a change in whether Americans think that immigrants, in general, are a good thing for America:

This is about culture first, and politics second

To a certain extent, polarization on immigration in Washington and polarization among voters reinforce each other.

In 2005, when comprehensive immigration reform was a key priority of President George W. Bush, Republicans and Democrats were about equally likely to think that immigrants strengthened America. Once Bush's successor, Barack Obama, started stressing the need for comprehensive immigration reform, though, Republicans were much less likely to look favorably on immigrants — according to Pew's findings, Republican attitudes changed precipitously between late 2009 and summer 2010.

Historically, even the ""anti-amnesty"" politicians who opposed comprehensive immigration reform stressed that immigrants were welcome in America as long as they came (and stayed) legally. For most Americans, though, the difference that matters isn't between legal and unauthorized immigrants — it's between immigrants they find likely to assimilate into ""American culture"" and those who (they believe) cannot.

Related How Americans really feel about immigrants

Americans are much more ambivalent about immigrants, in general, than you might expect from listening to politicians talk about immigration — or than you might guess by looking at polling for various immigration reform proposals.

For many white Americans over the past couple of decades, that ambivalence has hardened into a constellation of stereotypes: associating ""immigrant"" with ""illegal immigrant,"" ""illegal immigrant"" with ""Latino immigrant,"" and ""Latino immigrant"" with ""criminal.""

This is the genius of Donald Trump's presidential campaign: His rhetoric homes in directly on the things that actually worry many Americans about immigrants, rather than using economic or legal arguments as a way to gesture toward cultural fears.

But as the chart shows, Trump wasn't just exploiting a sentiment among American voters — he's exploiting a sentiment among specifically Republican voters.

Anti-Latino sentiment has consolidated in the GOP

The changes shown in the Pew chart don't just reflect Democrats or Republicans changing their minds about whether immigrants are good for America. (In fact, most of the people changing their minds are embracing immigrants; overall, the most recent Pew poll found 59 percent of Americans agree that immigration strengthens the country, which is the highest level of support in 20 years.)

They reflect changes in who identifies as a Republican or a Democrat.

Over the past 20 years, the Democratic Party has gotten markedly more ethnically diverse...

...as white voters have increasingly identified with Republicans:

Not all of the white voters who have switched parties are motivated by anti-Latino sentiment. But the voters who are motivated by anti-Latino sentiment are particularly likely to have switched parties.

Before 2000, there was a correlation between negative feelings toward Latinos and identifying as strongly Republican. But that was just a side effect; how people felt toward black Americans was a much better predictor of how strongly they identified with the GOP.

In the 21st century, the two have diverged. All else being equal — even sentiment toward African Americans — a white American in 2008 who felt negatively toward Latinos was likely to be more strongly Republican (one-third of a point on a seven-point scale from strong Republican to strong Democrat) than someone who felt positively toward them.

There's no indication that the trend has abated since 2008. Indeed, the Pew polling shows that sentiment toward immigrants among Republicans hit new lows in May 2015, with only 27 percent of Republicans saying immigrants strengthened America. That was just before Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign.

While Donald Trump didn't make Republicans wary of immigrants' effect on America, though, he does appear to have made the remaining skeptics in the Democratic Party embrace them.

In May 2015, on the eve of Trump's campaign launch, 62 percent of Democrats said that immigrants strengthened America. In March 2016, 78 percent said they did — a 16-percentage-point jump.

That's the biggest reason pro-immigrant sentiment is at a 20-year high: The Democrats who hadn't already embraced immigrants are doing so now.

If that holds, it will complete the last phase of the partisanization of immigration. Republican voters are already fairly united in their distrust of immigrants, and many Republican politicians are following their lead. Democratic politicians, meanwhile, are fairly united in their support of immigrants. And now, Democratic voters appear to be embracing their identity as the pro-immigrant party.",www.vox.com,left,yCC1H9PMe8ARRjgU

He does not have the infrastructure , he does not have the organization , he does not have the discipline . So why are so many Republican ThoughtLeaders intent on casting him from the race like a leper ?
Why does Senator Marco Rubio ( R-FL ) say that Trump should be “ disqualified ” from the race ? Why does Governor Rick Perry ( R-TX ) say that Trump is a “ cancer on conservatism ” that must be “ discarded , ” a “ barking carnival act ” ? Why does Senator John McCain ( R-AZ ) deride Trump ’ s supporters as “ crazies , ” while the rest of the Republican establishment nods silently ?
The answer , of course , is no . Alienating Trump ’ s voting base will lead Trump to run third party , destroying any opportunity for Republicans to beat Hillary Clinton . Establishment characters calling curses from the heavens down upon Trump grants him credibility with the same group of conservatives who believe that establishment attacks are a badge of honor . If those conservatives feel Trump is treated unfairly , it will widen the gap between the donors in the Republican Party and the base of the Republican Party .
Republicans should , instead , see Trump ’ s presence in the race as a grand opportunity . That ’ s because it is an opportunity . Here are seven reasons why :
Trump Is A Stalking Horse . Let ’ s imagine that you could design a candidate who would draw nearly 100 % of the media attention at the beginning of a race , long before polls mattered or primaries were scheduled to take place . Let ’ s also imagine that this candidate had no real shot at winning any of those primaries , and that the candidate would eventually either blow himself out or fade away after the curiosity factor worked its way through the public system . Wouldn ’ t you , as a rival candidate , beg for such a candidate to enter the race ? After all , it would give you the ability to raise money quietly , do grassroots work without media scrutiny ; it would force the media to lavish its attention on your rivals across the political aisle while spending their focus on this Big Name Candidate . That candidate is Trump . According to polls from Colorado , Iowa , and Virginia this week , Hillary Clinton loses to Rubio , Governor Scott Walker ( R-WI ) , and former Governor Jeb Bush ( R-FL ) . Does that happen if the media spend all their time and effort debunking those three candidates ? Or does it happen because the media are so distracted by Trump that the other three get an opportunity to fly under the radar ? Barack Obama was able to use Hillary Clinton ’ s high name recognition in 2008 to fly under the radar all the way to the nomination ; by the time Hillary tried to define him , it was too late . Other Republicans could do the same here .
Trump Generates Attention . Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani recently pointed out , “ Trump is in that debate , it ’ s going to get three times the audience. ” That ’ s exactly right . Primary debates aren ’ t exclusively designed to help Republicans pick their candidate – the debates are also designed to allow future general election voters to get first impressions of the other candidates . The more direct contact between voters and candidates without the filter of the media , the better . Furthermore , Republicans have been caught in the vice of media malpractice when it comes to issues like illegal immigration : the media won ’ t cover such issues unless a Republican makes a mistake , in which case the cameras descend en masse . Trump solves that conundrum : he says outrageous things , the media show up , and the other candidates get a chance to speak rationally on topics the media nearly always ignore . Never underestimate the benefit of someone who can bring busloads of media down to Laredo , Texas just to listen to him talk .
Trump Draws Contrast With Other Candidates . So , you don ’ t like Trump . Then you should love Trump in the race , given that he offers the greatest opportunity to his rivals to draw a contrast . Senator Lindsey Graham ( R-SC ) is charmless and vanilla as a politician – and even he has become likeable in response to Trump . If Governor Rick Perry ( R-TX ) seeks to become a beloved figure in mainstream media circles , all he has to do is continue to attack Trump . If Jeb Bush doesn ’ t like Trump ’ s position on immigration , Trump provides him a painless opportunity for a Sister Souljah moment . Free debate is the essence of primary season . Embrace it , or fall to the power of Trump .
Trump Attacks The Media . In 2012 , Newt Gingrich played the designated anti-media attack dog . He did it well , and he did it effectively : it moved him to the top of the polls . Trump does the same now . He has rhetorically punched members of the media ranging from CNN ’ s Anderson Cooper to MSNBC and Telemundo ’ s Jose Diaz Balart . He seems uncowed by media pressure – in fact , he embraces it . Were Trump not attacking the media , someone else would have to do it . Thankfully , other Republicans like Carly Fiorina have jumped on the anti-media bandwagon , and are punching just as effectively – or even more effectively – than The Donald .
Trump Channels Anger . Republicans seem pathologically fearful of the anger of their base . Taught by the media that “ angry white men ” can not fuel a party , they instead insist that they will out-compassion the left , a foolhardy proposition given that the left ’ s only calling card is compassion . Never mind that the left has consistently fueled its campaigns with rage against George W. Bush , “ white privilege , ” sexism , and other built-up monsters . The right has internalized criticisms that it must never humor the justified anger of its base . Not Trump . Trump embraces the feeling of frustration from the base , and does so in unapologetic fashion . That unapologetic nature is attractive to conservatives who feel as though they have elected Republicans , then watched those same Republicans surrender again and again . Other Republicans should watch Trump ’ s outrage-channeling and take notes .
Trump Doesn ’ t Buy Into Foolish Demographic Arguments . For years , the establishment Republicans have been telling the base to shut up on immigration ; if they don ’ t , the argument goes , then Hispanics will vote heavily Democrat , shutting Republicans out of political power . Immediately after the 2012 election , for example , Charles Krauthammer wrote , “ They should be a natural Republican constituency : striving immigrant community , religious , Catholic , family-oriented and socially conservative ( on abortion , for example ) . The principle reason they go Democratic is the issue of illegal immigrants. ” This is nonsense . Hispanic immigrants lean heavily left on most major issues . More importantly , running from the immigration issue , and thereby alienating the Republican base , doesn ’ t move Republicans closer to victory : Mitt Romney could have won 69 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2012 and still have lost . Romney lost not because Hispanics didn ’ t vote his way , but because white turnout was too low , and because he didn ’ t drive outsized turnout from Evangelical Christians , among others . As Sean Trende of RealClearPolitics told Politico today , “ Certainly the GOP shouldn ’ t be antagonistic to Hispanics , but the big question is how much outreach should they do before they start to turn off working-class white voters . Because from an Electoral College numbers perspective , the net gain in embracing some form of immigration reform just isn ’ t there . ”
Trump Doesn ’ t Suck Money Out Of The Race . For all the talk of Trump as a distraction , he certainly doesn ’ t suck money out of the Republican race : in his last FEC filing , filed last week , Trump had drawn just over 60 donors . He ’ s self-funding .
Trump is doing a lot of good for the Republican Party in terms of exposure , media misdirection , and issue-raising ; he ’ s firing up the base , allowing his opponents to draw contrasts with him , and he ’ s doing it all without tapping out those who want to give cash . If Republicans can ’ t beat him , what chance do they have of touching Hillary Clinton ? They ought to stop whining and start taking notes – or at least making hay while the media sun shines on The Donald .

Less than 72 hours before polls opened in Wisconsin on 7 April , the state legislature convened to weigh an emergency request from the governor , Tony Evers . With Covid-19 cases in the thousands , Evers implored the lawmakers to delay in-person voting for the state ’ s presidential primary and mail a ballot to every voter in the state .
It was a meeting only in name . Republicans , who control 63 of 99 seats in the state assembly , sent just one member . He brought the session to order and then immediately ended it without taking up the governor ’ s request . It took just 17 seconds . In the Republican-controlled state senate , the same thing happened , according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel . It took even less time .
The legislature ’ s defiance was a naked display of unabashed power – an elected body refusing its governor ’ s request and turning its back on its constituents in a time of crisis .
I don ’ t think many people who are aware of what ’ s going on would say that it ’ s anything even resembling a democracy Jay Heck of Common Cause
The Republican lawmakers who didn ’ t even bother to show up for the emergency session on Saturday knew that their re-election was guaranteed because of a successful party effort over the last 10 years to entrench themselves in power . Even in a state at the center of some of the most hard-nosed fights over voting , it was a stunning series of events .
That assault on democracy began in 2011 , when Republicans drew new lines for political districts in Wisconsin . It was part of a national Republican effort , called Project Redmap , to capture state legislatures and , with those victories , to gain control over redrawing the lines of each district . The goal of Redmap was to conjure districts that would advantage Republicans and disadvantage Democrats – a process called gerrymandering . The writer and author David Daley called Project Redmap “ the most audacious political heist of modern times ” .
Karl Rove , former senior adviser to George W Bush announced the redistricting effort in the Wall Street Journal , claiming , rightly , that whoever controls redistricting also controls Congress . Later , according to the New Yorker , when Rove addressed potential funders of Redmap in Dallas , he said “ People call us a vast rightwing conspiracy . But we ’ re really a half-assed rightwing conspiracy . Now it ’ s time to get serious . ”
Wisconsin proves it : Republicans will sacrifice voters ' health to keep power Read more
For $ 1.1m – a small sum in campaign dollars – Republicans won the state legislature and went on to curb Democratic power by passing a strict voter ID law , making it harder for minorities and students to vote , and later stripped statewide elected officials of some of their authority .
“ I don ’ t think many people who are aware of what ’ s going on , and are tuned into politics and government in this state , would say that it ’ s anything even resembling a democracy , ” said Jay Heck , the executive director of the Wisconsin chapter of Common Cause , a government watchdog group .
On Tuesday , voters risked their lives to go to the polls , waiting hours in line in Milwaukee . So far , turnout looks like it will be a fraction of what it was in 2016 , and that is believed to benefit Republicans , who were seeking to maintain control of a seat on the conservative-leaning state supreme court . It was the state supreme court who voted along partisan lines to overrule Evers ’ last-minute effort and to allow the election to move forward .
Wisconsin had long held a reputation as a bipartisan state , and there had been fights over redistricting before . But in 2011 , Republicans took it to a new level . They deployed mapmakers to the offices of a law firm across from the state capitol , where they drew different options for maps that tested how much of an advantage could be gained in districts . They closely regulated who had access to the room where maps were drawn , even requiring Republican lawmakers to sign agreements to keep discussions about the maps secret .
Republicans understood that they were drawing maps to maintain power far beyond that year . “ The maps we pass will determine who ’ s here 10 years from now , ” one memo at the time read . One assembly district belonging to Andy Jorgensen , a Democrat in the state general assembly , was cracked into four different Republican-friendly districts , Daley wrote in Ratf * * ked : Why Your Vote Doesn ’ t Count .
The plan worked almost exactly as the mapmakers predicted . In 2012 , the first election with the new map in place , Republicans won less than half the votes , but conquered 60 of the state ’ s 99 assembly seats . The Republicans grew their majority in 2014 and 2016 , despite earning just over 50 % of the statewide vote .
Republicans could act brazenly without fear because gerrymandered maps make it impossible for them to lose their majority Michael Li , a voting rights expert at the Brennan Center at NYU
“ It seems impervious to what happens with voters , ” said Barry Burden , director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison . “ It really looks like an unresponsive institution . ”
Michael Li , a voting rights expert at the non-partisan Brennan Center at NYU , wrote this week : “ Wisconsin ’ s maps are so gerrymandered that Republicans can win close to a supermajority of house seats with a minority of the vote .
“ Republicans could act brazenly without fear of electoral blowback because gerrymandered maps make it virtually impossible for them to ever lose their legislative majority , ” he wrote . Wisconsin ’ s maps were crafted with such micro-precision that even if Democrats managed to win a historically high 54 % of the two-party vote – a level they ’ ve reached only once in the last 20 years – Republicans would still end up with a solid nine-seat majority in the state assembly . ”
As the gerrymandering project wore on in 2011 , Republicans also drafted one of the strictest voter ID laws in the country . It required Wisconsin voters to present a form of photo ID such as a driver ’ s license or passport to vote . Students could only use their school IDs if they contained a signature and an expiration date .
Despite efforts to block it in court , the law went into effect for the first time in 2016 . One study estimated the law could have deterred as many as 23,252 people from voting in Milwaukee and Dane counties , two of the state ’ s largest , and both Democratic strongholds . Donald Trump won the state by just under 23,000 votes .
They view this as an opportunity to extend one-party in this rule in this state for another 10 years Jay Heck of Common Cause
Ruth Greenwood , an attorney at the Campaign Legal Center , said the link between voter ID laws and gerrymandering was undeniable . “ It definitely all feeds on itself , ” she said . “ Gerrymandering has meant there are less competitive elections and Republicans know they can maintain the majority . So they continue to restrict the electorate to advantage themselves . ”
A few weeks after the 2016 election , Greenwood and a team of lawyers helped convince a three-judge panel to strike down the gerrymandered assembly map , saying it was so severely manipulated that it violated the US constitution . But in 2018 , the US supreme court , in a 5-4 vote , overruled the lower court on technical grounds and sent the case back for further review . One year later , it would rule that federal courts could do nothing to stop partisan gerrymandering .
The maps Republicans secretly drew in 2011 laid the foundation for the power they used to force an unprecedented election on Tuesday . Had it not been for gerrymandering , voters in the state might not have had to risk their health to vote , said Nicholas Stephanopoulos , another lawyer who helped challenge the assembly map in federal court .
“ If you had fair maps , you would have an evenly divided legislature ; you might well have a Democratic legislature , given how well Democrats did in 2018 , ” he said . “ They might have gone along with the governor and agreed to sensible changes in the election schedule and the manner of conducting the election . ”
One of the politicians able to consolidate the most power in Wisconsin is Republican Robin Vos , the speaker of the state assembly . In addition to rebuffing Evers ’ efforts to postpone the election , Vos blamed Milwaukee officials for warning it wasn ’ t safe to run Tuesday ’ s election .
On election day , Vos volunteered at the polls . Speaking to reporters , he again brushed off concerns about holding elections . Dressed head-to-toe in protective equipment , he gave incorrect information about how to request an absentee ballot , before proclaiming it was “ perfectly safe to go out ” .","The state’s holding of a primary during a pandemic is just the latest example of Republicans’ naked bid to keep power at all costs

I don’t think many people who are aware of what’s going on would say that it’s anything even resembling a democracy Jay Heck of Common Cause

The Republican lawmakers who didn’t even bother to show up for the emergency session on Saturday knew that their re-election was guaranteed because of a successful party effort over the last 10 years to entrench themselves in power. Even in a state at the center of some of the most hard-nosed fights over voting, it was a stunning series of events.

That assault on democracy began in 2011, when Republicans drew new lines for political districts in Wisconsin. It was part of a national Republican effort, called Project Redmap, to capture state legislatures and, with those victories, to gain control over redrawing the lines of each district. The goal of Redmap was to conjure districts that would advantage Republicans and disadvantage Democrats – a process called gerrymandering. The writer and author David Daley called Project Redmap “the most audacious political heist of modern times”.

Karl Rove, former senior adviser to George W Bush announced the redistricting effort in the Wall Street Journal, claiming, rightly, that whoever controls redistricting also controls Congress. Later, according to the New Yorker, when Rove addressed potential funders of Redmap in Dallas, he said “People call us a vast rightwing conspiracy. But we’re really a half-assed rightwing conspiracy. Now it’s time to get serious.”

For $1.1m – a small sum in campaign dollars – Republicans won the state legislature and went on to curb Democratic power by passing a strict voter ID law, making it harder for minorities and students to vote, and later stripped statewide elected officials of some of their authority.

“I don’t think many people who are aware of what’s going on, and are tuned into politics and government in this state, would say that it’s anything even resembling a democracy,” said Jay Heck, the executive director of the Wisconsin chapter of Common Cause, a government watchdog group.

On Tuesday, voters risked their lives to go to the polls, waiting hours in line in Milwaukee. So far, turnout looks like it will be a fraction of what it was in 2016, and that is believed to benefit Republicans, who were seeking to maintain control of a seat on the conservative-leaning state supreme court. It was the state supreme court who voted along partisan lines to overrule Evers’ last-minute effort and to allow the election to move forward.

Wisconsin had long held a reputation as a bipartisan state, and there had been fights over redistricting before. But in 2011, Republicans took it to a new level. They deployed mapmakers to the offices of a law firm across from the state capitol, where they drew different options for maps that tested how much of an advantage could be gained in districts. They closely regulated who had access to the room where maps were drawn, even requiring Republican lawmakers to sign agreements to keep discussions about the maps secret.

Republicans understood that they were drawing maps to maintain power far beyond that year. “The maps we pass will determine who’s here 10 years from now,” one memo at the time read. One assembly district belonging to Andy Jorgensen, a Democrat in the state general assembly, was cracked into four different Republican-friendly districts, Daley wrote in Ratf**ked: Why Your Vote Doesn’t Count.

The plan worked almost exactly as the mapmakers predicted. In 2012, the first election with the new map in place, Republicans won less than half the votes, but conquered 60 of the state’s 99 assembly seats. The Republicans grew their majority in 2014 and 2016, despite earning just over 50% of the statewide vote.

Republicans could act brazenly without fear because gerrymandered maps make it impossible for them to lose their majority Michael Li, a voting rights expert at the Brennan Center at NYU

“It seems impervious to what happens with voters,” said Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “It really looks like an unresponsive institution.”

Michael Li, a voting rights expert at the non-partisan Brennan Center at NYU, wrote this week: “Wisconsin’s maps are so gerrymandered that Republicans can win close to a supermajority of house seats with a minority of the vote.

“Republicans could act brazenly without fear of electoral blowback because gerrymandered maps make it virtually impossible for them to ever lose their legislative majority,” he wrote. Wisconsin’s maps were crafted with such micro-precision that even if Democrats managed to win a historically high 54% of the two-party vote – a level they’ve reached only once in the last 20 years – Republicans would still end up with a solid nine-seat majority in the state assembly.”

As the gerrymandering project wore on in 2011, Republicans also drafted one of the strictest voter ID laws in the country. It required Wisconsin voters to present a form of photo ID such as a driver’s license or passport to vote. Students could only use their school IDs if they contained a signature and an expiration date.

Despite efforts to block it in court, the law went into effect for the first time in 2016. One study estimated the law could have deterred as many as 23,252 people from voting in Milwaukee and Dane counties, two of the state’s largest, and both Democratic strongholds. Donald Trump won the state by just under 23,000 votes.

They view this as an opportunity to extend one-party in this rule in this state for another 10 years Jay Heck of Common Cause

Ruth Greenwood, an attorney at the Campaign Legal Center, said the link between voter ID laws and gerrymandering was undeniable. “It definitely all feeds on itself,” she said. “Gerrymandering has meant there are less competitive elections and Republicans know they can maintain the majority. So they continue to restrict the electorate to advantage themselves.”

A few weeks after the 2016 election, Greenwood and a team of lawyers helped convince a three-judge panel to strike down the gerrymandered assembly map, saying it was so severely manipulated that it violated the US constitution. But in 2018, the US supreme court, in a 5-4 vote, overruled the lower court on technical grounds and sent the case back for further review. One year later, it would rule that federal courts could do nothing to stop partisan gerrymandering.

•••

The maps Republicans secretly drew in 2011 laid the foundation for the power they used to force an unprecedented election on Tuesday. Had it not been for gerrymandering, voters in the state might not have had to risk their health to vote, said Nicholas Stephanopoulos, another lawyer who helped challenge the assembly map in federal court.

“If you had fair maps, you would have an evenly divided legislature; you might well have a Democratic legislature, given how well Democrats did in 2018,” he said. “They might have gone along with the governor and agreed to sensible changes in the election schedule and the manner of conducting the election.”

One of the politicians able to consolidate the most power in Wisconsin is Republican Robin Vos, the speaker of the state assembly. In addition to rebuffing Evers’ efforts to postpone the election, Vos blamed Milwaukee officials for warning it wasn’t safe to run Tuesday’s election.

On election day, Vos volunteered at the polls. Speaking to reporters, he again brushed off concerns about holding elections. Dressed head-to-toe in protective equipment, he gave incorrect information about how to request an absentee ballot, before proclaiming it was “perfectly safe to go out”.",www.theguardian.com,left,cdsTfNfW9VGHvkGN

Literally.,2015-05-17,"Alexandra Glorioso, Daniel J. Mcgraw, Mark Brzezinski, Bjorn Lyrvall, Stan Greenberg, Jim Messina","Daniel J. McGraw is a political writer living in Lakewood , Ohio .
It turns out that one of the Grand Old Party ’ s biggest—and least discussed—challenges going into 2016 is lying in plain sight , written right into the party ’ s own nickname . The Republican Party voter is old—and getting older , and as the adage goes , there are two certainties in life : Death and taxes . Right now , both are enemies of the GOP and they might want to worry more about the former than the latter .
There ’ s been much written about how millennials are becoming a reliable voting bloc for Democrats , but there ’ s been much less attention paid to one of the biggest get-out-the-vote challenges for the Republican Party heading into the next presidential election : Hundreds of thousands of their traditional core supporters won ’ t be able to turn out to vote at all .
Since the average Republican is significantly older than the average Democrat , far more Republicans than Democrats have died since the 2012 elections . To make matters worse , the GOP is attracting fewer first-time voters . Unless the party is able to make inroads with new voters , or discover a fountain of youth , the GOP ’ s slow demographic slide will continue election to election . Actuarial tables make that part clear , but just how much of a problem for the GOP is this ?
Since it appears that no political data geek keeps track of voters who die between elections , I took it upon myself to do some basic math . And that quick back-of-the-napkin math shows that the trend could have a real effect in certain states , and make a battleground states like Florida and Ohio even harder for the Republican Party to capture .
By combining presidential election exit polls with mortality rates per age group from the U.S. Census Bureau , I calculated that , of the 61 million who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 , about 2.75 million will be dead by the 2016 election . President Barack Obama ’ s voters , of course , will have died too—about 2.3 million of the 66 million who voted for the president won ’ t make it to 2016 either . That leaves a big gap in between , a difference of roughly 453,000 in favor of the Democrats .
Here is the methodology , using one age group as an example : According to exit polls , 5,488,091 voters aged 60 to 64 years old supported Romney in 2012 . The mortality rate for that age group is 1,047.3 deaths per 100,000 , which means that 57,475 of those voters died by the end of 2013 . Multiply that number by four , and you get 229,900 Romney voters aged 60-to-64 who will be deceased by Election Day 2016 . Doing the same calculation across the range of demographic slices pulled from exit polls and census numbers allows one to calculate the total voter deaths . It ’ s a rough calculation , to be sure , and there are perhaps ways to move the numbers a few thousand this way or that , but by and large , this methodology at least establishes the rough scale of the problem for the Republicans—a problem measured in the mid-hundreds of thousands of lost voters by November 2016 . To the best of my knowledge , no one has calculated or published better voter death data before .
“ I ’ ve never seen anyone doing any studies on how many dead people can ’ t vote , ” laughs William Frey , senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in demographic studies . “ I ’ ve seen studies on how many dead people do vote . The old Daley Administration in Chicago was very good at that . ”
Frey points out that , since Republicans are getting whiter and older , replacing the voters that leave this earth with young ones is essential for them to be competitive in presidential elections . But the key question is whether these election death rates will make any real difference . There are so many other variables that dead voters aren ’ t necessarily going to be a decisive factor .
“ The [ GOP ] does rely too much on older and white voters , and especially in rural areas , deaths from this group can be significant , ” Frey says . “ But millennials ( born 1981 to 1997 ) now are larger in numbers than baby boomers ( [ born ] 1946 to 1964 ) , and how they vote will make the big difference . And the data says that if Republicans focus on economic issues and stay away from social ones like gay marriage , they can make serious inroads with millennials . ”
But what if Republicans aren ’ t able to win over a larger share of the youth vote ? In 2012 , there were about 13 million in the 15-to-17 year-old demo who will be eligible to vote in 2016 . The previous few presidential election cycles indicate that about 45 percent of these youngsters will actually vote , meaning that there will about 6 million new voters total . Exit polling indicates that age bracket has split about 65-35 in favor of the Dems in the past two elections . If that split holds true in 2016 , Democrats will have picked up a two million vote advantage among first-time voters . These numbers combined with the voter death data puts Republicans at an almost 2.5 million voter disadvantage going into 2016 .","Daniel J. McGraw is a political writer living in Lakewood, Ohio.

Right now, both are enemies of the GOP and they might want to worry more about the former than the latter.

There’s been much written about how millennials are becoming a reliable voting bloc for Democrats, but there’s been much less attention paid to one of the biggest get-out-the-vote challenges for the Republican Party heading into the next presidential election: Hundreds of thousands of their traditional core supporters won’t be able to turn out to vote at all.

Story Continued Below

The party’s core is dying off by the day.

Since the average Republican is significantly older than the average Democrat, far more Republicans than Democrats have died since the 2012 elections. To make matters worse, the GOP is attracting fewer first-time voters. Unless the party is able to make inroads with new voters, or discover a fountain of youth, the GOP’s slow demographic slide will continue election to election. Actuarial tables make that part clear, but just how much of a problem for the GOP is this?

Since it appears that no political data geek keeps track of voters who die between elections, I took it upon myself to do some basic math. And that quick back-of-the-napkin math shows that the trend could have a real effect in certain states, and make a battleground states like Florida and Ohio even harder for the Republican Party to capture.

By combining presidential election exit polls with mortality rates per age group from the U.S. Census Bureau, I calculated that, of the 61 million who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, about 2.75 million will be dead by the 2016 election. President Barack Obama’s voters, of course, will have died too—about 2.3 million of the 66 million who voted for the president won’t make it to 2016 either. That leaves a big gap in between, a difference of roughly 453,000 in favor of the Democrats.

Here is the methodology, using one age group as an example: According to exit polls, 5,488,091 voters aged 60 to 64 years old supported Romney in 2012. The mortality rate for that age group is 1,047.3 deaths per 100,000, which means that 57,475 of those voters died by the end of 2013. Multiply that number by four, and you get 229,900 Romney voters aged 60-to-64 who will be deceased by Election Day 2016. Doing the same calculation across the range of demographic slices pulled from exit polls and census numbers allows one to calculate the total voter deaths. It’s a rough calculation, to be sure, and there are perhaps ways to move the numbers a few thousand this way or that, but by and large, this methodology at least establishes the rough scale of the problem for the Republicans—a problem measured in the mid-hundreds of thousands of lost voters by November 2016. To the best of my knowledge, no one has calculated or published better voter death data before.

“I’ve never seen anyone doing any studies on how many dead people can’t vote,” laughs William Frey, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in demographic studies. “I’ve seen studies on how many dead people do vote. The old Daley Administration in Chicago was very good at that.”

Frey points out that, since Republicans are getting whiter and older, replacing the voters that leave this earth with young ones is essential for them to be competitive in presidential elections. But the key question is whether these election death rates will make any real difference. There are so many other variables that dead voters aren’t necessarily going to be a decisive factor.

“The [GOP] does rely too much on older and white voters, and especially in rural areas, deaths from this group can be significant,” Frey says. “But millennials (born 1981 to 1997) now are larger in numbers than baby boomers ([born] 1946 to 1964), and how they vote will make the big difference. And the data says that if Republicans focus on economic issues and stay away from social ones like gay marriage, they can make serious inroads with millennials.”

But what if Republicans aren’t able to win over a larger share of the youth vote? In 2012, there were about 13 million in the 15-to-17 year-old demo who will be eligible to vote in 2016. The previous few presidential election cycles indicate that about 45 percent of these youngsters will actually vote, meaning that there will about 6 million new voters total. Exit polling indicates that age bracket has split about 65-35 in favor of the Dems in the past two elections. If that split holds true in 2016, Democrats will have picked up a two million vote advantage among first-time voters. These numbers combined with the voter death data puts Republicans at an almost 2.5 million voter disadvantage going into 2016.",www.politico.com,left,9ssSw20o9DJRlxlb

But corporate sponsors are in no mood to celebrate .
Some of America ’ s largest corporations , which backed the Republican National Convention that nominated Mitt Romney in 2012 , are lurching away from sponsoring the 2016 confab . Under pressure from anti-Trump advocacy groups , corporations that have traditionally not hesitated to drop millions on national conventions are limiting their contributions and scaling back their activities .
Coca-Cola , for example , contributed $ 660,000 to the convention in 2012 but is dramatically drawing down the amount it is giving this year . The corporation gave $ 75,000 to both parties ’ conventions this time around , a company spokesman told The ███ , stressing that the contribution took place in 2015 . Coca-Cola has indicated to anti-Trump groups that it will not give any more .
And Microsoft , which contributed $ 1.5 million in cash and services to the Republican National Convention in 2012 , said in a press release just days ago that it “ decided last fall to provide a variety of Microsoft technology products and services instead of making a cash donation. ” If it did indeed make that decision last fall , it put off the announcement until just last week , after an anti-Trump coalition had began pounding its drums .
Citing the presumptive nominee ’ s history of xenophobic , sexist , and anti-Muslim comments , 24 organizations has banded together to pressure corporations to stop supporting the GOP convention .
“ Both Coca-Cola and Microsoft have agreed to end cash donations to political conventions that promote hate and bigotry , and we applaud their decision to do so , ” said Farhana Khera , the executive director of Muslim Advocates , which is part of the coalition . “ We hope that other companies will take their lead and send a strong message against hate . ”
Still , some of America ’ s largest technology companies are charging full steam ahead . AT & T , which provided $ 3 million in 2012 , will be an official communications provider for the July convention . Google will serve as the official livestream provider in Cleveland . And Facebook will support both Republican and Democratic conventions .
But silence from other major corporations on their expected contribution to the GOP convention , just days after Donald Trump sealed the nomination , speaks volumes .
Many of the 2012 Republican convention ’ s biggest sponsors didn ’ t respond to requests for comment from The ███ , including the American Petroleum Institute , Florida Power and Light , and Lockheed Martin , which were responsible for combined millions in contributions last cycle .
Sheldon Adelson contributed $ 5 million to the 2012 convention , making him the largest individual donor , but a spokesman didn ’ t respond to a question about this year ’ s convention . Marketing Solution Publications , run by financier William Edwards , gave the largest corporate donation last cycle at $ 4 million . But Edwards had nothing to say after The ███ called his office asking if he would re-up this year .
Or , as in the case of Walmart , companies said they had not yet made up their mind about whether they would sponsor the convention , less than three months before the event .
In off-the-record asides , corporation spokespersons insisted to The ███ that the convention is really about supporting the city of Cleveland , or the democratic process , or open political dialogue . The contributions aren ’ t an endorsement , they said , and in any case the corporations donate the same amount to both parties .
But of course , the GOP convention exists for one primary reason : to nominate a controversial billionaire businessman for the presidency .
“ They are sponsoring a party for Trump , ” said Rashad Robinson , executive director of Color of Change , another group urging corporations not to contribute to the event . “ Muslim kids being bullied , Latino kids being yelled at with threats of deportation at sporting events…these corporations are closing their eyes , closing their ears , closing their mouths , and handing over their wallets . ”
Corporations could be forgiven for seeking to distance themselves from the Cleveland convention . Even leading Republicans are going skip the event : four of the past five GOP presidential nominees—Mitt Romney , John McCain , George W. Bush , and George H.W . Bush—are declining to attend .
The calculus is clear : Robinson suggests the image of “ Confederate flags waving over corporate brands ” might be bad for business .
The Cleveland 2016 Host Committee , which aims to raise $ 64 million for the Republican convention , had a relatively slow month of fundraising—coinciding with a period of intense uncertainty over who the Republican nominee might be , or whether the nominee would even be decided by July .
Over the past month , the committee received $ 2 million in pledges , up from $ 54 million in late March . But at that rate , it will fall slightly short of its goal of $ 64 million before the convention date arrives .
Host committee spokeswoman Emily Lauer said it was “ confident ” it will meet its goal of $ 64 million , which is more than any other convention in history has raised . At least 80 percent of the pledged $ 56 million is already in the bank , she added .
But the committee will be fighting an uphill battle , with two dozen advocacy groups having organized to push corporations not to contribute to the event .
“ We recognize that these corporations serve millions and pride themselves for being inclusive and promoting fairness and diversity , ” Khera , the executive director of Muslim Advocates , told The ███ . “ That is why it is critical for these companies to exercise their responsibility to be good corporate citizens by ensuring that their products and resources are not used to foment hate and divide the American people . ”","It should be Donald Trump’s coming out party.

But Edwards had nothing to say after The Daily Beast called his office asking if he would re-up this year.

Or, as in the case of Walmart, companies said they had not yet made up their mind about whether they would sponsor the convention, less than three months before the event.

In off-the-record asides, corporation spokespersons insisted to The Daily Beast that the convention is really about supporting the city of Cleveland, or the democratic process, or open political dialogue. The contributions aren’t an endorsement, they said, and in any case the corporations donate the same amount to both parties.

But of course, the GOP convention exists for one primary reason: to nominate a controversial billionaire businessman for the presidency.

“They are sponsoring a party for Trump,” said Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, another group urging corporations not to contribute to the event. “Muslim kids being bullied, Latino kids being yelled at with threats of deportation at sporting events…these corporations are closing their eyes, closing their ears, closing their mouths, and handing over their wallets.”

Corporations could be forgiven for seeking to distance themselves from the Cleveland convention. Even leading Republicans are going skip the event: four of the past five GOP presidential nominees—Mitt Romney, John McCain, George W. Bush, and George H.W. Bush—are declining to attend.

The calculus is clear: Robinson suggests the image of “Confederate flags waving over corporate brands” might be bad for business.

The Cleveland 2016 Host Committee, which aims to raise $64 million for the Republican convention, had a relatively slow month of fundraising—coinciding with a period of intense uncertainty over who the Republican nominee might be, or whether the nominee would even be decided by July.

Over the past month, the committee received $2 million in pledges, up from $54 million in late March. But at that rate, it will fall slightly short of its goal of $64 million before the convention date arrives.

Host committee spokeswoman Emily Lauer said it was “confident” it will meet its goal of $64 million, which is more than any other convention in history has raised. At least 80 percent of the pledged $56 million is already in the bank, she added.

But the committee will be fighting an uphill battle, with two dozen advocacy groups having organized to push corporations not to contribute to the event.

“We recognize that these corporations serve millions and pride themselves for being inclusive and promoting fairness and diversity,” Khera, the executive director of Muslim Advocates, told The Daily Beast. “That is why it is critical for these companies to exercise their responsibility to be good corporate citizens by ensuring that their products and resources are not used to foment hate and divide the American people.”",www.thedailybeast.com,left,lnT39oMSqnrfVLRh

The rollback affects just a fraction of the myriad Obama administration rules that GOP lawmakers and the Trump administration eventually hope to undo, in what White House adviser Steve Bannon has billed as the “deconstruction of the administrative state.” But never before have lawmakers made such dramatic use of the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers and the White House to kill recently enacted regulations without having to overcome Senate filibusters.

The results underscore the massive partisan divide on the executive branch powers that President Barack Obama wielded so assertively during his second term.

“This should be a huge lesson to any future president, that if you’re going to carry out massive regulations that don’t have the support of the American people or the American Congress, then perhaps you shouldn’t be doing it in the first place,” said Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who called the outcome “a success for the American people.” He estimated that Congress’ nullification of the rules will save companies tens of billions of dollars in compliance costs.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) portrayed Republicans’ enthusiastic use of the review act as a deserved comeuppance for Obama. “I think it was bred by the fact that we had a president who said, ‘I’ve got a pen and I’ve got a phone,’ saying, ‘I’m disregarding Congress,'"" he said.

But Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii had a warning for Republicans: Someday, his party will retake power in Washington.

“Now that this tool has been exercised, it’s available to everybody, and we’ll use it too,” Schatz said. He added: “As long as the statute’s available to us, then we’d be crazy not to utilize it for our purposes as well.”

In fact, though, Congress has successfully used the act only once before, to kill a Clinton-era ergonomics regulation in 2001. GOP attempts to use the review act during Obama’s presidency either failed to make it through Congress or died in presidential vetoes.

Republicans’ control of both Congress and the White House allowed them to dust off the 1996 law, which allows the rule-killing resolutions to pass by simple majority votes in both chambers. The regulations they killed included limits on stream pollution by coal companies, restrictions on broadband providers’ reselling of customer data, protections for Planned Parenthood’s state funding, and an anti-corruption rule requiring energy companies to disclose their payments to foreign governments.

Under the act, lawmakers can use the tool to bypass Senate filibusters within 60 legislative days after a rule takes effect, a period that is due to expire on Thursday for Obama’s final regulations. Lawmakers could have tried to block any of the dozens of significant Obama-era regulations that took effect after June 2016, but their capacity was limited by other priorities on Congress’ calendar, such as confirming Trump’s Cabinet nominees and dealing with Obamacare.

In addition, the Obama administration made sure to finish most of its blockbuster regulations long before they would become vulnerable to the congressional attack.

That meant the repeals were as much about symbolically attacking Obama as they were about the substance of each targeted rule, said Philip Wallach, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

“My understanding is the collectivity of these rules kind of seems like largely a rebuke of the Obama administration in a pretty general sense, rather than necessarily showing that Congress thought very hard about exactly what was at stake with each of these rules,” he said.

Still, Republicans say they’re satisfied with what they accomplished.

""I think we’ve taken maximum opportunity to look at things the country lived without for 228 years, and the Obama administration lived without for at least 7 1/2,"" Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said. ""That kind of late rulemaking probably doesn’t deserve to be permanent if you can do anything about it. We did.""

Democrats generally expressed dismay over the rules the GOP axed, although many said bigger battles were being waged elsewhere. “They did some damage, but in the scheme of things I don’t think you look at those CRAs and say that President Obama’s legacy is undermined,” Schatz said.

However, the GOP’s frequent use of the review act this year could raise new legal questions down the road. That’s because the law doesn’t just allow Congress to block the targeted regulations — it also prohibits agencies from ever issuing a rule that is “substantially the same.”

“I think it’s been very helpful, but we still have a couple thousand more [rules] that Obama issued over the last eight years,” McCain said. “We’re still going to have to work on some of that.”

The final weeks of December may have been dominated by news of Donald Trump ’ s impeachment , but another development with potentially serious implications for the 2020 election – and the future of American democracy – attracted less global attention .
It took place not in the halls of Congress but hundreds of miles away , in Wisconsin . This was where a conservative advocacy group convinced a circuit court judge to order the state to remove more than 230,000 people removed from the state ’ s voter rolls . Wisconsin was already considered a crucial swing state in 2020 – bearing in mind that Donald Trump won the state by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016 . More than half of the voters at risk of being purged lived in areas that favored Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump that year , according to an analysis by the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel .
Top Trump adviser : Republicans have 'always ' relied on voter suppression Read more
A week later , one of Trump ’ s reelection advisers was caught on tape telling a Wisconsin Republicans that the party has “ traditionally ” relied on voter suppression . “ Traditionally it ’ s always been Republicans suppressing votes in places . Let ’ s start protecting our voters . We know where they are , ” the adviser , Justin Clark , said in audio obtained by the Associated Press . “ Let ’ s start playing offense a little bit . That ’ s what you ’ re going to see in 2020 . It ’ s going to be a much bigger program , a much more aggressive program , a much better-funded program . ”
There was now even less doubt that the Republicans intended to rely on both encouraging , and discouraging , voters as a key part of their 2020 election strategy .
Wisconsin wasn ’ t the only state where removing voters from the rolls en-masse came under scrutiny . The same week , in Georgia , the state voted to remove more than 300,000 people from the rolls . 120,000 of those people were removed because they hadn ’ t voted since 2012 and also failed to respond to multiple notices from the state asking them to confirm their address . The removals drew national outcry in a state that has been at the epicenter of accusations of voter suppression .
In 2017 the then secretary of state , Brian Kemp , removed more 500,000 from voter rolls and a month before the Gubernatorial election in 2018 he held up registrations of 53,000 under the state ’ s “ exact match ” law where a misplaced hyphen or comma in a voter registration record could mean more obstacles for someone to vote . Brian Kemp stood in that election and defeated Stacy Abrams by just 55,000 votes . Abrams later called Kemp a “ remarkable architect of voter suppression ” .
The controversies in Wisconsin and Georgia underscore how the mass removal of voters from the rolls – often called voter purging – has moved to the center of the polarized fight over voting rights in the United States . Although there is a consensus that purging , done carefully , is a useful tool to keep voting rolls accurate and remove people who move and die , there is growing alarm over how aggressively it is being used to penalize people , essentially , for not voting .
Overall , at least 17 million people have been removed from the voter rolls since the 2016 election , an uptick from the number of voters who were removed between 2006 and 2008 , according to a study by the Brennan Center for Justice . Although it ’ s not known how many of those removals were legitimate , the increase comes even as the number of Americans who move has dropped to historic lows .
“ Folks who benefit from having fewer people participate are constantly looking for new ways to suppress turnout , ” said Stuart Naifeh , an attorney at Demos who was involved in a high-profile voter purge case at the United States supreme court last year . Voter purges “ is one that seems to have become more popular . ”
Purging is not new – federal law has required it for more than two decades – but there is a new awareness of how purges can remove eligible voters from the rolls and target populations that move a lot : the young , the poor and people who live in cities , all groups that tend to favor Democrats .
“ It ’ s only bad when it ’ s done poorly . When it captures people who are still in the state or who are still eligible voters and shouldn ’ t be removed , ” said David Becker , the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research , who works with states cleaning their voter rolls .
Myrna Pérez , director of the voting rights and elections program at the Brennan Center for Justice , pointed out that there used to be an important tool to keep voting jurisdictions with a history of voting discrimination from “ bad ” purges : the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act . Until 2013 , if a state covered by the law wanted to make a change in its purge process , it would have to show the federal government that it wasn ’ t to the detriment of minority voters .
The oversight helped prevent both discriminatory purge practices and allowed states to catch errors in their methodology , Perez said . But it was lifted in 2013 when the supreme court gutted the Voting Rights Act . When the law was still in full effect , Pérez said , “ it had the effect of stalling and stopping intentional and accidental sloppiness . ”
Another legal blow came in 2018 , when the supreme court ruled in favor of a controversial way of carrying out purges .
Folks who benefit from having fewer people participate are constantly looking for new ways to suppress turnout Stuart Naifeh
The case involved Larry Harmon , a software engineer in Ohio , who sued the state when he discovered in 2015 that , after sitting out several elections , he was unable to vote on a marijuana initiative because he had been purged . If someone misses a federal election in Ohio , the state sends them a postcard asking them to confirm their address . If they don ’ t respond to the postcard and fail to vote in two more consecutive elections , they are removed from the rolls . Voting rights groups call the Ohio rule the “ use it or lose it ” law .
Harmon argued that he was being punished for not voting , which is prohibited by federal law . And critics said that linking one ’ s ability to stay on the voter rolls to one ’ s ability to vote can discriminate against people who face more obstacles getting to the polls , such as those who can ’ t get childcare or time off from work . But in a 5-4 ruling , the supreme court said the process was legal because Harmon wasn ’ t removed solely for not voting – he had also received the postcard .
The ruling “ opened the floodgates ” to aggressive voter purging , said Kathy Culliton-Gonzalez , a voting rights attorney .
Mailers and postcards are a controversial way of asking voters to confirm their voter registration . In 2018 , states reported sending more than 21 million address confirmation notices and only around 20 % of them were returned , according to federal data . The fact that so few people return the postcards signals that they ’ re not really a reliable way of assessing whether people have moved , voting advocates argue .
But voter purges are more than just a question of lapsed bureaucracy , they are now emerging as a new political battleground .
In Ohio , for instance , Democrats and Republicans have overseen voter purges for two decades , but recently , the practice seems to have clearly benefited Republicans . Voters in Democratic neighborhoods in the state ’ s three largest counties were struck from the rolls at nearly twice the rate as voters in Republican ones , according to a 2016 Reuters analysis . In largely African American neighborhoods in Cincinnati , over 10 % of voters were purged , compared to just 4 % in the suburbs .
Earlier this year , Ohio purged 158,000 voters from its rolls using that process , according to an analysis by the Columbus Dispatch . The removals came even after activists in the state discovered around 40,000 errors on the list of voters set to be purged . Oklahoma , which employs a similar purge process to Ohio and Georgia , also removed more than 88,000 inactive voters from its rolls in April .
Even so , there has been some recent successes in stopping unfair purges . Earlier this year , voting groups successfully blocked an Indiana law that would have allowed the state to cancel a voter registration if they had information the voter moved , but without giving the voter a chance to confirm that . Civil rights groups also stopped Texas from cancelling voter registrations of nearly 100,000 people it accused of being non-citizens based on faulty data .
In Wisconsin , election officials have declined to move ahead with the purge while an appeal is pending . The Wisconsin Democratic party has also pledged to contact voters and urge them to re-register ( the state allows people to register online , through their local clerk , or at the polls on election day . )

And in Georgia , there has been another victory – of sorts . Earlier this month , Brad Raffensperger , Georgia ’ s top election official , announced he made a mistake . Days after his office scrubbed 300,000 people from its voter rolls , he revealed 22,000 of them had been incorrectly removed . The voters should have been given several more months to confirm their voter registration .
Raffensperger said he was reactivating their voter registrations to give them more time . “ We are proactively taking additional steps to prevent any confusion come the day of the election , ” he said in a statement .
Some crucial protections against bad voter purging also remain in place . Federal law prohibits states from systematically cleaning their rolls within 90 days of a federal election and says the systems state develop to remove people from the rolls must be “ non-discriminatory . ”
It is clear that next year ’ s election is already becoming an epic battle to try and preserve the voting rights of millions of voters . The lessons from the 2016 election should sound a cautionary tale .

Saturday's GOP debate was the final one before Tuesday's New Hampshire primary. Here were five key moments:

1. That awkward start

One key thing has to happen before the debate starts: the candidates have to take the stage.

That proved more complicated than usual on Saturday night, as the ABC News Republican debate began with Ben Carson refusing to walk out to his podium, even after the moderators called his name.

Called second, Carson stood and waited, allowing Ted Cruz to go out after him. Making matters weirder: Donald Trump then stopped to stand beside Carson, rather than walking out himself. Jeb Bush walked past them as he took the stage.

After the moderators (again) called Carson, they also ""lastly"" called out Donald Trump — only to then to (seemingly) realize they still had to call out Kasich.

2. Rubio targeted

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie wasted no time in taking shots at Sen. Marco Rubio on Saturday night.

When asked early on to list his accomplishments, Rubio listed policies he has supported, then turned to attacking President Obama: ""Let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing,"" he said. ""He knows exactly what he's doing,"" Rubio said, by trying to make the U.S. like the rest of the world with policies like Obamacare.

Marco Rubio Uses Same Line 4 Times at Debate, Even After Christie Busts Him https://t.co/0u3kMTUE3x (VIDEO) pic.twitter.com/rDmuWzZqyw — Mediaite (@Mediaite) February 7, 2016

That line would pop up again and again — and Christie noticed.

In the heated exchange that followed, Christie said that being governor meant more accountability than being a senator, saying that he had to make tougher and more important decisions than Rubio has had to as a senator. He also attacked Rubio's pattern of missing votes in the Senate, a criticism that has dogged Rubio throughout this nomination contest.

Rubio attacked Christie on his response to a recent snowstorm that hit New Jersey, but then pivoted again to the line about how Obama ""knows exactly what he's doing."" Christie hit back.

""There it is. There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody,"" he said. Rubio repeated some variation of the line several times during the night.

Trump leads in recent New Hampshire polls by 10 to 20 points, but Rubio has become the candidate to beat for the so-called ""establishment"" candidates, like Christie, Jeb Bush, and John Kasich. Those three are fighting for survival in New Hampshire, while Rubio's numbers have surged there in the last few days.

3. Trump kept a low profile

Even though Trump skipped the last debate, some commentators nevertheless decided that he won. In bowing out, he garnered massive media attention, and he also avoided tough questions like those Cruz and Rubio fielded on their past immigration positions.

This debate, he showed up, and he had (what was for Trump) an unremarkable performance. He stuck to typical Trump talking points — on topics like China, job losses and America not winning anymore — and had few major tangles with his opponents. When he did argue with Jeb Bush on a question about eminent domain and subsequently commanded Bush to be ""quiet"" while he answered — the crowd booed Trump.

But then, Trump is far ahead in New Hampshire while the so-called ""establishment"" candidates battle it out. And while Saturday's performance may not have rocketed him further ahead, it also could help hold him in first place through Tuesday's primary vote.

4. Ambiguity on waterboarding (except Trump)

In a line of questioning about ISIS and foreign policy, moderator David Muir turned the conversation to an issue many Americans first encountered more than a decade ago. Pointing out that Cruz has in the past said that ""torture is wrong, unambiguously, period,"" Muir asked, ""Senator Cruz, is waterboarding torture?""

Cruz responded that ""under the definition of torture, it's not.""

But he was ambiguous when Muir followed up by asking if he would bring the practice back as president: ""I would not bring it back in any sort of widespread use,"" he said.

Trump, meanwhile, was more forceful. Referencing ""people chopping the heads off Christians,"" he said waterboarding (and then some) would be justified.

""I would bring back waterboarding, and I would bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding,"" he said.

Bush, who as Muir pointed out has in the past has said he ""you won't rule waterboarding out,"" seemed to rule it out this time, saying he wouldn't bring the practice back. Instead, he said, ""what we need to do is to make sure that we expand our intelligence capabilities.""

Muir finally turned to Rubio. Noting that Rubio has said that he didn't want to ""want to telegraph to the enemy"" his tactics as commander-in-chief, Muir asked Rubio if waterboarding is torture. Rubio never directly answered the question, but instead repeated that he didn't want to give away to the U.S.'s enemies what he'd want to do.

""It is true, we should not be discussing in a widespread way the exact tactics that we're going to use, because that allows terrorist to know to practice how to evade us,"" he said. He then pivoted to attacking President Obama's plan to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay.

5. Cruz was on defense

Cruz, fresh off a strong victory in Iowa, found himself on the defensive immediately in Saturday night's Republican debate in Manchester, N.H. First, he was asked to answer his comments that Donald Trump does not have the temperament to be president. Cruz demurred, saying that was for the voters to decide.

Then, moderators asked him to answer for voicemails, emails, and text messages that his campaign sent out on the night of the Iowa caucuses, reporting that Ben Carson was suspending his campaign.

Cruz, whose campaign has confirmed that it sent the messages, explained that it was based on a CNN report that Carson was ""taking a break"" after Iowa, as Cruz said, adding that CNN said it was a ""highly unusual"" move.

As he skips from one gaffe to the next , GOP leaders in Washington and in the most competitive states have begun openly contemplating turning their backs on their party 's presidential nominee to prevent what they fear will be wide-scale Republican losses on Election Day .
Back in 1996 , the party largely gave up on nominee Bob Dole once it became clear he had little chance of winning , so it 's not without precedent . Nevertheless , it 's a jolting prospect now , with roughly three months still left before the Nov. 8 vote and weeks before the three presidential debates .
Republicans who have devoted their professional lives to electing GOP candidates say they believe the White House already may be lost . They 're exasperated by Trump 's divisive politics and his insistence on running a general election campaign that mirrors his approach to the primaries .
`` Based on his campaign record , there 's no chance he 's going to win , '' said Sara Fagen , the political director for former President George W. Bush . `` He 's losing groups of people he ca n't get back . ''
Trump 's campaign says things are moving in the right direction , a position that itself feeds the discontent among his GOP detractors . The billionaire businessman 's loyalists say enough time remains to change the dynamic against Democrat Hillary Clinton who , like Trump , is deeply unpopular with voters .
And his backers are blaming the media for the perception that all is not well .
`` Frankly , a lot of stuff over the last week ... it 's him being distorted , '' said Trump 's campaign chairman , Paul Manafort . `` For the last week or so , he 's been very focused and very much on his game . ''
Trump did show some modest improvement as a candidate in the past week . He has stopped criticizing a Muslim family of a fallen U.S. soldier . Gone are the fights with some of his party 's most respected members of Congress .
But also in the past seven days , Trump has questioned the advice of senior aides , threatened to stop raising money for the party , dismissed the usefulness of get-out-the-vote efforts and defended his decision not to run any television ads even as his opponents fill the airwaves with spots backing Clinton in several contested states .
It all largely overshadowed the content of 44 previously-unreleased email exchanges Clinton had while at the State Department . They became public on Tuesday and showed her interacting with lobbyists , political and Clinton Foundation donors and business interests while serving as secretary of state .
`` He ca n't simply continue to preach to the choir and think he 's going to put together a coalition that will win the White House , '' said Ryan Williams , a party strategist and former aide to 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney . `` He 's essentially guaranteeing that he will lose by refusing to clean up his mistakes and stop committing future ones . ''
Trump this past week stuck by a patently false claim that President Barack Obama founded the Islamic State group . The candidate made an off-handed remark about Clinton that was widely condemned by critics as an invitation to violence . He even acknowledged that losing might not be so bad .
`` I 'll just keep doing the same thing I 'm doing right now , '' he told CNBC on Thursday . `` And at the end it 's either going to work or I 'm going to you know , I 'm going to have a very , very nice , long vacation . ''
All of it , to some Republicans , should lead the party to give up on its nominee .
More than 100 GOP officials , including at least six former members of Congress and more than 20 former staffers at the Republican National Committee , have signed a letter asking the party chairman , Reince Priebus , to stop helping Trump 's campaign .
They call the New York real estate mogul a threat to the party and to the nation . They want the RNC to take resources now helping Trump and shift them to vulnerable GOP candidates for House and Senate .
The letter follows a steady stream of recent defections from Republican elected officials and longtime strategists who vow never to support Trump . They want party leaders to acknowledge that backing his White House bid is a waste of time and money .
`` They 're going to do it sooner or later . They might as well do it sooner to have more impact , '' said former Minnesota Rep. Vin Weber , one of the Republicans to sign the letter to Priebus .
Senior Republicans in Washington and in some of the most contested states have discussed a scenario in which the party scales back its presidential focus in states that do n't feature top races for Senate . They could abandon a state such as Virginia , for example , and focus more a state such as Indiana , where Democrat Evan Bayh is trying to make a Senate comeback .
That 's according to several Republican officials in Washington and states that would be affected , including Ohio , Pennsylvania and New Hampshire . They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to outline private discussions .
There is no evidence that a formal plan to break with Trump exists at either the state party or RNC level , but Priebus has informally discussed the possibility with party leaders in battleground states in recent days , three of the officials said .
Should that occur , it 's not likely to happen until after Labor Day , as the party is still relying on Trump to help raise money to fund its expansive political operation . But the amount of money needed decreases as each day passes , giving the RNC greater financial freedom to potentially change course as the election nears .
For now , Priebus is vocally supportive of Trump . The party chairman joined the nominee on Friday , part of a larger effort to ensure an experienced political hand is almost always at the candidate 's side when he travels .
Others keeping Trump company this past week include former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani .
`` We 've always found it 's wise to have people traveling with him , because it 's an opportunity to have him engaged and not just sitting there , '' Manafort said .
Some credit that strategy for Trump 's avoiding devastating unforced errors , such as his tussle with Khizr and Ghazala Khan , the Muslim-Americans parents whose son , U.S. Army Capt . Humayun Khan , was killed in Iraq in 2004 . Manafort also has privately assured swing state Republicans that Trump no longer will attack party rivals — House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin , Arizona Sen. John McCain and Ohio Gov . John Kasich among them .
After several error-free days , Trump caused a major stir Tuesday when his comments about supporters of the Second Amendment 's right to bear arms were viewed by some as advocating violence against Clinton .
He came in for criticism again after saying on Wednesday that Obama was the `` founder '' of IS , a false claim he repeated several times on Thursday — even when given the chance to tone down his attack on the president 's foreign policies .
On Friday , Trump started the day saying he was only being sarcastic , before telling a Pennsylvania rally , `` but not that sarcastic , to be honest with you . ''
It 's those kinds of moments that lead experienced Republicans to think Trump can not be saved from himself .
`` He 's almost like someone with an addiction who ca n't stop , '' Fagen said . `` Until he gets help and admits it , he wo n't be able to change . ''
The dissension in the Republican ranks has n't affected Trump 's ability to draw supporters to his rallies . Lisa Thompson , a firefighter from St . Cloud , Florida , is among the many continue to stand in long lines for hours to see Trump at his events .
She said those balking at his missteps were being `` too sensitive '' — a luxury the nation ca n't afford with growing security threats . She urged Trump to stick with his playbook .
Mike Dedrel , a UPS driver and Trump supporter who 's also from St . Cloud , said he hoped in the coming months that Trump would n't speak off the cuff as often and stick to pre-planned answers . If he does n't , Dedrel said , he 's concerned that Trump is on the way to an Election Day defeat .
`` I was worried about that from Day One , when he was going against 16 other guys , '' he said . `` But at the end of the day , I know he 'll be a great president — if he can win . ''","The Republican Party could be nearing a breaking point with Donald Trump.

Conservative money has poured into Nebraska's Republican Senate primary race.

Big GOP names like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell are on opposite sides.

And the attack ads have been brutal — including one that took a page directly from the Swift-boating of John Kerry's military record during his 2004 presidential run.

But that doesn't mean the contest to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Mike Johanns is another clear-cut primary battle between the GOP's Tea Party wing and the establishment.

After all, Ben Sasse, the so-called anti-establishment candidate, worked in the Bush White House and spent the better part of last decade in federal jobs in Washington. And the candidate favored by GOP leaders in Washington, Shane Osborn, has support from prominent local anti-tax and Tea Party organizations.

The distinctions are muddled enough that FreedomWorks, a national Tea Party-affiliated group, first backed Osborn before switching gears and throwing its support to Sasse.

""We are on track for some incredible spin on Wednesday morning — some anti-establishment groups are building this up to be a monumental fight,"" says Nathan Gonzales, who analyzes Senate races for the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. ""I just don't think the Nebraska primary fits neatly into the establishment-vs.-anti-establishment battle within the Republican Party.""

Sasse, a former congressional staffer and Department of Health and Human Services official, has served as president since late 2010 of Nebraska's Midland College. Osborn, a retired, decorated Navy pilot, is a former one-term state treasurer. Another candidate, multimillionaire Omaha banker Sid Dinsdale, has pumped $1 million of his own money into the race.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Republican Senatorial Committee have notably stayed out of the race, leaving the playing field largely to groups like the limited-government Club for Growth and the conservative 60 Plus Association, both backing Sasse.

Osborn has sought to paint Sasse as a Washington insider; the Sasse camp counters that Osborn, while in the military, registered to vote in Florida while stationed there and once suggested he may settle in South Dakota.

A superPAC supporting Osborn — and formed by a former McConnell campaign manager — has attempted to portray Sasse as a ""liberal"" supporter of President Obama's health care law by taking comments he made at a 2010 health care summit out of context.

But the harshest ad was released recently by the 60 Plus Association, in which three veterans questioned Osborn's fitness for office because of a memo his campaign circulated that lauded his actions in landing a disabled Navy spy plane in China in 2001.

It turns out that the unsigned memo, on Navy letterhead, was written as a favor to Osborn, the Omaha World Herald reported, by a friend working at the Pentagon.

Backlash to the ad, which echoed attacks on John Kerry's decorated service during the Vietnam War, prompted Sasse to issue a statement about what he termed the ""counterfeit memo.""

He said: ""We have nothing but respect for those who serve our country in the military, decry all attacks on Shane's service, and have repeatedly thanked him for his service to our country.""

There's little reliable polling in the race, though Sasse looks to be the candidate to beat. Dinsdale, however, appears to have an unexpected opening. Once considered an also-ran, he could tap into a vein of voters fed up with the nastiness and has plenty of his own money to spend. Last week, in a telling move, the 60 Plus Association shifted its attacks from Osborn to Dinsdale.

Erick Erickson of the RedState blog has predicted that a Sasse win in Nebraska ""could re-energize conservative efforts and give them hope.""

But the political message that Nebraska sends Tuesday night is likely to be a lot more diluted than many hope it will be.",www.npr.org,center,EawTmMw4Ozu35G7O

The options include offering a separate piece of immigration legislation on the floor aimed at tightening border security and demanding the president enforce existing laws , promises to renew the effort next year when Republicans have larger numbers in both chambers , and passing two separate funding bills — a short-term bill with tight restrictions on immigration enforcement agencies , and another that would fund the rest of the government until the fall .

GOP leaders have not completely given up on a funding bill that would last until next October — they believe the support is quite strong , absent the executive action — but the political and legislative climate is unpredictable .

McConnell and Boehner desperately want to avoid a rolling set of spending fights early in the year , which would undermine their campaign promises to return Congress to regular order . An endless stream of stopgap spending bills would throw Washington back into the crisis-like atmosphere that has defined the post-2010 divided government . The dynamic amounts to the first true post-election test for Republican leaders : They want to push back aggressively on the administration without going too far .

Williamson, Rich Lowry, Kyle Smith, Kathryn Jean Lopez, Victor Davis Hanson, Zachary Evans, David Harsanyi, Jim Geraghty, Jonah Goldberg","Presidents really only get to do one big thing , or maybe two . Abraham Lincoln saved the Union . Franklin Roosevelt got his New Deal and joined the war against Adolf Hitler . Lyndon Johnson expanded the welfare state and signed into law a landmark civil-rights bill . George W. Bush wanted to be a school-reformer and economy-modernizer , but instead he was obliged to spend his presidency playing Whac-A-Mole with al-Qaeda and its allies .
Barack Obama ’ s one big thing was moving the United States toward a more European model of health care , one in which the federal government would take a stronger and much more direct role . It isn ’ t that he didn ’ t know what he wanted : While his heart ’ s own true desire is a government health-care monopoly ( “ I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer universal-health-care program , ” etc . ) he also believed that transitioning to such a program all at once would be disruptive , and so he backed what turned out to be an incompetent attempt at adapting a Swiss-style system of mandates , subsidies , and price controls to American conditions . As a political matter , he ’ d have signed a four-inch-thick stack of paper containing nothing but endless repetitions of the phrase “ All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy ! ” so long as Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi got it to his desk with the words “ Health-Care Reform ” on the title page .
His eight years in office will be remembered as a failure and a great lost opportunity , not least of which because his one big thing , the Affordable Care Act , was such a dog ’ s breakfast of a bill that it immediately began to unravel . Parts of it conflicted with other laws and with the Constitution . Its underlying economic architecture is a mess , which resulted in substantially higher health-insurance costs for many Americans and fewer choices for many more . Its mandate that individuals buy insurance — necessary to the function of insurance markets under the preexisting-conditions rule imposed by the ACA — was toothless .
That mandate is slated to be repealed as part of the Republican tax-cut bill . A little irony in that : The mandate was an unconstitutional misapplication of congressional powers under the commerce clause , but Chief Justice John Roberts and his Supreme Court colleagues went to extraordinary lengths to find that the mandate could be instead understood as a constitutional application of Congress ’ s taxing power , thus saving Obamacare ’ s constitutional bacon . If we are to take serious the risible fiction that the Affordable Care Act was really at its heart a tax bill , then repealing the mandate in another tax bill is appropriate .
But Republicans ought not spend too much time savoring that irony . In their tax bill , they have repeated virtually all of the major procedural sins of the Affordable Care Act : the lack of regular order , the reliance on ridiculous budgeting shenanigans , the “ we have to pass the bill in order to find out what ’ s in it ” approach to lining up votes behind legislation nobody had read , which was still being amended well into the evening — “ under cover of darkness , ” as they like to say in Washington — sometimes with notes scribbled in the margins . And , of course , the tax bill was passed on a party-line vote , or near to it : Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee voted against the bill .
A lot of fun stuff was jammed in there at the end . Senator Ted Cruz of Texas put in a provision that would allow parents to use tax-advantaged college-savings accounts to pay for K–12 tuition at private schools and for some expenses related to home-schooling . That ’ s a good idea .
But I wonder how long any of this will last .
President Donald Trump desperately needed a win in his first year in office after having failed to deliver on such big-ticket campaign promises as repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with a more consumer-oriented alternative , building a border wall and coercing the Mexicans into paying for it , and reordering our trade relations with the world . The Senate vote came on the day Michael Flynn , his former national-security adviser , pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian authorities , a question that is likely to continue haunting the administration .

The unseemly shenanigans behind the tax cut

Presidents really only get to do one big thing, or maybe two. Abraham Lincoln saved the Union. Franklin Roosevelt got his New Deal and joined the war against Adolf Hitler. Lyndon Johnson expanded the welfare state and signed into law a landmark civil-rights bill. George W. Bush wanted to be a school-reformer and economy-modernizer, but instead he was obliged to spend his presidency playing Whac-A-Mole with al-Qaeda and its allies.

Barack Obama’s one big thing was moving the United States toward a more European model of health care, one in which the federal government would take a stronger and much more direct role. It isn’t that he didn’t know what he wanted: While his heart’s own true desire is a government health-care monopoly (“I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer universal-health-care program,” etc.) he also believed that transitioning to such a program all at once would be disruptive, and so he backed what turned out to be an incompetent attempt at adapting a Swiss-style system of mandates, subsidies, and price controls to American conditions. As a political matter, he’d have signed a four-inch-thick stack of paper containing nothing but endless repetitions of the phrase “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy!” so long as Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi got it to his desk with the words “Health-Care Reform” on the title page.

His eight years in office will be remembered as a failure and a great lost opportunity, not least of which because his one big thing, the Affordable Care Act, was such a dog’s breakfast of a bill that it immediately began to unravel. Parts of it conflicted with other laws and with the Constitution. Its underlying economic architecture is a mess, which resulted in substantially higher health-insurance costs for many Americans and fewer choices for many more. Its mandate that individuals buy insurance — necessary to the function of insurance markets under the preexisting-conditions rule imposed by the ACA — was toothless.

That mandate is slated to be repealed as part of the Republican tax-cut bill. A little irony in that: The mandate was an unconstitutional misapplication of congressional powers under the commerce clause, but Chief Justice John Roberts and his Supreme Court colleagues went to extraordinary lengths to find that the mandate could be instead understood as a constitutional application of Congress’s taxing power, thus saving Obamacare’s constitutional bacon. If we are to take serious the risible fiction that the Affordable Care Act was really at its heart a tax bill, then repealing the mandate in another tax bill is appropriate.

But Republicans ought not spend too much time savoring that irony. In their tax bill, they have repeated virtually all of the major procedural sins of the Affordable Care Act: the lack of regular order, the reliance on ridiculous budgeting shenanigans, the “we have to pass the bill in order to find out what’s in it” approach to lining up votes behind legislation nobody had read, which was still being amended well into the evening — “under cover of darkness,” as they like to say in Washington — sometimes with notes scribbled in the margins. And, of course, the tax bill was passed on a party-line vote, or near to it: Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee voted against the bill.

A lot of fun stuff was jammed in there at the end. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas put in a provision that would allow parents to use tax-advantaged college-savings accounts to pay for K–12 tuition at private schools and for some expenses related to home-schooling. That’s a good idea.

But I wonder how long any of this will last.

President Donald Trump desperately needed a win in his first year in office after having failed to deliver on such big-ticket campaign promises as repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with a more consumer-oriented alternative, building a border wall and coercing the Mexicans into paying for it, and reordering our trade relations with the world. The Senate vote came on the day Michael Flynn, his former national-security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian authorities, a question that is likely to continue haunting the administration. The president’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, is said to be the next target of the investigation.

The Affordable Care Act began coming undone the second it was signed; this tax plan, created in much the same way, may very well suffer the same fate.

Pendulums swing. But when and how fast, no one knows.

The downward spiral here isn’t tracing the decline of the Republican party but the descent of Congress, which, from the Affordable Care Act to the new tax-cut bill, has shown itself incapable of proceeding according to regular order, of conducting its business in a fashion befitting the legislature of the most powerful nation in the history of human affairs, and of forging bipartisan compromises — which are desirable not because bipartisanship and compromise are virtuous but because achieving broad political buy-in is the only way to produce stable and long-lasting policy settlements.

Whatever the corporate tax rate is when Trump signs the tax bill, it is unlikely that it will stay there for very long if Democrats come back into the majority in Congress. And who believes that Republican congressional majorities are destined to be eternal?

The Republicans are very lucky that the only practical alternative to them at the moment is the Democrats. The Democrats are lucky in precisely the same way.

Thank you , Mr. Speaker , for finally admitting on national television that all the fiscal cliffs , sequestrations and budget battles you 've created are , indeed , artificially fabricated by ideologues and self-interested politicians and not the result of some imminent crisis that 's out of our control .
America owes this debt of gratitude to Boehner after he finally came clean on yesterday 's edition of ABC 's `` This Week '' and admitted that `` we do not have an immediate debt crisis . '' ( His admission was followed up by Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan , who quickly echoed much the same sentiment on CBS ' `` Face the Nation '' ) .
In offering up such a stunningly honest admission , the GOP leader has put himself on record as agreeing with President Obama , who has previously acknowledged that demonstrable reality . But the big news here is n't just about the politics of a Republican House speaker tacitly admitting they agree with a Democratic president . It is also about a bigger admission revealing the fact that the GOP 's fiscal alarmism is not merely some natural reaction to reality , but a calculated means to other ideological ends .
Before considering those ends , first remember that Boehner ( like Obama ) is correct on the facts .
As Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman has pointed out , `` Even if we do run deficits , federal debt as a share of GDP will be substantially less than it was at the end of World War II '' and `` it will also be substantially less than , say , debt in several European countries in the mid- to late 1990s . '' It is also lower than the 80 percent of GDP level that many economists say starts to put countries in a precarious position . Additionally , citing Congressional Budget Office data , the Center for American Progress notes that the long-term debt outlook is only dire because the projections simply assume without question that `` future Congresses will enact huge new deficit-increasing tax cuts and spending hikes . ''
`` The debt outlook is bad ( but ) we ’ re not looking at something inconceivable , impossible to deal with , '' writes Krugman . `` We ’ re looking at debt levels that a number of advanced countries , the US included , have had in the past , and dealt with . ''
So yes , we should start dealing with the long-term debt in a pragmatic and sober way , but we should n't pretend it is some sort of imminent crisis worthy of draconian austerity measures .
If we could somehow do that , then there would be plenty of gradual steps that could be taken right now -- steps that deal with the debt in measured ways that do the least harm to the overall economy . Those include starting to phase out the Bush tax cuts , which show no correlation with job growth and yet are the single largest driver of annual deficits ; starting to reduce defense and war spending , which , job-creation-wise , is one of the least effective ways for the government to spend money ; starting to move the United States toward the least costly , more efficient , and more effective single-payer healthcare system that most industrialized countries have , and that lowers overhead for employers ; and starting to spend more money on social programs that fight economic inequality , with the understanding that driving down such inequality tends to boost macroeconomic growth and consequently boost public revenues ( this is the Reagan-esque idea of growing one 's way out of debt ) .
But , of course , we are n't having a sober and measured discussion about such pragmatic solutions . Instead , the national conversation about the budget is dominated by debt demagogues with ulterior motives . Taking a page out of the shock doctrine playbook that says every crisis is an opportunity , these alarmists have sought to create the perception of an immediate crisis in order to quickly manufacture opportunities to legislate their otherwise politically impossible agenda items .
In practice , that means Wall Streeters and conservative ideologues citing the supposedly imminent crisis to successfully nudge the political establishment to endorse cuts to Social Security , even though the program has almost nothing to do with the debt crisis . It also means a GOP budget that targets most of its cuts at the social programs that the poor and middle-class most rely on ( this , at the same time most of these same alleged budget hawks supported an extension of most of the deficit-expanding Bush tax cuts ; decry any cuts to the defense budget ; and either outright oppose a single-payer system or support the Obama healthcare law that while certainly expanding coverage , nonetheless buttresses the private health insurance industry and , thus , arguably makes such a single-payer system more out of reach ) .

Republican Party leaders gathered in Washington this week for their annual winter meetings. They approved new rules for the 2016 presidential primaries designed to create a more orderly path to the GOP nomination — and, the party hopes, to the White House.

But this week's meeting also provided an opportunity to see how far Republicans have come in an effort begun a year ago to reach out to new voters — especially young people, minorities and women.

""I will tell you, as we embrace people in a new and fantastic way, we will encourage them to find the potential within themselves to maximize their potential. And when we win people, elections will take care of themselves.""

Mixed Messages

But over the course of the three-day RNC meetings, there were some mixed messages on reaching out to new voters.

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee spoke about ending divisiveness in the party, which some call a civil war between the Tea Party and establishment Republicans. But Huckabee also stirred controversy when he spoke about winning the votes of women.

It didn't exactly fit with the Republican Party's rebranding effort, which began a year ago following the party's poor showing in the 2012 elections. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus reacted cautiously to Huckabee.

""I don't know what he was talking about,"" Priebus said. ""What I can tell you is that I think he was trying to make the comment that government can't be involved in every part of everyone's life.""

Leaving 2012 Behind

Mostly, however, the GOP re-branding that was the talk of RNC meetings last year was in the background this year. Louisiana's Republican Party Chairman Roger Villere said progress is being made, though he denied that Republicans have a problem with women or minorities.

""I think the perception and what some of the Democrats want us to look like is, we have a problem,"" Villere said. ""We don't have a problem with minorities.

Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush — said in 2016 they didn’t vote for Trump. But Trump endorsed Jeb’s son, George P. Bush, when he ran for reelection as Texas Land Commissioner in 2018. In 2014, before Jeb Bush ran for president (a race he lost to Trump), George P. told the Texas Tribune’s Evan Smith he wouldn’t endorse his father.

The paper said U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney won't endorse the president, nor will Cindy McCain, widow of U.S. Sen. John McCain. Military leaders are sharing their misgivings, too. William McRaven, the former University of Texas System chancellor and retired Navy admiral, has been vocally dismissive of Trump in the past. He told the Times that Trump isn't qualified for the office.

“President Trump has shown he doesn’t have the qualities necessary to be a good commander in chief,” he said.

Scores of GOP lawmakers have experienced going viral this year with videos of constituents shouting their disagreement on support for President Trump and policies such as the GOP’s healthcare bill.

Lately, though, Republicans have observed some furious constituents who appear to be going even further.

Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) described attendees at a town hall in his district last week who booed him down after he said people’s rights are God-given.

“They booed God. They booed the pastor. They booed the prayer. They booed the name of the church. They booed when I said rights come from God,” Brat recounted to The Hill just off the House floor. “That’s a fundamental tenet of western civilization. I mean, I didn’t think that was partisan.”

Further north in New Jersey, Rep. Tom MacArthur (R) faced pushback from a crowd when he began telling the story of his special-needs daughter who died at the age of 11.

“Shame!” people shouted. “We’ve heard this story.”

“This child in 11 years has shaped my life more than anybody. So if I talk about my daughter too much, well then so be it. But this is the one human being that has impacted my life more than anybody,” MacArthur said.

Another person sarcastically yelled out MacArthur should write a book about it.

“Maybe I will write a book,” MacArthur shot back.

Still, not every town hall has veered into nastiness. Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), a top Democratic target in 2018, said his town hall attendees expressed their clear displeasure with his positions but remained civil.

“You know, they had the signs and stuff like that. But I thought they were pretty nice, I thought they were pretty respectful,” Coffman said.

“From the stories I have heard in other districts, I’ve got it pretty good,” he said.

On Tuesday, McConnell submitted a last-minute change to increase the length of opening arguments from two days to three, as well as to include evidence from the House.

“We’re very glad they moved to three days instead of two so we won’t be hearing arguments at two in the morning, it’s good that they admitted evidence, but the real test will be witnesses and documents,” Schumer said in an impromptu statement to reporters following the vote. “Will our Republican senators put pressure on McConnell so that we really have witnesses and documents?”

It still looks unlikely that Republicans, who have been united in planning a vote for witnesses after opening arguments, will vote for any of Schumer’s amendments before then. Moderate Republican Susan Collins of Maine said in a statement Tuesday that she would “vote to table any attempts by either side to subpoena documents or witnesses before that stage in the trial.”

Following the defeat of his amendment, Schumer proposed another amendment to subpoena State Department witnesses and documents, which is also expected to fail in a party-line vote.",www.nationalreview.com,right,ezcZIggtrnJcHrH6

GOP leaders in the House say they have reached an impasse with President Obama

Majority Leader Reid rejects Collins%27 effort to reopen government and extend the debt limit

Treasury Department says it must have resolution on debt limit by Oct. 17

WASHINGTON —The Senate's top two leaders have asserted control over budget negotiations with the White House for a deal to reopen the federal government and avoid a default on the nation's debt.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., met Saturday morning with Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to begin preliminary discussions.

""I hope that our talking is some solace to the American people and to the world,"" Reid said. ""This should be seen as something very positive, even though we don't have anything done yet.""

Senate Democratic leaders met Saturday afternoon at the White House with President Obama to plot strategy going forward. After the 75-minute meeting, neither the president nor the senators had any comment.

The momentum shifted to the Senate as it became increasingly clear that House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, was unable to strike a deal with Obama on his own.

Following a closed-door House GOP meeting Saturday morning, lawmakers acknowledged a diminished role to resolve the impasse.

""I'm disappointed that the president has rejected the offer that we put on the table. I know that he's trying to see which Republican senator he can pick off in the Senate. I hope that the Senate Republicans stand strong so we can speak with one voice,"" said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., after the meeting.

Reid rejected a bipartisan effort led by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, to end the shutdown and lift the debt ceiling because he said Democrats should not have to make concessions in order for Congress to reopen the government and avoid a first-ever national default. Collins' plan included reforms to the health care law and locked in federal spending levels Democrats oppose.

""I appreciate her efforts as always to find a consensus, but the plan that she's suggested that I've seen in writing is not going to go anyplace at this stage,"" Reid said. ""They're not doing (Democrats) a favor by reopening the government. They're not doing us a favor by extending the debt ceiling. That's part of our jobs.""

Two White House officials said the Collins plan is constructive, but retains too many sequester-level spending cuts. The officials also expressed concern about Collins' proposed changes to the health care law, including a suspension of the medical device tax and income verification rules for individuals applying for federal subsidies. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because negotiations are ongoing.

It is unclear what budget framework can pass a Democratic-controlled Senate and a GOP-controlled House, where Boehner is under significant political pressure from conservatives to deliver a package that reins in the health care law in some way, or sets up a path for significant fiscal reforms.

Senate Democrats made clear Saturday that they were confident that House Republicans would eventually advance what the Senate can pass, even if it means Boehner will need to rely on House Democrats to do so. Democrats only want to negotiate on long-term budget issues after the government is reopened and the threat of default is off the table.

""We are not overplaying our hand. We are open to discussion in every way, and I think our Republican colleagues are moving in our direction,"" said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ""The fact that Obamacare is not a major part of the discussion anymore among most all Senate and many House Republicans all shows it's moving in a decent direction.""

Schumer said Democrats were open, however, to negotiations to alleviate unpopular, across-the-board spending cuts known as the sequester, and that the cuts were one of the central issues in the talks.

The government shutdown, which entered its 12th day Saturday, began when House Republicans refused to advance a stopgap funding bill to keep government open unless it dismantled the president's health care law in some way.

The shutdown has rolled into a battle to increase the nation's borrowing authority by Oct. 17, or risk a U.S. default on its debts that could rattle financial markets and cause sweeping economic unrest.

Obama told business leaders on a conference call Friday that he hoped a deal could be struck this weekend, but lawmakers were not optimistic that a final deal would be reached this weekend. Schumer said he expected a result in ""the next few days"" which means Congress could go right up against the default date.

Reid emphasized Saturday that it could be catastrophic for financial markets to reopen with no deal done and the threat of U.S. default looming. ""Everyone will lose. Not only in America, but around the world.""

As RNC chairman , Priebus is n't calling the plays : That 's up to House Republican leadership and the ambitious GOP governors roaming state capitols around the country . But he is reading the other team and making crucial adjustments to the game plan .
Priebus is also the general manager , responsible for helping build the team and manage the expectations of ownership .
And he has many owners to answer to : 168 Republicans who make up the national committee , deep-pocketed donors who write the checks , grass-roots activists who provide conservative energy , and the lawmakers who have an immediate personal stake in the party 's success .
That 's why Priebus is developing a political plan he hopes , in the near term , will re-energize his party in time for the 2014 midterm elections , while also developing a long-term strategy to compete among key demographic voting blocs -- Hispanic , Asian , African-American -- that broke so heavily Democratic in November .
To hear Priebus tell it , the goal is two-tiered : restructure the party on a tactical level to match the sophisticated and data-driven efforts of the Obama campaign , and create a communications plan to sell the GOP 's message to voters it failed to connect with in 2012 .
It 's an overwhelming task and it 's going to cost money , lots of money .
`` I 've been meeting with donors since the election in November , '' Priebus said . `` I would say I am pleasantly surprised how quickly the donors who have given so much are ready to build a party that is a year-round operation . ''
As he reflected on the presidential race , it quickly became clear that one of the most bothersome aspects of the presidential race was the marathon debate schedule .

The primary debates were a point of frustration for some Republicans , who felt the process was controlled by the news media , not the party , in the past election .
`` I believe that No . 1 , we have to control the debates , '' Priebus said . `` I think that having over 20 debates is too many , and I think we ought to regulate the debates , pick the moderators and get involved in setting the calendar . ''
Priebus cautioned his comments are not set in stone and he described his ideas in `` hypothetical '' terms .
One idea he mentioned was instituting a penalty system in which candidates for the nomination would lose a percentage of delegates if they participated in a debate not sanctioned by the RNC .
Dark horse candidates hungry for media attention would likely oppose such a move , but it 's unclear if they would have the power to prevent a change in the rules .
The idea of handpicking moderators would also face stiff opposition from the media organizations who foot the bill to stage and broadcast the debates .
As for the primary calendar , Priebus said he would like to see it condensed to allow the eventual GOP nominee more time to prepare for the general election .
In an ideal world , he said , the intra-party fight would start later and finish sooner , with the Republican National Convention possibly being held as early as June .
But he does n't talk about changing the order of the four leadoff primary and caucus states -- Iowa , New Hampshire , Nevada and South Carolina -- that have traditionally kicked off the nomination process .
`` I think that the carve-out states have served us well , but I think the timing of the calendar and the rest of the calendar issue should be looked at , '' he said .
Priebus rejected the notion of the RNC becoming involved in presidential primaries to assist the strongest candidate , but he was quick to point out that state Republican parties can choose to play in primaries if they want .
`` State parties can decide for themselves , '' he said . `` It 's their choice . ''
In terms of outreach to minorities , Priebus said the GOP failed to pass a very basic test .
`` Well , for one thing , we have to ask for the vote , '' he said . `` You have to ask for it and I do n't think that we 've been doing a very good job of that . ''
Priebus said a glaring organizational flaw for Republicans is that there have been no long-term investments made in human capital to help sell the GOP message on a neighborhood to neighborhood level .
It 's more than just having an outreach director in a state -- it 's having dedicated , full-time staffers on a grass-roots level to run `` voter registration , hold community events , go to swearing-in ceremonies ... having real job descriptions for lots and lots of people on a yearlong basis in communities that move the dial . ''
The party 's standing among Hispanics emerged as a damaging sore spot last year for national Republicans , who were forced to answer for hard-line immigration positions from prominent conservative figures , including their own presidential nominee .
Obama won with 71 % of the Hispanic vote , according to CNN national exit polls .
`` I think you are seeing a lot of movement from our party on these issues , '' said Priebus , who said outreach has already begun . `` A lot of it , I tell you , was tone . You know , it was n't necessarily the policy on immigration , it was what is coming out of your mouth . ''
He specifically mentioned a comment by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney , who suggested illegal immigrants might `` self-deport '' and leave the country willingly .
`` When you talk about stuff of self-deportation , it is probably not the best place to start , '' Priebus said .
Still , Priebus said he believes that Republicans , not Democrats , better represent the ideals and goals of all voters , including minorities who turned out in droves to re-elect the president .
Priebus plans to explain his vision for the overhaul of his party in more detail to the 168 RNC members who arrive in Charlotte , North Carolina , this week for a three-day meeting that will focus almost entirely on this subject .
Five Republican heavyweights -- Henry Barbour , Sally Bradshaw , Ari Fleischer , Zori Fonalledas and Glenn McCall -- are helping Priebus craft the recovery plan , dubbed `` The Growth and Opportunity Project . ''
Just as Obama asked Democrats to nominate him as their presidential nominee in Charlotte in September , Priebus will ask RNC members on Friday to elect him to another two-year term .
It will be more of a formality than an election , because Priebus has only token opposition and has locked down enough support to maintain his role as chairman .
`` Both the grass-roots and the donors have to be on the same page , and I think I am in a unique position to do that , '' he said .
Priebus is in a unique position because of his financial stewardship of the national committee , which two years ago was saddled with nearly $ 25 million in debt after the departure of controversial former RNC chairman Michael Steele .
`` Our money situation here was so bad that both credit cards were suspended when I walked in the door , '' he said . `` So when we went to go book travel or anything like that , we did n't have a credit card to put the travel on . Fortunately , we had my two credit cards , so we maxed out both of those cards . ''
Priebus estimated he spent $ 40,000 to $ 50,000 on his personal credit cards , which he was eventually reimbursed .
Dialing for dollars became Priebus ' priority , a tough task for a depressed donor base that saw super PACs and the congressional campaign committees as viable alternatives to the poorly managed RNC .
When he started as chairman , Priebus said there were fewer than 100 major RNC donors , people who contributed more than $ 15,000 per year . By the close of his first year , he said 1,000 people were donating $ 30,000-plus each year .
Paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission showed the RNC ended 2012 with about $ 3.3 million in the bank and no debt .
Unlike two years ago , Priebus wo n't have to use his own credit card to pay for his plane ticket to Charlotte .
Now the big question is whether he will be able to raise enough money to transform the party , and if he can , will his fellow Republicans embrace his plan ?","Story highlights Reince Priebus, who engineered turnaround in GOP's finances, is up for re-election

When he started as chairman, Priebus said there were fewer than 100 major RNC donors, people who contributed more than $15,000 per year. By the close of his first year, he said 1,000 people were donating $30,000-plus each year.

Paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission showed the RNC ended 2012 with about $3.3 million in the bank and no debt.

N.A.A.C.P. officials said they were encouraged that a prominent Republican would challenge his party. “But the proof is always in the pudding in terms of seeing exactly what policies and measures he might support as an elected official,” said Jotaka Eaddy, the group’s senior director of voting rights.",www.nytimes.com,left,jPSEc8cHvI2w5Gwr

In public, mentor Bush and protege Rubio have avoided criticizing each other since Rubio announced his candidacy.

But Bush allies have started quietly spreading negative information about Rubio’s record. Also, supporters of the two Miami politicians are drawing contrasts between Rubio, a 43-year-old son of Cuban immigrants, and 62-year-old Bush, a member of one of the nation’s most powerful political dynasties.

“Sparks are going to fly,” said Al Cardenas, a Bush adviser who is also close to Rubio. “For the first time in our country’s history you’ve got two guys from the same town in the same state from same party running in the same primary.”

He added: “You can bet that regardless of how nice Jeb or Marco wants to be, their staffs are going to do anything they can to win.”

As Bush tries to convince Republicans of his conservative credentials, supporters are asserting that as governor, he was far more conservative than Rubio when both held prominent state posts. Rubio served as Florida House speaker in the two years immediately after Bush left the governor’s mansion.

Their relationship was close then.

Bush viewed Rubio as a protector of his political legacy. The governor presented Rubio with a golden sword in a ceremony symbolizing a political handoff nearly a decade ago, an endorsement that Rubio’s advisers point to when asked about the Bush camp’s early aggression now.

“I have it somewhere at home,” Rubio said of the sword. Asked about it while campaigning in New Hampshire on the weekend, he suggested the keepsake is not prominently displayed in his house. “I have young kids. I don’t want them running around with a sword,” he said.

They still call each other friends. But subtle criticism has emerged as Rubio speaks of the need to break with ideas from the last century and Bush questions whether one term in the Senate can prepare anyone for the White House.

Rubio’s respect for Bush is well-documented in his writings and years of political activity when he relied on Bush’s support, donor network and even former staff to help his own rise.

Rubio said he would not enter Florida’s 2010 Senate contest were Bush to run, and Bush didn’t.

Rubio was expected to defer to Bush again in the 2016 presidential contest once Bush began preparing for the race. Instead, Rubio this past week announced his own presidential campaign in their hometown, insisting the stakes were too high for him to “wait his turn.” Bush has not declared his candidacy but is expected to.

Rubio’s move forced prominent Florida Republicans such as Cardenas to pick sides.

Bush “feels disappointed because he’s cared for him for so long,” said Cardenas, who attended Rubio’s wedding. “You just don’t want to go to battle against someone you care for.”

Just below the surface, the battles have begun.

Several former Florida legislators now aligned with Bush challenged Rubio’s conservative credentials during his time as speaker. In the Senate, Rubio has opposed taxpayer-financed special projects known as earmarks. But he supported them as a state legislator, these critics point out, in one year alone requesting $43 million in such spending for public works, autism and substance abuse programs.

“Bush was more conservative,” said U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Fla., who served in the Legislature with Rubio and while Bush was governor, and now supports Bush.

Ross highlighted Bush’s aggressive use of the line-item veto to cut government spending, regardless of whether such spending benefited members of his own party.

Former state Rep. Juan-Carlos Planas, who also worked with both men and now backs Bush, made a similar point. “There were always projects that were important to Marco’s constituents,” he said. “And they always ended up in the budget.”

Rubio’s team declined to respond to those statements and hasn’t cast Bush or other rivals in a negative light.

Bush and Rubio courted New Hampshire primary voters on the same stage, hours apart Friday, but did not cross paths.

“He is a good, close friend,” Bush said. “It is what it is.”

“Jeb Bush is my friend,” Rubio said. “This is a race. It’ll be a competitive environment.”

If that fails , the next plan is to deny him a win at the GOP convention in Cleveland by peeling away pledged delegates on the second or third round of balloting .
And if that fails , a group of Republicans are readying a nuclear option : running a third-party alternative in just a handful of critical swing states in order to block both Trump and likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton from gaining the necessary 270 electoral votes required to claim the White House .
In such instances , according to the 12th Amendment to the Constitution , the choosing of the next president would then fall to the House of Representatives . In the House , each state casts one vote , and considering the current Republican majority in that chamber , would give the election to this newly created third-party ticket .
Among the dozen or so Republican operatives and donors who have been strategizing about putting this plan into action , the “ 12th Amendment Operation ” has several advantages over plans to deny Trump the nomination at the GOP convention in July . Even if Trump fails to garner the 1,237 delegates needed to win before Cleveland—as seems likely—Republicans fear a massive backlash if Trump is close to achieving the delegate threshold , as also seems likely .
Although many Republicans worry that Trump on top of the ticket would lead to a wave of electoral defeats—not just for the presidency but for down-ballot Senate , House and gubernatorial races—there is also an acknowledgement among the Republican establishment that Trump has energized a portion of the electorate that does not often turn out in GOP primaries . And anything seen as “ stealing ” the nomination from the delegate-leader at the convention is likely to backfire .
A third-party spoiler candidacy however would not be officially sanctioned by the Republican Party , and so supporters of the plan believe it would be a chance to put a conservative Trump alternative into the White House without permanently turning off new , Trump-energized voters .
Unlike other plans to hatch a third-party campaign , which involve gathering millions of signatures to achieve 50-state ballot access as Ross Perot did in 1992 , or somehow taking over an existing party , like the Libertarian Party , this “ 12th Amendment Operation ” would be relatively straightforward .
Taking as a baseline that Donald Trump is likely to win anywhere from 140 to 191 electoral votes based on his strength in the South , the upper plains and parts of the Mountain West , organizers would focus on just handful of states needed to deny Clinton 270 electoral votes . Targeting just a couple of large , electoral vote-rich states—such as , say , Texas and Florida , or Ohio and Virginia— along with a handful of smaller states like Maine , New Hampshire or Nevada , would allow organizers to avoid wasting money on costly ballot access in the rest of the nation , and would permit a campaign to target all of their resources and campaign energy in just a few places .
The most immediate task for organizers is to settle on a candidate . The current plans call for a bipartisan ticket featuring a Republican elder statesman as the presidential candidate and anti-Clinton Democrat as the vice-presidential nominee . Jim Webb , the Republican turned Democratic senator who briefly ran for president last year , has been mentioned as one down-ticket possibility , under the theory that Webb could help exploit Clinton ’ s lack of popularity among white voters and possibly help deliver Pennsylvania or Virginia . For the top of the ticket , among the names being discussed are Tom Coburn , the former Oklahoma senator seen as a senior statesman among GOP faithful , and someone who has expressed an interest in taking part in a Stop Trump effort ; former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ; and James Mattis , a retired Marine general .
“ We realize that this is not how we would have preferred this election season to go , but there is an acknowledgment that we are living in a period without real historical precedent , ” said Rick Wilson , a longtime Florida-based GOP consultant who—after helping run a pro-Marco Rubio SuperPAC—has emerged as one of the leaders of the Stop Trump movement and has been helping in the 12th Amendment Operation planning .
“ Trump would be box office poison for Republicans and may destroy the party for the forseeable future . There is a growing anxiety and a sense that something has to be done . ”
Wilson declined to name who else was working on this effort , though he did say that it was around “ 12-15 people in the Republican firmament—consultants , elected officials and donors . ”
Joel Searby , of the political polling firm Data Targeting , is also said to be spearheading the effort according to another Republican operative unaffiliated with the group .
However , among the diverse array of Republican forces aligned to halt Trump , there was some skepticism that sending the election to the House would save the country from the prospect of a Trump presidency .
“ It sounds incredibly complicated . Anytime you get Congress involved you never know what is going to happen , ” said Liz Mair , a well-connected GOP operative running a “ Stop Trump ” PAC that is focused on denying him delegates at the convention , and failing that , running a 50-state write-in campaign . “ If the Republican Party doesn ’ t have the balls to deny Trump the nomination , they aren ’ t going to have the balls to do this . Look , I ’ d vote for a piece of dried dog turd before I ’ d vote for Trump or Hillary , but this sounds like the last , last , last , last , last , last resort . ”
Only once before in American history has the House of Representatives chosen the president . In 1824 , despite winning the most electoral votes , Andrew Jackson failed to win a majority in a four-way race .

This renegade band of unconventional politicians already lives for the next fight — which has been kicked beyond the holidays to early 2014 . And none of Washington ’ s traditional levers of influence seem able to divert them from the goal of fighting again .
The threat of being stripped of committee assignments , losing party support for re-election or being blamed in the polls for the shutdown has little effect on the likes of Republican Sens . Ted Cruz , Rand Paul or Mike Lee and their allies in the House .

There ’ s also a misunderstanding in the mainstream media about really motivated these boat-rockers : It wasn ’ t about actually stopping Democrats from taking the Affordable Care Act across the goal line , nor was it about raising the debt ceiling before Mr. Obama and the Democrats offered any significant spending cuts .
Rather , it was about showing that there were Republicans in Congress who understood that standing and fighting was itself the goal — the endgame that disparaging critics on the left , right and center said was glaringly absent from Mr. Cruz ’ s crusade .
“ He ’ s done a good job drawing attention to Obamacare and that Obamacare is something that is going to be damaging to people , ” Mr. Paul said of Mr. Cruz in a television interview on Sunday . “ And , for that , I think he ’ s done a great service in bringing attention to , I think , something that ’ s really going to be bad for a lot of Americans . ”
The goal-line stand itself would , in the minds of many conservatives , show dispirited GOP rank-and-filers that their party still had hopes and aspirations for reclaiming a relevance lost since the Reagan era .
“ Our leaders in Congress have been bent and broken so many times by the Democrats and President Obama that this became a must-do line in the sand for them , ” explained Bruce Ash of Arizona , chairman of the Republican National Committee ’ s Standing Rules Committee and of its Conservative Caucus . “ The GOP leadership had its back up against the wall — a bad place to be . ”

But conservatives beyond the Beltway ( and a few inside ) saw the Cruz obstinacy as a necessary public rejection of bipartisanship as practiced since the days of President George H.W . Bush ’ s 1990 budget compromise with the congressional Democratic leaders , when he broke his no-new-taxes pledge and accepted the Democrats ’ demand to cut spending by $ 2 for every $ 1 in tax increases . The GOP kept their part of the bargain ; the Democrats didn ’ t , but they still got $ 137 billion in tax increases from 1991 through 1995 that they had originally wanted .
Government grew faster under the elder Mr. Bush than it had at any time since President Johnson ’ s War on Poverty years .
The GOP rebels in Congress have been doing a slow burn over the failure of their party to block or even slow government growth , which has been faster under Mr. Obama than under President George W. Bush , who increased spending more than any of his six predecessors , including Mr. Johnson . And it wasn ’ t just entitlements . In his eight years in the White House , President Bush increased discretionary spending by an eye-popping 49 percent .
Some conservative Republican strategists around the country , including some surprisingly prominent ones , have been saying privately that things had come to a head in the last few weeks because the GOP had shown itself to be so weak that it was bordering on irrelevance , even while controlling one house of Congress .
True , two years ago , Republicans staged a mini-showdown over the debt ceiling , today ’ s GOP House and Senate rebels acknowledge . They wanted the Democrats to agree to a “ cut , cap and balance ” agenda on spending and the federal deficit . The Republican got some cuts and caps . It was not what they considered enough , but certainly more than if they had not used their leverage .
Since that modest accomplishment , they had done nothing to block what they see as the Democrats ’ ongoing drive to socialize the economy and increase dependency on the government .
The boat-rockers among the House GOP ’ s majority and the Cruz-Lee-Paul faction among the Senate GOP ’ s minority decided that with Obamacare about to be implemented , they better at least try to do something . They knew they could not win , but it would at least show they understood the nation was about to pass the point of no return in another major advance toward what they called European-style socialism by funding the Affordable Care Act .
The problem from these GOP rebels ’ viewpoint was that the majority of the Washington GOP establishment had no fight in them . Those moderate GOP leaders were warriors in the cause of limited government no more — if they ever were .
That left some rebels torn over strategy , inclined , as one of them put it privately , “ to cruise with Ted ” but at the same time thinking , “ It would be nice to walk out on a limb and not have the surrender caucus behind you sawing it off before you even get started . ”
Act 5 of the shutdown drama this week leaves unclear just what was accomplished . Do enough GOP voters see the party as having reasserted its relevance , at least somewhat , to win in 2014 and in 2016 ?
However worthy Mr. Cruz ’ s goals , Republicans close to the action on Capitol Hill say the freshman Texan ’ s tactics have annoyed beyond redemption almost all his GOP colleagues with what they see as his grandstanding in preparation for a 2016 presidential nomination bid .
Many of these same Republicans say Mr. Paul , also a probable 2016 nomination contender , did not desert Mr. Cruz in holding out for significant concessions from Democrats . At the same time , the Kentucky Republican made it clear he thought a government shutdown was bad for his party and his country — and he refrained from attacks on the leadership . How that plays with donors in 2016 is not knowable at this point , partisans of each man say .
A surprisingly number of prominent Republicans are saying that if the GOP loses the 2016 presidential elections , the party will go the way of the Whigs — or formally split into a moderate party and a conservative party .
“ Those Republican rebels in Congress may have demonstrated , at least until the shutdown ended , that there are some GOP leaders still standing for principles and understanding spending and Obamacare are moral issues of the day , ” Solomon Yue of Oregon , a founder of the RNC ’ s Conservative Caucus , wrote in an email .
“ If we are not willing to fight on those issues , Republicans could become Whigs , ” Mr. Yue said . “ Therefore , the shutdown drama not only re-energized our demoralized base but also preserved our GOP army for the fight in 2014 and beyond as far as our grassroots are concerned . ”
Reality , however , may be what the masters of perception in the GOP and Democratic leadership and in the Fourth Estate say it is — a debacle for Mr. Cruz and his party ’ s image . That wasn ’ t the case with Ronald Reagan , depicted by the political and press establishments as a trigger-happy cowboy and intellectually handicapped B movie actor , or George W. Bush , also depicted as intellectually wanting .
That was then ; today , polls show the GOP took the biggest hit among the public in the spending and debt showdown . Some conservatives insist , however , on putting principles over polls , in part because doing so can lead to eventual victory rising out of apparent defeat .
“ If the Founders made their decisions based on poll numbers : 33 percent for revolution , 33 percent for King George and 33 percent in the middle , we would not have America , ” Mr. Yue said .","ANALYSIS:

The rowdy, stubborn species of conservatives who forced the 16-day shutdown of government and brought the nation to the brink of default can only see victory in their loss in the debt-ceiling battle.

They’ve got a new rallying cry, and a new moniker for their archenemy of establishment politicians and status quo government: the “Surrender Caucus.”

And anyone who dares think the latest crisis averted will end the cycle of budget battles, debt default threats and assaults on Obamacare should think again.

This renegade band of unconventional politicians already lives for the next fight — which has been kicked beyond the holidays to early 2014. And none of Washington’s traditional levers of influence seem able to divert them from the goal of fighting again.

The threat of being stripped of committee assignments, losing party support for re-election or being blamed in the polls for the shutdown has little effect on the likes of Republican Sens. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul or Mike Lee and their allies in the House.

“We are getting zero fiscal discipline,” a frustrated Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, explaining why he voted against the budget deal despite hailing from a state that voted for President Obama during the last two elections.

Since that modest accomplishment, they had done nothing to block what they see as the Democrats’ ongoing drive to socialize the economy and increase dependency on the government.

The boat-rockers among the House GOP’s majority and the Cruz-Lee-Paul faction among the Senate GOP’s minority decided that with Obamacare about to be implemented, they better at least try to do something. They knew they could not win, but it would at least show they understood the nation was about to pass the point of no return in another major advance toward what they called European-style socialism by funding the Affordable Care Act.

The problem from these GOP rebels’ viewpoint was that the majority of the Washington GOP establishment had no fight in them. Those moderate GOP leaders were warriors in the cause of limited government no more — if they ever were.

That left some rebels torn over strategy, inclined, as one of them put it privately, “to cruise with Ted” but at the same time thinking, “It would be nice to walk out on a limb and not have the surrender caucus behind you sawing it off before you even get started.”

Fallout

Act 5 of the shutdown drama this week leaves unclear just what was accomplished. Do enough GOP voters see the party as having reasserted its relevance, at least somewhat, to win in 2014 and in 2016?

However worthy Mr. Cruz’s goals, Republicans close to the action on Capitol Hill say the freshman Texan’s tactics have annoyed beyond redemption almost all his GOP colleagues with what they see as his grandstanding in preparation for a 2016 presidential nomination bid.

Many of these same Republicans say Mr. Paul, also a probable 2016 nomination contender, did not desert Mr. Cruz in holding out for significant concessions from Democrats. At the same time, the Kentucky Republican made it clear he thought a government shutdown was bad for his party and his country — and he refrained from attacks on the leadership. How that plays with donors in 2016 is not knowable at this point, partisans of each man say.

A surprisingly number of prominent Republicans are saying that if the GOP loses the 2016 presidential elections, the party will go the way of the Whigs — or formally split into a moderate party and a conservative party.

“Those Republican rebels in Congress may have demonstrated, at least until the shutdown ended, that there are some GOP leaders still standing for principles and understanding spending and Obamacare are moral issues of the day,” Solomon Yue of Oregon, a founder of the RNC’s Conservative Caucus, wrote in an email.

“If we are not willing to fight on those issues, Republicans could become Whigs,” Mr. Yue said. “Therefore, the shutdown drama not only re-energized our demoralized base but also preserved our GOP army for the fight in 2014 and beyond as far as our grassroots are concerned.”

Reality, however, may be what the masters of perception in the GOP and Democratic leadership and in the Fourth Estate say it is — a debacle for Mr. Cruz and his party’s image. That wasn’t the case with Ronald Reagan, depicted by the political and press establishments as a trigger-happy cowboy and intellectually handicapped B movie actor, or George W. Bush, also depicted as intellectually wanting.

That was then; today, polls show the GOP took the biggest hit among the public in the spending and debt showdown. Some conservatives insist, however, on putting principles over polls, in part because doing so can lead to eventual victory rising out of apparent defeat.

“If the Founders made their decisions based on poll numbers: 33 percent for revolution, 33 percent for King George and 33 percent in the middle, we would not have America,” Mr. Yue said.
