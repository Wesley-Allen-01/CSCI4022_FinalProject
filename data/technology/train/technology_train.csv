That ’ s one vision that Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh has laid out for the next phase of military cyber operations — and in a rare occurrence in the cyber realm , he elaborated with examples .
“ How do you make an enemy air defense system go completely blank in the first minute of the conflict ? ” Welsh asked reporters last week . “ How do you make a [ surface to air missile ] radar show a thousand false targets that all look real so you don ’ t know where the real package is in the middle of that ? How do you keep enemy surface to surface missiles from ever launching — or [ fly ] halfway to their target and then turn around and go home ? ”
The military services devote a lot of effort to defending their networks against cyberattacks and supporting the intelligence community , he said , but so far not enough pursuing cyber weapons they could wield the way they now deploy fighter squadrons or infantry battalions .
“ We haven ’ t thought of the domain in terms of our core missions robustly enough , and so that ’ s the focus we have right now , ” Welsh said . “ I ’ ve been calling it ‘ Big Cyber. ’ How does the Air Force get into big Air Force cyber stuff ? … How do you create airpower through the cyber domain ? ”
Answering those questions and achieving something like Welsh ’ s vision will take effort , time and billions of dollars , officials acknowledge .
For example , the U.S. Cyber Command , the military ’ s primary operational unit , needs a “ range ” on which its troops could train , the way Marine riflemen practice their marksmanship . It needs “ aggressors , ” against whom to rehearse — the way Air Force pilots duel with other fighters playing the role of the bad guys . And it needs more time to develop as a command and figure out how to integrate into the operational military .
“ They currently do not have a robust capability , ” said the Pentagon ’ s top cyber guru , Assistant Secretary of Defense Eric Rosenbach , who has appeared recently before the Senate Armed Services Committee ’ s emerging threats panel .
Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida , the committee ’ s ranking Democrat , said that in terms of going on offense , CyberCom ’ s units are basically “ hollow . ”
Defense officials don ’ t agree , but they acknowledge the Pentagon is taking incremental steps , said CyberCom ’ s deputy commander , Air Force Lt. Gen. James McLaughlin . It ’ s building a “ Cyber Mission Force ” that will include 133 teams made up of about 6,200 troops and Defense Department civilians , which it wants ready for action by fiscal 2018 . That cadre would defend military networks , defend the U.S. against attacks of “ significant consequence ” and conduct “ full-spectrum operations ” for “ contingency plans and military operations , ” according to CyberCom ’ s written statement .

Sustaining and growing that force will be a challenge for the traditional military system of recruiting and training . That ’ s why Defense Secretary Ash Carter has said the military branches need to rewrite some of their personnel policies to improve their ability to recruit and keep the most talented computer experts in a marketplace with fierce competition from Wall Street and Silicon Valley .
“ As our growing economy creates more civilian jobs , which is a good thing obviously , we ’ re going to have to work harder to compete to keep bringing in America ’ s best and brightest to our military , ” Carter said . “ When it comes to recruiting some of the most highly skilled parts of our force , like cybersecurity specialists , who are also in high demand in corporate America , we ’ ll have to be even more creative , because we ’ re going to need a lot more of them in the years to come . ”
There are also major questions about how much is possible or even practical for tactical cyberattacks , said Martin Libicki , a senior management scientist and information warfare expert with the government-funded RAND Corp. There ’ s a lot of promise and some precedent , he said , but what the military is actually doing in the cyber realm is so secret it is hard to know for certain .
“ What the Air Force is talking about is neither science fiction nor something you can always count on — it ’ s somewhere in between , ” he told ███ .
Libicki cited reports that Israel used a cyber weapon to neutralize Syria ’ s air defenses when it attacked its nascent nuclear reactor in 2007 , as well as claims the U.S. attempted a similar effort when it attacked Serbia in 1999 . So integrated air defenses are natural targets for American cyberattacks — but the owners of such systems know that , too .
“ The more complex the system , the greater the likelihood you ’ ll be able to find a vulnerability , ” Libicki said . “ We have a lot of good hackers within the Air Force , the NSA and so forth busy looking for that type of stuff — but on the other side , there are a lot of competent defenders . ”
For Welsh and other military commanders , the potential benefits are too rich to ignore . But he also acknowledged that the Air Force and other services were still in the early stages of figuring out how to juggle traditional missions and capabilities with what could be possible in the cyber realm .
“ For us , the balance in the future ’ s going to be operating in those three domains of air , space and cyber , ” he said . “ How do you manage the balance ? Can you become more efficient or control costs while maintaining the same operational capability ? If so — it ’ s like nirvana . ”","The Pentagon wants cyber weapons that can inflict “blunt force trauma.”

That’s one vision that Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh has laid out for the next phase of military cyber operations — and in a rare occurrence in the cyber realm, he elaborated with examples.

And it needs more time to develop as a command and figure out how to integrate into the operational military.

“They currently do not have a robust capability,” said the Pentagon’s top cyber guru, Assistant Secretary of Defense Eric Rosenbach, who has appeared recently before the Senate Armed Services Committee’s emerging threats panel.

Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida, the committee’s ranking Democrat, said that in terms of going on offense, CyberCom’s units are basically “hollow.”

Defense officials don’t agree, but they acknowledge the Pentagon is taking incremental steps, said CyberCom’s deputy commander, Air Force Lt. Gen. James McLaughlin. It’s building a “Cyber Mission Force” that will include 133 teams made up of about 6,200 troops and Defense Department civilians, which it wants ready for action by fiscal 2018. That cadre would defend military networks, defend the U.S. against attacks of “significant consequence” and conduct “full-spectrum operations” for “contingency plans and military operations,” according to CyberCom’s written statement.

Sustaining and growing that force will be a challenge for the traditional military system of recruiting and training. That’s why Defense Secretary Ash Carter has said the military branches need to rewrite some of their personnel policies to improve their ability to recruit and keep the most talented computer experts in a marketplace with fierce competition from Wall Street and Silicon Valley.

“As our growing economy creates more civilian jobs, which is a good thing obviously, we’re going to have to work harder to compete to keep bringing in America’s best and brightest to our military,” Carter said. “When it comes to recruiting some of the most highly skilled parts of our force, like cybersecurity specialists, who are also in high demand in corporate America, we’ll have to be even more creative, because we’re going to need a lot more of them in the years to come.”

There are also major questions about how much is possible or even practical for tactical cyberattacks, said Martin Libicki, a senior management scientist and information warfare expert with the government-funded RAND Corp. There’s a lot of promise and some precedent, he said, but what the military is actually doing in the cyber realm is so secret it is hard to know for certain.

“What the Air Force is talking about is neither science fiction nor something you can always count on — it’s somewhere in between,” he told POLITICO.

Libicki cited reports that Israel used a cyber weapon to neutralize Syria’s air defenses when it attacked its nascent nuclear reactor in 2007, as well as claims the U.S. attempted a similar effort when it attacked Serbia in 1999. So integrated air defenses are natural targets for American cyberattacks — but the owners of such systems know that, too.

“The more complex the system, the greater the likelihood you’ll be able to find a vulnerability,” Libicki said. “We have a lot of good hackers within the Air Force, the NSA and so forth busy looking for that type of stuff — but on the other side, there are a lot of competent defenders.”

For Welsh and other military commanders, the potential benefits are too rich to ignore. But he also acknowledged that the Air Force and other services were still in the early stages of figuring out how to juggle traditional missions and capabilities with what could be possible in the cyber realm.

“For us, the balance in the future’s going to be operating in those three domains of air, space and cyber,” he said. “How do you manage the balance? Can you become more efficient or control costs while maintaining the same operational capability? If so — it’s like nirvana.”",www.politico.com,left,STjYkVpWai4RRjRb

What's its role as a gatekeeper?

With billions of views a day, YouTube can propel careers, make someone a household name, promote brands and push political agendas. But how far should it go as a gatekeeper of online content? That debate is magnified by the recent banning of Alex Jones' website, Infowars, from YouTube and other social media platforms.

So, who is buying the fake views?

During its investigation, the Times found that Devumi’s customers included an employee of RT, the media company backed by the Russian government, and an employee of Al Jazeera English, another state-backed company, the report stated. Other buyers included a filmmaker for Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy group, and the head of video at The New York Post.

What is done to stop it?

All technology encodes within it certain values and assumptions about how the world works. Gutenberg’s press was more than a mere printing machine — it popularized the ideal of free information exchange. The telegraph system transformed people’s perceptions of time and distance, while the radio helped invent the concept of a single shared nationality, culture and language.

Every country wants to build their own Silicon Valley, and every city has ambitions to be a tech hub. Read any political manifesto from across the spectrum, and you’ll find yourself lost in a world of smart cities, lean governments and flexible workers.

And to whom do we look in order to solve our collective social problems? It’s no longer the state, but the modern tech-geek superhero. Space travel and climate change has fallen to Elon Musk. We look to Google to solve health problems and sort out ageing.

One UK MP suggested we might run the National Health Service like Uber, while another pitched the idea of Airbnb-style room rentals for patients who needed to stay overnight. Heaven help us all.

Total victory for the monopoly is not over economics or politics. It’s over assumptions, ideas and possible futures. Because when that happens, Big Tech won’t need to lobby or buy out competitors. They will have so insinuated themselves in our lives and minds, that we won’t be able to imagine a world without them.

Ahead of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey ’ s testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Wednesday , Jones confronted CNN ’ s Oliver Darcy outside the hearing room , accusing the reporter of leading a campaign to purge Infowars from the Internet .
A Twitter spokesperson told the Daily Beast that Jones ’ exchange with Darcy — in which he referred to the activist reporter as a “ rat , ” “ possum , ” “ evil-looking , ” and a “ virus ” — violated the platform ’ s Terms of Services . Jones mocked Darcy during the confrontation , predicting the CNN reporter would “ go to Twitter and say , ‘ He ’ s bullying me ! I ’ m only trying to deplatform [ inaudible ] and celebrating it , and then insulting my viewers a week later , saying no one ’ s doing it ! ' ”
The company warned it will “ take action ” against Infowars if Jones attempts to bypass the permanent suspension .
In addition , Twitter has placed Infowars editor-at-large Paul Joseph Watson under a 12-hour suspension . A screenshot obtained by ███ shows Watson ’ s account was temporarily limited after sharing a video of the exchange between Jones and Darcy , with minimal commentary : “ Here ’ s the video of Alex Jones confronting CNN ’ s @ oliverdarcy – the reporter who lobbied YouTube & Facebook to shut down Infowars . ‘ You are incredibly shameful , ’ Jones told Darcy , adding , ‘ You are literally an anti-American , anti-free speech coward . ' ”
In response , Watson told ███ , “ The fact that Alex Jones has been banned for ‘ targeted harassment ’ for a video in which he had a forthright but ultimately peaceful exchange of views with a CNN reporter is ludicrous . ”
“ This is clearly corporate media working in cahoots with Big Tech to silence its competition once again , ” he added .
Darcy has repeatedly dismissed concerns of big tech platforms suppressing conservatives and Republicans during an election year , recently criticizing President Donald Trump bringing attention to the issue in a series of tweets last week . “ President Donald Trump on Friday morning claimed in a tweet that social media companies are ‘ silencing millions of people , ’ exacerbating a longstanding paranoia from conservatives who have for years erroneously accused social media companies of bias and censorship , ” he wrote last Friday .
The article cited the president ’ s tweet calling on Silicon Valley to stop censoring social media users in its so-called fight against fake news . “ Social Media Giants are silencing millions of people . Can ’ t do this even if it means we must continue to hear Fake News like CNN , whose ratings have suffered gravely . People have to figure out what is real , and what is not , without censorship ! ” Trump tweeted last Friday .
Darcy also accused conservatives of falsely claiming they are being “ unfairly treated ” by Silicon Valley giants to exploit what he describes as a “ flimsy narrative. ” Further , The CNN reporter claims previous disciplinary actions against Jones were due to “ hate speech ” and “ harassment ” — not political ideology . “ The tech platforms said they removed Jones ’ content for violations of their hate speech and harassment guidelines . They have maintained that they do not discriminate against users for their political beliefs , ” he wrote .
On August 14 , Twitter slapped Jones with a seven-day suspension , which prevented him from tweeting or retweeting content . In a video shared on Infowars ’ Twitter account , Jones said Twitter suspended him over a video he shared in which he implored the president to investigate the social media censorship of conservatives .
Earlier in the month , Apple , Facebook , YouTube , and Spotify removed large amounts of content produced Jones and Infowars .
Apple removed the Alex Jones Show , along with five additional Infowars programs , from iTunes , citing “ hate speech. ” “ Apple does not tolerate hate speech , and we have clear guidelines that creators and developers must follow to ensure we provide a safe environment for all of our users , ” the company said in a statement . “ Podcasts that violate these guidelines are removed from our directory making them no longer searchable or available for download or streaming . We believe in representing a wide range of views , so long as people are respectful to those with differing opinions . ”
Following Apple ’ s lead , Facebook unpublished four InfoWars pages from their platform : the Alex Jones Channel Page , the Alex Jones Page , the Infowars Page , and the Infowars Nightly News Page . In a blog post , Facebook alleged the pages were removed due to the news outlet violating the company ’ s “ hate speech and bullying policies . ”

technology,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2017/12/14/16774148/net-neutrality-repeal-explained,Net neutrality is now officially on life support. Here’s what happens next.,2017-12-14,"Aja Romano, Sigal Samuel, Terry Nguyen, Rebecca Jennings, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz, Theodore Schleifer","Net neutrality still has a shot at survival , but its vital signs are weakening .
As of June 11 , 2018 , the FCC ’ s controversial repeal of the 2015 act that enshrined net neutrality into law has officially taken effect . That means net neutrality , currently , no longer exists .
Net neutrality requires internet service providers like Verizon and Comcast to distribute internet access fairly and equally to everyone , regardless of how much they pay or where they ’ re located . The incendiary FCC vote in December to repeal those requirements happened despite overwhelming public support for the regulation . The FCC instead had backing from a long list of Republican lawmakers , and FCC chair Ajit Pai was clearly determined to move ahead with the repeal amid a tense hearing that was briefly evacuated due to a security threat .
Since December , however , a groundswell of support has helped keep the conversation around net neutrality — and attempts to save it — alive . These efforts have included a successful move by the Senate to cancel the repeal using the Congressional Review Act , which lets Congress reverse — and , crucially , permanently block — any federal regulation with a simple majority vote . The Senate ’ s resolution , which passed 52-47 , was concurrent with a storm of activism across the internet — this time with far more urgency than last year ’ s milquetoast protests .
From the Senate , however , the path to repeal gets considerably more complicated . The House is less likely to support the Senate ’ s resolution , and even if it makes it out of Congress onto President Trump ’ s desk , the president would most likely veto it .
The implications of the FCC ’ s repeal are vast and complicated . If congressional efforts to save net neutrality fail and the repeal is allowed to take effect , it will almost certainly fundamentally change how people access and use the internet . But there ’ s also still the ghost of a chance that the repeal might be overturned , not by Congress , but by the US Court of Appeals . All 22 states with a Democratic attorney general have signed onto a joint lawsuit against the FCC to revoke the rules , and this might be the best chance we have at enshrining net neutrality protection into the fabric of internet law .
Here ’ s what you need to know about what ’ s happened with net neutrality , and what could happen next .
In December , the FCC voted on the Restoring Internet Freedom Order , which concerned the repeal of Title II protection for net neutrality .
Title II is a decades-old regulatory clause under which internet service providers ( ISPs ) have been ruled telecommunications companies and subject to the same regulations that other telecommunication companies — classified as utilities — must abide by . That basic regulatory standard is what people are referring to when they talk about net neutrality . Title II was first applied to ISPs in 2015 , after a hard-won fight by internet activists .
Placing ISPs under Title II was the only legal way — barring the unlikely introduction and passage of Congressional legislation instituting complicated new regulatory procedures — in which these companies could be regulated .
The FCC ’ s repeal did institute one very thin piece of ISP regulation in place of net neutrality — a version of a 2010 transparency ruling that requires ISPs to inform consumers when the ISPs are deliberately slowing their internet speed . The FCC will be passing off the enforcement of this transparency stipulation to the FTC , in a long-planned and recently formalized agreement that will allow the two commissions “ to work together to take targeted action against bad actors. ” That phrasing , however , leaves open a wide playing field for major telecom companies . In other words , now that the FCC has repealed Title II classification for ISPs , the ISPs will essentially be unregulated .
2 ) Why does it matter if ISPs are regulated or not ?
Classifying ISPs as utility companies under Title II meant they had to treat the internet like every other utility — that is , just like gas , water , or phone service — and that they couldn ’ t cut off service at will or control how much of it any one person received based on how much that person paid for it . The idea was that the internet should be a public service that everyone has a right to use , not a privilege , and that regulating ISPs like utilities would prevent them from hijacking or monopolize that access .
The best argument for the rollback of this Title II protection is that maybe the internet isn ’ t a public service — maybe it ’ s just another product , and in a free market system , competition over who gets to sell you that product would ensure accountability and fair treatment among providers , if only due to economic self-interest .
But there ’ s a huge problem with that argument , which is that , as far as the internet is concerned , there really isn ’ t a free and open market . In the United States , competition among ISPs was driven down years ago thanks to the consolidated nature of internet broadband infrastructure , which has typically been owned by major corporations , shutting out local ISP competitors .
That ’ s why many people don ’ t really have much choice about which company they pay for internet access — that access has been monopolized by a handful of powerful companies . In fact , nearly 50 million households have only one high-speed ISP in their area .
These particular utility companies , now unregulated , have free reign to behave like the corporate monopolies they are . Where net neutrality ensured the preservation of what ’ s been dubbed “ the open internet , ” its repeal will open the door for ISPs to create “ an internet for the elite . ”
3 ) What will happen to the internet without net neutrality protections in place ?
Net neutrality mandated that ISPs display all websites , at the same speed , to all sources of internet traffic . Without net neutrality , all bets are off .
That means ISPs will be free to control what you access on the internet , meaning they will be able to block access to specific websites and pieces of software that interact with the internet .
They might charge you more or less money to access specific “ bundles ” of certain websites , much as cable television providers do now — but instead of “ basic cable , ” you might be forced to pay for access to more than a “ basic ” number of websites , as this popular pro-net neutrality graphic illustrates :
ISPs will also be able to control how quickly you ’ re served webpages , how quickly you can download and upload things , and in what contexts you can access which websites , depending on how much money you pay them .
They ’ ll be able to charge you more to access sites you currently visit for free , cap how much data you ’ re allowed to use , redirect you from sites you are trying to use to sites they want you to use instead , and block you from being able to access apps , products , and information offered by their competitors or other companies they don ’ t like .
They can even block you from being able to access information on certain topics , news events , or issues they don ’ t want you to know about .
Finally , they ’ ll be able to exert this power not just over individual consumers , but over companies , as well . This could result in the much-discussed “ internet fast lane ” — in which an ISP forces a company like Twitter or BitTorrent to pay more for faster access for readers or users like you to its websites and services . Larger , more powerful companies likely won ’ t be hurt by this change . Smaller companies and websites almost definitely will be .
We already have a good idea of how these scenarios might play out , because in the era before net neutrality existed , ISPs tried instituting all of them : via jacked-up fees , forced redirection , content-blocking , software-blocking , website-blocking , competitor-blocking and still more competitor-blocking , app-blocking and still more app-blocking , data-capping , and censorship of controversial subjects .
If net neutrality advocates have made it seem like there ’ s simply no end to the worst-case scenarios that unregulated ISPs might subject us to , it ’ s because they ’ ve learned from experience . This history of ISP exploitation is a major reason that advocates for net neutrality fought so hard for it to begin with .
We also know that many ISPs , notably Comcast , already have their eyes on the aforementioned “ fast lane , ” also known as “ paid prioritization. ” ( Disclaimer : Comcast is an investor in ███ ’ s parent company , ███ Media , through its NBC-Universal arm . )
And lest you believe that the current FCC is prepared to make sure that such offenses are fully sanctioned and dealt with by the government , think again . FCC chair Pai is a vocal proponent of letting ISPs self-regulate , and seems perfectly content to ignore their contentious and often predatory history .
Not only that , but the FCC is explicitly preventing state consumer protection laws from taking effect regarding net neutrality . That means that once the repeal is final , the rights of states to govern themselves won ’ t apply to protecting net neutrality . ( Though California and Washington each vowed after the vote to try to protect it anyway . )
4 ) Who will be most affected by the repeal of net neutrality ?
Women , minorities , rural communities , and internet developers will feel the fullest effects of this repeal .
The general argument among net neutrality advocates is that without an open internet , members of society who have historically been marginalized and silenced will be in danger of being further marginalized and silenced , or marginalized and silenced once more — particularly women and minorities .
We ’ ve seen in the past that ISPs can and will censor access to controversial subjects . Without regulation , situations could arise in which underprivileged or disenfranchised individuals and groups have less access to speak up or contact others online .
One worst-case scenario that we haven ’ t yet seen in America , but which is worth considering given the current heated political climate , is that ISPs could potentially play a role in limiting or marginalizing certain communities during times of urgency — for instance , an ISP might choose to block a mobilizing hashtag like # BlackLivesMatter at the start of an organic protest .
This might seem like a dire prediction , but there ’ s precedent for it : In 2011 , the Egyptian government heavily censored certain websites during the Arab Spring . And in Turkey , under the administration of President Erdogan , the country has become notorious for censoring websites and blocking hashtags , at one point banning Twitter altogether .
Rural areas of the US — where internet access is already scarce due to a lack of ISPs operating there — will be further subjected to corporatization and monopolization of their internet infrastructure .
More than 10 million Americans already lack broadband access , and as the Hill notes in an overview of the potential impact of net neutrality ’ s repeal , “ Good broadband is a small town ’ s lifeline out of geographic isolation , its connection to business software and services , and its conduit for exporting homegrown ideas and products. ” Without regulatory inducements , corporate ISPs will have little incentive to develop infrastructure in such areas .
Another group that will be heavily impacted by net neutrality ’ s repeal — one that ’ s often overlooked but extremely crucial — is innovators and developers and people who create stuff for the internet . Tim Berners-Lee , creator of the internet as we know it , recently summed up the repeal ’ s potential effect on these developers :
If US net neutrality rules are repealed , future innovators will have to first negotiate with each ISP to get their new product onto an internet package . That means no more permissionless space for innovation . ISPs will have the power to decide which websites you can access and at what speed each will load . In other words , they ’ ll be able to decide which companies succeed online , which voices are heard — and which are silenced .
Again , this all sounds pretty dire — but that ’ s because it is . The people with the most expertise , the most investment in creating a progressive internet , and the strongest ability to advocate for an open internet could be prevented from doing their best work because of a lack of ability to pay for access to an ISP-controlled space .
It ’ s important to note , too , that because the nature of the repeal is unprecedented , we can ’ t necessarily predict every group and demographic that could potentially feel its impact .
5 ) Why did the FCC vote to repeal net neutrality when it had such overwhelming bipartisan support , and when the effects of a repeal seem so dire ?
Pretty much everybody supports net neutrality — it ’ s one of the few bipartisan issues that most of Congress and most American citizens agree on . The glaring exceptions are the giant ISPs who are reigned in by the regulation .
Over the last nine years , Verizon , Comcast , and AT & T have collectively spent over half a billion dollars lobbying the FCC to end regulatory oversight , and especially to block or repeal net neutrality . They found a loyal friend in Pai , who was appointed to the FCC in 2012 by then President Barack Obama , and named chairman by President Donald Trump shortly after Trump took office in January . Pai previously worked for Verizon and voted against the 2015 net neutrality ruling as a minority member of the FCC , calling it a “ massive intrusion in the internet economy . ”
So Pai has basically always supported the repeal of net neutrality , despite the overwhelming public support for it . He believes the 2015 ruling was frivolous and unnecessary , and has also argued , in opposition to hard evidence , that investment in the internet shrinks when net neutrality is in effect . With Trump ’ s full backing , he made undoing it a priority .
In fact , even though Pai is legally required to seriously consider the voice of the public when he makes decisions , he has made it clear that he never truly intended to consider most of the millions of comments submitted in support of net neutrality through the FCC ’ s website since it began the repeal process in May . That ’ s because the vast majority of those comments were duplicates that came through automated third-party advocacy websites . While many of them were likely submitted by spambots using fake or stolen identities and emails to file comments , many more of them were likely submitted by people using the tried-and-true method of sending a form letter to the government to express their opinions . Pai also rejected the form letters out of hand : Once the number of duplicate comments came to light , the FCC declared that it would be rejecting all duplicated comments as well as “ opinions ” that came without “ introducing new facts . ”
Essentially , even though nearly 99 percent of the unique comments that the FCC received were pro-net neutrality and anti-repeal , and even though the entire point of a democratic process is to allow people to express their opinions , the FCC chose to dismiss pretty much every opinion that was expressed , because spambots and auto-duplicated opinions were involved . FCC commissioner Rosenworcel , one of the commission ’ s two minority Democrats , acknowledged this during the December 14 vote to repeal , noting `` the cavalier disregard this agency has demonstrated to the public . ”
As Dell Cameron at Gizmodo put it , “ To be clear , when the FCC says that it is ‘ restoring internet freedom , ’ it is not talking about your freedom or the freedom of consumers . ”
A lot . Proponents of net neutrality have been busy at all levels of government trying to undo the FCC ’ s ruling . In March , Washington became the first state to protect net neutrality , by enacting a law that prohibits any ISP servicing the state to block or slow traffic . A month later , Oregon followed suit with a similar law . Two even tougher bills are currently being pushed through California and New York state legislature .
These laws , while feisty , aren ’ t foolproof : The FCC ’ s ruling includes a dictum that states aren ’ t allowed to self-regulate to protect net neutrality . Therefore , unless the FCC ’ s ruling itself is overturned , these laws stand in danger of being overturned in court .
The path Congress is taking is more direct but very thorny . The Congressional Repeal Act , under which Sen. Ed Markey ( D-MA ) petitioned to force a vote to overturn the FCC ruling , means proponents of net neutrality only need a simple majority . But despite overwhelming bipartisan public support , that ’ s not a given .
Markey ’ s resolution to overturn the FCC ruling was a success in the Senate , where supporters needed just 51 votes ; ultimately , it passed with 52 . From there , however , the vote shifted to the House , where it now needs 218 votes to pass , meaning Democrats voting in a bloc would need to muster up 25 more votes from Republicans . That ’ s unlikely to happen .
And even if the CRA motion to repeal the repeal actually manages to make it out of Congress onto the president ’ s desk , there ’ s every possibility that Trump , in what many perceive as an ongoing quest to destroy Obama ’ s legacy , will veto it .
That means that the best chance to reverse the FCC ’ s net neutrality repeal may lie in the court system .
Mere hours after the FCC vote in December , a flurry of lawsuits from tech companies , internet activists , the competitive carrier association INCOMPAS , and think tanks descended upon Washington . A multi-state appeal of the ruling was announced by the attorney general of the state of New York , Eric Schneiderman ( who recently resigned after multiple allegations of assault ) . The attorneys general of 22 other states joined the appeal by filing similar suits , which petitioned the US Court of Appeals for a review of the FCC ’ s order .
The collection of suits were filed as a consolidated suit in both D.C. and San Francisco , and were eventually punted to the U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals in D.C. following an appeal from the petitioners to have the location moved from San Francisco . That request might sound counterintuitive , given that San Francisco is the home of Silicon Valley — but judges serving D.C. have presided over previous cases involving net neutrality three times in the last decade , and are well-equipped to understand the complexities of the case . This is crucial given that the court could well be the determining factor in whether the repeal ultimately takes effect .
Technically , it already has . Some relatively minor parts of the FCC ’ s repeal took effect on April 23 , 2018 , including the reclassification of the internet as an information service rather than a utility . The ruling ’ s major consequences kicked in on June 11 , after some red tape was cleared up .
Meanwhile , now that the Senate has sent the joint resolution to the House , the House has until the end of the legislative session ( which concludes at the end of 2018 , when a new Congress will be sworn in ) to vote on the Senate ’ s resolution . Should the measure fail , it ’ s still probable that the absence of net neutrality won ’ t become immediately apparent . It ’ s possible , for example , that the D.C . Circuit Court of Appeals could order a stay of the ruling while motions against it are still being heard and appeals are being deliberated .
In a nutshell , we don ’ t know how long will it take to fight the repeal in the court system , so we can ’ t know when — or if — it will take effect . And it ’ s likely that even if a court overturns the FCC ’ s decision , that court may only overturn part of it and not the entire thing .
In the meantime , the FCC regulation has already taken effect — and net neutrality activists like Fight for the Future have predicted that encroaching moves by corporate ISPs will be gradual and insidious rather than sudden and overnight . That ’ s partly because the court situation is still a giant mess , so rolling out significant changes while the courts are still deciding the fate of the repeal could be disastrous .
And partly , it ’ s because corporations won ’ t want you to notice the difference . It ’ s easier to get the public to accept a gradual fee hike or change in the structure of your internet service over time than it would be to , for example , abruptly start charging you extra for access to your favorite websites . Gradual change will also give the ISPs time to ride out the public ’ s mistrust , perhaps by claiming that net neutrality went away and the world didn ’ t end .
But while that might be true at first , the reality is that in the long term , a net neutrality repeal makes the internet less democratic . What the final version of that repeal might look like , and when it might take effect , are both unknown at this point — with the future of an open internet hanging in the balance .
Update : This piece was originally written in December 2017 . It has been updated to include subsequent events surrounding the FCC ’ s net neutrality repeal .","Net neutrality still has a shot at survival, but its vital signs are weakening.

As of June 11, 2018, the FCC’s controversial repeal of the 2015 act that enshrined net neutrality into law has officially taken effect. That means net neutrality, currently, no longer exists.

Net neutrality requires internet service providers like Verizon and Comcast to distribute internet access fairly and equally to everyone, regardless of how much they pay or where they’re located. The incendiary FCC vote in December to repeal those requirements happened despite overwhelming public support for the regulation. The FCC instead had backing from a long list of Republican lawmakers, and FCC chair Ajit Pai was clearly determined to move ahead with the repeal amid a tense hearing that was briefly evacuated due to a security threat.

Since December, however, a groundswell of support has helped keep the conversation around net neutrality — and attempts to save it — alive. These efforts have included a successful move by the Senate to cancel the repeal using the Congressional Review Act, which lets Congress reverse — and, crucially, permanently block — any federal regulation with a simple majority vote. The Senate’s resolution, which passed 52-47, was concurrent with a storm of activism across the internet — this time with far more urgency than last year’s milquetoast protests.

From the Senate, however, the path to repeal gets considerably more complicated. The House is less likely to support the Senate’s resolution, and even if it makes it out of Congress onto President Trump’s desk, the president would most likely veto it.

The implications of the FCC’s repeal are vast and complicated. If congressional efforts to save net neutrality fail and the repeal is allowed to take effect, it will almost certainly fundamentally change how people access and use the internet. But there’s also still the ghost of a chance that the repeal might be overturned, not by Congress, but by the US Court of Appeals. All 22 states with a Democratic attorney general have signed onto a joint lawsuit against the FCC to revoke the rules, and this might be the best chance we have at enshrining net neutrality protection into the fabric of internet law.

Here’s what you need to know about what’s happened with net neutrality, and what could happen next.

1) What was the FCC actually voting on?

In December, the FCC voted on the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, which concerned the repeal of Title II protection for net neutrality.

Title II is a decades-old regulatory clause under which internet service providers (ISPs) have been ruled telecommunications companies and subject to the same regulations that other telecommunication companies — classified as utilities — must abide by. That basic regulatory standard is what people are referring to when they talk about net neutrality. Title II was first applied to ISPs in 2015, after a hard-won fight by internet activists.

Placing ISPs under Title II was the only legal way — barring the unlikely introduction and passage of Congressional legislation instituting complicated new regulatory procedures — in which these companies could be regulated.

The FCC’s repeal did institute one very thin piece of ISP regulation in place of net neutrality — a version of a 2010 transparency ruling that requires ISPs to inform consumers when the ISPs are deliberately slowing their internet speed. The FCC will be passing off the enforcement of this transparency stipulation to the FTC, in a long-planned and recently formalized agreement that will allow the two commissions “to work together to take targeted action against bad actors.” That phrasing, however, leaves open a wide playing field for major telecom companies. In other words, now that the FCC has repealed Title II classification for ISPs, the ISPs will essentially be unregulated.

2) Why does it matter if ISPs are regulated or not?

Classifying ISPs as utility companies under Title II meant they had to treat the internet like every other utility — that is, just like gas, water, or phone service — and that they couldn’t cut off service at will or control how much of it any one person received based on how much that person paid for it. The idea was that the internet should be a public service that everyone has a right to use, not a privilege, and that regulating ISPs like utilities would prevent them from hijacking or monopolize that access.

The best argument for the rollback of this Title II protection is that maybe the internet isn’t a public service — maybe it’s just another product, and in a free market system, competition over who gets to sell you that product would ensure accountability and fair treatment among providers, if only due to economic self-interest.

But there’s a huge problem with that argument, which is that, as far as the internet is concerned, there really isn’t a free and open market. In the United States, competition among ISPs was driven down years ago thanks to the consolidated nature of internet broadband infrastructure, which has typically been owned by major corporations, shutting out local ISP competitors.

That’s why many people don’t really have much choice about which company they pay for internet access — that access has been monopolized by a handful of powerful companies. In fact, nearly 50 million households have only one high-speed ISP in their area.

These particular utility companies, now unregulated, have free reign to behave like the corporate monopolies they are. Where net neutrality ensured the preservation of what’s been dubbed “the open internet,” its repeal will open the door for ISPs to create “an internet for the elite.”

3) What will happen to the internet without net neutrality protections in place?

Net neutrality mandated that ISPs display all websites, at the same speed, to all sources of internet traffic. Without net neutrality, all bets are off.

That means ISPs will be free to control what you access on the internet, meaning they will be able to block access to specific websites and pieces of software that interact with the internet.

They might charge you more or less money to access specific “bundles” of certain websites, much as cable television providers do now — but instead of “basic cable,” you might be forced to pay for access to more than a “basic” number of websites, as this popular pro-net neutrality graphic illustrates:

ISPs will also be able to control how quickly you’re served webpages, how quickly you can download and upload things, and in what contexts you can access which websites, depending on how much money you pay them.

They’ll be able to charge you more to access sites you currently visit for free, cap how much data you’re allowed to use, redirect you from sites you are trying to use to sites they want you to use instead, and block you from being able to access apps, products, and information offered by their competitors or other companies they don’t like.

They can even block you from being able to access information on certain topics, news events, or issues they don’t want you to know about.

Finally, they’ll be able to exert this power not just over individual consumers, but over companies, as well. This could result in the much-discussed “internet fast lane” — in which an ISP forces a company like Twitter or BitTorrent to pay more for faster access for readers or users like you to its websites and services. Larger, more powerful companies likely won’t be hurt by this change. Smaller companies and websites almost definitely will be.

We already have a good idea of how these scenarios might play out, because in the era before net neutrality existed, ISPs tried instituting all of them: via jacked-up fees, forced redirection, content-blocking, software-blocking, website-blocking, competitor-blocking and still more competitor-blocking, app-blocking and still more app-blocking, data-capping, and censorship of controversial subjects.

If net neutrality advocates have made it seem like there’s simply no end to the worst-case scenarios that unregulated ISPs might subject us to, it’s because they’ve learned from experience. This history of ISP exploitation is a major reason that advocates for net neutrality fought so hard for it to begin with.

We also know that many ISPs, notably Comcast, already have their eyes on the aforementioned “fast lane,” also known as “paid prioritization.” (Disclaimer: Comcast is an investor in Vox’s parent company, Vox Media, through its NBC-Universal arm.)

And lest you believe that the current FCC is prepared to make sure that such offenses are fully sanctioned and dealt with by the government, think again. FCC chair Pai is a vocal proponent of letting ISPs self-regulate, and seems perfectly content to ignore their contentious and often predatory history.

Not only that, but the FCC is explicitly preventing state consumer protection laws from taking effect regarding net neutrality. That means that once the repeal is final, the rights of states to govern themselves won’t apply to protecting net neutrality. (Though California and Washington each vowed after the vote to try to protect it anyway.)

4) Who will be most affected by the repeal of net neutrality?

Women, minorities, rural communities, and internet developers will feel the fullest effects of this repeal.

The general argument among net neutrality advocates is that without an open internet, members of society who have historically been marginalized and silenced will be in danger of being further marginalized and silenced, or marginalized and silenced once more — particularly women and minorities.

We’ve seen in the past that ISPs can and will censor access to controversial subjects. Without regulation, situations could arise in which underprivileged or disenfranchised individuals and groups have less access to speak up or contact others online.

One worst-case scenario that we haven’t yet seen in America, but which is worth considering given the current heated political climate, is that ISPs could potentially play a role in limiting or marginalizing certain communities during times of urgency — for instance, an ISP might choose to block a mobilizing hashtag like #BlackLivesMatter at the start of an organic protest.

This might seem like a dire prediction, but there’s precedent for it: In 2011, the Egyptian government heavily censored certain websites during the Arab Spring. And in Turkey, under the administration of President Erdogan, the country has become notorious for censoring websites and blocking hashtags, at one point banning Twitter altogether.

Rural areas of the US — where internet access is already scarce due to a lack of ISPs operating there — will be further subjected to corporatization and monopolization of their internet infrastructure.

More than 10 million Americans already lack broadband access, and as the Hill notes in an overview of the potential impact of net neutrality’s repeal, “Good broadband is a small town’s lifeline out of geographic isolation, its connection to business software and services, and its conduit for exporting homegrown ideas and products.” Without regulatory inducements, corporate ISPs will have little incentive to develop infrastructure in such areas.

Another group that will be heavily impacted by net neutrality’s repeal — one that’s often overlooked but extremely crucial — is innovators and developers and people who create stuff for the internet. Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the internet as we know it, recently summed up the repeal’s potential effect on these developers:

If US net neutrality rules are repealed, future innovators will have to first negotiate with each ISP to get their new product onto an internet package. That means no more permissionless space for innovation. ISPs will have the power to decide which websites you can access and at what speed each will load. In other words, they’ll be able to decide which companies succeed online, which voices are heard — and which are silenced.

Again, this all sounds pretty dire — but that’s because it is. The people with the most expertise, the most investment in creating a progressive internet, and the strongest ability to advocate for an open internet could be prevented from doing their best work because of a lack of ability to pay for access to an ISP-controlled space.

It’s important to note, too, that because the nature of the repeal is unprecedented, we can’t necessarily predict every group and demographic that could potentially feel its impact.

5) Why did the FCC vote to repeal net neutrality when it had such overwhelming bipartisan support, and when the effects of a repeal seem so dire?

Pretty much everybody supports net neutrality — it’s one of the few bipartisan issues that most of Congress and most American citizens agree on. The glaring exceptions are the giant ISPs who are reigned in by the regulation.

Over the last nine years, Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T have collectively spent over half a billion dollars lobbying the FCC to end regulatory oversight, and especially to block or repeal net neutrality. They found a loyal friend in Pai, who was appointed to the FCC in 2012 by then President Barack Obama, and named chairman by President Donald Trump shortly after Trump took office in January. Pai previously worked for Verizon and voted against the 2015 net neutrality ruling as a minority member of the FCC, calling it a “massive intrusion in the internet economy.”

So Pai has basically always supported the repeal of net neutrality, despite the overwhelming public support for it. He believes the 2015 ruling was frivolous and unnecessary, and has also argued, in opposition to hard evidence, that investment in the internet shrinks when net neutrality is in effect.

That’s because the vast majority of those comments were duplicates that came through automated third-party advocacy websites. While many of them were likely submitted by spambots using fake or stolen identities and emails to file comments, many more of them were likely submitted by people using the tried-and-true method of sending a form letter to the government to express their opinions. Pai also rejected the form letters out of hand: Once the number of duplicate comments came to light, the FCC declared that it would be rejecting all duplicated comments as well as “opinions” that came without “introducing new facts.”

Essentially, even though nearly 99 percent of the unique comments that the FCC received were pro-net neutrality and anti-repeal, and even though the entire point of a democratic process is to allow people to express their opinions, the FCC chose to dismiss pretty much every opinion that was expressed, because spambots and auto-duplicated opinions were involved. FCC commissioner Rosenworcel, one of the commission’s two minority Democrats, acknowledged this during the December 14 vote to repeal, noting ""the cavalier disregard this agency has demonstrated to the public.”

As Dell Cameron at Gizmodo put it, “To be clear, when the FCC says that it is ‘restoring internet freedom,’ it is not talking about your freedom or the freedom of consumers.”

6) What’s happened since the FCC voted to repeal?

A lot. Proponents of net neutrality have been busy at all levels of government trying to undo the FCC’s ruling. In March, Washington became the first state to protect net neutrality, by enacting a law that prohibits any ISP servicing the state to block or slow traffic. A month later, Oregon followed suit with a similar law. Two even tougher bills are currently being pushed through California and New York state legislature.

These laws, while feisty, aren’t foolproof: The FCC’s ruling includes a dictum that states aren’t allowed to self-regulate to protect net neutrality. Therefore, unless the FCC’s ruling itself is overturned, these laws stand in danger of being overturned in court.

The path Congress is taking is more direct but very thorny. The Congressional Repeal Act, under which Sen.

From there, however, the vote shifted to the House, where it now needs 218 votes to pass, meaning Democrats voting in a bloc would need to muster up 25 more votes from Republicans. That’s unlikely to happen.

And even if the CRA motion to repeal the repeal actually manages to make it out of Congress onto the president’s desk, there’s every possibility that Trump, in what many perceive as an ongoing quest to destroy Obama’s legacy, will veto it.

That means that the best chance to reverse the FCC’s net neutrality repeal may lie in the court system.

Mere hours after the FCC vote in December, a flurry of lawsuits from tech companies, internet activists, the competitive carrier association INCOMPAS, and think tanks descended upon Washington. A multi-state appeal of the ruling was announced by the attorney general of the state of New York, Eric Schneiderman (who recently resigned after multiple allegations of assault). The attorneys general of 22 other states joined the appeal by filing similar suits, which petitioned the US Court of Appeals for a review of the FCC’s order.

The collection of suits were filed as a consolidated suit in both D.C. and San Francisco, and were eventually punted to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in D.C. following an appeal from the petitioners to have the location moved from San Francisco. That request might sound counterintuitive, given that San Francisco is the home of Silicon Valley — but judges serving D.C. have presided over previous cases involving net neutrality three times in the last decade, and are well-equipped to understand the complexities of the case. This is crucial given that the court could well be the determining factor in whether the repeal ultimately takes effect.

7) When will the repeal go into effect?

Technically, it already has. Some relatively minor parts of the FCC’s repeal took effect on April 23, 2018, including the reclassification of the internet as an information service rather than a utility. The ruling’s major consequences kicked in on June 11, after some red tape was cleared up.

Meanwhile, now that the Senate has sent the joint resolution to the House, the House has until the end of the legislative session (which concludes at the end of 2018, when a new Congress will be sworn in) to vote on the Senate’s resolution. Should the measure fail, it’s still probable that the absence of net neutrality won’t become immediately apparent. It’s possible, for example, that the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals could order a stay of the ruling while motions against it are still being heard and appeals are being deliberated.

In a nutshell, we don’t know how long will it take to fight the repeal in the court system, so we can’t know when — or if — it will take effect. And it’s likely that even if a court overturns the FCC’s decision, that court may only overturn part of it and not the entire thing.

In the meantime, the FCC regulation has already taken effect — and net neutrality activists like Fight for the Future have predicted that encroaching moves by corporate ISPs will be gradual and insidious rather than sudden and overnight. That’s partly because the court situation is still a giant mess, so rolling out significant changes while the courts are still deciding the fate of the repeal could be disastrous.

And partly, it’s because corporations won’t want you to notice the difference. It’s easier to get the public to accept a gradual fee hike or change in the structure of your internet service over time than it would be to, for example, abruptly start charging you extra for access to your favorite websites. Gradual change will also give the ISPs time to ride out the public’s mistrust, perhaps by claiming that net neutrality went away and the world didn’t end.

But while that might be true at first, the reality is that in the long term, a net neutrality repeal makes the internet less democratic. What the final version of that repeal might look like, and when it might take effect, are both unknown at this point — with the future of an open internet hanging in the balance.

The rush to save net neutrality plan
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler is on the clock and scrambling to salvage his controversial net neutrality plan as the commission counts down to a crucial vote on Thursday .
According to FCC officials , he circulated his latest revisions Monday — trying to pick up the two votes he needs to pass the notice of proposed rule-making to ensure an open Internet .
In the most significant change , Wheeler will seek public comment on whether the FCC should reclassify broadband as a communications utility , giving the agency authority to regulate Internet rates and services as it does with telephone companies , according to commission officials . Net neutrality advocates favor that option as more robust , but it ’ s opposed by telecoms that fear it will give the government too much power over their business .
Wheeler ’ s original plan sparked outrage after details emerged that it would allow Internet-service providers , such as AT & T and Verizon , to charge companies like Netflix , Amazon and Google for faster delivery of content . The revised proposal keeps that basic approach but would seek comment on whether a “ fast lane ” should be banned . It also proposes a new ombudsman position at the FCC to act as a net neutrality advocate for startups and consumers .
“ He ’ s trying to address concerns from his fellow Democrats on the Hill and at the FCC , ” said Paul Gallant , managing director of Guggenheim Securities , a financial advisory firm . Democrats are concerned Wheeler is not asking enough questions about the proposal ’ s impact on consumers , he said .
Turmoil has engulfed the FCC chairman ’ s latest effort to write the rules . The agency ’ s previous attempt was thrown out by a court as legally flawed .
Aides to Wheeler ’ s fellow Democratic commissioners , Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel , declined to comment on the revisions . Wheeler will have to find support from the Democrats because the two Republican commissioners oppose any network neutrality rules .
Rosenworcel and Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai last week called for the vote to be delayed . The FCC also plans to seek comment on two other net neutrality proposals offered by Mozilla and Tim Wu , the Columbia University law professor credited with coining the term “ net neutrality . ”
Many lawmakers already have weighed in . A group of 11 senators — including Democrats Ron Wyden of Oregon , Chuck Schumer of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — urged Wheeler in a letter last week to drop the Internet fast lane approach .
“ Small businesses , content creators and Internet users must not be held hostage by an increasingly consolidated broadband industry , ” they wrote .
But looming over the debate is how Internet activists and tech giants will react moving forward . They have been here before : Major Internet players like Google and Wikipedia took part in the mass online protest against the Stop Online Piracy Act in early 2012 , a coordinated action that spurred lawmakers to drop SOPA and a similar bill in the Senate .
Wheeler ’ s proposal “ is trending in the right direction , from where it was before , but there ’ s still a lot more work to be done , ” said Michael Beckerman , president of the Internet Association , a trade group representing Google , Facebook , Amazon.com and other tech giants . He described Thursday as “ Day One , the beginning and not the end ” of the debate .
The FCC is already fielding a barrage of calls and comments regarding net neutrality , having received nearly 35,000 letters and emails . The agency has extended its comment period and its phones are ringing off the hook . The FCC ’ s main switchboard is playing a message urging those calling about the “ open Internet ” to email the agency , instead .
Free Press and other advocacy groups that favor strong net neutrality rules are organizing a rally on Thursday in front of FCC headquarters .
While the views of large companies have grabbed headlines when it comes to net neutrality , the issue has sparked concern from other sectors .
Libraries , which often provide free Internet access for low-income populations and already face tightening budgets , might be subject to higher costs under the new rules , said Larra Clark , director of the American Library Association ’ s network program .
“ We purchase and provide access to streaming media and online learning platforms , so if those costs for those services go up , that ’ s another cost that would have to be absorbed by libraries , ” Clark said .
The push for support will continue Wednesday as the commission prepares for a packed house at Thursday ’ s meeting . Meanwhile , the FCC announced that Gigi Sohn , Wheeler ’ s senior counsel for external affairs , will hold a Twitter chat Tuesday on net neutrality .","Turmoil has engulfed the FCC chairman’s latest effort to write the rules.

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler is on the clock and scrambling to salvage his controversial net neutrality plan as the commission counts down to a crucial vote on Thursday.

In the most significant change, Wheeler will seek public comment on whether the FCC should reclassify broadband as a communications utility, giving the agency authority to regulate Internet rates and services as it does with telephone companies, according to commission officials. Net neutrality advocates favor that option as more robust, but it’s opposed by telecoms that fear it will give the government too much power over their business.

Wheeler’s original plan sparked outrage after details emerged that it would allow Internet-service providers, such as AT&T and Verizon, to charge companies like Netflix, Amazon and Google for faster delivery of content. The revised proposal keeps that basic approach but would seek comment on whether a “fast lane” should be banned. It also proposes a new ombudsman position at the FCC to act as a net neutrality advocate for startups and consumers.

“He’s trying to address concerns from his fellow Democrats on the Hill and at the FCC,” said Paul Gallant, managing director of Guggenheim Securities, a financial advisory firm. Democrats are concerned Wheeler is not asking enough questions about the proposal’s impact on consumers, he said.

Turmoil has engulfed the FCC chairman’s latest effort to write the rules. The agency’s previous attempt was thrown out by a court as legally flawed.

Aides to Wheeler’s fellow Democratic commissioners, Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel, declined to comment on the revisions. Wheeler will have to find support from the Democrats because the two Republican commissioners oppose any network neutrality rules.

Rosenworcel and Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai last week called for the vote to be delayed. The FCC also plans to seek comment on two other net neutrality proposals offered by Mozilla and Tim Wu, the Columbia University law professor credited with coining the term “net neutrality.”

Many lawmakers already have weighed in. A group of 11 senators — including Democrats Ron Wyden of Oregon, Chuck Schumer of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — urged Wheeler in a letter last week to drop the Internet fast lane approach.

“Small businesses, content creators and Internet users must not be held hostage by an increasingly consolidated broadband industry,” they wrote.

But looming over the debate is how Internet activists and tech giants will react moving forward. They have been here before: Major Internet players like Google and Wikipedia took part in the mass online protest against the Stop Online Piracy Act in early 2012, a coordinated action that spurred lawmakers to drop SOPA and a similar bill in the Senate.

Wheeler’s proposal “is trending in the right direction, from where it was before, but there’s still a lot more work to be done,” said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, a trade group representing Google, Facebook, Amazon.com and other tech giants. He described Thursday as “Day One, the beginning and not the end” of the debate.

The FCC is already fielding a barrage of calls and comments regarding net neutrality, having received nearly 35,000 letters and emails. The agency has extended its comment period and its phones are ringing off the hook. The FCC’s main switchboard is playing a message urging those calling about the “open Internet” to email the agency, instead.

Free Press and other advocacy groups that favor strong net neutrality rules are organizing a rally on Thursday in front of FCC headquarters.

While the views of large companies have grabbed headlines when it comes to net neutrality, the issue has sparked concern from other sectors.

Libraries, which often provide free Internet access for low-income populations and already face tightening budgets, might be subject to higher costs under the new rules, said Larra Clark, director of the American Library Association’s network program.

“We purchase and provide access to streaming media and online learning platforms, so if those costs for those services go up, that’s another cost that would have to be absorbed by libraries,” Clark said.

The push for support will continue Wednesday as the commission prepares for a packed house at Thursday’s meeting. Meanwhile, the FCC announced that Gigi Sohn, Wheeler’s senior counsel for external affairs, will hold a Twitter chat Tuesday on net neutrality.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a rising star in the Democratic Party, and she’s got a huge edge over many of her colleagues: A savvy understanding of social media.

AOC, as she is known, is prolific, sending out dozens of tweets and retweets on Twitter each day, as well and posting on Facebook and Instagram. But on Sunday, she announced that she’s quitting Facebook and plans to cut back on all the others. “Social media poses a public health risk to everybody,” she said in a “Skullduggery” podcast. “I think it has effects on everybody — increased isolation, depression, anxiety, addiction, escapism.”

Now, I won’t say this often about AOC, but she’s absolutely right.

I don’t get much hate on social media, but all that changed Monday when the grand Notre Dame cathedral was burning in Paris. A friend sent me a picture of the inside of the stately medieval Catholic church, and — parroting what CNN was at the moment reporting — told me that everything inside was lost.

So I posted a tweet on Twitter: That same picture, with the words: “This is gone. Very sad.”

Turns out the picture was not of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, but of the Notre Dame Basilica in Montreal (to my friend I say, “no big”). I certainly never noticed, but then, I went to the Paris tourist trap just once 36 years ago, in 1983, and the other dozen times or so I’ve been to Paris I’ve skipped the site (I visited the Montreal basilica, too, but that was in the 1990s).

Well, you would have thought I murdered Mother Teresa with a machete in cold blood right on the street. The outpouring of anger flowed heavy. When I realized my post was wrong, I decided to leave it up anyway, just to watch (and catalogue) the vicious comments that came in. After all, it was a simple sentiment: It’s sad this beautiful place is gone (turns out CNN overstated that too, but that’s a different story).

By the numbers, my post has been retweeted more than 7,500 times and more than 24,000 people have pushed the little “heart” button. Some 1,100 people took time to comment. That’s by far my most “popular” post (I’m not a big Twitterer and have just under 10,000 followers).

So here now, in no particular order, are some of the things that were said:

Kevin M. Kruse, an author, was factual: “That cathedral is in Montreal and it’s still there.” Right you are, KK. My bad.

John Harwood, the economy and national politics for CNBC, wrote in response: “thank God they were able to save it.” Very funny, John.

“Curtis Stigers,” whose Twitter page says he is the Emmy nominated writer/singer of the “Sons Of Anarchy” theme, said: “You’re a stable genius, Joe.”

“Madbreaks” wrote, “Gone, along with your credibility.” Darn it! I worked 30 years as a journalist and I threw it all away by posting a picture of the wrong Notre Dame. D’oh!

There were some really funny ones, the kind that singed but didn’t burn. Pictures of the castle at Disney World (or Disneyland) appeared often, ID’ed as Notre Dame. Ha. Someone posted a picture of the Eiffel Tower — the one in Las Vegas. Good one. Someone posted my caption — “This is gone. Very sad.” — with a shot of an old Blockbuster movie rental store. Another used the caption with a shot of an old Underwood typewriter. Pretty funny.

Some people were a little mad, some people were big mad. Of course, a bunch of the responses were too graphic to post in this family newspaper. The emails, too. But “Dan Mitchell” emailed to say: “How do you just leave that Montreal cathedral tweet up, saying it’s ‘gone’? Unlike other falsehoods, it doesn’t seem to serve any propaganda purpose, and seems like just (yet another) boneheaded mistake. I know you people have very little capacity for either shame or pride (or basic competence), but do you actually have *zero*? How are you not humiliated?”

It was a “boneheaded mistake,” Dan, but again, I left it up to allow the flow of hate to stream in, to see where this one tiny error in a tweet with a sweet sentiment would go.

Others deemed my erroneous tweet as shoddy “journalism.” “Lulu in Canada” wrote: “‏Nothing is gone, but also we’re all safe here in Montreal! Super ‘journalism.’ ” “C. Sabetta” wrote: “It is good to see you did an in-depth investigation and corroborated information before sharing. Top notch reporting……NOT.” “Tim of Ottawa,” who called me “dude,” said, “you’re NO sort of journalist at all.”

For the record, Twitter ain’t journalism.

Everyone seemed super-concerned about me deleting the tweet, as if my leaving it up meant that hundreds, possibly thousands, of false reports might follow declaring that Montreal’s Notre Dame had burned to the ground. “Frank Thorp V,” whose Twitter page says he’s “Producer & Off-Air Reporter covering Congress at @NBCNews,” wrote: “How long are you gonna keep this tweet up?” Later, clearly very concerned about the adverse effect my tweet was having worldwide, wrote: “Are you going to delete your incorrect tweet?”

To all of you who commented, you’ll be relieved to know that I have now deleted the tweet.

To be clear, I did get something wrong. And I’ve been doing this a long time, so I’ve got a plenty thick skin. You had a good laugh at my expense. But it was a small error — the interior of one Notre Dame instead of the other — and my sentiment was simply expressing remorse that something so beautiful might be lost.

But I’d like to give a shout out to “Cameron Campbell,” who wrote, “I feel so sorry for you.” Well, thanks CC. Yeah, it was, I’ll admit, a little embarrassing. And to the guy who tweeted, “That’s Quebec, NOT Paris,” dude, it’s cool. Little mistake. It’ll pass. No big, brother.

This data was then given to Cambridge Analytica , a firm that was working for Donald J. Trump ’ s 2016 presidential campaign . The app not only gave GSR the data of the user who filled out the survey , but also that of all of the user ’ s friends without them knowing it . Some have noted a similar mining tool used by the Obama team , but they gathered information through their website ( with permission from those who engaged ) and the armies of volunteers , which was then matched with voter profiles . At the same time , these users also gave permission to have their friends data siphoned ; their friends gave no such consent . Yes , still a bit creepy , especially since the campaign boasted that they probably knew every single one of the 67+ million voters who supported President Obama in 2012 .
Last night , footage was released of Cambridge Analytica ’ s top executives pitching dirty political tricks , like video of a candidate accepting a bribe , girls around the candidate ’ s house , and even good ole ’ misinformation . The firm has denied ever using any of the tactics discussed and this isn ’ t necessarily earth-shattering news in the skulky world of nail biter campaigns , but it adds to the bad optics that both Facebook and Cambridge have reaped since Christopher Wylie , the brainchild of the firm , came forward to spill the inner workings of this company . Facebook certainly knew that something was up concerning user data given the sheer volume GSR was mining from the app MyPersonality . But we ’ re not going to discuss Cambridge . We ’ re discussing what many of you have noted on various social media platforms about the inherent left wing bias ingrained in the services . Well , one former data officer for the Obama campaign , Carol Davidsen , admitted that Facebook allowed them to break the rules because they were on their side .
First , she tweeted a Time magazine piece showing what the 2012 campaign did to gather information :
In the final weeks before Election Day , a scary statistic emerged from the databases at Barack Obama ’ s Chicago headquarters : half the campaign ’ s targeted swing-state voters under age 29 had no listed phone number . They lived in the cellular shadows , effectively immune to traditional get-out-the-vote efforts . For a campaign dependent on a big youth turnout , this could have been a crisis . But the Obama team had a solution in place : a Facebook application that will transform the way campaigns are conducted in the future . For supporters , the app appeared to be just another way to digitally connect to the campaign . But to the Windy City number crunchers , it was a game changer . “ I think this will wind up being the most groundbreaking piece of technology developed for this campaign , ” says Teddy Goff , the Obama campaign ’ s digital director . That ’ s because the more than 1 million Obama backers who signed up for the app gave the campaign permission to look at their Facebook friend lists . In an instant , the campaign had a way to see the hidden young voters . Roughly 85 % of those without a listed phone number could be found in the uploaded friend lists . What ’ s more , Facebook offered an ideal way to reach them . “ People don ’ t trust campaigns . They don ’ t even trust media organizations , ” says Goff . “ Who do they trust ? Their friends . ”
Davidsen then detailed on Twitter how representatives from the social media company were surprised how much data they mined , adding that they were “ very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn ’ t have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side . ”

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — President Donald Trump is gathering conservative groups at the White House this week for a “ summit ” on social media that will prominently snub the tech titans who run big platforms on Facebook , Twitter and Google .
It ’ s a sharp contrast to earlier days in Trump ’ s tenure when tech executives were occasional celebrity guests at the White House , serving as a fresh indication of the president ’ s escalating battle with Big Tech .
Now , Trump regularly accuses the big social media platforms of suppressing conservative voices . He has suggested the companies may be acting illegally and should be sued by U.S. regulators .
White House spokesman Judd Deere said the White House conference on Thursday would bring together “ digital leaders for a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today ’ s online environment . ”
But Google , Facebook and Twitter weren ’ t invited , their representatives confirmed . And their leaders may be more likely to turn up Thursday at an annual media industry conference in Sun Valley , Idaho , a venue oriented more toward high-stakes deal-making than reflections on perceived bias in online communications .
The White House had no comment on why top tech officials weren ’ t invited or on whether the conference was deliberately scheduled to overlap with the meeting in Idaho .
Among the conservative organizations that are expected to participate in the White House meeting : Turning Point USA ; PragerU , short for Prager University , which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics or economics ; and the Washington think tank Heritage Foundation .
Trump and some supporters have long accused Silicon Valley companies of being biased against them . Accusations commonly leveled against the platforms include anti-religious bias , a tilt against those opposed to abortion and censorship of conservative political views . While some company executives may lean liberal , they have long asserted that their products are without political bias .
Representatives for Facebook , Google and Twitter declined to comment specifically on Thursday ’ s meeting . But the Internet Association , the industry ’ s major trade group representing Facebook , Google and dozens of other companies , said the internet “ offers the most open and accessible form of communication available today . ”
Its members ’ platforms “ don ’ t have a political ideology or political bias , ” the group ’ s president and CEO Michael Beckerman said in a statement . He added that the companies “ succeed and grow by building a broad user base regardless of party affiliation or political perspectives . ”
Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough , in a statement , said “ We enforce the Twitter rules impartially for all users , regardless of their background or political affiliation . We are constantly working to improve our systems and will continue to be transparent in our efforts . ”
The White House conference offers Trump a chance to play to his conservative base in the lead-up to the 2020 election .
Trump has played to conservative concerns about bias on other issues . In March , he signed an executive order requiring U.S. colleges to protect free speech on their campuses or risk losing federal research funding . The order cheered those who said universities were attempting to silence some conservative students and speakers . But critics called the order unnecessary .
The president himself was dealt a setback Tuesday in his legal battle against Twitter , his favored means of communicating . A federal appeals court in New York City ruled that the president can ’ t ban critics from his Twitter account , saying the First Amendment calls for more speech , rather than less , on matters of public concern .
Trump has an estimated 61 million followers on Twitter . He has accused Twitter of making it “ very hard for people to join me ” and “ very much harder for me to get out the message . ”
Thursday ’ s conference raised questions about whether Trump would use the forum to signal tough actions ahead by his administration against the big companies in the areas of competition and privacy .
Big tech companies already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals including Facebook ’ s lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump ’ s 2016 campaign .

Trump told Fox Business Network ’ s Maria Bartiromo last month that he doesn ’ t know if what the companies are doing is illegal but added , “ I tell you what , they should be sued because of what ’ s happening with the bias . ”","President Donald Trump meets with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, July 9, 2019, in Washington.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is gathering conservative groups at the White House this week for a “summit” on social media that will prominently snub the tech titans who run big platforms on Facebook, Twitter and Google.

It’s a sharp contrast to earlier days in Trump’s tenure when tech executives were occasional celebrity guests at the White House, serving as a fresh indication of the president’s escalating battle with Big Tech.

Now, Trump regularly accuses the big social media platforms of suppressing conservative voices. He has suggested the companies may be acting illegally and should be sued by U.S. regulators.

White House spokesman Judd Deere said the White House conference on Thursday would bring together “digital leaders for a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today’s online environment.”

But Google, Facebook and Twitter weren’t invited, their representatives confirmed. And their leaders may be more likely to turn up Thursday at an annual media industry conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, a venue oriented more toward high-stakes deal-making than reflections on perceived bias in online communications.

The White House had no comment on why top tech officials weren’t invited or on whether the conference was deliberately scheduled to overlap with the meeting in Idaho.

Among the conservative organizations that are expected to participate in the White House meeting: Turning Point USA; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics or economics; and the Washington think tank Heritage Foundation.

Trump and some supporters have long accused Silicon Valley companies of being biased against them. Accusations commonly leveled against the platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against those opposed to abortion and censorship of conservative political views. While some company executives may lean liberal, they have long asserted that their products are without political bias.

Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment specifically on Thursday’s meeting. But the Internet Association, the industry’s major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said the internet “offers the most open and accessible form of communication available today.”

Its members’ platforms “don’t have a political ideology or political bias,” the group’s president and CEO Michael Beckerman said in a statement. He added that the companies “succeed and grow by building a broad user base regardless of party affiliation or political perspectives.”

Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough, in a statement, said “We enforce the Twitter rules impartially for all users, regardless of their background or political affiliation. We are constantly working to improve our systems and will continue to be transparent in our efforts.”

The White House conference offers Trump a chance to play to his conservative base in the lead-up to the 2020 election.

Trump has played to conservative concerns about bias on other issues. In March, he signed an executive order requiring U.S. colleges to protect free speech on their campuses or risk losing federal research funding. The order cheered those who said universities were attempting to silence some conservative students and speakers. But critics called the order unnecessary.

The president himself was dealt a setback Tuesday in his legal battle against Twitter, his favored means of communicating. A federal appeals court in New York City ruled that the president can’t ban critics from his Twitter account, saying the First Amendment calls for more speech, rather than less, on matters of public concern.

Trump has an estimated 61 million followers on Twitter. He has accused Twitter of making it “very hard for people to join me” and “very much harder for me to get out the message.”

Thursday’s conference raised questions about whether Trump would use the forum to signal tough actions ahead by his administration against the big companies in the areas of competition and privacy.

Big tech companies already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals including Facebook’s lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump’s 2016 campaign. A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. The House Judiciary Committee has opened a bipartisan probe of the tech giants’ market dominance.

A growing number of lawmakers and some Democratic presidential candidates are talking about tighter regulation of a customarily freewheeling industry or even breaking up the big companies.

But if Trump is looking for the participating conservative groups to support government action to bring the companies in line on perceived social media bias, he may be disappointed.

Rob Bluey, vice president for communications at the Heritage Foundation, said that “if the government were to get involved, it would lead to more problems.” He said market pressures can produce positive changes.

Turning Point USA keeps a list of college professors who it says discriminate against students with conservative views. “I think there will be some form of equilibrium” between the social media platforms and Americans who hold right-of-center views, Charlie Kirk, the group’s executive director, said Tuesday. “Hopefully these companies can self-correct.”

Trump told Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo last month that he doesn’t know if what the companies are doing is illegal but added, “I tell you what, they should be sued because of what’s happening with the bias.”

Remember net neutrality?

Right, it's that brain-flexing term that refers to the idea that phone and cable companies should treat all of the traffic on their networks equally. No blocking or slowing their competitors, and no fast lanes for companies that can pay more.

In fact, the term itself was so nerdy that it's been ""re-branded"" as Open Internet.

You might have thought things were kind of settled with net neutrality after the Federal Communications Commission passed hotly debated rules in February that redefined its authority over Internet service providers.

But the new regulations could be undone: The cable and telecom industries have taken the FCC to court.

It's the third time in less than a decade that the FCC's attempts to regulate Internet access have been challenged in court. Three judges at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals will decide whether the rules get to stay. Here are a few things to know about the lawsuit:

1. The key question the court will answer is whether the FCC had proper authority to reclassify broadband Internet as a more heavily regulated telecommunications service.

This wonky reclassification approach has been the biggest point of contention in the FCC's latest take on net neutrality.

This court, early last year, threw out the FCC's earlier rules because it ruled they were effectively treating ISPs as if they were providing ""telecommunications services,"" sort of like traditional telephone companies, even though the FCC itself had classified them in the more lightly regulated category of ""information service providers.""

So this time around, the FCC (with President Obama's weigh-in) decided to reclassify broadband Internet access under what's known as Title II of the Telecommunications Act — considering it like an essential public utility, like landline telephone service in the past century.

Various Internet and venture companies and public interest groups are supporting the FCC in the case, which is brought by cable, wireless and broadband industry associations alongside AT&T, CenturyLink and several smaller providers.

2. Reclassification is at the heart of the industry's legal challenge.

The ISPs say they don't oppose the specific net neutrality rules — no blocking or slowing down of websites and no payments for prioritized delivery of any traffic — but present the new regulatory regime as ""arbitrary and capricious,"" illegal, overbearing and arcane.

One big fear is that the government would at some point decide to dictate prices. But the FCC has said it will ""forebear from"" this part of Title II.

3. Another part of the new rules the court will consider will be whether mobile Internet and cable Internet should be regulated the same way.

Wireless broadband in the past enjoyed some exemptions from net neutrality rules (including some anti-discrimination and no-blocking rules) to prevent congestion on their networks. The new rules regulate them much the same as their wireline rivals.

Internet content companies say that equality was long overdue, while the wireless industry argues that the FCC didn't follow proper procedure to adopt those rules and that the rules themselves threaten the industry's growth and innovation.

4. Not much has changed since the rules went into effect in June.

Telecom lawyers say that's because net neutrality principles were already being followed and nobody in the industry planned to violate them. Also, Netflix — a major factor in how people perceive the quality of their Internet download speeds — has settled its negotiations with several major ISPs to make sure its streaming goes smoothly.

But what about the telecom companies' worries about innovation and investment?

One critic of the rules has suggested a link between the industry's lower capital expenditures and the FCC's new rules, though his findings have been disputed by net neutrality supporters. Economists at a House hearing on the topic said it may be just too early to see any real evidence of any effect the rules may be having.

When FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler was asked about T-Mobile's new unlimited-streaming offer that doesn't count participating video services against data allowances, Wheeler praised it as innovative and competitive. But he also said he'd ""continue to watch"" how it complies with the new rules. An AT&T executive later said such mixed messages have forced the company to shelve some of its creative ideas.

The FCC has received complaints through its new net neutrality consumer portal, but my previous Freedom of Information requests showed that they tend to get settled without the FCC's involvement. And the FCC hasn't said that it has found any violations.

5. Whatever this court decides, net neutrality will likely end up at the Supreme Court.

Friday's oral arguments are scheduled to last more than two hours, and then the D.C. Circuit Court is expected to rule sometime in the spring.

If the ISPs lose, they're likely to take their case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

If the FCC loses, the agency may do the same depending on the scope of its loss — if it loses on the margins, the commission could consider going back and tweaking the rules, but a bigger loss might lead to the high court.

Regarding Warren ’ s proposal , “ Jeff Bezos didn ’ t come up with the idea of owning a marketplace and using it to sell your own stuff at an unfair advantage against rivals . Reading Railroad , for example , became the largest company in the world by owning the rails that carried anthracite coal , as well as the coal mines along the route . Rival coal producers that wanted to use the lines got less favorable rates , fell behind , and got swallowed up by Reading Railroad . Congress put a stop to it in 1906 by adopting the Hepburn Act , which prevented the railroads from carrying products that they owned ... Warren ’ s central proposal — to structurally separate business lines in an effort to eliminate anti-competitive conduct and foster competition — has a century-old pedigree . ”
Some caution that “ the problem with applying a one-size-fits-four model to tech… is that the large tech companies have different business models that pose different anti-competitive risks . The stranglehold that Google and Facebook have on the digital advertising market is different from the way Amazon muscles out e-commerce brands , which is different from the way Apple uses its App Store to force burdensome terms on developers…
“ The possibility of unintended consequences means that tailoring regulations to address each of these problems is important . A law that banned Amazon from competing with third-party sellers on its platform could also cripple Chromebook laptops , or prevent iPhone users from getting access to their iTunes libraries . Rather than one giant package that crams everything together , a set of effective tech regulations would treat each problem [ discreetly ] , and address each with surgical precision . ”
“ Trump ’ s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial . But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence : it ’ s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed — such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed . Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time . They will also say that there ’ s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here . But… ‘ even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly , the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis . Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange. ’ … ‍ “ In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid , the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation . There is enough here to support impeachment . Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter . ”","From the Left

Reading Railroad, for example, became the largest company in the world by owning the rails that carried anthracite coal, as well as the coal mines along the route. Rival coal producers that wanted to use the lines got less favorable rates, fell behind, and got swallowed up by Reading Railroad. Congress put a stop to it in 1906 by adopting the Hepburn Act, which prevented the railroads from carrying products that they owned... Warren’s central proposal — to structurally separate business lines in an effort to eliminate anti-competitive conduct and foster competition — has a century-old pedigree.”

Some caution that “the problem with applying a one-size-fits-four model to tech… is that the large tech companies have different business models that pose different anti-competitive risks. The stranglehold that Google and Facebook have on the digital advertising market is different from the way Amazon muscles out e-commerce brands, which is different from the way Apple uses its App Store to force burdensome terms on developers…



“The possibility of unintended consequences means that tailoring regulations to address each of these problems is important. A law that banned Amazon from competing with third-party sellers on its platform could also cripple Chromebook laptops, or prevent iPhone users from getting access to their iTunes libraries. Rather than one giant package that crams everything together, a set of effective tech regulations would treat each problem [discreetly], and address each with surgical precision.”

“Trump’s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial. But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence: it’s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed — such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed. Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time. They will also say that there’s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here. But… ‘even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly, the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis. Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange.’… ‍ “In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid, the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation. There is enough here to support impeachment. Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter.”

In January 2020 , Facebook executives began paying attention to a new coronavirus spreading across the globe . The virus was deadly and highly contagious , and when the World Health Organization shared guidance about it , the company ’ s leadership dropped their typically hands-off approach to misinformation .
“ We decided we would remove content that directly contradicted [ the WHO ] and could contribute to risk of imminent physical harm , ” Monika Bickert , Facebook ’ s head of global policy management , told ███ . Say “ social distancing doesn ’ t work ” or “ wearing a mask can make you sick ” on Facebook , and the company will direct its moderators to remove your post . A move of this scale is unprecedented for a company that has sought to keep itself out of battles over the truth , but Facebook has removed hundreds of thousands of posts violating this policy already , according to Bickert , and reduced distribution on tens of millions of others .
Though Facebook has removed some health-related misinformation in the past , the company ’ s decision , although enforced spottily , to side with science has thrust it into new ground . Removing coronavirus misinformation could make its largely hands-off approach to other harm-causing misinformation — such as on climate denialism and anti-vaccine advocacy — harder to defend . It will also place Facebook squarely in the middle of a political battle in the US , where the not widely shared opposition to social distancing and masks break along party lines . “ I do n't know how they 're going to reconcile being an open marketplace of political ideas , while at the same time not cracking down on certain political voices that are taking fringe anti-science beliefs and trying to bring them into the mainstream , ” Andy Carvin , a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council 's Digital Forensic Research Lab , which takes funding from Facebook , told ███ . “ It feels like a collision is inevitable. ” Bickert acknowledged her company ’ s tough position . “ None of this is easy , ” she said . “ There are always difficult factors to balance in writing and applying content rules . ”
Is Saving Lives Time-Bound ? Although Facebook has removed misinformation on measles in Samoa , and polio in Pakistan , a deletion campaign of this scale is unprecedented , and as the pandemic continues it could be the first of many . Anti-vaxxers are spreading misinformation in anticipation of a vaccine for the coronavirus if one were to be developed — with some declaring that it would be made mandatory — and their Facebook pages and Instagram profiles are booming . Facebook won ’ t take down these inaccurate posts , even if they could cause deaths in the future , because the company ’ s standard for removal requires “ imminent harm. ” In the meantime , anti-vax pages and profiles are adding hundreds of thousands of engagements each month . A former Facebook policy employee told ███ that the company ’ s aggressive enforcement of WHO rules did n't square with its hands-off stance on anti-vaccine misinformation . “ Where I think the platforms are gon na be in a real shit position , ” the ex-employee said , “ is when we 're closer to a vaccine for coronavirus , all of the anti-vax groups that have taken the last month , and will continue to take the next few months , to build their followings , get donations , make sure that they 're right in front of people — they ’ re going to convince folks not to take the vaccine. ” Bickert defended applying the policy to the coronavirus but not vaccines by saying , `` There 's something about speech where the risk is immediate , where there is not necessarily going to be time for debate , that makes that speech especially important for us to address . '' That ’ s not to say there isn ’ t lively ongoing debate about vaccine misinformation policy inside Facebook . Lower-level employees debate policy issues , the ex-employee said , but the company ’ s decisions on politically explosive topics like anti-vax content remain at the top . “ The anti-vaxxer lobby is very well connected , very loud , so it 's a small group of people who are running things , but they know how to use the internet , ” the ex-Facebook policy employee said . “ [ Facebook leadership ] just does n't want the headache . I also think there are people who are somewhat sympathetic to parents saying that they want to make choices for their children. ” Though Facebook added some information about vaccines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after political pressure during a measles outbreak in 2019 , it ’ s largely allowed anti-vaccine misinformation to stay up , and for groups promoting such materials to remain active . Facebook also banned ads with vaccine misinformation , a ban it hasn ’ t enforced very effectively . Asked if Facebook would take a more restrictive approach about COVID vaccine misinformation , Bickert allowed for the possibility , but not yet . “ The situation is obviously dynamic , ” she said . “ We 're going to have to wait and see how it develops and what the state of treatment is , and when there are treatments what the risks are associated with those treatments and so forth , it 's complicated territory. ” That position may inspire scrutiny from critics who would prefer the company to act more consistently — and aggressively . “ They should follow through with what they say they 're going to do , ” Judd Legum , the author of the Popular Information newsletter , told ███ . “ If there 's a page with hundreds of thousands of people following it , and the whole purpose of the page is to talk about how it 's a government conspiracy , and hospitals are intentionally killing patients to drum up support for a mandatory vaccine , and this drug has a 99 % effective rate against coronaviruses , they should probably be more aggressive about taking that type of content down. ” And there are forms of misinformation that could be even more damaging than content about the coronavirus or vaccines . “ Climate change is actually an even bigger emergency than COVID , though society has n't yet fully appreciated this — partly due to climate misinformation , ” climate scientist Peter Kalmus told ███ . He worried that the new policy was too narrowly targeted on immediate harm .
`` Facebook should apply similar standards to climate misinformation as to COVID . ''
“ Climate breakdown threatens our food , water , infrastructure , health , economic , and geopolitical systems , has the potential to cause death and suffering on a massive scale , and will likely be effectively permanent , ” Kalmus said . “ So in my opinion , Facebook should apply similar standards to climate misinformation as it does to COVID misinformation . ”
Facebook doesn ’ t appear ready to take action with regard to climate crisis denial — making what appears to some outside observers an indefensible distinction between the imminent and the merely inevitable . Asked if the company would apply the same standard it did to the coronavirus to areas like climate change , Bickert demurred , saying , “ All of our policies evolve over time and we 're learning a lot through the way we 're seeing people respond to what we 're doing. ” Fighting the Science
When Facebook sided with the WHO ’ s guidelines for the coronavirus — and hence , science — it was fairly uncontroversial politically . All 50 US states put stay-at-home orders in place , and social distancing was the norm .

Many of these protests have added event pages on Facebook . The company has removed some for challenging their state ’ s stay-at-home orders , a decision that some lawmakers have disagreed with . “ You have to hear both sides of the debate , ” Danny McCormick , a Republican Louisiana state representative , told ███ . “ If you just censor one side of the debate because you think the other is the side you agree with , you 're not increasing education , you 're stymieing education. ” Rep.

The UK faces a ""democratic crisis"" with voters being targeted with ""pernicious views"" and data being manipulated, a parliamentary committee is set to warn.

The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee has been investigating disinformation and fake news following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.

In its first report, MPs will suggest social media companies should face tougher regulation or a new tax.

It also proposes measures to combat election interference.

The MPs' report comes after months of investigating the impact of technology giants and how people are affected by the rise in fake news on social media.

It also probed whether Russia had a role in influencing voters in the EU referendum.

The committee's report was due to be officially published on Sunday.

But a copy was leaked on Friday by Dominic Cummings, the director of the official Brexit campaign group Vote Leave, who published it on his own blog.

Mr Cummings was asked and officially summoned to take part in the inquiry - to respond to allegations made against the Vote Leave campaign - but he refused. Mr Cummings called the report ""fake news"".

According to the leaked report, MPs say ""our democracy is at risk and now is the time to act"".

The committee highlights the ""relentless targeting of hyper-partisan views, which play to the fears and prejudices of people, in order to influence their voting plans"".

The report is expected to be very critical of Facebook, which has been under increased scrutiny following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.

""Facebook has hampered our efforts to get information about their company throughout this inquiry. It is as if it thinks that the problem will go away if it does not share information about the problem, and reacts only when it is pressed,"" it will say.

""It provided witnesses who have been unwilling or unable to give full answers to the committee's questions.""

It will repeat its call for Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence.

The committee's report will also say it had received ""disturbing evidence"" - some of which it had not published - of hacking, disinformation and voter suppression in elections since 2010.

""We urge the government to ensure that the National Crime Agency thoroughly investigates these allegations.""

What will the committee recommend?

Social media sites should be held responsible for 'harmful' content on their services

Companies such as Facebook and YouTube have repeatedly said they are just a ""platform"", rather than a ""publisher"". They have argued that they are not responsible for the content people post on their services.

The committee's report is expected to say social media companies ""cannot hide behind"" this claim.

A ""new category of tech company"" which is something in between a platform or publisher should be created, the committee will suggest. This should establish ""clear legal liability for the tech companies to act against harmful and illegal content on their platforms"".

The rules on political campaigns should be made fit for the digital age

The committee will say that electoral law needs to be ""updated to reflect changes in campaigning techniques"".

Image copyright Facebook Image caption Vote Leave's Facebook advertisements have been released

It will suggest:

creating a public register for political advertising so that anybody can see what messages are being distributed

online political advertisements should have a digital imprint stating who was responsible, as is required with printed leaflets and advertisements

social media sites should be held responsible for interference in elections by malicious actors

electoral fraud fines should be increased from a maximum of £20,000 to a percentage of an organisations' annual turnover

Social network security should be audited

The report will suggest that an independent body such as the Competition and Markets Authority should audit the social networks.

It will say that security mechanisms and algorithms used by social networks should be available for audit by a government regulator, to ensure they are ""operating responsibly"".

The committee will also warn that fake accounts on sites such as Facebook and Twitter ""not only damage the user experience, but potentially defraud advertisers"" who could be paying to advertise to accounts not run by real people.

Tech companies should be taxed to fund education and regulation

Tighter regulation of social media sites would mean more work for organisations such as the Electoral Commission and Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).

The committee will suggest a tax on tech companies. Some of the money should fund the extra responsibilities of the regulators.

The rest of the money should be spent on digital education in schools and a public awareness campaign, to help people identify disinformation and fake news.

""Digital literacy should be the fourth pillar of education, alongside reading, writing and maths,"" the report will say.

The report will also summarise the evidence collected during the committee's inquiry, which was launched in September last year.

Whistleblower Christopher Wylie and Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix were among the 61 witnesses that gave evidence.

Tom Baldwin, who has written a book on the relationship between politics and media, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the report's recommendations did not go far enough.

""The social media ads that were seen used by Donald Trump and the Leave campaign are the most lethal political weapons ever invented,"" Mr Baldwin said.

Will Moy, the head of fact checking charity Full Fact, told the BBC that the same conversation about fake news is going on around the world - and the reaction of some governments had been ""quite scary"".

He said MPs should acknowledge that it is important to also ""stand proudly on being an open society and valuing free speech"".

Meanwhile, Jamie Bartlett, the head of think tank Demos, said the report is about the ""long-term integrity of elections"" so people ""trust they are getting accurate information"".

He said he fears the Brexit debate could distract the focus of the issue.

""So those who are pro-Brexit will dismiss a lot of it, those who are anti-Brexit will say 'this is why we should have another referendum, and then we miss what is essentially far more important: The long-term health of democracy.""

The committee's final report is expected before the end of the year.

technology,Media Matters,0,http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/03/18/could-twitter-have-stopped-the-medias-rush-to-w/193074,Could Twitter Have Stopped The Media's Rush To War In Iraq?,2013-03-18,,"Responding to a barrage of criticism he received for a factually inaccurate and flawed column he wrote this month about the sequestration battle , New York Times columnist Bill Keller wrote a follow-up blog post to detail how critics had hounded him online , especially via Twitter .
Denouncing the social media tool 's tendency to produce what he called mean and shallow commentary , Keller lamented Twitter 's suddenly pervasive power . “ It is always on , and it gets inside your head , ” he wrote , adding , “ there is no escape. ” Indeed , within days of writing his column , Keller felt compelled to pen a lengthy piece about his Twitter encounter .
The columnist painted an unpleasant picture of being hounded and “ bull [ ied ] ” on Twitter for merely expressing “ an unpopular view. ” But as the tenth anniversary of the United States-led invasion of Iraq approaches , I could n't help thinking back to when columnists like Keller , and newspapers like the New York Times , where Keller became executive editor in July 2003 , helped cheer the nation to war . To date , that conflict has claimed the lives of nearly 8,000 U.S. service members and contractors and more than 130,000 Iraqi citizens , and is projected to cost the U.S. Treasury more than two trillion dollars . ( The Times ' public editor later called the paper 's prewar coverage `` flawed journalism . '' )
Thinking about the historic failure of the Times and others in the media a decade ago , I could n't help wish that Twitter had been around during the winter of 2002-2003 to provide a forum for critics to badger writers like Keller and the legion of Beltway media insiders who abdicated their role as journalists and fell in line behind the Bush White House 's march to war . I would n't have cared that recipients might have been insulted by the Twitter critiques or seen them as mean and shallow , the way Keller does today . Sorry , but the stakes in 2003 were too high to worry about bruised feelings .
Looking back , I wish Keller and other pro-war columnists had been “ bullied ” ( rhetorically ) as they got almost everything wrong about the pending war . I think the revolutionary peer connection tool would have been invaluable in shaming journalists into doing their jobs when so many failed to . ( Keller later admitted the invasion was a “ monumental blunder . ” )
Twitter could have helped puncture the Beltway media bubble by providing news consumers with direct access to confront journalists during the run-up to the war . And the pass-around nature of Twitter could have rescued forgotten or buried news stories and commentaries that ran against the let's-go-to-war narrative that engulfed so much of the mainstream press .
Considering the central role the lapdog media played in helping to sell President Bush 's pre-emptive invasion , I wonder if Twitter could have stopped the Iraq War .
Make no mistake , the nascent liberal blogosphere was raising its collective voice against the war in 2003 and calling out the press for its lapdog ways . In fact , one of the catalysts for the rapid expansion of the liberal blogosphere one decade ago was the ingrained sense of frustration . Progressive often searched in vain for passionate and articulate anti- war voices within the mainstream media . ( And when they found a champion , Phil Donahue , he was summarily fired just weeks before the invasion . ) Denied a voice , they created their own platform , liberal blogs .
The problem was the liberal blogosphere got the war story right , but they did it in something of a bubble . It was a bubble the mainstream media bolstered to isolate their progressive critics ; to isolate and marginalize the new band of rowdy citizen journalists . Still new enough in 2002 and 2003 that they did n't necessarily command journalists ' respect , and lacking the technological ability to reach into newsrooms , liberal blogs were often ignored by media elite , despite the fact the blogs were raising all the questions about the pending war .
Why am I convinced Twitter would have made an impact ? The same reason Keller mentioned in his blog post this month : It 's always on . Every Beltway newsroom is now wired to Twitter . It 's today 's media nervous system , the way The Drudge Report supposedly was during the Clinton years . It 's the current that powers each news cycle . It 's the first warning signal for breaking news and it 's supplementing cocktail chatter that forms conventional wisdoms .
In 2009 , America Journalism Review noted some of the benefits that Twitter offered reporters :
It can provide instantaneous access to hard-to-reach newsmakers , given that there 's no PR person standing between a reporter and a tweet to a government official or corporate executive .
It 's that same lack of a filter , and that power to communicate directly with journalists , that can make it so influential . They may not always choose to respond , but like all Twitter users , journalists regularly tap the 'Connect ' icon to follow what people are saying to them and about them .
So yeah , it 's the best place to tweak the press and get an instance response . I 'm not talking about trolling and name calling . I 'm talking about flagging dubious work , the way critics used Twitter to spread the word about the obvious holes in Bill Keller 's recent sequestration column .
And Keller is n't alone . Take David Brooks ' Times piece a few weeks back , in which he erroneously suggested Obama had n't issued a proposal to avoid the looming sequestration other than raising taxes on the rich . Thanks to the wildfire messaging of Twitter , Brooks ' column became something of a laughing stock by noon on the day it was published . And like Keller , Brooks felt the need to quickly respond to the criticism ; to apologize . That kind of a real-time debunking , and a debunking that was read inside every newsroom , was precisely what liberals lacked ten years ago . They lacked an intimate amplifier that found its media mark every time .
With the interactivity of Twitter , journalists , I think , feel a much stronger urge to defend their work and to not let legitimate criticism go unanswered . Ignoring Twitter , and specifically ignoring what people are saying about your work on Twitter , is n't really an option the way turning a blind eye to anti-war bloggers may have been ten years ago .
The harshest judges of those in news media are often others in the news media , and , with the benefit of Twitter , that intrajournalistic watchdog role can be performed simultaneously with the journalism being criticized .
That description appeared in a Times piece about the angry reaction that erupted on Twitter when journalists were called together for President Obama 's first news conference after the Sandy Hook , CT. , school massacre . After Obama made public how the administration would respond to the tragedy , the assembled scribes then promptly ignored the issue pressed Obama on budget tactics . Media critics flipped out on Twitter and the Times wrote that up as news .
Think back to the night of Bush 's final , pre-war press conference on March 6 , 2003 . Laying out the reasons for war , Bush mentioned Al Qaeda and the terrorist attacks of September 11 thirteen times in less than an hour . Yet not a single journalist challenged the presumed connection Bush was making between Al Qaeda and Iraq , despite the fact that U.S. allies had publicly questioned any such association .
With Twitter , media condemnations would have been instant that night and somnambulant journalists certainly would have felt the public sting .
Or imagine how Twitter could have been used in real time on February 5 , 2003 , when Secretary of State Colin Powell made his infamous attack-Iraq presentation to the United Nations . At the time , Beltway pundits positively swooned over what they claimed was Powell 's air-tight case for war . ( Powell later conceded the faulty presentation represented a `` blot '' on his record . ) But Twitter could have swarmed journalists with instant analysis about the obvious shortcoming . That kind of accurate , instant analysis of Powell 's presentation was posted on blogs but ignored by a mainstream media enthralled by the White House 's march to war .
Now , I realize the social media tool has been credited with helping start a revolution , but stopping an invasion that the full force of the Bush administration was determined to wage ? Does n't that seem like a stretch ?
My point is Twitter could have altered , in important ways , the media coverage , especially during the run-up to the war when the Beltway press experienced something close to collective malpractice . It could have helped shame journalists into rediscovering the notion of skepticism .
A year after the war began , then-Washington Post editor Leonard Downie downplayed any role the media may have played in helping launch the invasion . He insisted people who opposed the war “ have the mistaken impression that somehow if the media 's coverage had been different , there would n't have been a war . ”
I disagree . It would have been far more difficult for Bush to have ordered the war of choice with Iraq -- and sold the idea at home -- if it were n't for the bountiful help he received from the mainstream media , and particularly the stamp of approval he received from so-called liberal media institutions such as the Washington Post , which in February of 2003 alone , editorialized in favor of war nine times . ( Between September 2002 and February 2003 , the paper editorialized twenty-six times in favor of the war . )
Ten years ago , Twitter could have also performed the Herculean task of making sure brave news stories that did raise doubts about the war did n't fall through the cracks , as invariably happened back then . With swarms of users touting the reports , it would have been much more difficult for reporters and pundits to dismiss important events and findings .
For instance , Twitter could have trumpeted the news that on October 10 , 2002 , retired Marine General Anthony Zinni , the former head of Central Command for U.S. forces in the Middle East , delivered a keynote address at a Washington think tank where he outlined his grave concerns about the Bush administration 's war with Iraq . ( The Washington Post devoted just 300 words , on page 16 , to Zinni 's deeply prophetic warning . )
Twitter could have spread the word about the Associated Press ' January 18 , 2003 dispatch , `` Inspectors Have Covered CIA 's Sites of 'Concern ' and Reporter No Violations , '' which documented how more than a dozen inspected Iraqi weapons facilities had failed to produce any evidence of Saddam 's alleged arsenal .
Twitter could have championed the work of the Washington Post 's Walter Pincus , who was writing insightful , skeptical war stories , but ones his editors refused to put on page-one . Pieces like `` Bush Clings To Dubious Allegations About Iraq , '' “ U.S . Lacks Specifics on Banned Arms , ” “ Alleged al-Qaida Ties Questioned ; Experts Scrutinize Details of Accusations Against Iraqi Government , ” and “ Making the Case Against Baghdad ; Officials : Evidence Strong , Not Conclusive . ”
And Twitter could have touted John Barry 's March 3 , 2003 piece in Newsweek :
Hussein Kamel , the highest-ranking Iraqi official ever to defect from Saddam Hussein 's inner circle , told CIA and British intelligence officers and U.N. inspectors in the summer of 1995 that after the gulf war , Iraq destroyed all its chemical and biological weapons stocks and the missiles to deliver them .
In other words , Twitter could have been the megaphone -- the media equalizer -- that war critics lacked ten years ago . And yes , for pro-war columnists like Bill Keller who later admitted they got the Iraq story very wrong , Twitter back then might 've meant enduring some “ bullying ” critiques .
Given the dire consequences of the war , it would 've been worth it .","Responding to a barrage of criticism he received for a factually inaccurate and flawed column he wrote this month about the sequestration battle, New York Times columnist Bill Keller wrote a follow-up blog post to detail how critics had hounded him online, especially via Twitter.

In days , Ms. Tang also created a “ mask information platform ” displaying scores of real-time maps detailing the mask supply at pharmacies across the island .
These innovations mark just one example of how the island nation of Taiwan , with wizard-like efficiency , has so far pulled off one of the world ’ s most striking coronavirus success stories . Located just 80 miles off the coast of mainland China , Taiwan faced early exposure to the virus : Hundreds of thousands of its citizens work in China , and millions of Chinese visit the island each year .

Taiwan has emerged as a cutting-edge model – a political laboratory of sorts – for using technology to improve democratic governance . It ’ s an example other countries are eager to learn from , from New Zealand to Italy to the United States .
One key element of Taiwan ’ s success is its vibrant tech culture , which sprang into action this winter as the island confronted the potentially disastrous outbreak of coronavirus just offshore , in China .

Such scenes would have been unthinkable in Taiwan just a generation ago , when the island was still under a martial law regime imposed by Chiang Kai-shek ’ s Nationalist government in 1949 and not lifted until 1987 . Since then , though , Taiwan ’ s democracy has grown up , evolving along with the rise of personal computers , press freedom , the internet , and social media . Taiwan held its first presidential election in 1996 , the year that the World Wide Web became popular . In successive elections , candidates “ imagined their administration in tandem with ... new digital advancements , ” says Ms. Tang .
Ms. Tang is representative of Taiwan ’ s millennial generation , one that is technically minded , with a strong sense of Taiwanese identity , and the first in decades to be able to express themselves freely .

As a teenager , she won recognition as a talented free software programmer , starting her own company at 16 and working in Silicon Valley .
Then politics called . In March 2014 , Ms. Tang joined Taiwan ’ s student-led “ sunflower ” protest movement , which for three weeks seized control of the national legislature to oppose a pending free trade agreement with China . Students argued the accord would allow Beijing to gain control of strategic sectors of Taiwan ’ s economy , and demanded an open debate over the agreement , which the government classified as internal . Ms. Tang and other “ hacktivists ” – tech-savvy activists who design their own solutions to government issues – set up communications and transmitted the debate to millions of people .
The movement won broad public support , helping prompt a change in government in 2016 with the election of President Tsai Ing-wen . Protests morphed into sustained participation , as “ hactivists ” joined the government . President Tsai ’ s administration recruited dozens of young social entrepreneurs and innovators to serve as “ reverse mentors ” for older ministers , and to broaden public engagement . Ms. Tang became Taiwan ’ s youngest-ever minister without portfolio , focused on digital governance . She is also Taiwan ’ s first transgender minister .

“ Most people feel they have won after they see the tallying , instead of half the people feeling that they have lost , ” she explains . Moreover , anyone can launch an e-petition on the Join platform , and once it reaches 5,000 signatures , the relevant ministries must respond in public .
In this way , Taiwan ’ s government invites change from the inside out , through transparency , open data , and involvement of the public in solving national problems . Challenges such as bureaucratic resistance and civil servants preferring anonymity are real , Ms. Tang says , but President Tsai ’ s commitment to act on the grassroots projects helps overcome them .
From the outside in , meanwhile , Taiwan ’ s civic technology community takes the initiative to improve and demystify government , and organize debates on key issues . A movement called g0v , or “ gov-zero ” – made up of coders , NGOs , and civil servants – clones government websites and builds better versions , which the government often adopts .

A federal appeals court in Manhattan says President Trump can not block critics from his Twitter account , calling it `` unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination . ''
In a 29-page ruling on Tuesday , a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court 's decision that found that Trump violated the First Amendment when he blocked certain Twitter users , because he uses his Twitter account `` to conduct official business and to interact with the public . '' By preventing critics from accessing his feed , the president is barring them from participating in what the judges deemed a public forum .
`` [ The ] First Amendment does not permit a public official who utilizes a social media account for all manner of official purposes to exclude persons from an otherwise-open online dialogue because they expressed views with which the official disagrees , '' the judges wrote .
The case stems from a lawsuit filed by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University on behalf of seven people who were blocked from the @ realDonaldTrump account after posting replies criticizing the president and his policies . That meant the users could not view the president 's tweets , reply directly to them or use the account 's webpage to view the comment threads associated with Trump 's tweets .
`` Public officials ' social media accounts are now among the most significant forums for discussion of government policy , '' Jameel Jaffer , the Knight Institute 's executive director , who argued the case before the 2nd Circuit panel in March , said in a statement .
`` This decision will ensure that people are n't excluded from these forums simply because of their viewpoints , and that public officials are n't insulated from their constituents ' criticism , '' Jaffer said . `` The decision will help ensure the integrity and vitality of digital spaces that are increasingly important to our democracy . ''
Several of the plaintiffs celebrated the legal victory on Twitter .
Buckwalter-Poza , who is a writer and legal analyst in Washington , D.C. , said she was banned from the president 's feed after a comment she posted about Russia 's involvement in the election was retweeted by thousands of people .
`` Take us to the Supreme Court if you dare @ realDonaldTrump , '' wrote plaintiff Eugene Gu , a California surgeon and scientist .
Plaintiff Holly Figueroa , a Grammy-nominated songwriter and one of the national organizers of the March for Truth movement , wrote in a June 2017 piece for The Washington Post that she had `` accumulated a very vocal group of Twitter followers who cheer me on when I troll the president . '' But she says she was blocked in May 2017 after a tweet in which she called Trump a `` bloody idiot . ''
`` The Founding Fathers did n't foresee Twitter , but they certainly provided a framework to make sure we could always engage with the people who purport to represent us , '' Figueroa wrote .
The government had argued that Trump acted as a private Twitter user when he blocked people on the social media platform , `` because the function is available to all users . '' But the panel of judges said that argument `` founders in the face of the uncontested evidence '' that Trump 's account is `` one of the White House 's main vehicles for conducting official business . ''

A federal appeals court in Manhattan says President Trump cannot block critics from his Twitter account, calling it ""unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.""

In a 29-page ruling on Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court's decision that found that Trump violated the First Amendment when he blocked certain Twitter users, because he uses his Twitter account ""to conduct official business and to interact with the public."" By preventing critics from accessing his feed, the president is barring them from participating in what the judges deemed a public forum.

""[The] First Amendment does not permit a public official who utilizes a social media account for all manner of official purposes to exclude persons from an otherwise-open online dialogue because they expressed views with which the official disagrees,"" the judges wrote.

The case stems from a lawsuit filed by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University on behalf of seven people who were blocked from the @realDonaldTrump account after posting replies criticizing the president and his policies. That meant the users could not view the president's tweets, reply directly to them or use the account's webpage to view the comment threads associated with Trump's tweets.

""Public officials' social media accounts are now among the most significant forums for discussion of government policy,"" Jameel Jaffer, the Knight Institute's executive director, who argued the case before the 2nd Circuit panel in March, said in a statement.

""This decision will ensure that people aren't excluded from these forums simply because of their viewpoints, and that public officials aren't insulated from their constituents' criticism,"" Jaffer said. ""The decision will help ensure the integrity and vitality of digital spaces that are increasingly important to our democracy.""

Several of the plaintiffs celebrated the legal victory on Twitter.

""We won on appeal,"" Rebecca Buckwalter-Poza wrote.

Buckwalter-Poza, who is a writer and legal analyst in Washington, D.C., said she was banned from the president's feed after a comment she posted about Russia's involvement in the election was retweeted by thousands of people.

""Take us to the Supreme Court if you dare @realDonaldTrump,"" wrote plaintiff Eugene Gu, a California surgeon and scientist.

Plaintiff Holly Figueroa, a Grammy-nominated songwriter and one of the national organizers of the March for Truth movement, wrote in a June 2017 piece for The Washington Post that she had ""accumulated a very vocal group of Twitter followers who cheer me on when I troll the president."" But she says she was blocked in May 2017 after a tweet in which she called Trump a ""bloody idiot.""

""The Founding Fathers didn't foresee Twitter, but they certainly provided a framework to make sure we could always engage with the people who purport to represent us,"" Figueroa wrote.

The government had argued that Trump acted as a private Twitter user when he blocked people on the social media platform, ""because the function is available to all users."" But the panel of judges said that argument ""founders in the face of the uncontested evidence"" that Trump's account is ""one of the White House's main vehicles for conducting official business.""

Trump often uses the platform to announce new policies, legislative changes, staff hirings and firings and diplomatic matters.

The court also noted that then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in 2017 that Trump's tweets should be considered ""official statements by the President of the United States.""

""In resolving this appeal, we remind the litigants and the public that if the First Amendment means anything, it means that the best response to disfavored speech on matters of public concern is more speech, not less,"" the judges wrote.

Trump has not tweeted about the ruling, but Justice Department spokeswoman Kelly Laco said in a statement to NPR, ""We are disappointed with the court's decision and are exploring possible next steps.""",www.npr.org,center,U9PAL74imXFOQpoY

That’s where you’ll find what’s become the fastest-growing chapter of the Obama alumni association.

Story Continued Below

Barack Obama was a startup president elected by a tech-obsessed campaign, they say. Silicon Valley is the natural next step.

In part, it’s a reflection of America’s changing economy; New York, D.C., Los Angeles and a president’s hometown used to be the best places to cash out after a post-White House career. But for the people who helped get Obama elected and worked for him once he did, there’s something about San Francisco and its environs that just feels right: the emphasis on youth and trying things that might fail, chasing that feeling of working for the underdog, and even using that word “disrupting” to describe what they do.

“A lot of people who moved out here were present at the creation of the Obama ’08 campaign,” said Tommy Vietor, working the shears on a two-mushroom pizza at a restaurant in the Marina neighborhood, not far from his apartment. “There’s a piece of them that wants to replicate that.”

Vietor’s time with Obama goes back to driving a van before the first presidential campaign even started, and he rode the opportunity all the way up through being the spokesman for the National Security Council.

Vietor left the White House two years ago, and though he and his business partner, former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau, briefly based the communications strategy firm they founded in Washington, they soon headed west. Favreau went to L.A. Vietor picked San Francisco. Now they have a focus on speechwriting for tech and other startups.

“If you’re writing for a CEO out here, they’re more likely to be your peer than your grandfather,” Vietor said. “They’re young, they’re cool, they get it.”

Even that kind of communications strategy firm is about as conventional as it gets for the Obama alumni who’ve descended.

It’s more than just David Plouffe, who moved out for a multimillion-dollar job at Uber. The not nearly exhaustive list includes: Obama speechwriter Kyle O’Connor, now at Nest; Michelle Obama’s former deputy communications director Semonti Stephens, now at Square; director of citizen participation Katie Jacobs Stanton, now at Twitter; ’08 regional and field director Mike Masserman, now at Lyft; Brandon Lepow, who did advance for the Obama campaign and communications for the White House, now at Facebook; legislative affairs special assistant Nicole Isaac, now at LinkedIn; director of research Liz Jarvis-Shean, first at Tesla and now and currently consulting for Civis; campaign staff director for technology Jim Green, now at Salesforce, along with Obama’s first chief information officer, Vivek Kundra; ’08 regional field director Alex McPhillips, at Google; ’08 regional Gillian Bergeron, at NextDoor; Organizing for America digital director Natalie Foster, at the Institute for the Future; Tech4Obama program manager Catherine Bracy, now at Code for America; ’08 deputy Wisconsin director Hallie Montoya Tansey, at an education-tech startup called Schoolzilla. Nick Papas, John Baldo, Courtney O’Donnell and Clark Stevens are all now at Airbnb. Jessica Santillo, the former White House assistant press secretary who handled much of the Healthcare.gov meltdown response, was the most recent to arrive, now to be a spokeswoman at Uber, along with White House director of strategic & message initiatives Jordan Burke, associate director of intergovernmental affairs Kellyn Blossom and assistant to the deputy White House chief of staff Sarah Fenn.

“There should be a welcome booth at the SFO airport,” said Jon Carson, the former Organizing for Action executive director, who commutes about twice a month from his home in Chicago as part of his job with the San Francisco-based rooftop solar-panel company SolarCity.

Ryan Gallentine, another Obama alum, recently moved out to San Francisco to work for Solar City himself.

Bobby Whithorne, a former Obama campaign aide and White House assistant press secretary who recently left Tom Steyer’s NextGen Climate Action to join public relations firm Porter Novelli, admits he’s become something of a San Francisco new economy poster boy: the Patagonia jacket he wears back and forth to his office in SoMA, getting to the airport by Uber, booking his hotels on Airbnb, getting his groceries delivered with InstaCart.

When he moved here last year, Whithorne had only ever spent a weekend in the city. But it quickly felt right to him, and not just because of the food and the weather or that he has more time to get home and cook dinner with his girlfriend (who also left an administration job to move here) or plan weekend hikes together.

There have been a few get-togethers, but Whithorne doesn’t spend a lot of time with other Obama alums. Knowing they’re in town, though, does help.

“It alleviates a lot of the anxiety about moving to a new place,” he said, “in the back of your mind knowing you can call someone you know and trust, even if you didn’t hang out a lot in D.C.”

Obama himself rarely misses an opportunity to come to San Francisco. He says he loves the energy there, loves the people. (The city’s ultraliberal leanings mean he was greeted as a rock star even during the dark days before last year’s midterms.) He’s even become friendly with Elon Musk.

And there’s no shortage of staffers at the White House who talk about a life in San Francisco once the next 18 months are done. It’s the opposite of everything they hate in Washington. It’s their city on the hill(s).

“Hard not to love this place,” White House political director David Simas tweeted on an official trip to the city back in February, along with a photo of Obama boarding Marine One, the Golden Gate Bridge in the background.

It hasn’t been just one-way traffic. Nearly three-dozen top tier techies have joined the Obama administration from all over Silicon Valley in the past few years to better integrate new technology, and they’re trying to recruit more.

Megan Smith, a former Google vice president who’s now the White House’s chief technology officer, recalled talking with then-chief technology officer Todd Park about persuading a promising engineer to pass on a job at a startup and say, “‘I’m going to join the VA digital service, because that’s the coolest thing.’ At the time, there was zero chance that anyone we knew would say that. But that was our goal.”

Very quickly, Smith says, that’s changing. “Government,” she said, “reminds me of the Internet in 1997 or 1998, before anyone realized what had happened.”

The sushi’s better in San Francisco, sure, but Smith said, “You can only eat so much.” The message she got from Obama was, “‘I don’t need you for your whole career. I need you to come and trade out.’”

Smith’s not sure what she’ll do after the administration’s over. Park has already moved out to Silicon Valley, working as a technology adviser.

People in the White House say that having all these San Francisco people around will probably only accelerate the migration to the Bay Area.

Some of that’s already started: In April, Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced a branch office in Silicon Valley, to build cooperation between the Pentagon and tech companies, and General Services Administration staff is already on the ground.

Like a lot of people who worked for Obama and have made their way out to San Francisco, Alex Lofton never considered himself a political junkie. Three years right out of college working for Obama’s 2008 campaign and at Organizing for America through the Obamacare rollout was enough.

But he said that his experience was crucial to what he’s doing now — with a fresh MBA from Stanford, he’s got a startup called Landed that’s using property management software and other technology to facilitate renting and home ownership. He’s hoping to develop some kind of shared-mortgage approach to combat income inequality.

“I think the campaign fast-tracked me into being really excited about working as an entrepreneur probably for the rest of my life,” Lofton said.

He’s got a lot of friends in San Francisco from his Obama days. And if any other Obama alums are looking to invest, Lofton would love to hear from them.

“The bank account,” he said, “is open.”

A bad precedent

The subject of how Google’s algorithms decide which pages and news stories match our interests certainly deserves cross-examination. The company has repeatedly had to apologize for serving up conspiracy theorists among news results and YouTube recommendations and has struggled to stop various sorts of ad fraud.

Good questions to ask

Instead of obsessing over search results, committee members might do better to focus on content filtering as seen in YouTube’s recommendation engine — which seems to optimize keeping people’s attention over the quality of what it puts in front of people’s eyeballs. Google’s attempts to filter out the worst content or at least exclude it from advertising income, meanwhile, have sometimes trapped content as innocent as a clip of a giant American flag at a football game.

From some other perspectives , that $ 5 billion fine is a big deal , of course : it ’ s the biggest fine in FTC history , far bigger than the $ 22 million fine levied against Google in 2012 . And $ 5 billion is a lot of money , to be sure . It ’ s just that like everything else that comes into contact with Facebook ’ s scale , it ’ s still entirely too small : Facebook had $ 15 billion in revenue last quarter alone , and $ 22 billion in profit last year .
The largest FTC fine in the history of the country represents basically a month of Facebook ’ s revenue , and the company did such a good job of telegraphing it to investors that the stock price went up .
The biggest FTC fine in history increased Mark Zuckerberg ’ s net worth
Here ’ s another way to say it : the biggest FTC fine in United States history increased Mark Zuckerberg ’ s net worth .
That ’ s actually the real problem here : fines and punishments are only effective when they provide negative consequences for bad behavior . But Facebook has done nothing but behave badly from inception , and it has only ever been slapped on the wrist by authority figures and rewarded by the market . After all , Facebook was already under a previous FTC consent decree for privacy violations imposed in 2011 , and that didn ’ t seem to stop any of the company ’ s recent scandals from happening .

`` violate the law once , then violate it again after you 're under a consent order at a mammoth scale , then violate it so many times that we all lose track of what 's happening , & you 'll get a proportionately modest fine & get to continue breaking things '' -- the FTC to SV today . — Lindsey Barrett ( @ LAM_Barrett ) July 12 , 2019
There are other elements to the settlement , as Tony Romm at the Washington Post has reported : Facebook will have to document how it plans to use data before it launches new products , and execs like Zuckerberg will have to promise the company has protected user privacy . But none of these conditions will prevent Facebook from collecting and sharing data , and they certainly won ’ t affect Facebook ’ s insanely lucrative ad business , which relies upon that data .
And as Peter Kafka notes , regulatory compliance costs aren ’ t exactly a deterrent either : Facebook will pay the fine , eat the cost of a few more lawyers and PR people to ensure compliance with this new order , and carry on with the business of , uh , issuing a new worldwide currency while exposing underpaid contractors to horrifying videos of people being murdered for $ 15 an hour .
The FTC just gave Facebook a Christmas present five months early . — David Cicilline ( @ davidcicilline ) July 12 , 2019
Members of Congress are already opposing this settlement — Rep. David Cicilline is calling it a “ Christmas present , ” while Senator Ron Wyden says the FTC has “ failed miserably. ” Senator Richard Blumenthal says the decision is “ inadequate ” and “ historically hollow , ” and Senator Mark Warner says “ It ’ s time for Congress to act . ”
Facebook made $ 5 billion in profits in just the first three months of last year . The company is too big to oversee , and this drop-in-the-bucket penalty confirms that . The FTC should break Facebook up , plain and simple . Enough is enough . — Elizabeth Warren ( @ SenWarren ) July 12 , 2019
There are surely going to be many more statements and strongly-worded condemnations of the FTC in the weeks ahead , as the settlement goes through Justice Department review and inevitable approval .

There are other elements to the settlement, as Tony Romm at the Washington Post has reported: Facebook will have to document how it plans to use data before it launches new products, and execs like Zuckerberg will have to promise the company has protected user privacy. But none of these conditions will prevent Facebook from collecting and sharing data, and they certainly won’t affect Facebook’s insanely lucrative ad business, which relies upon that data.

And as Peter Kafka notes, regulatory compliance costs aren’t exactly a deterrent either: Facebook will pay the fine, eat the cost of a few more lawyers and PR people to ensure compliance with this new order, and carry on with the business of, uh, issuing a new worldwide currency while exposing underpaid contractors to horrifying videos of people being murdered for $15 an hour.

The FTC just gave Facebook a Christmas present five months early. — David Cicilline (@davidcicilline) July 12, 2019

Members of Congress are already opposing this settlement — Rep. David Cicilline is calling it a “Christmas present,” while Senator Ron Wyden says the FTC has “failed miserably.” Senator Richard Blumenthal says the decision is “inadequate” and “historically hollow,” and Senator Mark Warner says “It’s time for Congress to act.”

Facebook made $5 billion in profits in just the first three months of last year. The company is too big to oversee, and this drop-in-the-bucket penalty confirms that. The FTC should break Facebook up, plain and simple. Enough is enough. — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) July 12, 2019

There are surely going to be many more statements and strongly-worded condemnations of the FTC in the weeks ahead, as the settlement goes through Justice Department review and inevitable approval. But words are just words, really. If our government is going to hold Facebook accountable for its reckless and irresponsible behavior, it has to actually do it, and in such a way that Mark Zuckerberg learns that actions have consequences.",www.theverge.com,left,MgXEqyP3dd6ppRU4

He is Gen. Kim Yong-chol , director of the espionage and clandestine operations service known as the Reconnaissance General Bureau , or RGB .
The RGB was formed in 2009 when the Korean People ’ s Army , the communist state ’ s military , combined its Reconnaissance Bureau with the ruling Workers ’ Party of Korea Central Committee Operations Department .
The combined intelligence and military special operations force is under the control of North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-un . Both military and party organizations have a long history of deadly covert operations and nefarious foreign espionage operations , such as the 1970s operations to kidnap foreign nationals for use in intelligence training in North Korea .
U.S. and South Korean intelligence agencies have been tracking Gen. Kim since he emerged as a member of the Central Military Commission in September 2010 . The four-star general also was part of the funeral committee for Kim Jong-il , who died in 2011 , a key indicator of his place in the hierarchy of the secretive North Korean power structure . His promotion to full general was announced in February 2012 .
Gen. Kim , who is also deputy chief of the military ’ s general staff , has headed the RGB since 2009 , but his career has not been without bumps . He was demoted to two-star rank in November 2012 following the arrest of a number of North Korean spies in South Korea . By February of 2013 , however , Gen. Kim had regained the lost two stars .
His role as head of the RGB remained secret until March 29 , 2013 , when Pyongyang ’ s state-controlled media for the first time confirmed the existence of the organization blamed for the sinking of South Korea ’ s Cheonan warship in 2010 . Earlier RGB operations included the terrorist bombing in Yangon , Myanmar , that killed three visiting South Korean government ministers and a commando raid on the South Korean Blue House presidential residence in 1968 .

A report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies made public last week said North Korea employs around 5,900 cyberwarfare specialists .
“ The act against Sony is the first of its kind by North Korea , in terms of both the target and the sophistication of the hack , ” wrote CSIS researchers Jenny Jun , Scott LaFoy and Ethan Sohn .
The RGB “ is now credited with significant operational cyber capabilities and missions that are , effectively , another means of achieving the objectives of previous provocations , ” the report said .
Several groups of hackers within the organization have been identified . They include Unit 121 and Lab 110 , cover names for shadowy cyberattack operations groups .
Unit 121 has been identified by U.S. and South Korean intelligence as the RGB ’ s main offensive cyberwarfare group . It is reported that cyberwarfare experts from the group operated out of the Chilbosan Hotel in Shenyang , China . The Sony hack was carried out from a hotel in Thailand , according to an intelligence source . Unit 121 also was blamed for the so-called DarkSeoul cyberattacks last year that were traced to North Korean hackers .
Those attacks against South Korean banks , television broadcasters and news outlets were very similar , in terms of malicious software used and other attack methodology , to the Sony hack . Against the movie network , the North Koreans used a layered cyberattack involving careful pre-attack reconnaissance , data theft for the attack and then data destruction on hard drives and other storage media through the use of “ wiper ” malware .
South Korea ’ s government , which cooperated with the FBI in investigating the Sony cyberattack , has linked the 2013 cyberattacks to Internet Protocol addresses belonging to the Pyongyang government ’ s Korea Post and Telecommunications Corporation , which is part of the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications .
A report produced in August by HP Security Research stated that “ North Korean hackers have successfully penetrated U.S. defense networks more frequently than any other country that has targeted U.S. defense assets . ”
The HP security report identified RGB Unit 204 as involved in cyberoperations . If true , that unit would also be a likely perpetrator of the Sony hack that successfully dissuaded the $ 8 billion entertainment giant to cancel its widespread Dec. 25 rollout of the movie “ The Interview , ” a comedy involving a fictitious plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un . Sony agreed to limited distribution after a backlash against the cancellation .
China ’ s military is setting up facilities on small islands off the coast of Zhejiang province , about 186 miles northwest of Japan ’ s Senkakus , islands that China claims as its territory and calls the Diaoyu .
Japan ’ s Kyodo news agency and Bloomberg news , quoting Chinese sources , said the military base will be used by the People ’ s Liberation Army to react quickly to potential military crises .
China increased tensions in the East China Sea last year by announcing it was setting up an air defense identification zone covering the Senkakus and threatening aircraft or ships that enter the zone , which includes large swaths of international airspace and sea lanes .
The initial military construction on the Nanji Islands includes several large radar and several landing strips .
Rick Fisher , a senior fellow at the International Assessment and Strategy Center , said the Nanji Island military buildup is an ominous development for both Japan and Taiwan .
“ China ’ s construction of a military base on Nanji Island could put an effective People ’ s Liberation Army amphibious assault force within a four-hour ride of the Senkaku Islands , ” Mr. Fisher told Inside the Ring .
“ The real danger is that China is initiating an escalation cycle that could lead to war . ”
The new base could prompt Japan to militarize the Senkakus to deter Chinese military attacks . “ But if Tokyo puts troops on the islands , then China will be more likely to attack them , ” Mr. Fisher said .
PLA control over the Senkakus also would give the Chinese military a much better position for an attack on Taiwan . China has said it is prepared to use force to reunite the island with the mainland .
Additionally , China could deploy some of its large , Ukrainian-made Zubr air-cushioned hovercraft on Nanji and use them to move troops and tanks to the Senkakus or in an assault against Taiwan .
As if the CIA didn ’ t have enough bad publicity following the release of a critical Senate Democratic staff report on its terrorist interrogation tactics , the anti-secrecy group Wikileaks this week published two classified CIA documents used to train clandestine service officers on how to evade security screening at airports .
“ Consistent , well-rehearsed , and plausible cover is important for avoiding secondary selection and critical for surviving it , ” states one of the documents , a report called “ Surviving Secondary : An Identity Threat Assessment Secondary Screening Procedures at International Airports. ” The document is labeled “ Secret/Orcon/Noforn , ” the last two acronyms standing for “ originator controlled ” and not for distribution to foreign nationals .
The 15-page manual tells CIA officers to avoid looking suspicious to airport security screeners by having a well-learned cover story and being prepared to answer two basic primary screening questions : “ Why are you here ? ” and “ Where are you staying ? ”
Not having clear or convincing answers could lead to tough interrogation by security and intelligence officials at airports in countries with difficult entry procedures , such as those in Europe , the Middle East and Asia .
The report contains this classified no-brainer tip : “ Travelers can minimize the possibility of secondary by knowing how to prepare for and navigate the primary inspection and by avoiding to the extent possible the various triggers for secondary , ” like sweating or breathing heavily while being questioned .
The report concludes that under all circumstances , CIA officers should not reveal their true identities , “ no mater what . ”
“ Even when the traveler does everything right , the best protection during secondary screening is to be well-prepared with a cover story , according to an experienced CIA traveler , ” the report says .
One tip for spies : Wear a tie . During an early-morning incident at a European airport , a CIA officer was picked for secondary screening , probably because his casual dress did not match his profile as a diplomatic passport holder . The officer faced grilling after explosives residue was found on his bag .
“ In response to questioning , the CIA officer gave the cover story that he had been in counterterrorism training in Washington , DC , ” the report said . “ Although language difficulties led the local security officials to conclude that the traveler was being evasive and had trained in a terrorist camp , the CIA officer consistently maintained his cover story . Eventually , the security officials allowed him to rebook his flight and continue on his way .
The report revealed how China trains its spies to avoid intensive U.S. screening . In May 2009 the FBI learned that “ a Chinese network security company advises its employees in secondary to avoid appearing nervous , keep answers simple , and not volunteer additional information , such as details on U.S. contacts , ” the report said .","U.S. intelligence agencies have identified the military officer orchestrating North Korea’s state-sponsored hacking attacks, such as the one on Sony Pictures Entertainment.

Twitter has suspended the account in question, according to a source familiar with the matter. The company is also working to remove footage of the shooting from its service, noting that both are in violation of the company's policies.

YouTube, which is owned by Google, is also working to remove footage from its platform.

“Our hearts are broken over today’s terrible tragedy in New Zealand. Please know we are working vigilantly to remove any violent footage,” said YouTube, in a tweeted statement.

SOCIAL MEDIA GIANTS CLAMP DOWN ON SICKENING VIRGINIA SHOOTING FOOTAGE

""Shocking, violent and graphic content has no place on our platforms, and we are employing our technology and human resources to quickly review and remove any and all such violative content on YouTube,"" said the video sharing site, in a statement obtained by Fox News.

According to a source familiar with the situation, YouTube has removed thousands of videos related to the mass shooting.

The tech giant uses smart detection technology to scan its platform for violent extremist videos, most of which have fewer than 10 views when they are removed. Users are also encouraged to flag any content they think violates YouTube's guidelines.

The footage highlights the challenges facing social media firms in swiftly clamping down on vile that can be quickly shared across their platforms.

This is not the first time that a shooting has been live streamed. Last year, chilling live stream footage that showed the deadly shooting at a Madden 19 NFL tournament in Jacksonville surfaced on social media.

technology,The Guardian,0,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/20/facebook-data-cambridge-analytica-sandy-parakilas,'Utterly horrifying': ex-Facebook insider says covert data harvesting was routine,2018-03-20,Paul Lewis,"Sandy Parakilas says numerous companies deployed these techniques – likely affecting hundreds of millions of users – and that Facebook looked the other way
Hundreds of millions of Facebook users are likely to have had their private information harvested by companies that exploited the same terms as the firm that collected data and passed it on to Cambridge Analytica , according to a new whistleblower .
Sandy Parakilas , the platform operations manager at Facebook responsible for policing data breaches by third-party software developers between 2011 and 2012 , told ███ he warned senior executives at the company that its lax approach to data protection risked a major breach .
Where 's Zuck ? Facebook CEO silent as data harvesting scandal unfolds Read more
“ My concerns were that all of the data that left Facebook servers to developers could not be monitored by Facebook , so we had no idea what developers were doing with the data , ” he said .
Parakilas said Facebook had terms of service and settings that “ people didn ’ t read or understand ” and the company did not use its enforcement mechanisms , including audits of external developers , to ensure data was not being misused .
Parakilas , whose job was to investigate data breaches by developers similar to the one later suspected of Global Science Research , which harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and provided the data to Cambridge Analytica , said the slew of recent disclosures had left him disappointed with his superiors for not heeding his warnings .
“ It has been painful watching , ” he said , “ because I know that they could have prevented it . ”
Play Video 3:41 What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal ? - video explainer
Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers , he replied : “ Zero . Absolutely none . Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control , and there was no insight into what was going on . ”
Parakilas said he “ always assumed there was something of a black market ” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers . However , he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “ audit developers directly and see what ’ s going on with the data ” he was discouraged from the approach .
He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used , warning him : “ Do you really want to see what you ’ ll find ? ” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “ Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn ’ t know about the abuse that was happening ” .
He added : “ They felt that it was better not to know . I found that utterly shocking and horrifying . ”
Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago , but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica .
Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas , but directed ███ to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices , which it said had “ significantly improved ” over the last five years .
“ While it ’ s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago , it ’ s untrue to suggest we didn ’ t or don ’ t care about privacy , ” that statement said . “ The facts tell a different story . ”
Parakilas , 38 , who now works as a product manager for Uber , is particularly critical of Facebook ’ s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform , without the knowledge or express consent of those friends .
That feature , called friends permission , was a boon to outside software developers who , from 2007 onwards , were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform .
The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company ’ s 2012 initial public offering , an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones .
Facebook took a 30 % cut of payments made through apps , but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data .
Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014 . However , he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so .
It has been painful watching , because I know they could have prevented it
Parakilas estimates that “ a majority of Facebook users ” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge . The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data .
Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms , such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data .
Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “ extremely rare ” , he said , adding : “ In the time I was there , I didn ’ t see them conduct a single audit of a developer ’ s systems . ”
Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica . The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach .
During the time he was at Facebook , Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “ one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data ” . Shortly after arriving at the company ’ s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive , Mark Zuckerberg , although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers .
While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users ’ friends ’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook ’ s terms and conditions , and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings , Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic .
“ It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk , ” he said . “ Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves , and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn ’ t read or understand . ”
It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research , and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014 . GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan , who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users .
The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz , ostensibly for academic purposes . Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly , and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “ close working relationship ” with Facebook .
While Kogan ’ s app only attracted around 270,000 users ( most of whom were paid to take the quiz ) , the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users .
“ Kogan ’ s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions , ” Parakilas said , adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes . Academic research from 2010 , based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps , concluded that around 11 % of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users .
If those figures were extrapolated , tens of thousands of apps , if not more , were likely to have systematically culled “ private and personally identifiable ” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users , Parakilas said .
The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern , he added .

Hundreds of millions of Facebook users are likely to have had their private information harvested by companies that exploited the same terms as the firm that collected data and passed it on to Cambridge Analytica, according to a new whistleblower.

Sandy Parakilas, the platform operations manager at Facebook responsible for policing data breaches by third-party software developers between 2011 and 2012, told the Guardian he warned senior executives at the company that its lax approach to data protection risked a major breach.

“My concerns were that all of the data that left Facebook servers to developers could not be monitored by Facebook, so we had no idea what developers were doing with the data,” he said.

Parakilas said Facebook had terms of service and settings that “people didn’t read or understand” and the company did not use its enforcement mechanisms, including audits of external developers, to ensure data was not being misused.

Parakilas, whose job was to investigate data breaches by developers similar to the one later suspected of Global Science Research, which harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and provided the data to Cambridge Analytica, said the slew of recent disclosures had left him disappointed with his superiors for not heeding his warnings.

“It has been painful watching,” he said, “because I know that they could have prevented it.”

Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: “Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”

Parakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.

He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.

He added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”

Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.

Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.

“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”

‘A majority of Facebook users’

Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.

That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.

The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.

Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.

Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.

It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it

Parakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.

Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.

Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”

Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.



During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.

While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.

“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”

It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.

The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.

While Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.

“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.

If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.

The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.

Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.

He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.

“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”

‘They treated it like a PR exercise’

Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.

“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”

Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”

That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”

As Edward Snowden , the National Security Agency whistleblower at the center of the film , packs his bags in a Hong Kong hotel for a desperately uncertain future , the camera lingers for a beat on the book near Snowden 's ever-present laptop : Cory Doctorow 's novel Homeland .
As sci-fi nerds can tell you , Homeland is no random novel . The book tells the tale of a wary , civil libertarian college-dropout hacker who has in his possession a four-gigabyte file of nefarious government documents , which he seeks to release even as powerful interests stalk his every move . Sound familiar ?
The novelist is also no ordinary scribbler . In addition to producing Prometheus Award–winning novels , Cory Doctorow is an influential copyright reform activist and co-editor of the hugely popular tech-culture group weblog BoingBoing . As the media thinker Lawrence Lessig pointed out last year , Citizenfour 's core audience of geeks recognized Homeland as one of several key `` internal references , '' along with the stickers on Snowden 's laptop from the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the online privacy tool Tor . `` If you are a public official on the wrong side of this fight , '' Lessig proclaimed , `` that core will stand against you . ''
But that 's not quite true . Or at least , it 's not the whole story . As I watched Citizenfour for the first time the day after the Academy Awards , the Doctorow reference felt bittersweet . That 's because the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) was on the cusp of a long-telegraphed 3–2 vote along party lines to place unprecedented regulatory controls onto the Internet . And one of the key lobbies supporting the FCC 's intrusion was led in part by none other than Cory Doctorow himself .
Under the vague banner of `` net neutrality '' —once technical jargon , now a surprisingly effective political slogan—federal regulators unceremoniously shoved the Internet out of the less-regulated `` information service '' category and reclassified it as a `` telecommunications service , '' thus subjecting it to oversight under the far more hands-on Title II of the Telecommunications Act . The aim , in the words of supporters such as Doctorow , is to forcibly prevent Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) such as Comcast , Time Warner Cable , and Verizon from `` extract [ ing ] ransom from everyone you want to talk to on the internet . '' That such ransom notes have stubbornly failed to materialize has been deemed immaterial .
As dissenting FCC commissioner Ajit Pai puts it bracingly in a must-read interview with ███ 's Nick Gillespie on page 44 , net neutrality is `` a solution that wo n't work to a problem that simply does n't exist . '' Instances where large ISPs have violated the principles of the `` open Internet '' are vanishingly few , and all involve disputes between corporations that were resolvable under existing laws , not circumstances where Comcast is brutally repressing a lone defenseless blogger .
Why did the same Netizens ( as they are no longer called ) who rally against government in the name of privacy turn around and rally in favor of it when it comes to data prioritization arrangements ? Partly because of a deep-seated and wholly understandable dislike of ISP giants . In a world where very few brands matter anymore on a visceral level ( with Apple being one of the few exceptions ) , companies like Time Warner and Comcast inspire deep hatred . My family probably called Time Warner customer service at least four dozen times in our two years as unhappy clients ; the moment we were able to escape to Verizon felt like V.J . Day . Champagne was uncorked .
It 's not hard to upgrade such well-deserved customer hostility from assertions of incompetence to accusations of organized thuggery . As Doctorow charged in The Guardian last year , `` The ISPs are n't seeking to get paid , they 're seeking to get paid twice : once by you , and a second time because you are now their hostage and the companies you want to do business with have to get through them to get to you . ''
But one problem with today 's ( and yesterday 's ) complaints about ISP giants is that they discount the more competitive developments coming tomorrow—if government gets the hell out of the way . As Geoffrey A. Manne and R. Ben Sperry explain in `` How to Break the Internet '' ( page 20 ) , `` imposing public-utility regulation under Title II means the qualities you do n't like about your cable company will become more widespread . It will mean less competition , reduced investment ( especially in underserved communities ) , slower broadband for everyone , and new regulatory hurdles for startups . '' If you do n't like what the comparatively free market offered , just wait until broadband providers start feeling more like your local electric company .
Manne and Sperry argue that allowing the Internet industry to set prices on data prioritization ( or not ! ) is an excellent way to maximize the potential for experimentation and business development . We 'll all be streaming live video to and from all our devices soon enough ; somebody needs to build out the infrastructure to make that possible . And an underappreciated benefit to legalizing prices is that it allows total unknowns to buy their way onto the same radar screens as the major players .

We 're all in favor of free minds ; it 's up to us to persuade you that free markets are the quickest way to get there .","There's a telling moment in Laura Poitras' Oscar-winning documentary Citizenfour. As Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency whistleblower at the center of the film, packs his bags in a Hong Kong hotel for a desperately uncertain future, the camera lingers for a beat on the book near Snowden's ever-present laptop: Cory Doctorow's novel Homeland.

As sci-fi nerds can tell you, Homeland is no random novel. The book tells the tale of a wary, civil libertarian college-dropout hacker who has in his possession a four-gigabyte file of nefarious government documents, which he seeks to release even as powerful interests stalk his every move. Sound familiar?

The novelist is also no ordinary scribbler. In addition to producing Prometheus Award–winning novels, Cory Doctorow is an influential copyright reform activist and co-editor of the hugely popular tech-culture group weblog BoingBoing. As the media thinker Lawrence Lessig pointed out last year, Citizenfour's core audience of geeks recognized Homeland as one of several key ""internal references,"" along with the stickers on Snowden's laptop from the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the online privacy tool Tor. ""If you are a public official on the wrong side of this fight,"" Lessig proclaimed, ""that core will stand against you.""

But that's not quite true. Or at least, it's not the whole story. As I watched Citizenfour for the first time the day after the Academy Awards, the Doctorow reference felt bittersweet. That's because the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was on the cusp of a long-telegraphed 3–2 vote along party lines to place unprecedented regulatory controls onto the Internet. And one of the key lobbies supporting the FCC's intrusion was led in part by none other than Cory Doctorow himself.

Under the vague banner of ""net neutrality""—once technical jargon, now a surprisingly effective political slogan—federal regulators unceremoniously shoved the Internet out of the less-regulated ""information service"" category and reclassified it as a ""telecommunications service,"" thus subjecting it to oversight under the far more hands-on Title II of the Telecommunications Act. The aim, in the words of supporters such as Doctorow, is to forcibly prevent Internet Service Providers (ISPs) such as Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and Verizon from ""extract[ing] ransom from everyone you want to talk to on the internet."" That such ransom notes have stubbornly failed to materialize has been deemed immaterial.

As dissenting FCC commissioner Ajit Pai puts it bracingly in a must-read interview with reason's Nick Gillespie on page 44, net neutrality is ""a solution that won't work to a problem that simply doesn't exist."" Instances where large ISPs have violated the principles of the ""open Internet"" are vanishingly few, and all involve disputes between corporations that were resolvable under existing laws, not circumstances where Comcast is brutally repressing a lone defenseless blogger.

Why did the same Netizens (as they are no longer called) who rally against government in the name of privacy turn around and rally in favor of it when it comes to data prioritization arrangements? Partly because of a deep-seated and wholly understandable dislike of ISP giants. In a world where very few brands matter anymore on a visceral level (with Apple being one of the few exceptions), companies like Time Warner and Comcast inspire deep hatred. My family probably called Time Warner customer service at least four dozen times in our two years as unhappy clients; the moment we were able to escape to Verizon felt like V.J. Day. Champagne was uncorked.

It's not hard to upgrade such well-deserved customer hostility from assertions of incompetence to accusations of organized thuggery. As Doctorow charged in The Guardian last year, ""The ISPs aren't seeking to get paid, they're seeking to get paid twice: once by you, and a second time because you are now their hostage and the companies you want to do business with have to get through them to get to you.""

But one problem with today's (and yesterday's) complaints about ISP giants is that they discount the more competitive developments coming tomorrow—if government gets the hell out of the way. As Geoffrey A. Manne and R. Ben Sperry explain in ""How to Break the Internet"" (page 20), ""imposing public-utility regulation under Title II means the qualities you don't like about your cable company will become more widespread. It will mean less competition, reduced investment (especially in underserved communities), slower broadband for everyone, and new regulatory hurdles for startups."" If you don't like what the comparatively free market offered, just wait until broadband providers start feeling more like your local electric company.

Manne and Sperry argue that allowing the Internet industry to set prices on data prioritization (or not!) is an excellent way to maximize the potential for experimentation and business development. We'll all be streaming live video to and from all our devices soon enough; somebody needs to build out the infrastructure to make that possible. And an underappreciated benefit to legalizing prices is that it allows total unknowns to buy their way onto the same radar screens as the major players. Take that ability away and incumbents will become even more entrenched.

Even if you take as given that tolerating data-delivery prices equals allowing for ""discrimination,"" it's still a terrible idea to task the government with preventing it. Adam Thierer, the thinker behind the concept of ""permissionless innovation,"" explains on page 30 (""Uncle Sam Wants Your Fitbit"") that the precautionary principle could prove disastrous if applied to America's globally envied Internet culture. ""If we spend all our time worrying over worst-case scenarios,"" Thierer argues, ""that means the best-case scenarios will never come about either.""

Are the days of the freewheeling Internet behind us? Of course not. To see why, look no further than the proclamations 15 years ago from the very people cheering loudest today about net neutrality.

technology,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/06/23/the-anti-innovation-president-000464,The anti-innovation presidency,2017-06-23,Michael Grunwald,"“ Innovation ” is one of those Washington priorities , like “ security ” or “ the children , ” that politicians in both parties tend to describe as investments rather than spending . Even as budget wars have raged on Capitol Hill , there ’ s been a fairly broad consensus that funding research and development is vital to American competitiveness . The Beltway seems to churn out an inexhaustible supply of bipartisan reports proclaiming that bigger government investments in science and technology today will pay economic dividends for taxpayers down the road .
This week has been “ tech week ” at the White House , and President Trump has jumped onto the rhetorical bandwagon , hailing the glories of innovation . “ My administration is embracing a new spirit of innovation that will make life better for all Americans , ” he told a group of technology leaders gathered in the Oval Office on Monday ; he doubled down Thursday , promising another group of new-economy executives that his government would “ help unleash technological breakthroughs that will transform our lives . ”
But Trump ’ s 2018 budget goes the opposite direction : It proposes the deepest cuts in innovation investments that any administration has ever proposed .
Not only does the Trump budget slash climate science and clean energy research beloved by Trump ’ s critics , it whacks advanced manufacturing programs and fossil energy research catering to Trump ’ s supporters , as well as basic science and medical research beloved by almost everyone . It ’ s a powerful rejection of the innovation-industrial complex , and even though Congress is likely to ignore most of it , a similarly powerful reflection of Trump ’ s political war on Washington elites .
Overall , Trump ’ s budget cuts research and development spending by about 5 percent from current levels , but that figure includes hefty increases for late-stage weapons development at the Pentagon . It would roll back non-defense R & D by an unprecedented 19 percent , taking the axe to the popular as well as the obscure . The National Institutes of Health would absorb a 21.5 percent hit , including major cuts in research on aging , cancer , infectious disease , mental health , and drug abuse ; NIH grant programs would have their stingiest award rates since 1970 . There would be even harsher cuts for the Agricultural Research Service , the National Institute of Standards and Technology , NASA ’ s education funding , NOAA ’ s ocean research , and EPA ’ s science office .
The Trump blueprint would also eliminate the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , which oversees studies of which medical treatments actually work ; the U.S. Geological Survey ’ s monitoring programs for volcanoes , earthquakes and the climate ; and a popular Manufacturing Extension Partnership that provided technical assistance for more than 25,000 companies last year . And it would wipe out ARPA-E , the most futuristic agency in Washington , a cutting-edge incubator for energy research modeled on the high-tech Pentagon unit that pioneered GPS and the Internet .
Trump aides believe some federal investments in R & D have been duplicative or ineffective , while others ought to be handled by the private sector . And they ’ re still proposing $ 150 billion in R & D funding , which is considerably more than zero . But their main argument for spending less on innovation is simply that America can ’ t afford to spend more . Trump ’ s Office of Management and Budget director , Mick Mulvaney , is an ardent limited-government conservative , and the budget he crafted for Trump reflects his belief that Washington spends way too much of your money . Trump made it clear his top budget priorities are strengthening the military and securing the border , while somehow reducing deficits without raising taxes or cutting Medicare or Social Security for the elderly . Mulvaney had to shrink something—really , just about everything else—to try to check all those boxes .
“ We wanted more for defense and the border , so we had to offset those increases somewhere , ” one senior budget official explained . “ We ’ re still making a big commitment to R & D . It ’ s just less than other administrations might make . ”
In fact , even within Trump ’ s top government priorities , like the military and the border , innovation is getting a haircut . The American Association for the Advancement of Science calculated that Trump ’ s budget would squeeze the Pentagon ’ s science and technology spending by 5 percent , including an 18 percent cut for its “ manufacturing innovation institutes. ” The Department of Homeland Security ’ s science and technology budget would shrink by 20 percent , limiting research into cybersecurity , bioweapons defense , and border technologies .
There ’ s a political logic to Trump ’ s innovation policy heresies . Two thirds of R & D spending goes to blue states , and most of it tends to cluster in large cities and college towns rather than farm country or the Rust Belt , one reason these issues have more resonance for cosmopolitan technocrats than for Trump voters . President Obama talked about them incessantly , clamoring for aggressive investments in innovation to help America “ win the future , ” but Trump has attacked just about everything Obama was for , from health care reform to the Paris climate agreement . On the campaign trail , he never emphasized winning the future , just winning , and he never proposed any new innovation policies of note .
Trump did create a White House Office of American Innovation led by his son-in-law , Jared Kushner , and at his meeting with tech leaders he vowed that the office would help upgrade the federal government ’ s balky technology . But he did not suggest that it would help promote innovation in the private sector ; he suggested that was the private sector ’ s job . In fact , one of the office ’ s main tasks will be shrinking and reorganizing the government , reflecting the belief of Mulvaney and other movement conservatives in the administration that the best thing government can do to spur innovation is to get out of the way of innovative businesses . In fact , during last year ’ s crisis over the Zika virus , as public health experts were racing to study its link to birth defects , Mulvaney asked a provocative question on Facebook : “ Do we really need government-funded research at all ? ”
Historically , though , the U.S. government has played a vital role in seeding and developing technological advances ranging from supercomputing to hydraulic fracking , advanced prosthetics to lactose-free milk , LED lighting to MRI testing . The Trump budget represents an abrupt departure from this tradition , at a time when federal expenditures on R & D have already drooped to their lowest level as a share of the economy since the Russians launched Sputnik . This has innovation experts scratching their heads , since Trump ’ s entire budget depends on yet another departure from budget tradition , a blithe assumption of 3 percent annual growth . Mark Muro , policy director at the Brookings Institution ’ s metropolitan studies program , says that with America ’ s workforce shrinking , the clearest pathways to that kind of robust growth would be more immigration and more innovation—and Trump has made it clear he doesn ’ t want more immigration . But he doesn ’ t seem to think Uncle Sam can help make innovation happen , either .
“ There ’ s no conception in this budget of any positive role for government , ” Muro says . “ It ’ s totally out of step with everything we know about the innovation economy . I guess you could say that ’ s an innovation . ”
OBAMA FIRST UNVEILED his innovation agenda in a November 2007 speech at Google headquarters , calling for major investments in clean energy , digital technology , medical research , and basic science—as well as education reform , job training , and infrastructure , which he also categorized as innovation spending . Two years later , he was elected president during an economic meltdown , and quickly tucked a remarkable amount of that egghead agenda into his $ 800 billion stimulus bill , using public dollars to jump-start private industries that felt like the future .
For example , the stimulus poured billions of dollars into solar power , and while the highest-profile result was a busted loan to a manufacturer called Solyndra , other stimulus projects have helped increase U.S. solar generation by more than 3000 percent since 2009 . Similarly , the stimulus financed an entirely new domestic battery industry for electric vehicles , as well as a $ 465 million loan to rescue a failing automaker called Tesla ; more than 400,000 EV ’ s have been sold in America since 2009 , and Tesla is now the most valuable U.S. car company . Overall , the stimulus sparked the largest federal investment in innovation since the moon mission , including record funding for a smarter electric grid , factories producing clean energy components , digital health records , NIH research , and an out-of-the-box grant competition called TIGER for innovative transportation projects .
Obama kept banging the drum for innovation throughout his presidency , repeatedly calling on America to “ out-educate , out-innovate , and out-compete the rest of the world. ” On October 21 , 2015—also known as Back to the Future Day , because that ’ s the day Marty McFly time-traveled to in his cinematic DeLorean—Obama unveiled an ambitious agenda for future investments in growth areas like precision medicine , brain science , artificial intelligence , and educational technology . But the huge bump in innovation funding through the stimulus turned out to be a one-time bump . The Republicans who took back the House in 2011 consistently rejected Obama ’ s requests for more money , so federal R & D expenditures have stagnated , dipping to about half their 1980s levels as a share of GDP .
Now Trump is proposing to gut them , sending an unmistakable message about his priorities . He ’ s not interested in helping the geeks who carried signs poking fun of him at the March for Science .
“ Nobody has ever proposed cuts of this scale , ” says Matt Hourihan , who oversees R & D policy at the American Association for the Advancement of Science . “ Nobody has ever drawn this narrow a boundary around what government should be doing with basic science . It ’ s really a clean break with a bipartisan consensus . ”
The Trump budget would kill the loan program for fuel-efficient automakers that saved Tesla , as well as similar loans for “ innovative technologies ” in the green energy world . It would also kill TIGER , even though Trump ’ s transportation secretary , Elaine Chao , told Congress she would push to boost the program ’ s funding because it was working so well , and the AHRQ , even though its comparative effectiveness studies help save lives ( by highlighting safety measures like a checklist that reduced central line infections in hospitals ) and taxpayer dollars ( by exposing wasteful and ineffective surgeries , drugs , and medical devices ) . It would cut the Energy Department ’ s clean energy program by more than two thirds , and fossil energy by half . If you include education , job training and infrastructure in your innovation bucket , Trump ’ s budget cuts all of them as well , although he has promised a still-unspecified $ 1 trillion infrastructure program outside his budget .
As for R & D , the senior budget official told me the administration wants to shift the government focus from applied research towards early-stage experimentation that private firms tend to avoid , partly because they tend to focus on short-term earnings , partly because they worry that their competitors will end up reaping the benefits of their expensive research . But that doesn ’ t explain why the Trump wants to dismantle ARPA-E , which finances disruptive energy technologies in their earliest stages . Since 2009 , its grant recipients have gone on to raise more than $ 1 billion in private capital , for ideas ranging from easier-to-make silicon wafers for solar panels to laser-operated drill bits for oil wells . Bill Gates and other business leaders have described ARPA-E as a model for what government ought to be doing to help America compete in the 21st century “ Look , we had to make some tough choices , ” the official explained . “ We ’ re still going to have national labs . ”
The Trump budget also calls for a 70 percent cut in an Obama program called Manufacturing USA , which has partnered with industry and academia to finance early-stage research into growth areas like robotics , photonics , 3-D printing and lightweight materials at “ hubs ” in cities like Detroit , Knoxville , and Youngstown . And it would shut down the Manufacturing Extension Partnership , a $ 120-million-a-year program with offices providing technical assistance to small and medium-sized manufacturers in all 50 states . Atkinson said that Canada invests ten times as much in similar programs as a share of its GDP , while Germany invests 20 times as much and Japan 40 times as much—and they ’ ve lost less of their manufacturing base .
“ I thought reviving U.S. manufacturing was going to make America great again , ” says Rob Atkinson , president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation . “ These programs are already terribly underfunded , and they ’ re serving Trump ’ s voters . But this administration is under the ideological delusion that the government is always the problem . No other country acts like this . ”
Administration officials point out federal programs with noble goals and unobjectionable-sounding names are not necessarily effective , and they ’ ve got a point . The Manufacturing Extension Partnership ’ s offices in all 50 states , including states without much manufacturing , is hidden-in-plain-sight evidence that political considerations often drive funding decisions . It may seem odd that Trump wants to get rid of the Economic Development Administration , when he talks so much about economic development , and when the EDA specifically focuses on the depressed rural regions and smaller cities where so many Trump voters live . But a Government Accountability Office report found that every one of the agency ’ s 80 programs overlapped with some other federal program .
Andy Roth , a lobbyist at the conservative Club for Growth , said Trump and Mulvaney deserve credit for taking on the sacred cow of “ investment in innovation , ” because it ’ s really just a euphemism for corporate welfare . Roth argued that when government helps a company or an industry with basic research or applied research or anything else , it ’ s picking winners and losers , substituting the judgment of politicians and bureaucrats for the genius of the free market . Roth said the government should protect businesses from high taxes and intrusive regulations , but should otherwise leave innovation to the innovators in the private sector .
“ We don ’ t believe the government should be in the innovation business , ” Roth said . “ We ’ re thrilled that the Trump administration is getting rid of some of these programs , because there are a lot of stinkers out there . ”
But innovation experts say there ’ s voluminous evidence that the long-term benefits of these investments far outweigh the costs , and that cutting them is like eating seed corn . Atkinson estimates that Trump ’ s cuts would reduce GDP by $ 139 billion by 2027 . And some programs the administration portrayed as stinkers don ’ t really sound so awful . For example , the budget proposed to save $ 1.16 billion a year by axing the “ 21st Century Community Learning Centers ” after-school program for needy children , declaring “ performance data demonstrates the program is not achieving its goals. ” It cites evidence that “ student improvement in academic grades was limited , with states reporting higher math or English grades for less than half of regular program participants. ” But a program that helped nearly half its participants improve their grades sounds quite successful . On standardized tests , according to the budget , “ less than 20 percent of participants improved from ‘ not proficient ’ to ‘ proficient ’ or above. ” Again , that ’ s real improvement . Maybe it ’ s not enough improvement for $ 1.16 billion a year , but it ’ s pretty weak evidence of a boondoggle .
Republicans in Congress have already made it clear that much of Trump ’ s funding attack on innovation is dead on arrival . They won ’ t eliminate ARPA-E or TIGER . They won ’ t slash medical research at NIH or shred science at EPA . But advocates worry about the death of Washington ’ s innovation consensus . In the past , even though lawmakers didn ’ t always back up their R & D rhetoric with R & D funding , science and technology were treated like motherhood and apple pie , a kind of no-fly zone in the thick of Capitol Hill ’ s partisan bombardments . But in Trump ’ s Washington , norms cease to be norms , and anything can come under attack .
“ Government support for innovation is an American success story , and one of the few places of American consensus , ” Muro says . “ At least it used to be . ”","“Innovation” is one of those Washington priorities, like “security” or “the children,” that politicians in both parties tend to describe as investments rather than spending. Even as budget wars have raged on Capitol Hill, there’s been a fairly broad consensus that funding research and development is vital to American competitiveness. The Beltway seems to churn out an inexhaustible supply of bipartisan reports proclaiming that bigger government investments in science and technology today will pay economic dividends for taxpayers down the road.

This week has been “tech week” at the White House, and President Trump has jumped onto the rhetorical bandwagon, hailing the glories of innovation. “My administration is embracing a new spirit of innovation that will make life better for all Americans,” he told a group of technology leaders gathered in the Oval Office on Monday; he doubled down Thursday, promising another group of new-economy executives that his government would “help unleash technological breakthroughs that will transform our lives.”

But Trump’s 2018 budget goes the opposite direction: It proposes the deepest cuts in innovation investments that any administration has ever proposed.

Not only does the Trump budget slash climate science and clean energy research beloved by Trump’s critics, it whacks advanced manufacturing programs and fossil energy research catering to Trump’s supporters, as well as basic science and medical research beloved by almost everyone. It’s a powerful rejection of the innovation-industrial complex, and even though Congress is likely to ignore most of it, a similarly powerful reflection of Trump’s political war on Washington elites.

Overall, Trump’s budget cuts research and development spending by about 5 percent from current levels, but that figure includes hefty increases for late-stage weapons development at the Pentagon. It would roll back non-defense R&D by an unprecedented 19 percent, taking the axe to the popular as well as the obscure. The National Institutes of Health would absorb a 21.5 percent hit, including major cuts in research on aging, cancer, infectious disease, mental health, and drug abuse; NIH grant programs would have their stingiest award rates since 1970. There would be even harsher cuts for the Agricultural Research Service, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NASA’s education funding, NOAA’s ocean research, and EPA’s science office.

The Trump blueprint would also eliminate the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which oversees studies of which medical treatments actually work; the U.S. Geological Survey’s monitoring programs for volcanoes, earthquakes and the climate; and a popular Manufacturing Extension Partnership that provided technical assistance for more than 25,000 companies last year. And it would wipe out ARPA-E, the most futuristic agency in Washington, a cutting-edge incubator for energy research modeled on the high-tech Pentagon unit that pioneered GPS and the Internet.

Trump aides believe some federal investments in R&D have been duplicative or ineffective, while others ought to be handled by the private sector. And they’re still proposing $150 billion in R&D funding, which is considerably more than zero. But their main argument for spending less on innovation is simply that America can’t afford to spend more. Trump’s Office of Management and Budget director, Mick Mulvaney, is an ardent limited-government conservative, and the budget he crafted for Trump reflects his belief that Washington spends way too much of your money. Trump made it clear his top budget priorities are strengthening the military and securing the border, while somehow reducing deficits without raising taxes or cutting Medicare or Social Security for the elderly. Mulvaney had to shrink something—really, just about everything else—to try to check all those boxes.

“We wanted more for defense and the border, so we had to offset those increases somewhere,” one senior budget official explained. “We’re still making a big commitment to R&D. It’s just less than other administrations might make.”

In fact, even within Trump’s top government priorities, like the military and the border, innovation is getting a haircut. The American Association for the Advancement of Science calculated that Trump’s budget would squeeze the Pentagon’s science and technology spending by 5 percent, including an 18 percent cut for its “manufacturing innovation institutes.” The Department of Homeland Security’s science and technology budget would shrink by 20 percent, limiting research into cybersecurity, bioweapons defense, and border technologies.

There’s a political logic to Trump’s innovation policy heresies. Two thirds of R&D spending goes to blue states, and most of it tends to cluster in large cities and college towns rather than farm country or the Rust Belt, one reason these issues have more resonance for cosmopolitan technocrats than for Trump voters. President Obama talked about them incessantly, clamoring for aggressive investments in innovation to help America “win the future,” but Trump has attacked just about everything Obama was for, from health care reform to the Paris climate agreement. On the campaign trail, he never emphasized winning the future, just winning, and he never proposed any new innovation policies of note.

Trump did create a White House Office of American Innovation led by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and at his meeting with tech leaders he vowed that the office would help upgrade the federal government’s balky technology. But he did not suggest that it would help promote innovation in the private sector; he suggested that was the private sector’s job. In fact, one of the office’s main tasks will be shrinking and reorganizing the government, reflecting the belief of Mulvaney and other movement conservatives in the administration that the best thing government can do to spur innovation is to get out of the way of innovative businesses. In fact, during last year’s crisis over the Zika virus, as public health experts were racing to study its link to birth defects, Mulvaney asked a provocative question on Facebook: “Do we really need government-funded research at all?”

Historically, though, the U.S. government has played a vital role in seeding and developing technological advances ranging from supercomputing to hydraulic fracking, advanced prosthetics to lactose-free milk, LED lighting to MRI testing. The Trump budget represents an abrupt departure from this tradition, at a time when federal expenditures on R&D have already drooped to their lowest level as a share of the economy since the Russians launched Sputnik. This has innovation experts scratching their heads, since Trump’s entire budget depends on yet another departure from budget tradition, a blithe assumption of 3 percent annual growth. Mark Muro, policy director at the Brookings Institution’s metropolitan studies program, says that with America’s workforce shrinking, the clearest pathways to that kind of robust growth would be more immigration and more innovation—and Trump has made it clear he doesn’t want more immigration. But he doesn’t seem to think Uncle Sam can help make innovation happen, either.

“There’s no conception in this budget of any positive role for government,” Muro says. “It’s totally out of step with everything we know about the innovation economy. I guess you could say that’s an innovation.”

OBAMA FIRST UNVEILED his innovation agenda in a November 2007 speech at Google headquarters, calling for major investments in clean energy, digital technology, medical research, and basic science—as well as education reform, job training, and infrastructure, which he also categorized as innovation spending. Two years later, he was elected president during an economic meltdown, and quickly tucked a remarkable amount of that egghead agenda into his $800 billion stimulus bill, using public dollars to jump-start private industries that felt like the future.

For example, the stimulus poured billions of dollars into solar power, and while the highest-profile result was a busted loan to a manufacturer called Solyndra, other stimulus projects have helped increase U.S. solar generation by more than 3000 percent since 2009. Similarly, the stimulus financed an entirely new domestic battery industry for electric vehicles, as well as a $465 million loan to rescue a failing automaker called Tesla; more than 400,000 EV’s have been sold in America since 2009, and Tesla is now the most valuable U.S. car company. Overall, the stimulus sparked the largest federal investment in innovation since the moon mission, including record funding for a smarter electric grid, factories producing clean energy components, digital health records, NIH research, and an out-of-the-box grant competition called TIGER for innovative transportation projects.

Obama kept banging the drum for innovation throughout his presidency, repeatedly calling on America to “out-educate, out-innovate, and out-compete the rest of the world.” On October 21, 2015—also known as Back to the Future Day, because that’s the day Marty McFly time-traveled to in his cinematic DeLorean—Obama unveiled an ambitious agenda for future investments in growth areas like precision medicine, brain science, artificial intelligence, and educational technology. But the huge bump in innovation funding through the stimulus turned out to be a one-time bump. The Republicans who took back the House in 2011 consistently rejected Obama’s requests for more money, so federal R&D expenditures have stagnated, dipping to about half their 1980s levels as a share of GDP.

Now Trump is proposing to gut them, sending an unmistakable message about his priorities. He’s not interested in helping the geeks who carried signs poking fun of him at the March for Science.

“Nobody has ever proposed cuts of this scale,” says Matt Hourihan, who oversees R&D policy at the American Association for the Advancement of Science. “Nobody has ever drawn this narrow a boundary around what government should be doing with basic science. It’s really a clean break with a bipartisan consensus.”

The Trump budget would kill the loan program for fuel-efficient automakers that saved Tesla, as well as similar loans for “innovative technologies” in the green energy world. It would also kill TIGER, even though Trump’s transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, told Congress she would push to boost the program’s funding because it was working so well, and the AHRQ, even though its comparative effectiveness studies help save lives (by highlighting safety measures like a checklist that reduced central line infections in hospitals) and taxpayer dollars (by exposing wasteful and ineffective surgeries, drugs, and medical devices). It would cut the Energy Department’s clean energy program by more than two thirds, and fossil energy by half. If you include education, job training and infrastructure in your innovation bucket, Trump’s budget cuts all of them as well, although he has promised a still-unspecified $1 trillion infrastructure program outside his budget.

This is a completely different product.” The entire Facebook Trending News team was fired in 2016 following an investigation by Breitbart News which revealed an extreme level of bias from members of the team. A former Facebook employee stated that 90 percent of the Trending Topics team was liberal and that Breitbart News received extra scrutiny. The Trending Topics feature continued for some time, run solely by an algorithm.

As Breitbart News reported Wednesday:

Facebook removed an excerpt from the U.S. Declaration of Independence, claiming the text violated the social network’s policies on “hate speech.” The Liberty County Vindicator had been uploading the Declaration of Independence in parts to their Facebook page, only for the tenth part to be removed by the social network.

The following portion of text was excised by Facebook as constituting “hate speech”:

Casey Stinnett, managing editor of the Liberty County Vindicator, suspects the term “Indian Savages” might have triggered Facebook’s “filtering program.” He said the censorship was an “automated action.”

Russia has successfully tested a country-wide alternative to the global internet, its government has announced.

Details of what the test involved were vague but, according to the Ministry of Communications, ordinary users did not notice any changes.

The results will now be presented to President Putin.

Experts remain concerned about the trend for some countries to dismantle the internet.

""Sadly, the Russian direction of travel is just another step in the increasing breaking-up of the internet,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at the University of Surrey.

""Increasingly, authoritarian countries which want to control what citizens see are looking at what Iran and China have already done.

""It means people will not have access to dialogue about what is going on in their own country, they will be kept within their own bubble.""

How would a domestic internet work?

The initiative involves restricting the points at which Russia's version of the net connects to its global counterpart, giving the government more control over what its citizens can access.

""That would effectively get ISPs [internet service providers] and telcos to configure the internet within their borders as a gigantic intranet, just like a large corporation does,"" explained Prof Woodward.

So how would the government establish what some have dubbed a ""sovereign Runet""?

Countries receive foreign web services via undersea cables or ""nodes"" - connection points at which data is transmitted to and from other countries' communication networks. These would need to be blocked or at least regulated.

This would require the co-operation of domestic ISPs and would be much easier to achieve if there were just a handful of state-owned firms involved. The more networks and connections a country has, the more difficult it is to control access.

Then Russia would need to create an alternative system.

In Iran, the National Information Network allows access to web services while policing all content on the network and limiting external information. It is run by the state-owned Telecommunication Company of Iran.

One of the benefits of effectively turning all internet access into a government-controlled walled garden, is that virtual private networks (VPNs), often used to circumvent blocks, would not work.

Another example of this is the so-called Great Firewall of China. It blocks access to many foreign internet services, which in turn has helped several domestic tech giants establish themselves.

Russia already tech champions of its own, such as Yandex and Mail.Ru, but other local firms might also benefit.

The country plans to create its own Wikipedia and politicians have passed a bill that bans the sale of smartphones that do not have Russian software pre-installed.

Technical challenges

One expert warned that the policy could help the state repress free speech, but added that it was not a foregone conclusion that it would succeed.

""The Russian government has run into technical challenges in the past when trying to increase online control, such as its largely unsuccessful efforts to block Russians from accessing encrypted messaging app Telegram,"" Justin Sherman, a cyber-security policy fellow at the New America think tank, told the BBC.

""Without more information about this test though, it's hard to assess exactly how far Russia has progressed in the path towards an isolatable domestic internet.

""And on the business front, it remains to be seen just how much domestic and foreign pushback Russia will get.""

""The results of the exercises showed that, in general, both the authorities and telecoms operators are ready to effectively respond to emerging risks and threats, to ensure the stable functioning of both the internet and unified telecommunication network in the Russian Federation,"" said Alexey Sokolov.
