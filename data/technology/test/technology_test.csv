Scientists discover a new adorable mammal called the olinguito

Asteroids pass by, and a meteor explodes over Russia

It has been a thrilling year of discovery in many areas of science, but also a sobering time -- federal funding cuts threaten the future of innovation, and rising carbon dioxide levels foreshadow environmental and health challenges linked to climate change.

This was the year we learned that Mars was habitable billions of years ago, and also that Lady Gaga reportedly intends to be the first artist to sing in outer space in 2015 (will the papa-paparazzi follow?).

Let's take a spin around some of the major science stories from 2013:

Mars is the word

Meanwhile, a company called Mars One announced its intentions to land four lucky astronauts on Mars in 2025 to begin the first human colonies there. The technology doesn't exist yet to bring anyone back, the company said, so whoever goes will have to stay. More than 200,000 prospective astronauts found this idea attractive enough to apply

Elsewhere in space

Further afield, one of the biggest space milestones of the year was the crossing of Voyager 1 out of the solar system . There's no border crossing agent out there, so scientists had to figure out on their own whether the probe had truly entered uncharted territory.

The probe, which launched with its twin, Voyager 2, in 1977, made history as the first human-made object to leave the heliosphere, the magnetic boundary separating the solar system's sun, planets and solar wind from the rest of the galaxy.

Probing the world of ancient humans

We're also learning more about the world of our ancient relatives, although there's not enough information to use the word ""ancestor.""

A remarkable find in Dmanisi, Georgia , gave us the most complete skull ever of an individual from the early Homo genus. It is the fifth example of an ancient hominid, a bipedal primate mammal that walked upright, at this site.

Sequester, shutdown suck money out of science

It takes funding to do scientific research, and it's a big problem when the stream stops. The one-two punch of $85 billion in forced spending cuts and a federal government shutdown bit deeply into American science in 2013.

Fun with physics

It doesn't look as cool as Harry Potter's invisibility cloak, but this is real science, not movie magic.

But science is still moving forward, sometimes even toward what looks like science fiction.

Physicists said they had taken a step in the direction of making an invisibility cloak , albeit a small step. Their method can make objects ""invisible"" within a limited range of light waves -- specifically, microwaves.

This is a smart argument . Indeed , I believed it a couple of years ago . The problem is that it 's a couple of years out of date . If regulators were going to try to shut down the Bitcoin network , they needed to do it in 2012 or 2013 , not 2015 .
In early 2013 , Bitcoin was best known as the payment system used by the drug marketplace Silk Road . It would n't have been surprising if federal officials had taken a hostile stance toward the system . But a savvy lobbying campaign from Bitcoin supporters convinced the feds that the smart play was to make peace with Bitcoin rather than to fight it .
Advocates ' argument was simple : Bitcoin was so decentralized and globalized that it would be impossible to drive it out of existence . Even if it was suppressed in the US , the network would continue operating overseas . Americans could use anonymizing technologies like Tor to access it . But if US officials tried to stamp it out , they 'd destroy legitimate Bitcoin businesses and with them any influence over how the Bitcoin economy evolved . In particular , they 'd lose the ability to subpoena the records of Bitcoin companies to help them trace Bitcoin transactions .
Regulators seem to have bought this argument . When the Senate held hearings on Bitcoin in November 2013 , they were lovefests , with key regulators emphasizing the need to accommodate legitimate Bitcoin applications , even as they cracked down on illegal uses . Sen. Tom Carper , who chaired one of the hearings , drew an explicit parallel to the early internet . `` Innovation is a very important part of our economy , '' said Jennifer Calvery , the woman who enforces the nation 's money laundering laws .

And remember , this hearing happened after federal officials seized assets belonging to Mt . Gox , which was then the leading Bitcoin exchange and would later declare bankruptcy . It was mere weeks after the feds shut down the Bitcoin-based drug marketplace Silk Road . In short , the feds at that point were under no illusions that the technology would only be used for legitimate purposes .
Farrell argues that the government 's attitude will change if Bitcoin ever becomes popular enough to pose a real threat to conventional , regulated financial networks . But I think that gets things backwards . Bitcoin will only grow enough to be economically significant if a lot of legitimate businesses start to rely on it .

Bitcoin already has more powerful allies than it did two years ago . In 2014 alone , dozens of Bitcoin startups have raised money . Their backers are n't going to stand idly by while the government destroys their investments . For example , influential pro-Bitcoin venture capitalists , including Marc Andreessen and Fred Wilson , have pooled their resources to create a new Bitcoin advocacy organization called the Coin Center .
And of course the arguments that persuaded regulators in 2013 are still true . The Bitcoin network probably ca n't be shut down ; it can only be driven underground . Doing so wo n't prevent serious criminals from using it , but it will make it harder for law enforcement to track down people using the network . And Bitcoin has good applications as well as bad ones . After going before Congress and endorsing these arguments last year , it would be awkward for regulators to do an about-face and declare war on the technology .
In short , if the regulators were going to try to shut down Bitcoin , they would have done it two years ago when it was still a fringe technology with no real support among elites . Now it 's too late .","I'm a Bitcoin optimist. Henry Farrell isn't. In an astute post, he argues that the big threat to Bitcoin's long-term viability comes from government regulation.

For example, influential pro-Bitcoin venture capitalists, including Marc Andreessen and Fred Wilson, have pooled their resources to create a new Bitcoin advocacy organization called the Coin Center.

And of course the arguments that persuaded regulators in 2013 are still true. The Bitcoin network probably can't be shut down; it can only be driven underground. Doing so won't prevent serious criminals from using it, but it will make it harder for law enforcement to track down people using the network. And Bitcoin has good applications as well as bad ones. After going before Congress and endorsing these arguments last year, it would be awkward for regulators to do an about-face and declare war on the technology.

In short, if the regulators were going to try to shut down Bitcoin, they would have done it two years ago when it was still a fringe technology with no real support among elites. Now it's too late.",www.vox.com,left,UINkmzkakAYOAJDn

Election season is in full swing, and Americans have already begun to cast their votes in the 2020 presidential primaries. As we exercise this precious right, we must be mindful that foreign interference and malign influence in our elections are still threats to our democracy.

Combating these threats requires a whole-of-society approach that deserves the attention of all Americans. While these threats to our elections are perennial, our efforts to defend our democracy are unwavering. As leaders of our government, we are committed to defending our democracy, but we need your help, too.

Safeguarding the sanctity of your vote is paramount. States have made significant progress since 2016, but as long as the threat remains, there is work to be done. We have yet to identify any activity designed to prevent voting or change votes. However, we remain watchful of any malicious activities from cybercriminals and from foreign actors like Russia, China and Iran.

The states' autonomy over elections makes our elections more resilient. The diversity of election systems among the states, multiple checks and redundancies in those systems, and post-election auditing all make it extraordinarily difficult for foreign adversaries to disrupt or change vote tallies.

States have plans in place, like provisional ballots, to enable a reliable election to proceed in the case that interference does occur. While the states have primary responsibility for administering elections under our Constitution, our agencies continue to provide them with support by identifying best practices for voting systems, sharing threat information and offering services and resources.

Several of our agencies are working directly with campaigns and candidates to educate them about ways to help keep their networks secure. We are mobilized and working with states to identify cybersecurity threats to their own systems and to campaigns, and we are better able to warn them about threats today than ever before.

You can play an important role, too:

►First, you can participate in the process. All Americans should be undeterred by concerns of attempted foreign interference and have full confidence that a vote cast is a vote counted. The best way to understand how your elections are secured is to engage with your state and local officials, or to volunteer to serve as a poll worker and help support the election process yourself. Don’t fall prey to disinformation about your election — such as when, where or how to vote — from untrusted sources. State and local government websites are the authoritative sources for this information.

►Second, we encourage candidates, election officials, technology companies and others involved in elections to report suspicious cyber activity to us. The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency have set up election-focused websites that host additional information about election security and provide avenues to report concerns.

►Third, an informed and discerning public is a resilient public. As consumers of all types of media, you can help separate facts from falsehoods by seeking trustworthy sources for information and by evaluating what you read or watch with a critical eye. Some foreign governments have a track record of meddling in our affairs by attempting to shape public opinion and voter perceptions. Foreign actors have done this by hacking and dumping private campaign and candidate information on the internet and spreading disinformation and divisive messages on social media.

Often, we see foreign adversaries amplifying messages some Americans create and share with each other, in an effort to stoke hostility among us and make us appear more divided than we are. They seek to undermine our trust and confidence in each other, our democratic society and democracy itself.

To combat this threat, we continue to strengthen partnerships with technology and social media companies and share more information than ever before. Those companies are taking more responsibility for preventing foreign adversaries from weaponizing their platforms. Additionally, we must remain aware that foreign adversaries continue to spread disinformation to discredit politicians and views that are counter to their interests and ambitions.

We cannot prevent all disinformation, foreign propaganda or cyberattacks on our infrastructure. However, together, we can all help to mitigate these threats by exercising care when we share information and by maintaining good cyber hygiene to reduce the risks that malicious cyberattacks will succeed.

We can all play a role in sustaining our democracy and securing our elections from foreign interference. Americans can rest assured that our agencies’ efforts to defend our republic are unwavering, and we will work diligently to secure our elections, both in 2020 and beyond.

technology,Time Magazine,0,http://time.com/5233296/mark-zuckerberg-congress-hearing-facebook-russia/,Mark Zuckerberg's Congressional Testimony Will Mark a Stunning Reversal for the Facebook CEO,,Nash Jenkins,"Facebook founder and chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg will strike an apologetic tone when he appears before Congress this week , expressing contrition for the website ’ s oversight of user data and its role in the 2016 election .
In testimony at a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees on Tuesday and before a House committee on Wednesday , the famously aloof social media executive will take responsibility for failing to handle its civic duties with more care .
“ It ’ s clear now that we didn ’ t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm … That goes for fake news , foreign interference in elections , and hate speech , as well as developers and data privacy , ” he will say , according to advance testimony to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce released Monday . “ We didn ’ t take a broad enough view of our responsibility , and that was a big mistake . It was my mistake , and I ’ m sorry . I started Facebook , I run it , and I ’ m responsible for what happens here . ”
The hearings come several weeks after it was reported that Cambridge Analytica , a data-mining firm linked to President Donald Trump ’ s 2016 presidential campaign , had improperly stored the private information of tens of millions of users .
The Cambridge Analytica scandal is only the latest to besiege the social media giant in the wake of the 2016 presidential election . Last fall , a senior Facebook executive ( alongside representatives from Google and Twitter ) admitted before a congressional hearing that Russian actors had exploited advertising and networking social media tools to “ sow division and discord ” in the American political conversation both before and after the 2016 election .
Zuckerberg has since faced loud and widespread public criticism , while Facebook ’ s stock has plunged .
In his remarks before Congress , Zuckerberg is expected to explain the conditions that allowed Cambridge Analytica to exploit private data and detail how Facebook plans to prevent similar breaches in the future .
In the written testimony submitted ahead of Wednesday ’ s House hearing , Zuckerberg explained that in 2013 , a Cambridge University researcher launched a personality quiz on Facebook that drew on the personal information of the roughly 300,000 users who installed it and millions more of their friends . Zuckerberg stressed that it was only a year later , in 2014 , that the company revised its privacy policy to prevent Facebook applications from accessing this data , but by that point , the damage was done : the researcher , Aleksandr Kogan , had already shared the lode of information with Cambridge Analytica .
“ We have a responsibility to make sure what happened with Kogan and Cambridge Analytica doesn ’ t happen again , ” Zuckerberg writes in the testimony . “ We need to make sure that developers like Kogan who got access to a lot of information in the past can ’ t get access to as much information going forward . ”
In the testimony , Zuckerberg articulates what those remedial strategies might look like . “ We ’ re removing developers ’ access to your data if you haven ’ t used their app in three months , ” he writes . “ We ’ re reducing the data you give an app when you approve it to only your name , profile photo , and email address .

“ I started Facebook when I was in college . We ’ ve come a long way since then , ” Zuckerberg writes in his prepared testimony . “ We now serve more than 2 billion people around the world , and every day , people use our services to stay connected with the people that matter to them most . I believe deeply in what we ’ re doing . And when we address these challenges , I know we ’ ll look back and view helping people connect and giving more people a voice as a positive force in the world . ”","Facebook founder and chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg will strike an apologetic tone when he appears before Congress this week, expressing contrition for the website’s oversight of user data and its role in the 2016 election.

In testimony at a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees on Tuesday and before a House committee on Wednesday, the famously aloof social media executive will take responsibility for failing to handle its civic duties with more care.

“It’s clear now that we didn’t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm … That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy,” he will say, according to advance testimony to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce released Monday. “We didn’t take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake. It was my mistake, and I’m sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I’m responsible for what happens here.”

The hearings come several weeks after it was reported that Cambridge Analytica, a data-mining firm linked to President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, had improperly stored the private information of tens of millions of users.

The Cambridge Analytica scandal is only the latest to besiege the social media giant in the wake of the 2016 presidential election. Last fall, a senior Facebook executive (alongside representatives from Google and Twitter) admitted before a congressional hearing that Russian actors had exploited advertising and networking social media tools to “sow division and discord” in the American political conversation both before and after the 2016 election.

Zuckerberg has since faced loud and widespread public criticism, while Facebook’s stock has plunged.

In his remarks before Congress, Zuckerberg is expected to explain the conditions that allowed Cambridge Analytica to exploit private data and detail how Facebook plans to prevent similar breaches in the future.

In the written testimony submitted ahead of Wednesday’s House hearing, Zuckerberg explained that in 2013, a Cambridge University researcher launched a personality quiz on Facebook that drew on the personal information of the roughly 300,000 users who installed it and millions more of their friends. Zuckerberg stressed that it was only a year later, in 2014, that the company revised its privacy policy to prevent Facebook applications from accessing this data, but by that point, the damage was done: the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, had already shared the lode of information with Cambridge Analytica.

“We have a responsibility to make sure what happened with Kogan and Cambridge Analytica doesn’t happen again,” Zuckerberg writes in the testimony. “We need to make sure that developers like Kogan who got access to a lot of information in the past can’t get access to as much information going forward.”

In the testimony, Zuckerberg articulates what those remedial strategies might look like. “We’re removing developers’ access to your data if you haven’t used their app in three months,” he writes. “We’re reducing the data you give an app when you approve it to only your name, profile photo, and email address. That’s a lot less than apps can get on any other major app platform.”

The discussions on how to best regulate tech giants began with a Zuckerberg-Macron meeting last year , followed by a report on tech regulation last month that Facebook 's founder considered could be a blueprint for wider EU regulation .
Facebook had refrained from handing over identification data of people suspected of hate speech because it was not compelled to do so under U.S.-French legal conventions and because it was worried countries without an independent judiciary could abuse it .
France 's parliament , where Macron 's ruling party has a comfortable majority , is debating legislation that would give the new regulator the power to fine tech companies up to 4 % of their global revenue if they do n't do enough to remove hateful content from their network .

Facebook had refrained from handing over identification data of people suspected of hate speech because it was not compelled to do so under U.S.-French legal conventions and because it was worried countries without an independent judiciary could abuse it.

France's parliament, where Macron's ruling party has a comfortable majority, is debating legislation that would give the new regulator the power to fine tech companies up to 4% of their global revenue if they don't do enough to remove hateful content from their network.

O also signalled his openness to seeing French startups being snapped up by larger U.S. companies, in a spite of recent measures taken by Macron's government to bolster anti-takeover rules to protect the country's strategic companies.

'My only goal is to spur the creation of a lot of companies,' he said. 'I have no problem with the fact that some of them are bought by U.S. companies, as long as they don't have critical technology.'

The minister is also reluctant to support the idea of breaking up companies like Facebook or Google, whose size, weight on the Internet and financial firepower have turned them into systemic players just as much as big banks.

Facebook has been called a social media monopoly by co-founder Chris Hughes, and calls for a break-up of the group have intensified.

'We cannot impose very tough obligations on Western companies and dismantle them because they are very big, and not do the same thing with Chinese companies that enter the Western market,' he said, referring to groups like Alibaba and Tencent.

A graduate of France's top business school, HEC, O combines political experience - he was an aide to Dominique Strauss-Khan, like many of the tight group of 'Macron Boys' who propelled him to power - and a stint in the private sector, at engine maker Safran.

At the Elysee, he was in charge of advising Macron on the French government's vast portfolio of stakes in French companies, having to deal with hot corporate sagas such as Renault-Nissan, as well as handling relations with Big Tech.",www.dailymail.co.uk,right,92OEBp2fnja9R8YA

Google and Facebook are looking to make an early imprint on legislation being drafted in the House and Senate that would force them and other online networks to disclose information about the buyers of political ads.

Lobbyists from the Silicon Valley behemoths have met with the staffs of Sens. Mark Warner and Amy Klobuchar and Rep. Derek Kilmer, all of whom are drawing up bills that would impose new regulations on the industry, according to Democratic aides and company representatives. The Senate bill is expected to be formally introduced next week. It is not clear when the House legislation, which has not been previously reported, will be introduced.

Facebook has talked with those working on the bill, a company source confirmed, characterizing Facebook as willing to continue discussing it as the process moves along. A spokesperson for Google declined to comment.

The companies are keen to show steps they've taken to police themselves when it comes to monitoring and disclosing the ads on their sites, efforts that could be used to fend off heavy-handed regulation as investigations into Russian interference in the election bring unprecedented scrutiny on their businesses. This week, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg flew to D.C. for a whirlwind of meetings with lawmakers to contain the fallout.

A Democratic Senate aide said Facebook has tried to make Hill staff well aware of efforts it's making on its own toward ad transparency and self-regulation — measures put in place as news of 3,000 Russia-linked ads was disclosed to congressional investigators — but that the company is not surprised a bill is in the works.

""This is an important issue that deserves attention, and we are engaging with legislators and other stakeholders on finding a solution,"" said Noah Theran, a spokesman for the Internet Association, whose members include Google, Facebook, Snap and Twitter.

The Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group with more than 600 members, has also been meeting with lawmakers. Dave Grimaldi, IAB's executive vice president for public policy, said self-regulation can be ""vastly more meaningful and more powerful"" than legislation, adding that the online advertising industry has a track record of self-imposed transparency.

Nevertheless, Grimaldi said it is important for IAB to hear lawmakers' concerns and help ensure proposed legislation does not negatively affect smaller advertising platforms. ""Until we figure out exactly what the words on the page will be, we remain ready and eager to help,"" he said.

Greater disclosure requirements for online advertising platforms could be among the tangible impacts of the scandal surrounding Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. Revelations from Google, Facebook and Twitter that their ad networks were used to help sway the race’s outcome have brought the lack of oversight into sharper focus, drawing ire from both Republicans and Democrats.

Most online political ads are not subject to the same disclosure requirements as television ads — which must name who paid for them and whether they’re authorized by a candidate. Yet social networks like Google, Facebook and Twitter, each with many millions of users across the country, have a much longer reach than any television station or cable channel. Many of the social media ads purchased during the election were placed to stoke social tensions rather than endorse a specific candidate.

Warner and Klobuchar were among the first to call for legislation on the matter. The pair penned a letter in September seeking co-sponsors on prospective legislation and they're currently on the hunt for a Republican to back to the bill so they can promote is as bipartisan legislation. The Democratic Hill aide said staff is pitching the bill as a solution to a national security threat and not a significant change to campaign finance laws, and they anticipate Republican pushback if it is framed as a campaign finance issue.

Original thresholds outlined in the Warner-Klobuchar letter, such as the amount of money an entity must spend on online ads to be subject to public disclosure, have changed in the past weeks after conversations with industry and pro-transparency groups, the aide said.

Republicans have historically opposed regulating political speech, but some now appear open to new rules amid pressure to act against Russian influence before the 2018 midterm elections. Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and James Lankford (R-Okla.), who both sit on the Intelligence Committee where Warner is the top Democrat, said in interviews with POLITICO in recent weeks that they’re looking at the proposal he and Klobuchar have crafted.

“We’re talking it through,” Lankford said in an interview, underscoring that he has “not determined yet what I’m going to do.”

Collins said she wants to wait until the intelligence panel hears from Facebook, Twitter and potentially Google at a public hearing Nov. 1 before making a final decision.",www.politico.com,left,pjRkkb2c89NLW4o2

The call shows how Silicon Valley millionaires , who have been coddled by the press and lauded as innovators and disruptors , fundamentally misunderstand the role of journalism the moment it turns a critical eye to their industry . It also suggests they ’ re eager to find new ways to hit back at what they see as unfavorable and unfair press coverage .
Motherboard obtained a recording of the conversation , which took place on Clubhouse , an app which as of late May had just 1,500 users . The app was valued at $ 100 million after a reported $ 12 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz , and requires an invite to join . In May , New York Times internet culture reporter Taylor Lorenz wrote that the app is `` where venture capitalists have gathered to mingle with one another while they are quarantined in their homes . ''
`` Sometimes there is a tarot card reader critiquing a member ’ s Instagram account ; sometimes it is a dating advice show ; sometimes bored people sound off about anything that pops into their mind , '' she wrote .
On Wednesday night , the topic of conversation was Lorenz herself , who had been listening earlier in the conversation but left partway through . After she left , the participants began discussing whether Lorenz was playing `` the woman card '' when speaking out about her harassment following a Twitter altercation with Srinivasan .
`` You ca n't fucking hit somebody , attack them and just say , 'Hey , I have ovaries and therefore , you ca n't fight back , ' '' Felicia Horowitz , founder of the Horowitz Family Foundation and wife of Andreessen Horowitz cofounder Ben Horowitz , said .
In recent days Lorenz , who criticized luggage startup Away co-CEO Steph Korey on Twitter Wednesday , has been harassed and impersonated on Twitter .
On the call , Srinivasan suggested that Lorenz—who earlier in the day had accused him on Twitter of `` constantly trying to destroy my career on the internet and in private '' —was overreacting and that she was perhaps scared of him , and that this was why she left the conversation that night on Clubhouse .
`` Is Taylor afraid of a brown man on the street ? Then she should n't be afraid of a brown man in Clubhouse , '' Srinivasan said . `` I have literally done nothing other than one previous tweet . Number one , right ? So the whole , you know , talking about tweeting as you know , harassment—completely illegitimate , completely wrong , completely fabricated and just false . ''
The audio chat had spiraled wildly out of control from a broader conversation earlier in the call about the state of journalism and what VCs should do to receive better coverage . Srinivasan , formerly a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz , claimed that `` the entire tech press was complicit in covering up the threat of COVID-19 , '' and claimed that relying on the press is `` outsourcing your information supply chain to folks who are disaligned with you , '' comparable to the United States having outsourced its medical supply chain . He proposed that the approaches to truth and accountability offered by GitHub , venture capital funding , and cryptocurrency all offer better models for journalism than `` the East Coast model of 'Respect my authori-tay . ' ''
When asked for comment about the Clubhouse chat , Srinivasan screenshotted our request and tweeted about it .
`` When it comes to our industry , there ’ s a really , really toxic dynamic that exists right now , '' Nait Jones , an Andreessen Horowitz VC , said on the call while speaking about recent reports about abuse in the tech industry . `` Because those stories were so popular and drove so much traffic , they also created a market for more of those stories . They created a pressure on many reporters to find the next one of those stories inside of a fast growing tech company because those stories play very well on Twitter , especially around protecting vulnerable people . ''
( In 2020 , the idea that fishing for “ clicks ” to drive ad revenue is a successful or even common business model is a fallacy . Publications that rely exclusively on advertising are failing at an astonishing rate ; financially , many journalistic outlets are increasingly moving away from an ad-based revenue model driven by traffic , and instead focus on live events , subscriptions , optioning their articles to movie studios , and other models that rely on having a dedicated readership that trusts the publication ) .
The exclusive users of Clubhouse on the call seemed to conceive of themselves as humble citizens preyed upon by corrupted elites cravenly lusting after money and power ; this reached a bizarre apogee when Srinivasan boasted of standing up for the CEO of a scandal-plagued luggage brand , depicting her as all but powerless because of her relatively low Twitter follower count . The conversation essentially resembled a Gamergate chat , with people obsessing over minute drama and , at times , suggesting that Lorenz had crossed a line on Twitter and must be punished .
`` How can there be an accountability function that 's implementable across all media that allows for that to happen , that pushback to happen without it being turned around and can become some toxic thing where all types of power dynamics are being used , and people have their weapons out , '' Jones said .
`` Her employer should be saying , you cross the line with your editorial comments , '' Martin said , adding that `` If I 'm [ Srinivasan ] , the argument that I would make to her bosses is you should be instructing your reporters not to be making editorial judgments about someone . Stick to reporting . ''
“ Taylor is an excellent reporter doing incredibly relevant reporting for this moment . She , and all reporters , should be able to do their jobs without facing harassment , ” Choire Sicha , editor of the NYTimes Styles desk , told Motherboard in an email .
Clubhouse founders Rothan Seth and Paul Davison did n't respond to a request for comment . Jones did not respond to a request for comment . Andreessen Horowitz declined to comment .
The conversation was set off by a series of exhausting , insidery events from the last two weeks . Some in the Silicon Valley set turned their sights on the Times after Scott Alexander , a psychiatrist who ran the philosophy blog SlateStarCodex , deleted the entire blog because he said the Times was going to `` dox '' him by publishing his real name in an upcoming story . ( It is worth noting that Alexander has republished SlateStarCodex blogs in books using his full name . ) This event resurfaced an ongoing and tedious discussion among venture capitalist types about journalism ethics , business models , and publishing incentives .
Wednesday , Korey , the co-CEO of Away , a direct to consumer luggage brand that was the subject of an expose in The Verge last year , published a series of Instagram Story posts in which she suggested that she was unfairly targeted by The Verge in part because she is a woman . She also said that journalists should be easier to sue , and suggested that the main thing driving journalism is `` clicks . '' The Verge story focused on a culture of abuse at Away under Korey 's leadership ; workers there said they were prevented from taking vacation , were banned from emailing each other , and worked extremely long hours .
While Korey ’ s Instagram comments were a supposed critique of the journalism industry , they looked at times a lot more like a claim that The Verge story was unfair or inaccurate in ways she didn ’ t actually address .
After Korey posted her stories on Instagram , a number of journalists commented on them , including Lorenz , who tweeted `` Steph Korey , the disgraced former CEO of Away luggage company , is ranting on IG stories about the media . Her posts are incoherent and it ’ s disappointing to see a woman who ran a luggage brand perpetuate falsehoods like this abt an industry she clearly has 0 understanding of . ''
Lorenz 's tweet was immediately tweeted about by several Silicon Valley venture capitalists , most notably Srinivasan , who eventually made a seven-tweet thread in which he suggested Lorenz , and journalists like her , are `` sociopaths . ''
That same day , a self-described Taylor Lorenz `` parody '' Twitter account started retweeting Srinivasan and other tech investors and executives critical of her work . The account 's bio also links to a website , also self-described as parody , which is dedicated to harassing Lorenz . ( Twitter told Motherboard it deleted another account for impersonating Lorenz . )
Yesterday Lorenz called out Srinivasan on Twitter by tagging him and asked his friends , like Andreessen Horowitz co-founder Ben Horowitz , to help end the conflict , which eventually continued on Clubhouse .
In Korey 's analysis , exposing the conditions of workers is clickbait designed to attract eyeballs ; she also argued that female founders were more likely to be attacked , especially by young female reporters . The story about Korey ’ s alleged misconduct was written by a young reporter named Zoe Schiffer . Korey added a few minutes later that she ’ d gotten word her comments were filtering through to Twitter , and wrote , in part , “ I believe the overwhelming majority of young female reporters are truly excellent . It has been the case that the female-founder takedowns tend to be written by young women , but I do not think they represent the whole demographic whatsoever . ”
Korey ’ s avid defenders in the Clubhouse conversation agreed with that analysis .
“ The coverage seems to be so one-sided around the people running the companies , ” one person on the call whom Motherboard could not immediately identify complained . “ They 're all abusers , they 're all trying to get rich . It 's just down , down , down . It 's almost depressing to watch , as someone who 's an advocate for building things . It 's hard to watch the coverage , it 's almost anti-building things ... The whole entire DNA of Silicon Valley has been optimism from day one . ''
Articles like the Verge 's investigation into Away do not appear out of thin air . People who work at tech companies—often burdened with non-disclosure agreements—take risks to discuss labor conditions at their company . At the time the Verge article was published , Korey apologized . Wednesday , she was suggesting she 'd been unfairly targeted , and that `` a few who are using the media platform they have access to further their careers by knowingly misrepresenting female founders for clicks & their own profile/fame . ''
`` I spoke up for her because she had , you know , 8,000 followers , and she was being attacked by a New York Times reporter as a disgraced former CEO and she 's actually still , you know , current co-CEO , '' Srinivasan said . `` I believe in standing up for those people who do n't have a voice , who can not stand up for themselves . ''
Lost in the shuffle are the employees who say this apparently powerless CEO still presides over a broken company . Thursday afternoon , a coalition of Away employees emailed Away 's leadership to say that `` Steph 's Comments Are Hurting Us . ''
We “ have been hurt and left deflated by Steph Korey ’ s recent action on Instagram and Twitter , '' they wrote in the email , which was obtained by Motherboard and was acknowledged by Away 's cofounder Jen Rubio . `` We are writing to you as the employees of Away and asking that something is done to address the story that is building around Steph 's Instagram and Twitter comments over the last several days .
Steph has been largely absent during this health pandemic , the company 's layoffs and the civil unrest surrounding Black Lives Matter . This made sense . She was on mat leave and taking time to focus on her personal life over her professional one . This is why her social media activity over the last few days has been so surprising and frankly hurtful as employees of this company . ''
Korey and Away 's cofounders did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
In response to a request for comment from Motherboard , Away 's ███ president of communications and corporate affairs shared two screenshots . The first was an email from Jen Rubio , Away 's co-founder , president , and Chief Brand Officer , addressed to the employees who had complained about Korey 's comments . ( The email comes from Rubio 's email account ; it 's also cosigned by Stuart Haselden , the company 's co-CEO ) .
Rubio wrote that Korey 's comments `` do not reflect or affect our current company priorities and the deep work we 're doing about diversity , equity and inclusion . '' The email also stated that Stuart Haselden will take on the role of sole CEO at Away in 2020 , and that Korey has updated her social media profiles to state that her views are her own .
In her own Slack response , Korey wrote : `` I understand that I have a responsibility as co-founder and co-CEO to commit to using my personal platforms to support our priorities , not distract by them . '' She apologized to `` anyone I hurt by shifting the focus away from these important cultural moments this past week , '' referring to the Black Lives Matter movement and the company 's stated commitment to `` Diversity , Equity and Inclusion , '' as Korey put it . Both statements say Away 's priority is `` becoming an anti-racist company .

The Verge story focused on a culture of abuse at Away under Korey's leadership; workers there said they were prevented from taking vacation, were banned from emailing each other, and worked extremely long hours.

“The incentive isn’t to report what’s happening,” Korey wrote. “It’s to write things that will be shared by people on social media. And several of these digital-only outlets have nearly nonexistent editorial standards (especially the click baity-y ones, you know who they are). Side note: I could write a whole separate essay about how defamation lawsuits should be easier to pursue now that misrepresentation *is* the business model of some of these outlets.” (In the aftermath of The Verge's story, Korey announced she’d hired the well-known defamation firm Clare Locke LLP, which has made a business out of getting unflattering stories stalled or killed.)

While Korey’s Instagram comments were a supposed critique of the journalism industry, they looked at times a lot more like a claim that The Verge story was unfair or inaccurate in ways she didn’t actually address.

People who work at tech companies—often burdened with non-disclosure agreements—take risks to discuss labor conditions at their company. At the time the Verge article was published, Korey apologized. Wednesday, she was suggesting she'd been unfairly targeted, and that ""a few who are using the media platform they have access to further their careers by knowingly misrepresenting female founders for clicks & their own profile/fame.""

""I spoke up for her because she had, you know, 8,000 followers, and she was being attacked by a New York Times reporter as a disgraced former CEO and she's actually still, you know, current co-CEO,"" Srinivasan said. ""I believe in standing up for those people who don't have a voice, who cannot stand up for themselves.""

Lost in the shuffle are the employees who say this apparently powerless CEO still presides over a broken company. Thursday afternoon, a coalition of Away employees emailed Away's leadership to say that ""Steph's Comments Are Hurting Us.""

We “have been hurt and left deflated by Steph Korey’s recent action on Instagram and Twitter,"" they wrote in the email, which was obtained by Motherboard and was acknowledged by Away's cofounder Jen Rubio. ""We are writing to you as the employees of Away and asking that something is done to address the story that is building around Steph's Instagram and Twitter comments over the last several days.

Steph has been largely absent during this health pandemic, the company's layoffs and the civil unrest surrounding Black Lives Matter. This made sense. She was on mat leave and taking time to focus on her personal life over her professional one. This is why her social media activity over the last few days has been so surprising and frankly hurtful as employees of this company.""

Korey and Away's cofounders did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Update, 5:43 P.M. EST

In response to a request for comment from Motherboard, Away's vice president of communications and corporate affairs shared two screenshots. The first was an email from Jen Rubio, Away's co-founder, president, and Chief Brand Officer, addressed to the employees who had complained about Korey's comments. (The email comes from Rubio's email account; it's also cosigned by Stuart Haselden, the company's co-CEO).

Rubio wrote that Korey's comments ""do not reflect or affect our current company priorities and the deep work we're doing about diversity, equity and inclusion."" The email also stated that Stuart Haselden will take on the role of sole CEO at Away in 2020, and that Korey has updated her social media profiles to state that her views are her own.

In her own Slack response, Korey wrote: ""I understand that I have a responsibility as co-founder and co-CEO to commit to using my personal platforms to support our priorities, not distract by them."" She apologized to ""anyone I hurt by shifting the focus away from these important cultural moments this past week,"" referring to the Black Lives Matter movement and the company's stated commitment to ""Diversity, Equity and Inclusion,"" as Korey put it. Both statements say Away's priority is ""becoming an anti-racist company.""

FCC chief Ajit Pai , a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump in January , said the commission will vote at a Dec. 14 meeting on his plan to rescind the so-called net neutrality rules championed by Democratic former President Barack Obama that treated internet service providers like public utilities .
The rules barred broadband providers from blocking or slowing down access to content or charging consumers more for certain content . They were intended to ensure a free and open internet , give consumers equal access to web content and prevent broadband service providers from favoring their own content .
The action marks a victory for big internet service providers such as AT & T Inc , Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc that opposed the rules and gives them sweeping powers to decide what web content consumers can get and at what price .
It represents a setback for Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc , which had urged Pai not to rescind the rules . Netflix said Tuesday it opposed the measure to “ roll back these core protections . ”
With three Republican and two Democratic commissioners , the move is all but certain to be approved . Trump , a Republican , expressed his opposition to net neutrality in 2014 before the regulations were even implemented , calling it a “ power grab ” by Obama . The White House did not immediately comment Tuesday .
Pai said his proposal would prevent state and local governments from creating their own net neutrality rules because internet service is “ inherently an interstate service. ” The preemption is most likely to handcuff Democratic-governed states and localities that could have considered their own plans to protect consumers ’ equal access to internet content .
“ The FCC will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and preemptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro-competitive , ” Pai said in an interview , adding that the Obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised “ heavy-handed ” regulation of the internet .
“ We should simply set rules of the road that let companies of all kinds in every sector compete and let consumers decide who wins and loses , ” Pai added .
Tom Wheeler , who headed the FCC under Obama and advocated for the net neutrality rules , called the planned repeal “ a shameful sham and sellout . Even for this FCC and its leadership , this proposal raises hypocrisy to new heights . ”
AT & T , Comcast and Verizon have said that repealing the rules could lead to billions of dollars in additional broadband investment and eliminate the possibility that a future presidential administration could regulate internet pricing .
Comcast said no matter what the FCC decided it would “ not block , throttle , or discriminate against lawful content . ”
Verizon said it believed the FCC “ will reinstate a framework that protects consumers ’ access to the open internet , without forcing them to bear the heavy costs from unnecessary regulation . ”
The Internet Association , representing major technology firms including Alphabet and Facebook , said Pai ’ s proposal “ represents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of Americans . ”
“ This proposal undoes nearly two decades of bipartisan agreement on baseline net neutrality principles that protect Americans ’ ability to access the entire internet , ” it said .

Pai ’ s proposal would require internet service providers to disclose whether they allow blocking or slowing down of consumer web access or permit so-called internet fast lanes to facilitate a practice called paid prioritization of charging for certain content . Such disclosure will make it easier for another agency , the Federal Trade Commission , to act against internet service providers that fail to disclose such conduct to consumers , Pai said .
The FTC could seek to bar practices that it deemed “ anticompetitive ” or violated antitrust rules .
The FCC received more than 22 million comments . New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman disclosed Tuesday he has been investigating for more than six months in a bid to learn who was behind the filing of false comments .

Ted Cruz as “ Obamacare for the internet . ”
An alliance of celebrities , progressives and liberal lawmakers denounced Mr. Pai ’ s draft plan to dismantle the 2015 Title II regulations , enacted to ensure that high-speed internet providers treat web traffic equally and prevent them from charging different prices for different services .
“ Taking away # NetNeutrality is the Authoritarian dream , ” said actor Mark Ruffalo , who stars as the Hulk in “ Thor : Ragnarok. ” Comedian Patton Oswalt urged foes to “ bombard ” Mr. Pai with messages against the draft proposal .
“ I know . We ’ ve faced a lot of issues threatening our democracy in the last year , ” actress Alyssa Milano tweeted . “ But honestly , the @ FCC and @ AjitPaiFCC ’ s dismantling of # NetNeutrality is one of the biggest . THIS IS A HUGE DEAL . ”
The outcry is unlikely to sway Mr. Pai , who decried net neutrality as “ heavy-handed , utility-style regulations ” that have stymied investment , deterred innovation and placed the federal bureaucracy in charge of the internet .
He described the FCC ’ s party-line vote two years ago under pressure from President Obama to impose the regulatory framework as a mistake .
“ Under my proposal , the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet , ” Mr. Pai said in a statement . “ Instead , the FCC would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that ’ s best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate . ”
His draft , which he shared Tuesday with the other four commissioners , would also increase transparency by restoring the oversight role of the Federal Trade Commission .
“ Additionally , as a result of my proposal , the Federal Trade Commission will once again be able to police ISPs , protect consumers , and promote competition , just as it did before 2015 , ” Mr. Pai said . “ Notably , my proposal will put the federal government ’ s most experienced privacy cop , the FTC , back on the beat to protect consumers ’ online privacy . ”
Democrats were not convinced . “ The FCC is siding with big corporations by releasing a plan to claw back # NetNeutrality rules , ” said Sen. Kirsten E. Gillibrand , New York Democrat . “ They were hoping you wouldn ’ t notice . We must fight back to defend a free and open internet . ”
Net neutrality may not be a burning issue for most voters , but it became a cause celebre in Hollywood in part after comedian John Oliver began championing the rule as host of “ Last Week Tonight ” in 2014 .
NARAL Pro-Choice America said the proposed repeal “ would make it harder to get information on how and where to access abortion . And it will make it harder for activists to organize against Trump ’ s anti-choice , racist , extremist agenda . ”
How ? NARAL said the Title II rule change would allow “ extremists to pay to block access to accurate information about reproductive health ” by loosening rules on internet service providers such as Verizon and Comcast .
Republicans have dismissed the uproar as politically motivated fearmongering , pointing out that the rules established under President Clinton were in place for nearly 20 years , prompting $ 1.5 trillion in investment and resulting in what Mr. Pai called “ an internet economy that became the envy of the world . ”
“ Some of America ’ s greatest companies were born on the internet , ” Sen. Steve Daines , Montana Republican , said in a statement . “ By dismantling harmful internet regulations , American companies will have an open internet that allows their business , and our economy , to grow . ”
Rep. Steve Scalise , Louisiana Republican , called the 2015 rules “ a solution in search of a problem that didn ’ t exist ” and described them as “ 1930s-era utility-style regulations [ that ] have no business being applied to the internet in the 21st century . ”
The only disagreement among Republicans came from those who have advocated for a legislative solution rather than an FCC vote that could easily be overturned under a Democratic administration .
“ The last administration ’ s approach of regulating the internet with Depression-era phone rules is deeply flawed , ” said Sen. John Thune , South Dakota Republican and chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation . “ While I support Chairman Pai ’ s efforts as an improvement , I still strongly believe the only way to create long-term certainty for the internet ecosystem is for Congress to pass a bipartisan law . ”
Sen. Mike Lee , Utah Republican , introduced legislation in May to scrap the rule requiring internet service providers to treat all web traffic the same . House Republicans passed a bill to do so in April 2016 .
“ Now is the time to end government micromanagement of the internet and let it thrive without federal , state , or local meddling , ” Mr. Cruz , Texas Republican , said in a tweet .
The proposed rule change is expected to pass , given that two of the commission ’ s five members — Mr. Pai and Michael O ’ Rielly — voted against net neutrality when it came up for a vote in 2015 , and a third , Commissioner Brendan Carr , has said he would vote for the repeal .
“ I look forward to casting my vote in favor of restoring the 20-year , bipartisan approach under which the free and open internet flourished , ” Mr. Carr said in a Tuesday statement .
The commission ’ s Democrats , Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel , are expected to vote against the proposal . Ms. Rosenworcel tweeted , “ Time to call foul . Time to raise a ruckus . Time to save # NetNeutrality . ”
The trade group USTelecom , whose members include AT & T and Verizon , praised the proposed repeal , telling AdAge that the “ removal of antiquated , restrictive regulations will pave the way for broadband network investment , expansion and upgrades . ”
Meanwhile , progressive activist groups , including Demand Progress and Fight for the Future , announced a nationwide protest Dec. 7 at Verizon stores .

• The iTunes Store , allowing the purchase of single music tracks ( 2003 )
And you can add to list that Steve Jobs ' revitalization of the animated feature film through his acquisition of Pixar .
That 's a lot of imagination in a very short time . Apple has n't just dominated the story for a decade : It has written the story of the past decade . That is a lot to live up to . Most companies ca n't . It 's particularly brutal for tech ( as opposed to , say , shampoo ) companies , which at best can usually hope to set the pace for only about generation until they settle into a comfortable middle class .

At the bottom of the pile there is the sad tale of Palm -- the hottest tech company on the planet for far too brief a time . Palm Pilots were once everywhere . But the company stumbled by failing to recognize quickly enough that , in the age of the Internet , no one wanted a portable device that could n't get online .
Another hard luck case is Research in Motion -- now BlackBerry . That company did get the portable device memo , but it spectacularly misjudged the smartphone revolution sparked by Apple .
Now Apple is this unfamiliar territory : Successful on paper , products seen everywhere , Macbooks and iPhone placed in seemingly every TV show and movie and yet ... the cool factor is cooling off .
There is a big difference between atmospherics and actuality , of course . But nobody wants to be thought of as a has-been in the making .
The lesson of tech history is that smart companies crash when they believe what they have already done is all they need to do : that doubling-down and trash-talking the competition is what it takes .
This would be a good time to mention that increasingly large numbers of these `` business customers '' now want an iPhone at work , challenging Microsoft at what has been its enterprise stronghold .
Success is never assured , but it can only be extended only two ways : If you corner the market , impossible in the uberdisruptive tech space , or if you are unabashedly willing to question everything , all the time .
Facebook began life as the world 's most exclusive private social network -- only Harvard students need apply . But it became a public company worth $ 68 billion because it decided instead to become the world 's least exclusive private network .
Even Palm 's trajectory might have been different if it had inverted its thinking in time : Imagine a Palm Pilot not as a personal information manager with connectivity , but a connected device with PIM applications , and you have described exactly what the smartphone is today .
There is no reason to think Apple wo n't thrive financially for years to come , just like Microsoft . But its continued reputation as the chief arbiter of cool is being challenged . Apple may still have the best-selling smartphone in the world , but the many others powered by rival Google 's Android operating system -- and especially those made by Samsung -- far exceed the iPhone .
For years , tech writers reviewed each new smartphone on a simple grading scale : Is this the iPhone killer ? None has been , but collectively the point has been made :
No phone has killed the iPhone , but plenty of them co-exist just fine , thank you very much .
We expect the unexpected from Apple , and the company does nothing to tamp down these expectations . So when it does n't dazzle us , ennui begins to creep in . Apple is also burdened by what I called at the time the meaningless milestone of having become the biggest company ever . Where do you go from there ? You are either still the biggest , or slipping . Consolidating your lead is fine and all , but it is n't sexy .
My own prediction of Apple 's prospects is that needs to worry about becoming a mid-packer only after the CEO Tim Cook and designer Jony Ive -- the other tow members of the triumvirate headed by Steve Jobs -- are no longer with the company .
Until then , perhaps a decade from now , you bet against Apple at your own peril .","Story highlights John Abell: Reactions to iPhone 5 and iPad Mini were, for new Apple products, lukewarm

And you can add to list that Steve Jobs' revitalization of the animated feature film through his acquisition of Pixar.

That's a lot of imagination in a very short time. Apple hasn't just dominated the story for a decade: It has written the story of the past decade. That is a lot to live up to. Most companies can't. It's particularly brutal for tech (as opposed to, say, shampoo) companies, which at best can usually hope to set the pace for only about generation until they settle into a comfortable middle class.

At the bottom of the pile there is the sad tale of Palm -- the hottest tech company on the planet for far too brief a time. Palm Pilots were once everywhere. But the company stumbled by failing to recognize quickly enough that, in the age of the Internet, no one wanted a portable device that couldn't get online.

Another hard luck case is Research in Motion -- now BlackBerry. That company did get the portable device memo, but it spectacularly misjudged the smartphone revolution sparked by Apple.

Now Apple is this unfamiliar territory: Successful on paper, products seen everywhere, Macbooks and iPhone placed in seemingly every TV show and movie and yet ... the cool factor is cooling off.

There is a big difference between atmospherics and actuality, of course. But nobody wants to be thought of as a has-been in the making.

The lesson of tech history is that smart companies crash when they believe what they have already done is all they need to do: that doubling-down and trash-talking the competition is what it takes.

This would be a good time to mention that increasingly large numbers of these ""business customers"" now want an iPhone at work , challenging Microsoft at what has been its enterprise stronghold.

Success is never assured, but it can only be extended only two ways: If you corner the market, impossible in the uberdisruptive tech space, or if you are unabashedly willing to question everything, all the time.

Facebook began life as the world's most exclusive private social network -- only Harvard students need apply. But it became a public company worth $68 billion because it decided instead to become the world's least exclusive private network.

Even Palm's trajectory might have been different if it had inverted its thinking in time: Imagine a Palm Pilot not as a personal information manager with connectivity, but a connected device with PIM applications, and you have described exactly what the smartphone is today.

There is no reason to think Apple won't thrive financially for years to come, just like Microsoft. But its continued reputation as the chief arbiter of cool is being challenged. Apple may still have the best-selling smartphone in the world, but the many others powered by rival Google's Android operating system -- and especially those made by Samsung -- far exceed the iPhone.

For years, tech writers reviewed each new smartphone on a simple grading scale: Is this the iPhone killer? None has been, but collectively the point has been made:

No phone has killed the iPhone, but plenty of them co-exist just fine, thank you very much.

We expect the unexpected from Apple, and the company does nothing to tamp down these expectations. So when it doesn't dazzle us, ennui begins to creep in. Apple is also burdened by what I called at the time the meaningless milestone of having become the biggest company ever. Where do you go from there? You are either still the biggest, or slipping. Consolidating your lead is fine and all, but it isn't sexy.

My own prediction of Apple's prospects is that needs to worry about becoming a mid-packer only after the CEO Tim Cook and designer Jony Ive -- the other tow members of the triumvirate headed by Steve Jobs -- are no longer with the company.

Until then, perhaps a decade from now, you bet against Apple at your own peril.",www.cnn.com,left,y5DDk7gHu9jgUS7V

The revelations came just a week after officials disclosed a previous massive cyber intrusion into the same federal personnel office , compromising records of more than 4 million current and past employees in a breach that administration officials have privately blamed on Chinese hackers .
The stolen records in the hack disclosed Friday included data on intelligence and military personnel , The Associated Press reported . A senior administration official would not confirm that information but confirmed that the breach occurred at the Office of Personnel Management .
The hackers are believed to have obtained data from a security intake form known as a Standard Form-86 , which includes details such as financial trouble , past convictions , drug use and close relationships with citizens of other countries . The form is used for background checks of current , former and prospective federal employees .
“ This is crown jewels material … a gold mine for a foreign intelligence service , ” said Joel Brenner , a former NSA senior counsel .
The SF-86 breach could have dire consequences for U.S. intelligence gathering , former officials said , noting that it would make it extremely difficult for anyone inside the database to ever work in a covert capacity . For example , that would include someone employed by the State or Agriculture departments who gathers intelligence for the Defense Intelligence Agency .
“ This is not the end of American human intelligence , but it ’ s a significant blow , ” Brenner said .
As of October , 4.5 million Americans were cleared for access to classified information , including approximately a million contractors .
And because the SF-86s are stored in an indexed database , that database could also be combed for secrets , said Robert Caruso , a former Navy special security officer who has worked in security at the State and Defense departments . For example , Chinese agents could search the database for instances when agents with NSA covers were in the same place at the same time and make reasonable deductions about what they were doing there .
Brenner and Caruso both said it ’ s likely that clearance forms from the Defense Department and its related intelligence agencies , including NSA and the Defense Intelligence Agency , could be accessed through OPM . It ’ s much less likely that CIA employee clearance information was accessed that way because the CIA has traditionally insisted on managing its own personnel information .
“ CIA refuses to put its people ’ s information in with OPM , and of course they ’ re right , ” Brenner said . One lesson to draw from the breach , he said , is that “ any serious clandestine agency has to be in charge of its own personnel information . Full stop . ”
Investigators became aware of this second breach of the OPM ’ s systems as they pursued a previously disclosed breach into an unencrypted system holding personnel files of as many as 4.2 million current and past federal employees . That information included Social Security numbers , as well as names , addresses , pay grades , personnel actions and pension , insurance and health plan details .
The administration official said the relevant federal agencies received notification of the latest hack on Monday . “ We expect OPM will conduct additional notifications as necessary , ” the official said in a statement .
Administration officials have said privately that signs point to the first hack having originated in China , and security experts have said it appeared to be part of a Chinese effort to build dossiers on federal employees who might be approached later for espionage purposes .
The SF-86 “ gives you any kind of information that might be a threat to [ the employees ’ ] security clearance , ” said Jeff Neal , a former Department of Homeland Security official and a senior vice president at ICF International . “ It ’ s really a personal document . ”
It ’ s likely that the hackers are building a database on federal employees to “ make it easier for them to try to pick off people that they want , ” he added , saying most Americans who end up spying for foreign governments are motivated by money . With the security clearance data , plus the data from their earlier OPM hack , the attackers can compile lists of attractive and vulnerable intelligence targets .
Previously revealed data breaches at U.S. health insurance companies , which have also been attributed to Chinese state actors , only compound the accuracy of such a database , Neal said . “ They can basically build a large record on federal employees . ”
One federal cybersecurity official said the stolen data go beyond just the information on the employees themselves .
“ They got more than just your security form , ” the official said , speaking on condition of background . “ They got the supporting documentation . ”
Attackers also have information not just on federal employees with security clearances , but also any contact information that those cleared personnel entered into the form . “ How deep is the personally identifying information on the other people , I don ’ t know , ” the official said . “ It might just be their contact information , and I think that ’ s what [ investigators are ] trying to find out . ”
The disclosures add concern about employees being blackmailed or co-opted by foreign governments , former officials said .
Security clearance investigations , by their very nature , expose people ’ s darkest secrets — the things a foreign government might use to blackmail or compromise them such as drug and alcohol abuse , legal and financial troubles and romantic entanglements .
The best solution at this point , former officials said , may be what the government has already begun to do — drastically ramping up the government ’ s network defenses , both to prevent additional breaches from abroad and to more readily spot mischief by co-opted employees .
There may also be calls to further expand “ insider threat ” detection efforts , Caruso suggested .
Since the Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden leaks that disclosed a wealth of classified data , the Defense Department and intelligence agencies have put increased emphasis on programs to continuously monitor some employees ’ computer activity to spot anomalies — such as a China analyst accessing documents on Iran after hours . On a smaller scale , they ’ ve also ramped up “ continuous evaluation programs , ” which monitor public databases to turn up information suggesting added stress or abnormal behavior , such as financial troubles or an unreported drunken driving arrest .
Also on Friday , the White House announced a “ 30-day Cybersecurity Sprint ” in which the administration is instructing agencies to take actions such as testing their networks ’ vulnerabilities , patching weaknesses , restricting the number of privileged user accounts and “ dramatically ” ramping up the use of so-called multifactor authentication , which goes beyond requiring people to use passwords .

The stolen records in the hack disclosed Friday included data on intelligence and military personnel, The Associated Press reported. A senior administration official would not confirm that information but confirmed that the breach occurred at the Office of Personnel Management.

The hackers are believed to have obtained data from a security intake form known as a Standard Form-86, which includes details such as financial trouble, past convictions, drug use and close relationships with citizens of other countries. The form is used for background checks of current, former and prospective federal employees.

The administration official said the relevant federal agencies received notification of the latest hack on Monday. “We expect OPM will conduct additional notifications as necessary,” the official said in a statement.

Administration officials have said privately that signs point to the first hack having originated in China, and security experts have said it appeared to be part of a Chinese effort to build dossiers on federal employees who might be approached later for espionage purposes.

Friday’s new revelations appeared to back up that theory.

The SF-86 “gives you any kind of information that might be a threat to [the employees’] security clearance,” said Jeff Neal, a former Department of Homeland Security official and a senior vice president at ICF International. “It’s really a personal document.”

It’s likely that the hackers are building a database on federal employees to “make it easier for them to try to pick off people that they want,” he added, saying most Americans who end up spying for foreign governments are motivated by money.

Also on Friday, the White House announced a “30-day Cybersecurity Sprint” in which the administration is instructing agencies to take actions such as testing their networks’ vulnerabilities, patching weaknesses, restricting the number of privileged user accounts and “dramatically” ramping up the use of so-called multifactor authentication, which goes beyond requiring people to use passwords. In addition, a “Cybersecurity Sprint Team” will engage in a 30-day review of federal cyber efforts.

A statement on McInnes ’ YouTube channel ’ s page said it had been deleted for copyright infringement , according to the Daily Beast .
McInnes had already been banned by various social media platforms ; in August , Twitter suspended his account just before a “ Unite the Right ” rally in Washington , D.C. ; at the end of October , Facebook and Twitter banned McInnes and Facebook groups affiliated with the Proud Boys , one day after the Daily Beast reported :
McInnes used his account to draw up publicity for his infamous Oct. 12 speech at a New York Republican club , which ended with his Proud Boy followers brawling in the street with left-wing activists . To promote his speech , which celebrated the decades-old murder of a Japanese socialist , McInnes posted pictures of himself on Instagram in racist “ Asian eyes ” glasses . In the aftermath of the event , McInnes—who recently made his account private—posted a picture of the Japanese assassination with a Nike slogan superimposed over it : “ Just do it . ”
On Saturday , The Blaze announced McInnes would not be working with them , although roughly one week before the outlet had announced he would be hosting a show .
McInnes , who before becoming an alt-right darling was best known for co-founding Vice , was poised to host “ Get Off My Lawn , ” a show that was reportedly similar to his “ Get Off My Lawn ” podcast . BlazeTV co-president , Gaston Mooney , had previously touted McInnes as a “ provocateur , ” telling CNN that he was “ one of the many varied voices and viewpoints on Blaze Media platforms . ”
In mid-November , The Washington Post reported that a Washington state sheriff ’ s office had issued a report saying the FBI considered the Proud Boys to be an extremist group . The office of Clark County Sheriff Chuck E. Atkins said in the report , “ The FBI categorizes the Proud Boys as an extremist group with ties to White Nationalism . The FBI has warned local law enforcement that the Proud Boys are actively recruiting in the Pacific Northwest and that some in the group have contributed to the escalation of violence at political rallies held on college campuses . ”
But last week , The Oregonian reported that according to Oregon ’ s top FBI agent , the FBI had not designated the Proud Boys as an extremist group . Special Agent in Charge Renn Cannon told reporters that the FBI never intended to designate the Proud Boys as an extremist group when it briefed Clark County law enforcement leaders about regional threats .
Cannon continued vis-a-vis the Proud Boys , the FBI “ tried to characterize the potential threat from individuals within that group , ” adding that the FBI doesn ’ t designate groups but does investigate violent conspiracies . He stated , “ We do not intend and did not intend to designate the group as extremist … I can see where Clark County representatives came to that conclusion . That was not our intention . That ’ s not what we do . We will not open a case if someone belongs to antifa or even the Proud Boys . There has to be a credible allegation or a threat of violence before someone opens a case . ’ ’","On Monday, YouTube banned Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes, who had almost a quarter-million subscribers on the channel.

McInnes used his account to draw up publicity for his infamous Oct. 12 speech at a New York Republican club, which ended with his Proud Boy followers brawling in the street with left-wing activists. To promote his speech, which celebrated the decades-old murder of a Japanese socialist, McInnes posted pictures of himself on Instagram in racist “Asian eyes” glasses. In the aftermath of the event, McInnes—who recently made his account private—posted a picture of the Japanese assassination with a Nike slogan superimposed over it: “Just do it.”

On Saturday, The Blaze announced McInnes would not be working with them, although roughly one week before the outlet had announced he would be hosting a show.

As the Daily Beast reported:

McInnes, who before becoming an alt-right darling was best known for co-founding Vice, was poised to host “Get Off My Lawn,” a show that was reportedly similar to his “Get Off My Lawn” podcast. BlazeTV co-president, Gaston Mooney, had previously touted McInnes as a “provocateur,” telling CNN that he was “one of the many varied voices and viewpoints on Blaze Media platforms.”

In mid-November, The Washington Post reported that a Washington state sheriff’s office had issued a report saying the FBI considered the Proud Boys to be an extremist group. The office of Clark County Sheriff Chuck E. Atkins said in the report, “The FBI categorizes the Proud Boys as an extremist group with ties to White Nationalism. The FBI has warned local law enforcement that the Proud Boys are actively recruiting in the Pacific Northwest and that some in the group have contributed to the escalation of violence at political rallies held on college campuses.”

But last week, The Oregonian reported that according to Oregon’s top FBI agent, the FBI had not designated the Proud Boys as an extremist group. Special Agent in Charge Renn Cannon told reporters that the FBI never intended to designate the Proud Boys as an extremist group when it briefed Clark County law enforcement leaders about regional threats.

Cannon continued vis-a-vis the Proud Boys, the FBI “tried to characterize the potential threat from individuals within that group,” adding that the FBI doesn’t designate groups but does investigate violent conspiracies. He stated, “We do not intend and did not intend to designate the group as extremist … I can see where Clark County representatives came to that conclusion. That was not our intention. That’s not what we do. We will not open a case if someone belongs to antifa or even the Proud Boys. There has to be a credible allegation or a threat of violence before someone opens a case.’’",www.dailywire.com,right,8Bxm4N29B77gpdaU

Facebook said Sunday that it removed or blocked from the social media site 1.5 million videos of a gunman's rampage on two New Zealand mosques that killed 50 people and wounded dozens more.

Mia Garlick, spokeswoman for Facebook New Zealand, said that about 300,000 videos were removed within the first 24 hours of the terrorist attack Friday. More than 1.2 million were blocked at upload, she said.

""Out of respect for the people affected by this tragedy and the concerns of local authorities, we're also removing all edited versions of the video that do not show graphic content,"" Garlick said in a tweet.

Garlick said that Facebook was using technology and people ""around the clock"" to remove content that violates its violence policy.

Minutes before the attack, the alleged shooter posted a 74-page manifesto on Twitter and sent it to numerous officials and media outlets in New Zealand. The gunman also livestreamed the rampage via helmet cam on Facebook and Twitter.

Footage of the massacre circulated for hours after the shooting, despite efforts by Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Reddit to take it down as quickly as possible. Twitter and YouTube said they were continuously monitoring and removing any content depicting the tragedy.

""Our hearts are broken over today’s terrible tragedy in New Zealand,"" YouTube tweeted within hours of the attack. ""Please know we are working vigilantly to remove any violent footage.""

Twitter issued a statement citing its ""rigorous processes and a dedicated team"" that activates in such emergencies. The site also stressed that it cooperates with law enforcement investigations.

Church services and candlelight vigils were taking place across the nation of fewer than 5 million people Sunday. Dozens of people wounded in the assault on the Al Noor and Linwood mosques remained hospitalized.

New Zealand Police on Sunday released some details of the initial response to the attack.

""There has been some speculation around the Police response times to the first attack,"" New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush said in a statement. ""To clarify, police received its first 111 call at 1.41pm. The first armed police unit was on scene at 1.47pm. That’s six minutes to respond.""

Weiss for a reported $200 million to $300 million; and “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Scandal” creator Shonda Rhimes for more than $100 million.

Topping it off, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth at least $500 million to offer all the episodes of “Seinfeld,” starting in 2021.

It’s enough for LightShed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield to initiate coverage of Netflix this month with a whopping price target of $375. He believes “competition will accelerate Internet TV revolution.”

Netflix has forecast up to 800,000 paid subscriber additions in the U.S. in the third quarter and 7 million total, with results scheduled to be released on Oct. 16. Netflix is the market leader, with some 60 million domestic and 91.5 million international subscribers.

For the immediate future, Netflix’s dominance appears safe. By 2021, however, things could get dicey, says Needham analyst Laura Martin. She expects a price war worldwide then that will force Netflix to lower subscription fees of $9 to $16 a month. The company risks losing 5 million to 10 million of its 60 million U.S. subscribers in 2020 if it doesn’t act soon, she warned in an Oct. 3 note.

Netflix shares have gained 2.3% year to date, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.05% has climbed 20% and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.07% has rallied 18%.

Note: Netflix’s subscriber-additions forecast has been updated to clarify domestic and overall projections.",www.marketwatch.com,right,7zrxgH4OCUXyMjxr

VentureBeat summarized the enormous implications.

Google has the world’s most popular mobile operating system. The world’s most popular search engine. One of the world’s most popular social networks, in Google+. The biggest ad exchange in the world.

technology,The Guardian,0,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/15/twitter-elon-musk-joe-biden-hacked-bitcoin,"Twitter accounts of Biden, Musk and other prominent figures apparently hacked in bitcoin scam",2020-07-15,"Julia Carrie Wong, Kari Paul","Accounts of Uber and Apple also appear to have been hacked as part of scam instructing followers to transfer cryptocurrency
Twitter suffered a major security breach on Wednesday that saw hackers take control of the accounts of major public figures and corporations , including Joe Biden , Barack Obama , Elon Musk , Bill Gates , Jeff Bezos and Apple .
The company confirmed the breach Wednesday evening , more than six hours after the hack began , and attributed it to a “ coordinated social engineering attack ” on its own employees that enabled the hackers to access “ internal systems and tools ” . Twitter said it was “ looking into what other malicious activity they may have conducted or information they may have accessed ” in addition to using the compromised accounts to send tweets .
The hack unfolded over the course of several hours , and in the course of halting it , Twitter stopped all verified accounts from tweeting at all – an unprecedented measure . The company had restored most accounts by Wednesday evening , but warned that it “ may take further actions ” . The company said that it had also locked the compromised accounts and “ taken steps to limit access to internal systems and tools ” while it continues its investigation .
The compromised accounts , which count tens of millions of followers , sent a series of tweets proposing a classic bitcoin scam : followers were told that if they transferred cryptocurrency to a specific bitcoin wallet , they would receive double the money in return .
Other compromised accounts include those of Kanye West , Michael Bloomberg , Uber , and a number of cryptocurrency exchanges or organizations .
The messages included the address of a bitcoin wallet whose balance grew rapidly to more than 11 BTC ( more than $ 100,000 ) as the scam spread . Tweets with similar messages were repeatedly deleted and re-posted by some of the compromised accounts over the course of Wednesday afternoon .
While the motives and source of the attack are not yet known , the coordinated hijacking of the verified communications streams of world leaders , celebrities and major corporate accounts was a frightening prospect . Twitter has become a de facto wire service for the world and is used for official communications by governments during emergencies ; a hack on the scale of Wednesday ’ s attack could have been more disruptive or even dangerous .
“ The amount of damage this could cause is very high , ” said Douglas Schmidt , a computer science professor at Vanderbilt University . “ These people could hold information gleaned from the hack for ransom in the future . ”
Twitter issued its first statement approximately 90 minutes after scam messages began being sent out by Musk ’ s and Gates ’ accounts , as the attack was ongoing .
“ We are aware of a security incident impacting accounts on Twitter , ” the company said on Twitter . “ We are investigating and taking steps to fix it . We will update everyone shortly . ”
The company subsequently warned that some users would be unable to tweet or change their passwords as it worked to address the issue . Verified users , whose accounts feature a blue checkmark to denote that Twitter has confirmed their identities , were blocked from tweeting for about an hour .
Twitter ’ s stock price tumbled more than 3 % in after hours trading .
“ Tough day for us at Twitter , ” chief executive Jack Dorsey tweeted on Wednesday evening . “ We ’ re diagnosing and will share everything we can when we have a more complete understanding of exactly what happened . ”
It is not entirely uncommon for high-profile figures to suffer Twitter hacks . Dorsey himself was the victim of a Sim swap attack in 2019 .
But Twitter ’ s description of the attack suggests a much more serious breach of the company ’ s internal systems , carried out by tricking or otherwise persuading an employee to provide access . It is not the first time Twitter has faced an insider threat . In 2017 , a customer support employee briefly deleted Donald Trump ’ s account . And in 2019 , two former employees were charged with spying after they allegedly accessed thousands of users ’ account information and provided it to the government of Saudi Arabia .
Schmidt said that the attacks could be related to the fact that Twitter , like much of the rest of the tech industry , has transitioned to remote work during the coronavirus pandemic .
“ The likelihood of attacks like this increase when people are working remotely it is much easier for bad actors to impersonate someone through an email and gain access to their accounts , ” said Schmidt . “ Assuming this wasn ’ t someone inside Twitter trying to take revenge , it appears to be a spear phishing attack – someone who has access to admin privileges that can override two-factor authentication and strong passwords fell victim to a hack ” .","Accounts of Uber and Apple also appear to have been hacked as part of scam instructing followers to transfer cryptocurrency

Twitter has become a de facto wire service for the world and is used for official communications by governments during emergencies; a hack on the scale of Wednesday’s attack could have been more disruptive or even dangerous.

“The amount of damage this could cause is very high,” said Douglas Schmidt, a computer science professor at Vanderbilt University. “These people could hold information gleaned from the hack for ransom in the future.”

Twitter issued its first statement approximately 90 minutes after scam messages began being sent out by Musk’s and Gates’ accounts, as the attack was ongoing.

“We are aware of a security incident impacting accounts on Twitter,” the company said on Twitter. “We are investigating and taking steps to fix it. We will update everyone shortly.”

The company subsequently warned that some users would be unable to tweet or change their passwords as it worked to address the issue. Verified users, whose accounts feature a blue checkmark to denote that Twitter has confirmed their identities, were blocked from tweeting for about an hour.

Twitter’s stock price tumbled more than 3% in after hours trading.

“Tough day for us at Twitter,” chief executive Jack Dorsey tweeted on Wednesday evening. “We’re diagnosing and will share everything we can when we have a more complete understanding of exactly what happened.”

It is not entirely uncommon for high-profile figures to suffer Twitter hacks. Dorsey himself was the victim of a Sim swap attack in 2019.

But Twitter’s description of the attack suggests a much more serious breach of the company’s internal systems, carried out by tricking or otherwise persuading an employee to provide access. It is not the first time Twitter has faced an insider threat. In 2017, a customer support employee briefly deleted Donald Trump’s account. And in 2019, two former employees were charged with spying after they allegedly accessed thousands of users’ account information and provided it to the government of Saudi Arabia.

Schmidt said that the attacks could be related to the fact that Twitter, like much of the rest of the tech industry, has transitioned to remote work during the coronavirus pandemic.

“The likelihood of attacks like this increase when people are working remotely it is much easier for bad actors to impersonate someone through an email and gain access to their accounts,” said Schmidt. “Assuming this wasn’t someone inside Twitter trying to take revenge, it appears to be a spear phishing attack – someone who has access to admin privileges that can override two-factor authentication and strong passwords fell victim to a hack”.",www.theguardian.com,left,oKLdYMgUJeaUXLKj

Will the shares recover?

Facebook's initial public offering in 2012 priced shares at $38 each, giving the company a market valuation of close to $104bn.

Following steady user growth and a dominant space in the digital advertising market ensuring revenues, Facebook's share price climbed to $190 by February this year.

I asked 4 tech optimists what went wrong.,2018-06-08,"Dylan Matthews, Alissa Wilkinson, Sigal Samuel, Terry Nguyen, Rebecca Jennings, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz","The web , and in particular social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter , were supposed to make information easier and freer to share , to advantage the citizen at the expense of governments , to provide access to more information and viewpoints and more vibrant debates than residents of democracies had ever experienced before . It was supposed to topple dictators , to build social collaboration , to punish defection and isolation .
Now , in 2018 , the familiar techno-utopian pronouncements of the 1990s and ’ 00s seem not just wrong but like a bad joke .
Citizens enjoying a wealth of new information ? Take a look at the depth of the fake news problem .
Citizens being privileged over countries ? Hard to take seriously after Russia orchestrated a successful effort to hack the US election .
Individuals gaining power over hierarchy ? What about the individuals whose data was obtained without permission by Cambridge Analytica and exploited for political ends ?
How could we have gotten this so wrong ? To find out , I reached out to a number of men ( and , this being the tech industry , the most prominent and enthusiastic voices were men ) who , in the early years of the internet , expressed optimistic views of the potential of the web to improve democracy , politics , or just society generally , to ask them if they ’ ve reevaluated their views in light of recent events . Clay Shirky , David Weinberger , and Jeff Jarvis replied by email ; Alec Ross , currently a candidate for governor of Maryland , talked on the phone .
Some have rethought their premises . Others insist their initial views were less utopian than many critics believed , and that they ’ ve been right all along . Others landed somewhere in the middle . Their responses have been very lightly edited for length and clarity .
Bio : Writer , researcher , professor of journalism and interactive telecommunications at New York University and NYU Shanghai . Author of several books , including Here Comes Everybody : The Power of Organizing Without Organizations ( 2008 ) , Cognitive Surplus : Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age ( 2010 ) , and Little Rice : Smartphones , Xiaomi , and the Chinese Dream ( 2015 ) .
What he said then : “ The use of social media tools — text messaging , e-mail , photo sharing , social networking , and the like — does not have a single preordained outcome . … The safest characterization of recent quantitative attempts to answer the question , Do digital tools enhance democracy ? ( such as those by Jacob Groshek and Philip Howard ) is that these tools probably do not hurt in the short run and might help in the long run — and that they have the most dramatic effects in states where a public sphere already constrains the actions of the government. ” ( “ The Political Power of Social Media , ” Foreign Affairs , 2011 )
[ Your 2008 book ] Here Comes Everybody was full of persuasive arguments that the social web was fundamentally changing dynamics of political organizing , largely for the better . I know you ’ ve written some on how Facebook has fallen short of that potential , so I ’ m curious for your thoughts , as well as any reflections on which of your predictions about the web and democracy have and haven ’ t been borne out so far .
I ’ ve long said the organizational and communal models enabled by the internet are a challenge to 20th-century institutions , not an extension of them . Not only do I still think that ’ s true , now almost everyone thinks it ’ s true . ( This is a big change — at the beginning of the decade , people were still writing think pieces about how socially and politically unimportant Facebook and Twitter would turn out to be . )
However , I underestimated two things , and both of them make pessimism more warranted . The first is the near-total victory of the “ social graph ” as the ideal organizational form for social media , to the point that we now use “ social media ” to mean “ media that links you to your friends ’ friends , ” rather than the broader 2000s use of “ media that supports group interaction . ”
The second thing I underestimated was the explosive improvement in the effectiveness of behavioral economics and its real-world consequences of making advertising work as advertised .
Taken together , these forces have marginalized the earlier model of the public sphere characterized by voluntary association ( which is to say a public sphere that followed [ Jürgen ] Habermas ’ s conception ) , rather than as a more loosely knit fabric for viral ideas to flow through .
Here Comes Everybody is about that former model — I just looked in the index , and I mention Facebook only four times in the book , while I wrote about Meetup so much it has its own set of subheadings in the index . Both companies were relatively young at the time , and the book was not focused on them as firms so much as enablers of social patterns , but the social pattern I was most interested in was opt-in , active , and created a sense of membership among its users , as Meetup does , not just connectedness , as Facebook does .
Voluntary associations ( groups that know who their members are , roughly , whether organized around veganism or socialism or a shared love of Family Guy ) defend themselves against material that comes in from the outside , and they also contain the spread of information they produce . Without that social club as an organizational form , you get an emphasis on the pleasure of shared emotion , and especially outrage , among a large , loosely knit social fabric , which gets privileged over most other kinds of reactions and over almost many forms of collective action .
When you add to that environment the presence of advertising firms that can now finally do what ad firms have long claimed to be able to do , namely to predictably and reliably engender a fairly tailored set of emotional reactions in a narrowly defined target audience , you get , well , today .

Creator of Entertainment Weekly , blogger at BuzzMachine .
What he said then : “ Today , it occurs to me that Facebook , Twitter , and YouTube may be the Gutenberg press of the Middle East , tools like this that enable people to speak , share , and gather . Without those tools , could revolutions occur ? Of course , curmudgeons , they could . Without people and their passion , could revolutions occur ? Of course not , curmudgeons . But why are these revolutions occurring now ? No , curmudgeons , we ’ ll never be able to answer that question .
“ But it does matter that the revolutionaries of the Middle East use — indeed , depend upon — these social tools and the net . That is the reason why we must protect them , for by doing so we protect the public and its freedoms . If you follow [ Malcolm ] Gladwell , et . al. , and believe that the social tools are merely toys and trifles , then what does it matter if they are shut down ? That is why the curmudgeons ’ debate with themselves matters : because it could do harm ; it could result in dismissing the tools of publicness just when we most need to safeguard them. ” ( “ Gutenberg of Arabia , ” BuzzMachine , 2011 )
“ Dictators and politicians , media moguls and marketers try to tell us what to think and say . But now , in a truly public society , they must listen to what we say , whether we ’ re using Twitter to complain about a product or Facebook to organize a protest . If they are to prosper , these institutions must learn to deal with us at eye-level , with respect for us as individuals and for the power we can now wield as groups — as publics . If they do not , they may be replaced by entrepreneurs or insurgents , good or bad. ” ( Public Parts , 2011 )
Your book Public Parts begins with a long interview with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg , where you seem to share a philosophy centered around the value of “ publicness ” and overratedness of privacy with him . Have you reevaluated that philosophy in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal ? Do you think Facebook has gone too far in data sharing ? Have you adjusted your view of Zuckerberg ?
I share with Zuckerberg a belief that a connected world can be a better world . I do not think that Cambridge Analytica itself negates that view . Do you ?
Does Facebook “ go too far in data sharing ” ? The API that allowed a researcher to take the public data of friends of friends was disabled shortly after it was used ( and note this was a feature that was used by many media and marketing companies as well ) . Note also that Facebook does not — contrary to frequent talk-show assertion — share or sell data to advertisers . It , like Google — and like news media in the rare instances when we are smart enough to get our own first-party data — shares the fruits of that information with advertisers in terms of better targeting and ad effectiveness .
I want to be careful about not overreacting to the 2014 violation of Facebook ’ s terms of service by one researcher who then worked with one nefarious company . For I believe the future of news media , and I do hope we have one , is to abandon our mass-media ways , treating everyone alike and underserving countless communities in society — and bring people relevance and value as individuals and members of communities .
That means we need to know people as individuals ; we need to have information — or to use what is becoming the scare term , data — about them . If we go overboard in forbidding the collection and use of that information , I fear that we will cut off our nose to spite our face and cut off a critical strategy for a sustainable future of news and journalism .
Have I adjusted my view of Zuckerberg ? I ’ ve adjusted my view of the net to this extent : I was and remain an optimist . I was rather a dogmatist about the value of openness . I still value openness . But as Twitter , Blogger , and Medium co-founder Ev Williams said at [ South by Southwest ] recently , he and we did not account for the extent of the bad behavior that would follow . These companies accounted and compensated for dark-hat SEO , spam , and other economically motivated behavior . They did not see the extent of the actions of political bad actors and trolls who would destroy for the sake of destruction .
Note well now that Facebook is hiring 20,000 people to combat that bad behavior on its platform , while , for the sake of apples-to-pears comparison only , the US now employs fewer than 30,000 journalists on daily newspapers . What does that say about society ’ s problems and priorities ? We soon might be investing more in detecting and banning bad behavior than we do in reporting the truth .
Do I blame Zuckerberg or Facebook or that ? No . I say we have a problem as a society that we need to work on as we negotiate new norms around our new , connected reality .
Bio : Philosopher , researcher , and freelance writer on technology and society . Author of numerous books , including Small Pieces Loosely Joined : A Unified Theory of the Web ( 2002 ) , Everything Is Miscellaneous : The Power of the New Digital Disorder ( 2007 ) , and Too Big to Know : Rethinking Knowledge Now That the Facts Aren ’ t the Facts , Experts Are Everywhere , and the Smartest Person in the Room Is the Room ( 2011 ) .
What he said then : “ The Web ’ s architecture itself is fundamentally moral . … The Web is not the messiah dressed in cables and bits . It does not signal the apocalypse . It does not even make us all millionaires . But it is also more than merely another new technology . … It ’ s a world we build simply by using it , and what is of worth stays and adds to the Web ’ s overall worth. ” ( Small Pieces Loosely Joined , 2002 )
“ I think it ’ s essential that there be people keeping people like me in line , and reminding us that big business has reemerged on the internet . In fact , it ’ s conceivable that large corporations are going to sink the internet , and that even though there are new voices being heard , say , through the blogosphere , the biggest sites on the blogosphere are either very traditional media companies or they ’ re people who are now playing the basic role of very big media companies .
“ And so the argument that it hasn ’ t changed that much I think needs to be considered . And yet I look around and I see how fundamentally transformed — often in ways that we forget , because we ’ re living in the midst of this — how fundamentally transformed so many aspects of our lives are .
“ It seems to me empirically true that we ’ re dealing with a transformative , exceptional technology that holds open utopian possibilities. ” ( Interview with ABC Radio Australia , 2012 )
Small Pieces Loosely Joined was one of the first books I read to champion the web ’ s potential to improve political discourse , and I know you ’ ve written some on how Facebook has fallen short of that potential . I ’ m curious for your thoughts , as well as any reflections on which of your predictions about the web and democracy have and haven ’ t been borne out so far .
The net is certainly more open to systematic and systemic attack than some early web optimists like me thought . It also centralized itself around key commercial providers in ways that I ’ d hoped and predicted it wouldn ’ t .
It ’ s a tragedy that while the web connects pages via an open protocol , the connections among people are managed by closed , for-profit corporations . A lot of our political problems come from that : The interests of those corporations and of its users and citizens are not always aligned . That ’ s bad .
Within the internet ecosystem , I feel my tiny role is to be one of the people who occasionally interrupt the important discussion of the failings of the net to say , “ Okay , but we should also sometimes remember just how much the net has positively transformed politics as well . ”
That ’ s not what we need to be focusing on right now because we ’ re facing issues that threaten democracy itself . Nevertheless , we should be trying to preserve the good the net has done as we work to mitigate its harm to our political system .
We would scream and cry if we were forced back into the old political information ecosystem : 22 minutes of nightly news , mimeographed ( look it up ) one-pagers on a handful of issues that you could pick up at your campaign headquarters , a range of opinions in the mainstream media ( which was pretty much the only media ) that range from moderate left to moderate right , and the marginalization of virtually all voices that didn ’ t issue from white men in suits .
We are far more engaged , far more politically informed ( and , yes , far more misinformed , alas ) . Yes , we form “ echo chambers , ” but we are also are more aware than ever of the diversity of opinions around us . Furthermore , and this is a looong conversation , talking with like-minded people is how we make sense , collectively and collaboratively , of what ’ s going on . It ’ s also how people form political movements .
The web excited many of us because we could talk about what mattered to us and do so in our own voice . We sound like ourselves on the web . That has helped politicians sound more like humans . Of course , it also allows trumpeting , racist narcissists to sound like themselves too .
Since many early web enthusiasts like me felt emboldened by the fact that what we liked about the web was baked into the internet ’ s very architecture , it is particularly disappointing — horrifying , actually — to see that architecture get turned against the values we hoped it would support .
When addressed with nation-scale resources , the internet enables perfect surveillance . The ability for anyone to speak on any topic without having to ask permission also enables bots to pepper us with their lies and hatred . The anonymity that is the default on the net , a property that is liberating for the vulnerable and oppressed , also lets hackers , cowards , and frauds demean our conversations and erode our trust .
I have hope , though . Our interactions with the internet are mediated by applications , and applications can be adjusted so that they serve us better . I ’ m not saying it ’ s easy , but it is possible .
Bio : “ One of America ’ s leading experts on innovation. ” Former senior adviser on innovation to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ; author of The Industries of the Future . Current candidate for governor of Maryland .
What he said : “ Dictatorships are now more vulnerable than they have ever been before , in part — but not entirely — because of the devolution of power from the nation state to the individual . … One thesis statement I want to emphasize is how networks disrupt the exercise of power . They devolve power from the nation-state , from governments and large institutions to individuals and small institutions .
“ The overarching pattern is the redistribution of power from governments and large institutions to people and small institutions . … The Che Guevara of the 21st century is the network. ” ( Remarks at the Guardian ’ s Activate summit , 2011 )
“ These technologies can be used against citizens and they frequently are , to deadly effect . However , this does not reverse the irreversible dynamic of connection technologies putting power in the hands of citizens and networks of citizens at the expense of hierarchies , including the state. ” ( Interview with Huffington Post , 2013 )
You ’ ve expressed a lot of optimism about the potential for social networks and online networks more generally to undermine dictatorships , empower citizens , and so on . Have your views on this evolved at all in the wake of the 2016 election , revelations about Facebook , etc . ?
Look , my views on this haven ’ t changed at all . I ’ ve never held the view that technology — what I believe is that technology can disrupt the power of hierarchies at the expense of citizen networks . I believe that to be true . I think a lot of people made a mistake by lumping it into democracy specifically . I always think the technology can be used for closed theocracies . The technology itself is value-neutral and inanimate .
In the case of Russia using Facebook as well as it did , [ social media ] took a big hierarchy like the United States and its democratic institutions and undermined it , even though it was in a position of asymmetrical disadvantage . It can advantage the upstart against the incumbent , and in the case of Russia versus the United States , that ’ s Russia .
Some people have falsely characterized my views as utopian . My views have never been utopian or dystopian . Ideas are like technology : They can fuel a city or destroy . Whether it ’ s used for good or ill depends on the people using it .
A lot of people would look at what happened with Cambridge Analytica and dispute that that constituted the advantaging of citizens over governments . It was a firm with rich political backers exploiting average citizens ’ data without permission , a case of Facebook and social media being used to enhance corporate power and the power of political elites , not citizen power .
I disagree . Cambridge Analytica — how long has it existed ? Not very long , right ? It ’ s this very little organization . What was undermined was the American election . It was undermined by this relatively small upstart political firm .
So where I think what was really destroyed was the election . What they did is they used their tools and their targeting to basically create an insurgent army of unwitting American voters . I guess that ’ s my view on it . You conflated corporate power and the power of the state . I wouldn ’ t conflate those two . I think the power of the state is made considerably more vulnerable by exposure to technologies . I don ’ t think the same holds true in reference to corporate power .
Facebook is being used to perpetrate a genocide against Muslim people in Myanmar , with the tacit approval of the country ’ s government . How does that fit into your theory ?
From my standpoint , it ’ s being used in the same way in which Hutu radio was used to foment a genocide in Rwanda in the 1990s . The difference between social media being used to foment hate today versus the 1990s is that it ’ s inherently more collaborative as opposed to something like radio where it ’ s one-way . Here you can get lots of different people participating .
Again , I ’ m cold-blooded about this . If you asked me , if it were up to you , would all of our smartphones go dead and all social media go dead ? If you think it ’ s a net negative , if you ’ re at all intellectually honest , you ’ d say , “ If it were up to me I ’ d push a button and turn it off . ”
Am I in favor of that ? No . I ’ m not in favor of all our smartphones and social networks going dark . I ’ m in favor of exerting increased levels of responsibility , but am I in favor of turning it off ? No .
I don ’ t think many people are saying we should turn off all smartphones and end all social media .
If you look at the critique coming out of a lot of European capitals and the European academics and the people closing their Facebook accounts , I think there are many saying it ’ s not worth it .
I hear a lot more criticism of specific networks , like Facebook , than blanket condemnations of the idea of connecting people . Facebook clearly has a different , and arguably more dangerous , ecosystem than , say , Instagram .
But Instagram is Facebook . Facebook owns it ; it ’ s the same thing .

The web, and in particular social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, were supposed to make information easier and freer to share, to advantage the citizen at the expense of governments, to provide access to more information and viewpoints and more vibrant debates than residents of democracies had ever experienced before. It was supposed to topple dictators, to build social collaboration, to punish defection and isolation.

Now, in 2018, the familiar techno-utopian pronouncements of the 1990s and ’00s seem not just wrong but like a bad joke.

Citizens enjoying a wealth of new information? Take a look at the depth of the fake news problem.

Citizens being privileged over countries? Hard to take seriously after Russia orchestrated a successful effort to hack the US election.

Individuals gaining power over hierarchy? What about the individuals whose data was obtained without permission by Cambridge Analytica and exploited for political ends?

How could we have gotten this so wrong? To find out, I reached out to a number of men (and, this being the tech industry, the most prominent and enthusiastic voices were men) who, in the early years of the internet, expressed optimistic views of the potential of the web to improve democracy, politics, or just society generally, to ask them if they’ve reevaluated their views in light of recent events. Clay Shirky, David Weinberger, and Jeff Jarvis replied by email; Alec Ross, currently a candidate for governor of Maryland, talked on the phone.

Some have rethought their premises. Others insist their initial views were less utopian than many critics believed, and that they’ve been right all along. Others landed somewhere in the middle. Their responses have been very lightly edited for length and clarity.

Clay Shirky

Bio: Writer, researcher, professor of journalism and interactive telecommunications at New York University and NYU Shanghai. Author of several books, including Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations (2008), Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age (2010), and Little Rice: Smartphones, Xiaomi, and the Chinese Dream (2015).

What he said then: “The use of social media tools — text messaging, e-mail, photo sharing, social networking, and the like — does not have a single preordained outcome. … The safest characterization of recent quantitative attempts to answer the question, Do digital tools enhance democracy? (such as those by Jacob Groshek and Philip Howard) is that these tools probably do not hurt in the short run and might help in the long run — and that they have the most dramatic effects in states where a public sphere already constrains the actions of the government.” (“The Political Power of Social Media,” Foreign Affairs, 2011)

What he says now (via email):

Dylan Matthews

[Your 2008 book] Here Comes Everybody was full of persuasive arguments that the social web was fundamentally changing dynamics of political organizing, largely for the better. I know you’ve written some on how Facebook has fallen short of that potential, so I’m curious for your thoughts, as well as any reflections on which of your predictions about the web and democracy have and haven’t been borne out so far.

Clay Shirky

I’ve long said the organizational and communal models enabled by the internet are a challenge to 20th-century institutions, not an extension of them. Not only do I still think that’s true, now almost everyone thinks it’s true. (This is a big change — at the beginning of the decade, people were still writing think pieces about how socially and politically unimportant Facebook and Twitter would turn out to be.)

However, I underestimated two things, and both of them make pessimism more warranted. The first is the near-total victory of the “social graph” as the ideal organizational form for social media, to the point that we now use “social media” to mean “media that links you to your friends’ friends,” rather than the broader 2000s use of “media that supports group interaction.”

The second thing I underestimated was the explosive improvement in the effectiveness of behavioral economics and its real-world consequences of making advertising work as advertised.

Taken together, these forces have marginalized the earlier model of the public sphere characterized by voluntary association (which is to say a public sphere that followed [Jürgen] Habermas’s conception), rather than as a more loosely knit fabric for viral ideas to flow through.

Here Comes Everybody is about that former model — I just looked in the index, and I mention Facebook only four times in the book, while I wrote about Meetup so much it has its own set of subheadings in the index. Both companies were relatively young at the time, and the book was not focused on them as firms so much as enablers of social patterns, but the social pattern I was most interested in was opt-in, active, and created a sense of membership among its users, as Meetup does, not just connectedness, as Facebook does.

Voluntary associations (groups that know who their members are, roughly, whether organized around veganism or socialism or a shared love of Family Guy) defend themselves against material that comes in from the outside, and they also contain the spread of information they produce. Without that social club as an organizational form, you get an emphasis on the pleasure of shared emotion, and especially outrage, among a large, loosely knit social fabric, which gets privileged over most other kinds of reactions and over almost many forms of collective action.

When you add to that environment the presence of advertising firms that can now finally do what ad firms have long claimed to be able to do, namely to predictably and reliably engender a fairly tailored set of emotional reactions in a narrowly defined target audience, you get, well, today.

Jeff Jarvis

Bio: Journalist; professor and director of the Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism. Author of What Would Google Do? (2009), Public Parts: How Sharing in the Digital Age Improves the Way We Work and Live (2011), and Geeks Bearing Gifts: Imagining New Futures for News (2014). Creator of Entertainment Weekly, blogger at BuzzMachine.

What he said then: “Today, it occurs to me that Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube may be the Gutenberg press of the Middle East, tools like this that enable people to speak, share, and gather. Without those tools, could revolutions occur? Of course, curmudgeons, they could. Without people and their passion, could revolutions occur? Of course not, curmudgeons. But why are these revolutions occurring now? No, curmudgeons, we’ll never be able to answer that question.

“But it does matter that the revolutionaries of the Middle East use — indeed, depend upon — these social tools and the net. That is the reason why we must protect them, for by doing so we protect the public and its freedoms. If you follow [Malcolm] Gladwell, et. al., and believe that the social tools are merely toys and trifles, then what does it matter if they are shut down? That is why the curmudgeons’ debate with themselves matters: because it could do harm; it could result in dismissing the tools of publicness just when we most need to safeguard them.” (“Gutenberg of Arabia,” BuzzMachine, 2011)

“Dictators and politicians, media moguls and marketers try to tell us what to think and say. But now, in a truly public society, they must listen to what we say, whether we’re using Twitter to complain about a product or Facebook to organize a protest. If they are to prosper, these institutions must learn to deal with us at eye-level, with respect for us as individuals and for the power we can now wield as groups — as publics. If they do not, they may be replaced by entrepreneurs or insurgents, good or bad.” (Public Parts, 2011)

What he says now (via email):

Dylan Matthews

Your book Public Parts begins with a long interview with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, where you seem to share a philosophy centered around the value of “publicness” and overratedness of privacy with him. Have you reevaluated that philosophy in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal? Do you think Facebook has gone too far in data sharing? Have you adjusted your view of Zuckerberg?

Jeff Jarvis

I share with Zuckerberg a belief that a connected world can be a better world. I do not think that Cambridge Analytica itself negates that view. Do you?

Does Facebook “go too far in data sharing”? The API that allowed a researcher to take the public data of friends of friends was disabled shortly after it was used (and note this was a feature that was used by many media and marketing companies as well). Note also that Facebook does not — contrary to frequent talk-show assertion — share or sell data to advertisers. It, like Google — and like news media in the rare instances when we are smart enough to get our own first-party data — shares the fruits of that information with advertisers in terms of better targeting and ad effectiveness.

I want to be careful about not overreacting to the 2014 violation of Facebook’s terms of service by one researcher who then worked with one nefarious company. For I believe the future of news media, and I do hope we have one, is to abandon our mass-media ways, treating everyone alike and underserving countless communities in society — and bring people relevance and value as individuals and members of communities.

That means we need to know people as individuals; we need to have information — or to use what is becoming the scare term, data — about them. If we go overboard in forbidding the collection and use of that information, I fear that we will cut off our nose to spite our face and cut off a critical strategy for a sustainable future of news and journalism.

Have I adjusted my view of Zuckerberg? I’ve adjusted my view of the net to this extent: I was and remain an optimist. I was rather a dogmatist about the value of openness. I still value openness. But as Twitter, Blogger, and Medium co-founder Ev Williams said at [South by Southwest] recently, he and we did not account for the extent of the bad behavior that would follow. These companies accounted and compensated for dark-hat SEO, spam, and other economically motivated behavior. They did not see the extent of the actions of political bad actors and trolls who would destroy for the sake of destruction.

Note well now that Facebook is hiring 20,000 people to combat that bad behavior on its platform, while, for the sake of apples-to-pears comparison only, the US now employs fewer than 30,000 journalists on daily newspapers. What does that say about society’s problems and priorities? We soon might be investing more in detecting and banning bad behavior than we do in reporting the truth.

Do I blame Zuckerberg or Facebook or that? No. I say we have a problem as a society that we need to work on as we negotiate new norms around our new, connected reality.

David Weinberger

Bio: Philosopher, researcher, and freelance writer on technology and society. Author of numerous books, including Small Pieces Loosely Joined: A Unified Theory of the Web (2002), Everything Is Miscellaneous: The Power of the New Digital Disorder (2007), and Too Big to Know: Rethinking Knowledge Now That the Facts Aren’t the Facts, Experts Are Everywhere, and the Smartest Person in the Room Is the Room (2011).

What he said then: “The Web’s architecture itself is fundamentally moral. … The Web is not the messiah dressed in cables and bits. It does not signal the apocalypse. It does not even make us all millionaires. But it is also more than merely another new technology. … It’s a world we build simply by using it, and what is of worth stays and adds to the Web’s overall worth.” (Small Pieces Loosely Joined, 2002)

“I think it’s essential that there be people keeping people like me in line, and reminding us that big business has reemerged on the internet. In fact, it’s conceivable that large corporations are going to sink the internet, and that even though there are new voices being heard, say, through the blogosphere, the biggest sites on the blogosphere are either very traditional media companies or they’re people who are now playing the basic role of very big media companies.

“And so the argument that it hasn’t changed that much I think needs to be considered. And yet I look around and I see how fundamentally transformed — often in ways that we forget, because we’re living in the midst of this — how fundamentally transformed so many aspects of our lives are.

“It seems to me empirically true that we’re dealing with a transformative, exceptional technology that holds open utopian possibilities.” (Interview with ABC Radio Australia, 2012)

What he says now (via email):

Dylan Matthews

Small Pieces Loosely Joined was one of the first books I read to champion the web’s potential to improve political discourse, and I know you’ve written some on how Facebook has fallen short of that potential. I’m curious for your thoughts, as well as any reflections on which of your predictions about the web and democracy have and haven’t been borne out so far.

David Weinberger

The net is certainly more open to systematic and systemic attack than some early web optimists like me thought. It also centralized itself around key commercial providers in ways that I’d hoped and predicted it wouldn’t.

It’s a tragedy that while the web connects pages via an open protocol, the connections among people are managed by closed, for-profit corporations. A lot of our political problems come from that: The interests of those corporations and of its users and citizens are not always aligned. That’s bad.

Within the internet ecosystem, I feel my tiny role is to be one of the people who occasionally interrupt the important discussion of the failings of the net to say, “Okay, but we should also sometimes remember just how much the net has positively transformed politics as well.”

That’s not what we need to be focusing on right now because we’re facing issues that threaten democracy itself. Nevertheless, we should be trying to preserve the good the net has done as we work to mitigate its harm to our political system.

We would scream and cry if we were forced back into the old political information ecosystem: 22 minutes of nightly news, mimeographed (look it up) one-pagers on a handful of issues that you could pick up at your campaign headquarters, a range of opinions in the mainstream media (which was pretty much the only media) that range from moderate left to moderate right, and the marginalization of virtually all voices that didn’t issue from white men in suits.

We are far more engaged, far more politically informed (and, yes, far more misinformed, alas). Yes, we form “echo chambers,” but we are also are more aware than ever of the diversity of opinions around us. Furthermore, and this is a looong conversation, talking with like-minded people is how we make sense, collectively and collaboratively, of what’s going on. It’s also how people form political movements.

The web excited many of us because we could talk about what mattered to us and do so in our own voice. We sound like ourselves on the web. That has helped politicians sound more like humans. Of course, it also allows trumpeting, racist narcissists to sound like themselves too.

Since many early web enthusiasts like me felt emboldened by the fact that what we liked about the web was baked into the internet’s very architecture, it is particularly disappointing — horrifying, actually — to see that architecture get turned against the values we hoped it would support.

When addressed with nation-scale resources, the internet enables perfect surveillance. The ability for anyone to speak on any topic without having to ask permission also enables bots to pepper us with their lies and hatred. The anonymity that is the default on the net, a property that is liberating for the vulnerable and oppressed, also lets hackers, cowards, and frauds demean our conversations and erode our trust.

I have hope, though. Our interactions with the internet are mediated by applications, and applications can be adjusted so that they serve us better. I’m not saying it’s easy, but it is possible.

Alec Ross

Bio: “One of America’s leading experts on innovation.” Former senior adviser on innovation to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; author of The Industries of the Future. Current candidate for governor of Maryland.

What he said: “Dictatorships are now more vulnerable than they have ever been before, in part — but not entirely — because of the devolution of power from the nation state to the individual. … One thesis statement I want to emphasize is how networks disrupt the exercise of power. They devolve power from the nation-state, from governments and large institutions to individuals and small institutions.

“The overarching pattern is the redistribution of power from governments and large institutions to people and small institutions. … The Che Guevara of the 21st century is the network.” (Remarks at the Guardian’s Activate summit, 2011)

“These technologies can be used against citizens and they frequently are, to deadly effect. However, this does not reverse the irreversible dynamic of connection technologies putting power in the hands of citizens and networks of citizens at the expense of hierarchies, including the state.” (Interview with Huffington Post, 2013)

What he says now (via phone interview):

Dylan Matthews

You’ve expressed a lot of optimism about the potential for social networks and online networks more generally to undermine dictatorships, empower citizens, and so on. Have your views on this evolved at all in the wake of the 2016 election, revelations about Facebook, etc.?

Alec Ross

Look, my views on this haven’t changed at all. I’ve never held the view that technology — what I believe is that technology can disrupt the power of hierarchies at the expense of citizen networks. I believe that to be true. I think a lot of people made a mistake by lumping it into democracy specifically. I always think the technology can be used for closed theocracies. The technology itself is value-neutral and inanimate.

In the case of Russia using Facebook as well as it did, [social media] took a big hierarchy like the United States and its democratic institutions and undermined it, even though it was in a position of asymmetrical disadvantage. It can advantage the upstart against the incumbent, and in the case of Russia versus the United States, that’s Russia.

Some people have falsely characterized my views as utopian. My views have never been utopian or dystopian. Ideas are like technology: They can fuel a city or destroy. Whether it’s used for good or ill depends on the people using it.

Dylan Matthews

A lot of people would look at what happened with Cambridge Analytica and dispute that that constituted the advantaging of citizens over governments. It was a firm with rich political backers exploiting average citizens’ data without permission, a case of Facebook and social media being used to enhance corporate power and the power of political elites, not citizen power.

Alec Ross

I disagree. Cambridge Analytica — how long has it existed? Not very long, right? It’s this very little organization. What was undermined was the American election. It was undermined by this relatively small upstart political firm.

So where I think what was really destroyed was the election. What they did is they used their tools and their targeting to basically create an insurgent army of unwitting American voters. I guess that’s my view on it. You conflated corporate power and the power of the state. I wouldn’t conflate those two. I think the power of the state is made considerably more vulnerable by exposure to technologies. I don’t think the same holds true in reference to corporate power.

Dylan Matthews

Facebook is being used to perpetrate a genocide against Muslim people in Myanmar, with the tacit approval of the country’s government. How does that fit into your theory?

Alec Ross

From my standpoint, it’s being used in the same way in which Hutu radio was used to foment a genocide in Rwanda in the 1990s. The difference between social media being used to foment hate today versus the 1990s is that it’s inherently more collaborative as opposed to something like radio where it’s one-way. Here you can get lots of different people participating.

Again, I’m cold-blooded about this. If you asked me, if it were up to you, would all of our smartphones go dead and all social media go dead? If you think it’s a net negative, if you’re at all intellectually honest, you’d say, “If it were up to me I’d push a button and turn it off.”

Am I in favor of that? No. I’m not in favor of all our smartphones and social networks going dark. I’m in favor of exerting increased levels of responsibility, but am I in favor of turning it off? No.

Dylan Matthews

I don’t think many people are saying we should turn off all smartphones and end all social media.

Alec Ross

If you look at the critique coming out of a lot of European capitals and the European academics and the people closing their Facebook accounts, I think there are many saying it’s not worth it.

Dylan Matthews

I hear a lot more criticism of specific networks, like Facebook, than blanket condemnations of the idea of connecting people. Facebook clearly has a different, and arguably more dangerous, ecosystem than, say, Instagram.

Alec Ross

But Instagram is Facebook. Facebook owns it; it’s the same thing.

Dylan Matthews

But it’s a different app, with a different culture.

Alec Ross

It’s a different ecosystem, but do you imagine the data sharing practices are any different?

Dylan Matthews

I suppose not.

Alec Ross

I don’t think there are many competitor social networks. As a practical matter, if you see where most people are congregating, it’s on a small number of platforms. Twitter is drawn into this as much as Facebook is. Name another social media platform.

Dylan Matthews

Do you think there’s any role for the government to play in regulating social media companies to prevent abuses?

Alec Ross

I think there is a reasonable role for government to play — for example, getting platforms to keep from promulgating genocide. That seems pretty reasonable to me. But to be perfectly blunt, I don’t see government as the source of vast expertise in how to regulate the online world, and I think some of the biggest pieces of shit using social media to foment hate come from government.

The president of the United States is a cyberbully. If you look at members of Congress, do you really want them to be the ones setting norms for our online platforms? Most of them would get kicked off if there was much in the way of regulation there. The theory and practice are two different things. I see the government playing a negative role, by and large, in making the internet a more harmonious place.

Dylan Matthews

What about antitrust enforcement? You just said you don’t think Facebook has real competition.

Alec Ross

From an antitrust perspective, less so. If I were a venture capitalist, I’d see there’s a great big market out there of people abandoning Facebook. I wouldn’t attack this from an antitrust perspective, but a market competitiveness perspective. I think the barriers to entry are lower than what the conventional wisdom says.

I think there’s room in the market for new entrants, so I think the corrective is better arrived at by people imaging the social networks they would like that don’t exist right now, than something coming out Trumps’s DOJ.

If you look at what the Trump administration has been willing to politicize, I do not trust his Justice Department.

Dylan Matthews

That sounds to me like a statement that we can’t have any antitrust enforcement at all for the next two and a half years, more if Trump is reelected.

Alec Ross

I know, it sucks. I’m not saying this in a happy way! I’m saying this with the experience of having governed. This isn’t something out of the textbook; this is something out of reality.

The simple fact of the matter is that we have a cyberbully president. You think I trust his Justice Department? Hell no. Does this mean meaningful antitrust can’t be trusted as long as he’s president? Yes. I don’t think his NSC or EPA can be trusted. It’s hard to think about anything coming out of Trump’s administration as anything other than malignant.

Dylan Matthews

You’re running for governor. What role do you think state governments have in fixing the problems the Russian hacking scandal and Cambridge Analytica exposed?

Alec Ross

I think that sunlight is the best disinfectant. There are certain things a governor can do. I think transparency in how election dollars are spent is critically important. If there’s a nickel spent for any kind of issue advocacy or social advocacy, the origin of those dollars should be transparent in real time; it should be disclosed.

Dylan Matthews

Not just candidates but advocacy groups too?

Alec Ross

I mean, a lot of quote-unquote “issue advocacy” is inherently candidate-oriented. I believe in transparency, I really do. If someone’s fighting for a $15 minimum wage and they spew a bunch of information, the origin of the money and the amount of the money should be transparent.

I also think, and I think this will seem almost comically naive, but there are things called libel and slander, and I don’t understand why they’re considered now to be off the books. A lot of what’s being published meets the technical measure of liberal and slander. We need to bring good old-fashioned enforcement on the book of false speech, the whole fake news phenomenon. It’s against the law in terms of what’s on the law; it’s just not enforced.

Dylan Matthews

I’m not a lawyer, but my understanding is that the Supreme Court has sharply limited what can be punished as libel in cases where you can’t prove actual malice and the information is simply false.

Alec Ross

You just hit the right word: malice. If you look at what was the case in the 2016 election, it fits the technical legal definition of malice.

Dylan Matthews

But let’s go back to what you said about mandating disclosure by advocacy groups, which I found extremely alarming. One reason we don’t have laws like that is to prevent harassment and violence against vulnerable people. When Alabama subpoenaed the NAACP’s membership lists, the Supreme Court unanimously blocked it, saying that forcing the group to give up its membership lists violated freedom of assembly. And frankly, if the membership lists had been released, people could have been lynched.

Alec Ross

I think that’s a very reasonable point. I think our problem right now is the exact opposite. Harassment is being promulgated by a set of actors who are willing to spend behind closed doors with zero transparency. It’s a reasonable and convincing point.

The question right now is where is harm actually taking place. In disclosing membership, the details matter. When you talk about disclosure and transparency, what specifically do you mean by that? The name of the organization and the amount? Or the composition of the organization? I will not pretend to have arrived at what I think the right answers to that are.

For the past month and a half , we 've been exploring the invisible forces that shape our lives in NPR 's newest program , Invisibilia . Now we 're ending the pilot season with a visible twist — exploring the ways computers shape our behavior , and the way we see the world .
The first person we hear from is actually a cyborg . His name is Thad Starner . In 1993 , when Starner was in grad school , he went to see The Terminator . In the movie , Arnold Schwarzenegger 's character views the world through a screen that 's actually in his eyeball — sort of Google Glass before Google Glass came to be . Thad sees that and says , `` That is cool ! ''
A whole bunch of psychologists are trying to systematically figure out how the rules of socializing work differently online . It 's almost as if the Internet is a different planet , where gravity pulls on us in a different way .
So he works with a friend to create a computer he can wear . He jury-rigs a little screen to some goggles so he literally has a screen sitting in front of one eye . He has a wearable keyboard for one hand . He 's constantly taking notes on everything around him , via the keyboard , so the computer is constantly tracking his interactions in the world .
And then he programs the computer with something called a remembrance agent . It works like this — let 's say Starner runs into `` Kenji '' — somebody he only knows a little and has n't seen in four years . Starner types Kenji 's name on his keyboard , and the remembrance agent displays on the screen in front of his eye all the information about Kenji that Starner has ever entered into the system . It displays all that information — as Starner 's talking to the guy .
What Starner found was that having all that information available to him changed him in certain ways — particularly his social relationships .
With easy access to that background information , for example , he 'd be able to say stuff like , `` Yes , Kenji , I know that last time we talked , your daughter was going to college . How 's she doing ? What 's she majoring in ? '' Without the computer 's help , Starner says , he would n't have had those details at the tip of his tongue — he would n't even have remembered that Kenji has a daughter .
Starner says being able to insert those sorts of details into his conversation changed the way people responded to him — because it conveyed that he cared . `` Suddenly , '' he says , `` you 're interested in them . ''
These sorts of situations raise intriguing questions — maybe , in this case , it 's really the machine that 's interested in them .
For his part , Starner says he does n't think relying on the computer in this way cheapened his social interactions . He thinks it deepened them — made him almost superhuman .

For the past month and a half, we've been exploring the invisible forces that shape our lives in NPR's newest program, Invisibilia. Now we're ending the pilot season with a visible twist — exploring the ways computers shape our behavior, and the way we see the world.

The first person we hear from is actually a cyborg. His name is Thad Starner. In 1993, when Starner was in grad school, he went to see The Terminator. In the movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger's character views the world through a screen that's actually in his eyeball — sort of Google Glass before Google Glass came to be. Thad sees that and says, ""That is cool!""

A whole bunch of psychologists are trying to systematically figure out how the rules of socializing work differently online. It's almost as if the Internet is a different planet, where gravity pulls on us in a different way.

So he works with a friend to create a computer he can wear. He jury-rigs a little screen to some goggles so he literally has a screen sitting in front of one eye. He has a wearable keyboard for one hand. He's constantly taking notes on everything around him, via the keyboard, so the computer is constantly tracking his interactions in the world.

And then he programs the computer with something called a remembrance agent. It works like this — let's say Starner runs into ""Kenji"" — somebody he only knows a little and hasn't seen in four years. Starner types Kenji's name on his keyboard, and the remembrance agent displays on the screen in front of his eye all the information about Kenji that Starner has ever entered into the system. It displays all that information — as Starner's talking to the guy.

What Starner found was that having all that information available to him changed him in certain ways — particularly his social relationships.

With easy access to that background information, for example, he'd be able to say stuff like, ""Yes, Kenji, I know that last time we talked, your daughter was going to college. How's she doing? What's she majoring in?"" Without the computer's help, Starner says, he wouldn't have had those details at the tip of his tongue — he wouldn't even have remembered that Kenji has a daughter.

Starner says being able to insert those sorts of details into his conversation changed the way people responded to him — because it conveyed that he cared. ""Suddenly,"" he says, ""you're interested in them.""

These sorts of situations raise intriguing questions — maybe, in this case, it's really the machine that's interested in them.

For his part, Starner says he doesn't think relying on the computer in this way cheapened his social interactions. He thinks it deepened them — made him almost superhuman.

So in this episode, we look a little deeper into the negative side of how computers are changing us.

For example, we talk to this guy named Pete Malachowsky. He started out as somebody sort of like Mr. Rogers — from Mister Rogers' Neighborhood on TV. One thing that famously bothered Mr. Rogers — and Malachowsky, at least in the beginning — was ""seeing one person demeaning another.""

Malachowsky tells us that what really breaks his heart are the daily, minuscule cruelties we all see every day — on subways and buses when, say, a pregnant woman climbs aboard.

""You'd think everybody would jump up to give her their seat, right?"" says Malachowsky. ""But it doesn't happen. It really doesn't happen."" Most passengers, he notices in his subway commute in New York, just keep their heads down, and pretend not to see the pregnant woman standing there.

So Pete set out to right these wrongs by setting up a Twitter account to document this rude behavior — calling people out on social media. In the beginning, he sort of saw it as a way to restore the moral balance.

But Pete says what really happened, over time, is that he ended up becoming the sort of person he hated — his own tweets started to get really, really harsh.

And so we set out to understand in this episode whether there might be something about interacting with a computer — about being online — that could be behind this kind of transformation. And if so, how would that work?

What we found out is that there are a whole bunch of psychologists trying to systematically figure out how the rules of socializing work differently online. It's almost as if the Internet is a different planet, where gravity pulls on us in a different way.

The key takeaway ? Everyone is still unhappy . The report is little more than a formalized catalog of six categories of grievances aired in Republican-led congressional hearings over the past two years . It doesn ’ t include any real quantitative assessment of bias . There are no statistics assessing the millions of moderation decisions that Facebook and Instagram make each day . Instead , there are merely some capitulatory minor product tweaks to address edge cases , such as the permitting of images of premature babies to bolster pro-life ads ( previously , Facebook had apparently prohibited images of medical tubes connected to a human body ) .
These tiny changes are all the more remarkable because the audit was an exhaustive affair , the result of about a year of research led by former Republican Sen. Jon Kyl , encompassing interviews with scores of conservative lawmakers and organizations . Facebook committed to the audit in May 2018 , amid criticism that it silenced conservative voices .
Despite the time and energy invested , the conspicuous absence of evidence within the audit suggests what many media researchers already knew : Allegations of political bias are political theater . Sen. Ted Cruz has been touting anecdotes about Silicon Valley censorship for more than a year . President Donald Trump has fundraised on it . Recognizing that it plays well , left-leaning politicians have begun to seize on the censorship talking point , too : Sen. Elizabeth Warren got angry about Facebook denying one of her ads ( it was later restored ) , and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , another presidential candidate , is presently testing the limits of cognitive dissonance by suing Google for censorship while simultaneously touting her debate performance on Google search trends .
Still , the audit findings ( or lack of them ) may help shift the conversation in a positive direction . While they ’ re unlikely to put a stop to the belief in political bias , perhaps they will dissuade the Trump administration from pursuing a misguided executive order to “ police ” social media censorship . That may be too optimistic . But perhaps the findings—and the challenges of even conducting a meaningful audit—could be used to focus the conversation on real problems with social media : an advertising infrastructure masquerading as a communications infrastructure and algorithms that incentivize misinformation .
Viral stories of individual bad calls spread like wildfire , particularly if they feed the narrative that a distinct group is being censored .
Fewer than two weeks ago , a draft executive order leaked , detailing a plan by Trump to address “ anti-conservative bias ” on social media platforms , including Facebook and Twitter . ( The leak came shortly after a bizarre “ social media summit ” held at the White House . ) The order , titled “ Protecting Americans From Online Censorship , ” signaled an effort to take the topic of anti-conservative bias from sound bites to rule-making . If enacted , it could significantly change the long-standing law that has governed American speech online and make major tech platforms liable for perceived censorship . The order would seek to grant the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission new power over the content that social media companies currently moderate themselves .
But the volume of content and moderation decisions that those agencies would face is staggering : From July to December 2018 , Twitter ’ s transparency report notes that 11 million unique accounts were reported for rules violations . Of those , Twitter took some sort of action on 235,455 flagged as abuse , 250,806 for hateful conduct , and 56,577 for violent threats . Meanwhile , Facebook moderates millions of posts per week . In a three-month period at the start of 2019 , Facebook took action on 2.6 million pieces of content related to harassment and 4 million related to hate speech . Given that volume , human moderators and algorithmic systems inevitably make bad calls . The problem is that viral stories of those individual bad calls spread like wildfire , particularly if they feed the narrative that a distinct group is being censored .
The topic of free speech is always thorny , but the evidence that is supposed to support conservative criticism broadly , and Trump ’ s draft order specifically , simply doesn ’ t stand up to scrutiny . First , using the metric that is most transparent—reach—conservative news is top-performing content on Facebook . Attempts to take a quantitative approach to assessing conservative censorship , such as a Quillette article analyzing prominent Twitter accounts that were banned , revealed something else entirely : “ Of 22 prominent , politically active individuals who are known to have been suspended since 2005 and who expressed a preference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election , 21 supported Donald Trump , ” the author assessed . Among the 21 were conservative paragons Tila Tequila , David Duke , and the American Nazi Party ; other conservatives sharply critiqued the attempt to reclassify extremists as conservatives . Even the anecdotes are misleading : One of the most touted is the story of Rep. ( now-Sen. ) Marsha Blackburn , who alleged conservative censorship when she was prevented from running an ad that made false claims about Planned Parenthood selling baby parts . Twitter initially declined to allow what it deemed a contested and inflammatory claim to be served as an ad but said the Blackburn campaign was free to post and promote it organically on the site .
For many researchers who study social media and moderation , the hope was that the conservative bias audit would provide a large-scale assessment that would resolve the question of systemic political bias . It didn ’ t happen . And that ’ s partially because it can ’ t . Ultimately , this is a system of incredible complexity in which moderators make millions of hard calls . It ’ s also a system with no transparency or oversight . It ’ s time for partisans to stop working the refs to achieve better outcomes for their parties and instead work toward bipartisan policies that benefit us all .
We all spend time on a communications infrastructure that ’ s opaque , controlled by a handful of companies , and built to drive engagement at any cost . Feelings of frustration emerge when moderation rules are applied unfairly and there ’ s no one to appeal to . These are problems the left and right can find common ground on . Lawmakers and pundits in both parties should push for more transparency into recommendation engines and content takedowns , more accountability when those algorithms promote dangerous content , and a common-sense appeals process when individuals believe they have been unfairly censored .
There are already bright ideas in this vein : The social media industry and civil society could identify a system of shared standards or best practices ; companies could then decide whether to adopt those standards , and consumers could sign up for platforms that best suited them . Improved A.I . moderation , coupled with a robust human appeals process and subject to auditing , is also a way forward—and would reduce the harms that many human moderators experience . There ’ s also the potential to replicate and improve upon systems such as the Lumen database , which makes copyright-related content takedowns visible to outside researchers ; this would increase transparency and enable ongoing assessments to ensure there ’ s no bias .
We all want an internet that facilitates free expression . It ’ s time to pursue ideas that get us there , rather than political orders masquerading as policy .

The preliminary results of Facebook’s long-awaited “bias” audit are out. The key takeaway? Everyone is still unhappy. The report is little more than a formalized catalog of six categories of grievances aired in Republican-led congressional hearings over the past two years. It doesn’t include any real quantitative assessment of bias. There are no statistics assessing the millions of moderation decisions that Facebook and Instagram make each day. Instead, there are merely some capitulatory minor product tweaks to address edge cases, such as the permitting of images of premature babies to bolster pro-life ads (previously, Facebook had apparently prohibited images of medical tubes connected to a human body).

These tiny changes are all the more remarkable because the audit was an exhaustive affair, the result of about a year of research led by former Republican Sen. Jon Kyl, encompassing interviews with scores of conservative lawmakers and organizations. Facebook committed to the audit in May 2018, amid criticism that it silenced conservative voices.

Despite the time and energy invested, the conspicuous absence of evidence within the audit suggests what many media researchers already knew: Allegations of political bias are political theater. Sen. Ted Cruz has been touting anecdotes about Silicon Valley censorship for more than a year. President Donald Trump has fundraised on it.

Of those, Twitter took some sort of action on 235,455 flagged as abuse, 250,806 for hateful conduct, and 56,577 for violent threats. Meanwhile, Facebook moderates millions of posts per week. In a three-month period at the start of 2019, Facebook took action on 2.6 million pieces of content related to harassment and 4 million related to hate speech. Given that volume, human moderators and algorithmic systems inevitably make bad calls. The problem is that viral stories of those individual bad calls spread like wildfire, particularly if they feed the narrative that a distinct group is being censored.

The topic of free speech is always thorny, but the evidence that is supposed to support conservative criticism broadly, and Trump’s draft order specifically, simply doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. First, using the metric that is most transparent—reach—conservative news is top-performing content on Facebook. Attempts to take a quantitative approach to assessing conservative censorship, such as a Quillette article analyzing prominent Twitter accounts that were banned, revealed something else entirely: “Of 22 prominent, politically active individuals who are known to have been suspended since 2005 and who expressed a preference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, 21 supported Donald Trump,” the author assessed. Among the 21 were conservative paragons Tila Tequila, David Duke, and the American Nazi Party; other conservatives sharply critiqued the attempt to reclassify extremists as conservatives. Even the anecdotes are misleading: One of the most touted is the story of Rep. (now-Sen.) Marsha Blackburn, who alleged conservative censorship when she was prevented from running an ad that made false claims about Planned Parenthood selling baby parts. Twitter initially declined to allow what it deemed a contested and inflammatory claim to be served as an ad but said the Blackburn campaign was free to post and promote it organically on the site.

For many researchers who study social media and moderation, the hope was that the conservative bias audit would provide a large-scale assessment that would resolve the question of systemic political bias. It didn’t happen. And that’s partially because it can’t. Ultimately, this is a system of incredible complexity in which moderators make millions of hard calls. It’s also a system with no transparency or oversight. It’s time for partisans to stop working the refs to achieve better outcomes for their parties and instead work toward bipartisan policies that benefit us all.

We all spend time on a communications infrastructure that’s opaque, controlled by a handful of companies, and built to drive engagement at any cost. Feelings of frustration emerge when moderation rules are applied unfairly and there’s no one to appeal to. These are problems the left and right can find common ground on. Lawmakers and pundits in both parties should push for more transparency into recommendation engines and content takedowns, more accountability when those algorithms promote dangerous content, and a common-sense appeals process when individuals believe they have been unfairly censored.

There are already bright ideas in this vein: The social media industry and civil society could identify a system of shared standards or best practices; companies could then decide whether to adopt those standards, and consumers could sign up for platforms that best suited them. Improved A.I. moderation, coupled with a robust human appeals process and subject to auditing, is also a way forward—and would reduce the harms that many human moderators experience. There’s also the potential to replicate and improve upon systems such as the Lumen database, which makes copyright-related content takedowns visible to outside researchers; this would increase transparency and enable ongoing assessments to ensure there’s no bias.

We all want an internet that facilitates free expression. It’s time to pursue ideas that get us there, rather than political orders masquerading as policy.

SAN FRANCISCO — Twitter suspended high-profile accounts associated with the alt-right movement, the same day the social media service said it would crack down on hate speech.

Among those suspended was Richard Spencer, who runs an alt-right think tank and had a verified account on Twitter.

The alt-right, a loosely organized group that espouses white nationalism, emerged as a counterpoint to mainstream conservatism and has flourished online. Spencer has said he wants blacks, Asians, Hispanics and Jews removed from the U.S.

Twitter on Tuesday removed Spencer's verified account, @RichardBSpencer, that of his think tank, the National Policy Institute @npiamerica, and his online magazine @radixjournal.

""This is corporate Stalinism,"" Spencer told The Daily Caller News Foundation. In a YouTube video, entitled Knight of the Long Knives, an apparent reference to the purge of Nazi leaders in 1934 to consolidate Adolf Hitler's power, Spencer said Twitter had engaged in a coordinated effort to wipe out alt-right Twitter.

""I am alive physically but digitally speaking there has been execution squads across the alt right,"" he said. ""There is a great purge going on and they are purging people based on their views.""

In a statement, Twitter said: ""The Twitter Rules prohibit targeted abuse and harassment, and we will suspend accounts that violate this policy.""

It declined to comment specifically on the suspensions, which included the accounts of Paul Town, Pax Dickinson, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers.

Twitter was the platform of choice for the campaign of President-elect Donald Trump and the alt-right political movement that embraced him. The alt-right used social media to spread its cause of white supremacy, operating largely unchecked by social media giants Twitter and Facebook.

For years, Twitter billed itself as ""the free speech wing of the free speech party."" But as the social media service grew, that hands-off approach contributed to a dramatic rise in abuse, harassment and hate speech. As the company's user and revenue growth stagnated and public backlash increased, Twitter has in recent months begun to address complaints. After a bitterly divisive election, personal attacks and threats have only escalated.

Twitter says it's cracking down on hate speech

It removed 125,000 accounts linked to ISIL between mid-2015 and February 2016. But it's unclear if the crackdown will continue.

technology,CNN (Web News),0,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/11/politics/donald-trump-social-media-summit-census-fact-check/index.html,Trump makes 6 false claims during his 'social media summit',2019-07-11,"Daniel Dale, Holmes Lybrand","( CNN ) During a wide-ranging , largely off the cuff speech during his `` social media summit '' Thursday , President Donald Trump made several misleading and downright false claims about social media companies , the census , the economy , crowd sizes and Democrats ' past positions on a border wall .
Trump spoke at length about what he falsely suggested was a deliberate attempt by social media companies to prevent him from gaining followers , alleging that `` a lot of bad things are happening . ''
Trump said it used to take him a mere `` short number of days '' to gain 100,000 new followers , but it now takes `` 10 times as long '' even though , he claimed , his personal brand is `` much hotter '' than it was when he was gaining followers more quickly .
`` People come up to me : 'Sir , we want to follow you ; they do n't let us on , ' '' Trump said . He added later : `` I have millions of people , so many people I would n't believe it , but I know that we 've been blocked . People come up to me and they say , 'Sir , I ca n't get you . I ca n't follow you . ' ''
Facts First : There is no evidence that Twitter or other social media companies have made it difficult for people to follow Trump .
We obviously ca n't verify what certain people might have told Trump in private about following him on social media , but following him is not complicated : doing so is simply a matter of signing up for an account , searching his name and clicking a single button .
If Trump is not gaining followers as quickly as he used to , that 's because fewer people are now trying to follow him . ( At the time of his speech , he had 61.9 million followers on Twitter . He had fewer than 13 million a week before his election and fewer than 23 million at the time of his inauguration , according to Factba.se , which tracks Trump-related data . )
Twitter did take followers away from Trump last year , but that was part of a broad purge of suspected fake accounts . The purge also removed followers from the accounts of many other famous people . Trump lost approximately 300,000 followers , far fewer than Barack Obama ( more than 2 million ) and the Dalai Lama ( about 375,000 ) , according to a New York Times count .
When Trump began accusing Twitter last year of malicious behavior over the purge , Twitter issued a statement saying `` many prominent accounts have seen follower counts drop . '' It explained that it had removed `` fake accounts and those engaging in malicious behavior '' to improve the health of the service .
Trump touted the low unemployment rate for women , saying : `` Women , I think , Kellyanne ( Conway ) , the best in 75 years -- the best unemployment numbers in 75 years . ''
Facts First : Trump exaggerated slightly . The women 's unemployment Trump exaggerated slightly . The women 's unemployment rate for June is 3.6 % , a tick above the 3.4 % in April and 3.5 % in May . Those are excellent numbers , but it has been 66 years since the women 's rate has been this low , not 75 . Prior to Trump 's presidency , the last time the rate fell to 3.6 % was October 1953 .
While arguing that he should be permitted to include a citizenship question in the 2020 US census , Trump said that the census survey can ask people about the number of beds and toilets they have but not about whether they are citizens .
`` They go through houses , they go up , they ring doorbells , they talk to people . How many toilets do they have ? How many desks do they have ? How many beds ? What 's their roof made of ? '' Trump said . `` The only thing we ca n't ask is 'Are you a citizen of the United States ? ' ''
Facts First : Trump is wrongly suggesting that the decennial census asks households about the number of toilets in a house . He could be referring to supplemental surveys from the Census Bureau , which do ask questions about living conditions of a small sample of households . If that 's the case , then he 's still wrong , since these surveys do ask questions of citizenship .
The decennial census -- which counts the US population every ten years and is required by the Constitution -- was last administered in 2010 . That census did not include questions on plumbing , bedrooms , and desks . Instead , the decennial census focuses on questions like age and race and number of occupants in a household .
Trump could be referring to other surveys sent out from the Census Bureau such as the American Community Survey , which is sent to just a fraction of households , about 3.54 million addresses every year .
One of the main functions of the ACS , according the Census Bureau , is to gather `` data that help determine how more than $ 675 billion in federal and state funds are distributed each year . '' The 2019 version of this survey includes questions on the education levels and employment status of those living on the property , as well as the property 's computer access , number of rooms , if there is access to hot and cold water and much more .
But the ACS also includes questions on citizenship . `` Is this person a citizen of the United States ? '' this year 's version asks . So , Trump is wrong to suggest that while you can ask these more specific questions on living conditions you can not ask a citizenship status question .
On the specifics , Trump 's argument lacks facts , and on his larger point he 's flatly wrong : the decennial census did not ask about number of bathrooms , bedrooms , and so on .
Trump touted a new record set by the Dow Jones Industrial Average , then made a claim about how much 401 ( k ) retirement plans have increased .
`` I do n't know if you know but we just hit 27,000 on the Dow . ... The highest in history , for those of you that like the stock market , but the stock market means jobs . I view it as jobs , and I view it as 401 ( k ) s. ... And people with 401 ( k ) s , they 're up 72 % and 67 % , and the wife or the husband , whoever 's responsible , the other one says 'you 're a genius , you 're a great financial investor , darling you 're up 77 % this year . ' ''
Facts First : These percentages overstate gains in US stock markets .
It is possible that some people have 401 ( k ) s that are up 77 % on the year or since Trump was elected , but stock markets themselves are not up that much . At the close of trading on the day Trump spoke , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up by 16 % , the S & P 500 Index by 20 % , the Nasdaq by 24 % .
The gains are greater if you go back to Trump 's election day , as the President often does : 48 % for the Dow , 40 % for the S & P , 58 % for the Nasdaq . Still , none of them approaches 77 % .
Trump claimed that there were thousands of people outside his June campaign kickoff rally in Orlando in addition to the large crowd inside .
`` We had sort of an opening rally in Orlando , Florida . We had 109,000 , maybe more , wanting to come . We were doing as much as we could to keep people not from coming . We had a 21,000-seat stadium , and then with the basketball court , it held many more than that , it was packed . And we had a similar number outside . ''
Facts First : There were nowhere close to 21,000 people outside the rally as Trump was speaking . And the arena had a capacity of 20,000 that night , not `` many more than '' 21,000 .
The Orlando Sentinel , which debunked a previous version of Trump 's claim about the crowd `` outside , '' reported that the overflow area outside the Amway Center was `` virtually empty '' as Trump spoke , with only `` a few dozen people in the holding area . '' The paper reported : `` About an hour before the President 's speech , the long lines around the Amway were gone and people could easily walk into the event right up to the start of the rally . ''
The city of Orlando , which owns the arena , issued an official crowd count of 19,792 , just shy of the 20,000 a city spokesperson said would have been let in , the Sentinel reported .
Trump has previously claimed , also falsely , that tens of thousands of people were stuck outside various other campaign events , many of which have been debunked previously
Trump then took a shot at the number of people in the audience when Joe Biden announced his candidacy earlier this year .
`` You look at Biden . They say he had 600 people . That was n't 600 , that was 150 people . That was 150 . ''
Facts First : Independent observers reported that Joe Biden did indeed have 600 people at his first public event after announcing his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination .
The Atlantic said that journalists occupied 100 of the 600 spots at a union hall in Pittsburgh , but that is still 500 non-journalists , not 150 .
Trump accused the Democrats of hypocrisy for their opposition to his proposed border wall .
`` For instance , on the wall : Chuck Schumer was totally in favor of a wall , right Liz ( Cheney ) ? Totally in favor . Everybody : Hillary , everybody . They were all in favor of a wall just a few years ago . ''
Facts First : Some Democrats , not all , voted in 2006 to approve a fence that Trump himself said was much different than the wall he wanted .
It is not true that `` everybody '' in the Democratic Party supported even this fencing . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi voted against . In the Senate , 26 Democrats ( including Schumer and Clinton ) voted yes , 17 voted no .
The law , called the Secure Fence Act , was to authorize 700 miles of fencing on the Mexican border . Trump himself said during the 2016 campaign that this fencing was not comparable to the giant concrete wall he was proposing : `` It was such a little wall , it was such a nothing wall , '' he told Fox News .","(CNN) During a wide-ranging, largely off the cuff speech during his ""social media summit"" Thursday, President Donald Trump made several misleading and downright false claims about social media companies, the census, the economy, crowd sizes and Democrats' past positions on a border wall.

Social media followers

Trump spoke at length about what he falsely suggested was a deliberate attempt by social media companies to prevent him from gaining followers, alleging that ""a lot of bad things are happening.""

Trump said it used to take him a mere ""short number of days"" to gain 100,000 new followers, but it now takes ""10 times as long"" even though, he claimed, his personal brand is ""much hotter"" than it was when he was gaining followers more quickly.

""People come up to me: 'Sir, we want to follow you; they don't let us on,'"" Trump said. He added later: ""I have millions of people, so many people I wouldn't believe it, but I know that we've been blocked. People come up to me and they say, 'Sir, I can't get you. I can't follow you.'""

Facts First: There is no evidence that Twitter or other social media companies have made it difficult for people to follow Trump.

We obviously can't verify what certain people might have told Trump in private about following him on social media, but following him is not complicated: doing so is simply a matter of signing up for an account, searching his name and clicking a single button.

If Trump is not gaining followers as quickly as he used to, that's because fewer people are now trying to follow him. (At the time of his speech, he had 61.9 million followers on Twitter. He had fewer than 13 million a week before his election and fewer than 23 million at the time of his inauguration, according to Factba.se, which tracks Trump-related data. )

Twitter did take followers away from Trump last year, but that was part of a broad purge of suspected fake accounts. The purge also removed followers from the accounts of many other famous people. Trump lost approximately 300,000 followers, far fewer than Barack Obama (more than 2 million) and the Dalai Lama (about 375,000), according to a New York Times count.

When Trump began accusing Twitter last year of malicious behavior over the purge, Twitter issued a statement saying ""many prominent accounts have seen follower counts drop."" It explained that it had removed ""fake accounts and those engaging in malicious behavior"" to improve the health of the service.

Women's unemployment

Trump touted the low unemployment rate for women, saying: ""Women, I think, Kellyanne (Conway), the best in 75 years -- the best unemployment numbers in 75 years.""

Facts First: Trump exaggerated slightly. The women's unemployment Trump exaggerated slightly. The women's unemployment rate for June is 3.6%, a tick above the 3.4% in April and 3.5% in May. Those are excellent numbers, but it has been 66 years since the women's rate has been this low, not 75. Prior to Trump's presidency, the last time the rate fell to 3.6% was October 1953.

Census

While arguing that he should be permitted to include a citizenship question in the 2020 US census, Trump said that the census survey can ask people about the number of beds and toilets they have but not about whether they are citizens.

""They go through houses, they go up, they ring doorbells, they talk to people. How many toilets do they have? How many desks do they have? How many beds? What's their roof made of?"" Trump said. ""The only thing we can't ask is 'Are you a citizen of the United States?'""

Facts First: Trump is wrongly suggesting that the decennial census asks households about the number of toilets in a house. He could be referring to supplemental surveys from the Census Bureau, which do ask questions about living conditions of a small sample of households. If that's the case, then he's still wrong, since these surveys do ask questions of citizenship.

The decennial census -- which counts the US population every ten years and is required by the Constitution -- was last administered in 2010 . That census did not include questions on plumbing, bedrooms, and desks. Instead, the decennial census focuses on questions like age and race and number of occupants in a household.

Trump could be referring to other surveys sent out from the Census Bureau such as the American Community Survey, which is sent to just a fraction of households, about 3.54 million addresses every year.

One of the main functions of the ACS, according the Census Bureau, is to gather ""data that help determine how more than $675 billion in federal and state funds are distributed each year."" The 2019 version of this survey includes questions on the education levels and employment status of those living on the property, as well as the property's computer access, number of rooms, if there is access to hot and cold water and much more.

But the ACS also includes questions on citizenship. ""Is this person a citizen of the United States?"" this year's version asks. So, Trump is wrong to suggest that while you can ask these more specific questions on living conditions you cannot ask a citizenship status question.

On the specifics, Trump's argument lacks facts, and on his larger point he's flatly wrong: the decennial census did not ask about number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and so on.

401(k)s

Trump touted a new record set by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, then made a claim about how much 401(k) retirement plans have increased.

""I don't know if you know but we just hit 27,000 on the Dow. ...The highest in history, for those of you that like the stock market, but the stock market means jobs. I view it as jobs, and I view it as 401(k)s. ... And people with 401(k)s, they're up 72% and 67%, and the wife or the husband, whoever's responsible, the other one says 'you're a genius, you're a great financial investor, darling you're up 77% this year.'""

Facts First: These percentages overstate gains in US stock markets.

It is possible that some people have 401(k)s that are up 77% on the year or since Trump was elected, but stock markets themselves are not up that much. At the close of trading on the day Trump spoke, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up by 16%, the S&P 500 Index by 20%, the Nasdaq by 24%.

The gains are greater if you go back to Trump's election day, as the President often does: 48% for the Dow , 40% for the S&P , 58% for the Nasdaq . Still, none of them approaches 77%.

Crowds, part 1

Trump claimed that there were thousands of people outside his June campaign kickoff rally in Orlando in addition to the large crowd inside.

""We had sort of an opening rally in Orlando, Florida. We had 109,000, maybe more, wanting to come. We were doing as much as we could to keep people not from coming. We had a 21,000-seat stadium, and then with the basketball court, it held many more than that, it was packed. And we had a similar number outside.""

Facts First: There were nowhere close to 21,000 people outside the rally as Trump was speaking. And the arena had a capacity of 20,000 that night, not ""many more than"" 21,000.

The Orlando Sentinel , which debunked a previous version of Trump's claim about the crowd ""outside,"" reported that the overflow area outside the Amway Center was ""virtually empty"" as Trump spoke, with only ""a few dozen people in the holding area."" The paper reported: ""About an hour before the President's speech, the long lines around the Amway were gone and people could easily walk into the event right up to the start of the rally.""

The city of Orlando, which owns the arena, issued an official crowd count of 19,792, just shy of the 20,000 a city spokesperson said would have been let in, the Sentinel reported.

Trump has previously claimed, also falsely, that tens of thousands of people were stuck outside various other campaign events, many of which have been debunked previously

Trump then took a shot at the number of people in the audience when Joe Biden announced his candidacy earlier this year.

Crowds, part 2

""You look at Biden. They say he had 600 people. That wasn't 600, that was 150 people. That was 150.""

Facts First: Independent observers reported that Joe Biden did indeed have 600 people at his first public event after announcing his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination.

The Atlantic said that journalists occupied 100 of the 600 spots at a union hall in Pittsburgh, but that is still 500 non-journalists, not 150.

Democrats and the border wall

Trump accused the Democrats of hypocrisy for their opposition to his proposed border wall.

""For instance, on the wall: Chuck Schumer was totally in favor of a wall, right Liz (Cheney)? Totally in favor. Everybody: Hillary, everybody. They were all in favor of a wall just a few years ago.""

Facts First: Some Democrats, not all, voted in 2006 to approve a fence that Trump himself said was much different than the wall he wanted.

It is not true that ""everybody"" in the Democratic Party supported even this fencing. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi voted against. In the Senate , 26 Democrats (including Schumer and Clinton) voted yes, 17 voted no.

The law, called the Secure Fence Act, was to authorize 700 miles of fencing on the Mexican border. Trump himself said during the 2016 campaign that this fencing was not comparable to the giant concrete wall he was proposing: ""It was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall,"" he told Fox News.

Hazlett, Christian Britschgi, Josh Blackman, Xander Peters, Cosmo Wenman, Joe Setyon, Zuri Davis","Jeff Bezos `` is worried about me , '' grinned Donald Trump back in 2016 while discussing Amazon 's bald-headed billionaire . `` He thinks I would go after him for antitrust , because he 's got a huge antitrust problem because he 's controlling so much . '' President Trump has continued to threaten Amazon and other tech giants with the trust-busting lash . This year , on CNBC , he informatively announced his role model : `` The European Union is suing them all of the time . Well , we should be doing this . They 're our companies . ''
You will not be surprised to hear that Fox News talker Tucker Carlson agrees with Trump . But you might blink when told that he arrived at this agreement via a lecture delivered by Professor Elizabeth Warren . The Massachusetts senator has gained traction in a crowded Democratic presidential field by announcing pre-election antitrust verdicts to bust up Amazon , Apple , Google , and Facebook—no legal proceedings required .
Carlson sprinkles conservative holy water upon Warren 's Plan for Economic Patriotism , saying her `` policy prescriptions make obvious sense . '' Warren would treat the rise of big tech firms like an exploding offshore oil rig : an emergency to be met by capping , closing , and hosing down the fiery mess . Carlson gushes that Warren `` sounds like Trump at his best . ''
This bipartisan pot of pols and pundits is echoing a school of thought known as the `` new structuralism . '' But you 're more likely to hear its nickname : `` hipster antitrust . '' It claims a historical hero in the late Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis , and its manifesto is Lina Khan 's 2017 Yale Law Journal article `` Amazon 's Antitrust Paradox . ''
The antitrust hipsters fear the `` winner take all '' rivalry in tech platforms while romanticizing the drowsy world of `` common carrier '' regulation . As seen in transport and communications , this regime has had its unfortunate place in history . While imposing so-called `` nondiscrimination '' rules on service providers under the auspices of giving everyone equal access , the regulations widely and deeply favor incumbents and legacy technologies at the expense of upstarts and innovation .
In the hipsters ' telling , regulation and antitrust are princes riding white horses to our salvation . The computer company IBM was an unrepentant oligopolist , they say , until it was put on the straight and narrow by a federal antitrust suit in 1969 . That police action opened the market for Microsoft , which then started monopolizing the software business . Thankfully , the 1998 U.S. v. Microsoft suit busted that diabolical plot . If not for this victory for the Department of Justice Antitrust Division , Google would have been nipped in the bud . Alas , Google 's search function then got much too popular , and now it must be disciplined . Indeed , Amazon , Google , Facebook , and Apple have all grown too big for their britches . Each needs to be split up . They would already have been , in fact , had the cop on the beat not dozed off .
This pattern-recognition exercise is a reprise of Justice Brandeis ' early 20th century legal attacks on price-slashing innovators such as A & P , Safeway , Sears , Montgomery Ward , and J.C. Penney . Then , as now , each triggering offense was a daring market breakthrough that consumers flocked to embrace . Legislation procured by those who , like Brandeis , saw these commercial successes as threats did more to promote cartels than to promote competition : Oligopolies flourished under the auspices of the Interstate Commerce Commission ( ICC ) , the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , the Civil Aeronautics Board ( CAB ) , and the U.S. Department of Agriculture , with grim effects . Under the rule of the CAB , for example , air carrier competition was drastically reduced . In one of the `` most bizarre and illuminating chapters in the history of regulation , '' Harvard law professor Louis Jaffe wrote in the Harvard Law Review in 1954 , only 30 percent of air traffic could be sold at coach fares—and that discounting existed only because `` unscheduled '' airlines brazenly evaded a government ban . `` The CAB is completely committed to the existing certificated carriers , '' Jaffe explained .
And while the ICC brought stability to railroads , it did so while creating higher average prices . The agency , which was established in 1887 , was abolished in 1995 for undermining railroad and trucking efficiencies , wasting fuel , savaging the environment , killing economic growth , and waterboarding consumers . With less `` public interest '' and more open market rivalry , shipping costs were slashed , pollution declined , and innovation sprouted . A Brookings Institution study pegged efficiencies at $ 18 billion in 1996 alone , while crediting deregulation for allowing the emergence of new competitors in overnight shipping , including Federal Express .
Waves of deregulation produced protean results elsewhere , too . Legacy markets have been disrupted and powerful incumbents have fallen , with the choices available to consumers proliferating . The emergence of competitive wireless networks—granting 6 billion human beings access to global communications , 5 billion of them new phone subscribers—is itself a prime example of this liberalization . The antitrust hipsters present themselves as populists , but it is a curiously elitist form of populism that would undo the laws that allowed those mass market gains .
Antitrust was recently pushed to advance consumers ' welfare . That was part of the liberalization trend . Now it 's being tugged back to form a support system protecting `` competitors '' —guarding against low prices , escalating quality , and market rivalry .
For Khan , a legal scholar currently based at Columbia University , the problem with today 's market is epitomized by the operations of one firm . Amazon `` generates meager profits , '' electing to keep prices low while `` choosing to expand at a speed and scale that is pushing it into the red , '' she writes . It has risen to become the world 's second most valuable firm , worth about $ 1 trillion , because it is `` at the center of e-commerce '' and owns `` essential infrastructure for a host of other businesses that depend upon it . ''
That infrastructure—a platform spanning the planet—certainly is valuable . Amazon lists more than 400 million product pages from more than 300,000 independent vendors , creating the `` long tail '' of niche goods and services that shoppers adore . Recode reported in 2018 that `` more than 100 million items in the U.S. are now eligible for two-day shipping . '' Most of these are sold by companies other than Amazon , which not only hosts `` rival '' vendors but takes orders , ships products , and collects payments on their behalf . About half of these businesses generate over $ 100,000 a year .
For Khan , Amazon creates competition but also crushes competition . It is ensnared in a maze of conflicts , she says , and it routinely engages in predatory tactics—such as favoring its own listings—that steamroll pesky upstarts to protect Amazon 's ruthless march to world domination . Yet Amazon 's prices have been low for 25 years now . Khan does n't deny that . In fact , it 's what she complains about : The company 's offerings are too good for other sellers to compete with .
There is a germ of truth in Khan 's complaints about Amazon 's conflicts , but she fails to see the ubiquity of conflicts in economic rivalry—and in government regulation , which can worsen outcomes for consumers and the overall economy . Hence , she interprets vertical integration—Amazon supplying an online store and then stocking some of the shelves with its own products—in a naive and counterproductive way .
Every business acquires inputs and then sells outputs . In between , some magical process creates new value . Cooperative deals between suppliers and buyers today may well erupt in rivalrous tension tomorrow . That 's actually a good thing : We want to encourage shifting alliances . Customers change ; technologies advance ; firms learn ; efficiencies evolve . Amazon hosting its retail rivals is no weirder than Costco displaying its own Kirkland champagne side-by-side with Veuve Clicquot or the Dodgers hosting the Giants in Dodger Stadium .
Antitrust scribblers may imagine Amazon squelching independent sellers and stealing their profits , but that 's not the reality according to the vendors . Hundreds of thousands of third-party sellers have made Amazon `` the Everything Store . '' From 1999 to 2018 , Amazon 's own share of the products it sells dropped from 97 percent to 42 percent . And even that overstates Amazon 's vertical integration . Marketplace—the platform for third parties who offer goods through Amazon—now accounts for 68 percent of the platform 's retail revenues .
`` More buyers transacting more often on Amazon will naturally attract third-party sellers , '' eMarketer analyst Andrew Lipsman told TechCrunch last year . `` But because third-party transactions are also more profitable , Amazon has every incentive to make the process as seamless as possible for those selling on the platform . '' In May 2019 , Business Insider headlined the news `` 3rd-party sellers are thriving on Amazon . ''
In Khan 's telling , all the economic forces move in opposite fashion . She recommends a ban on mergers and more aggressive actions to limit or scale back the platform .
Take Amazon 's recent acquisition of Whole Foods for $ 13.7 billion . Khan blasted the combination in a June 2017 New York Times op-ed titled `` Amazon Bites Off Even More Monopoly Power . '' The fear was that a company with 0.8 percent of U.S. grocery sales ( Amazon ) gobbling up a competitor with 1.7 percent ( Whole Foods ) would leave American shoppers powerless to resist . Walmart 's 26 percent share of total grocery sales , not to mention Kroger 's 10 percent or Albertson 's 5 percent , would not constrain the beast . Neither would the fact that , in the year the merger went through , just 3.8 percent of U.S. groceries were sold online .
`` Amazon 's purchase of Whole Foods will expand its dominance and heighten conflicts of interest , '' Khan predicted . `` By bundling services and integrating grocery stores into its logistics network , the company will be able to shut out or disfavor rival grocers and food delivery services . ''
Her predictions have thus far proven wrong : Amazon 's rivals gained after the merger . `` In the past year , '' the Harvard Business Review reported in April 2019 , `` Walmart , Kroger , Costco , and Target have driven down costs and introduced delivery capabilities in new regions , cutting into Amazon 's market share . '' They 're afraid of the online retail giant ? Good .
The rivals ' fortunes may still change . Who knows ? Not Khan , not the Justice Department , not Amazon . Absent demonstrable harm , letting things play out produces robust competition , oodles of innovation , and even new competitors , such as Instacart , launched in 2012 by a former Amazonian . That company boasts that it delivers alcoholic beverages to your home in as little as one hour . Which is , of course , not a moment too soon .
Khan ignores these dynamics . Or rather , she actively opposes them .
Conventional wisdom holds that U.S. corporations are painfully shortsighted . It 's said they scurry about with an eye to quarterly earnings while ignoring the broader horizon . It 's said that this undermines the risk-taking and R & D investments that are needed to unlock better worlds . But Khan launches her 96-page essay with this quote from The New York Times : `` Even as Amazon became one of the largest retailers in the country , it never seemed interested in charging enough to make a profit . Customers celebrated and the competition languished . '' She also quotes the biographer Ida Tarbell , who said that one of John D. Rockefeller 's `` most impressive characteristics [ was ] patience . ''
Back in the day , Khan argues , antitrust policy would have stopped the clear and present danger of Amazon . But free market economists , mostly from the University of Chicago , have twisted the law to focus solely on `` consumer welfare '' as measured by `` prices and outputs . '' And so , she says , monopolies thrive . Things that look to be amazing new efficiencies , driven by economies of scale , are a trick : Predatory tactics displace competitors , steal markets , and dominate entire industries in the long run .
The paradigmatic illustration is Amazon 's acquisition nine years ago of Diapers.com . Yet a close look at her selected case study undercuts the lessons taught in Lina Khan 's academy .
In short : Marc Lore and Vinit Bharara launched the online retailer Quidsi in 2005 . The startup sold baby products online , and its Diapers.com website gained a toehold . In November 2010 , the pair sold their company to Amazon . Khan claims that Amazon actually squished them like a bug , using its massive data intelligence capabilities to crack their strategy . By figuring out how to reduce its own diaper prices , it drove Quidsi to the financial brink and then devoured it via merger in order to eliminate a retail rival . The upstart was vanquished , the monopolist got fatter , and all potential challengers were forewarned .
Khan 's story is sourced from Brad Stone 's 2013 book The Everything Store . Stone reports , but Khan does not , that the story of Amazon 's strategy is in dispute . This missing detail is one among many . But it turns out to be a harmless oversight , because Khan 's own facts , nested in the context of competitive innovation , are indisputably hostile to her theory .
First , there was no barrier to entry . Quidsi got into the business of selling Pampers and Huggies online , which Amazon could not prevent . The newcomer then pioneered innovative methods , particularly in shipping , using boxes that fit orders exactly so as to lower costs . This welcome progress stands in stark contrast to what happens under `` public utility '' regimes in which `` licenses of convenience and necessity '' are routinely denied to upstarts . Airlines , railroads , medical services , trucking , shipping , broadcasting , telecommunications , energy—in every one of these cases , commissions have erected artificial entry barriers deterring competition . Not a single new trunk airline was approved for launch by the Civil Aeronautics Board from 1938 to 1978 . With unregulated diapers sold online , two guys from New Jersey formed a firm and walked right in .
Second , the Jersey boys did a better job of cleaning up the babies ' bottoms . Yes , Amazon sells competing products , and yes , it has bots that relentlessly monitor competitive offers . But by 2010 , Diapers.com was outselling the ogre from Seattle by about four to one . When Lore and Bharara sold to Amazon , they received a payoff of $ 545 million , or about $ 400 million above invested capital . If Amazon is a predator trying to discourage entrants , it is going to need some powerful corporate messaging to overcome the language its cash is speaking .
Third , founder Marc Lore did n't lose his entrepreneurial bent . In 2014 , he founded Jet.com , an online retailer and direct rival to Amazon . In 2016 , he sold that start-up for $ 3.3 billion to Walmart . Lore—a billionaire who bought a $ 43 million flat in one of New York City 's finest buildings in 2018—now heads the brick-and-mortar retailer 's eCommerce division . If this is what Amazon 's economic brutality looks like , quick—let 's crowdfund AdultDiapers.com and get pummeled .
Fourth , the gains for consumers were not just temporary . Khan says Amazon immediately ceased its price discounts on products sold by Diapers.com after absorbing the site . But hers is a vague and selective presentation ; suffice it to say that the evidence would not be admissible in a court of law . I do not have a dataset as extensive as Amazon 's , but online prices for many brands over time can be found on Google . Huggies , Snuggles , Pampers , Luvs , and Seventh Generations were about 18 percent cheaper in online stores ( free delivery with minimum purchase ! ) in 2019 than they were in mid-2010 . Mommies and daddies clicked away—and won . No predatory exclusion , no monopoly , no price hikes to recoup the investment . Just good , clean , bottom-up consumer welfare .
Finally , Khan makes a major concession when she argues ( uncompellingly ) that prices rose after the Amazon-Quidsi merger . Throughout her critique of modern antitrust , she complains about the fact that the law focuses `` primarily on price and output effects as metrics of competition . '' But there 's a good ███ for that , and courts ought to be encouraged to do more of it . These are the indices that impact customers and distinguish efficient rivalry from predatory conduct . Under the latter , prices fall , but only temporarily , and the price increases that come after wipe out the benefits for customers .
So Khan was right to consider Pampers prices as a metric of consumer impact . Alas , she makes no serious commitment to this approach . If she did , she would have to demand that regulatory measures advance their stated purpose and that they do not sabotage the constituency being offered protection . Attacking low prices with antitrust rules that retard innovation and freeze technologies does exactly that .
Even more problematic : As I witnessed up close while testifying as an economic expert retained by the winning side in a class-action suit against a firm found to have engaged in predation , judges can be lost when it comes to what remedies to administer .
`` For much of its history , '' write scholars Joshua Wright , Elyse Dorsey , Jonathan Klick , and Jan M. Rybnicek , `` antitrust has done more harm than good . '' Rulings that block pro-competitive conduct may `` have resounding chilling effects…likely to discourage other firms from engaging in similarly beneficial conduct . '' Leaving an overly dominant firm intact , on the other hand , often creates less social risk , because it generates its own offset : The profits earned by the miscreant announce opportunities for others .
Khan falls into this trap when she offers Quidsi as the quintessential upstart entrant but fails to mention its empirical reality . Or , for that matter , its inspiration : Amazon . Lore and Bharara idolized the online giant . They privately referred to Jeff Bezos as `` sensei '' and wanted to be him . And their decision to get into the game was funded by , among others , Accel Partners , a company flush with early-stage windfalls from Facebook . All these monopolies , so many startups .
The antitrust hipsters ' lodestar , Louis Brandeis , championed local enterprises— '' the small dealers and worthy men , '' as his Supreme Court predecessor Rufus Peckham called them—that found themselves fighting the emerging national chains . To Brandeis , the big retailers ' low prices were a bug , not a feature . In 1915 , the future justice amazed Rep. Alben Barkley ( D–Ky . ) by testifying that volume discounts were `` fraught with very great evil '' and should be banned . `` Knowing the quantity discounts were as old as business itself , '' wrote Thomas McCraw in his Pulitzer Prize–winning Prophets of Regulation ( 1984 ) , Barkley `` could not believe he had heard Brandeis correctly . '' He had .
In this way of thinking , the efficiencies of the Industrial Revolution were a problem we needed government to counter . Brandeis condemned the consumer as `` servile , self-indulgent , indolent , ignorant , '' because she would blithely shop for lower prices and higher quality without concern for the social ramifications . It was an unambiguous loss , he believed , for A & P to displace the local grocer and for Sears , Roebuck and Co. to out-compete the town dry goods shop . Brandeis supported cartels to raise prices and protect inefficient producers . He rejected the interests of the `` supine '' customer , who `` deserves to suffer '' for patronizing vendors based on cost and convenience . As McCraw put it , Brandeis attacked consumer welfare as an objective because `` consumers had betrayed him : They had refused to follow his precepts . '' Instead , they were eagerly buying `` the endless stream of goods that flowed '' from the large , integrated businesses that `` Brandeis so detested . ''
Brandeis ' view nonetheless gained traction . In 1962 , the Supreme Court blocked Brown Shoe ( a company producing 4 percent of U.S. footwear ) from merging with Kinney 's ( a company retailing 1.2 percent ) . The antitrust enforcers then put the kibosh on Vons-Shopping Bag in 1966 , saving America from a supermarket behemoth that would have dominated the Los Angeles retail grocery market by cornering—as the third-largest local seller—7.5 percent of sales . That , the high court said , indicated a `` threatening trend toward concentration . '' One wonders what the justices were drinking , but that may have been answered a few days later , when the Court upheld the Department of Justice 's move to stop a Pabst-Blatz merger as well .
Just to be clear : If the beer market were being monopolized , I would be the first to buy a case for the legal beagle filing suit . But here I 'm not even opening a tab . As the Supreme Court explained : `` In 1958 , the year of the merger , Pabst was the tenth largest brewer in the Nation and Blatz ranked eighteenth . The merger would have made Pabst the Nation 's fifth largest brewer with 4.49 % of the industry 's total sales . By 1961 , three years after the merger , Pabst had increased its share of the beer market to 5.83 % and had become the third-largest brewer in the country . '' The Court ominously noted that their combined shares totaled 23.95 percent of the all-important Wisconsin beer market , raising the prospect of an `` incipient '' monopoly .
Justice William O. Douglas attached a 1966 Washington Post column , written by humorist Art Buchwald , as an appendix to his concurring opinion in the Pabst case . Buchwald 's piece considered a future ( 1978 ) merger case involving the last two companies in America—Samson , controlling all corporate assets west of the Mississippi , and Delilah , owning everything to the east . The essay had the Court finding no competitive issue . An excellent analogy for Pabst-Blatz : After those two companies assume control of all but 94.17 percent of U.S. beer production , what 's left ?
Antitrust hipsters present the free market economists of the University of Chicago as their historical villains . Yet these scholars began their journey not far from Brandeis . The late Nobel laureate George Stigler started as a `` bust 'em up '' guy : In 1952 he wrote an article in Fortune stating the `` case against Big Business '' and calling for the dissolution of General Motors . But through observation and analysis , Stigler 's view progressed until he arrived at an antitrust policy that gave dynamic forces their due and put consumer interests at the center . He came to see government institutions as imperfect , and he posited in a 1971 paper the theory of `` regulatory capture , '' whereby `` regulation is acquired by the industry and is designed and operated primarily for its benefit . ''
Khan claims that ideological motives explain this `` effort to idealize competitive markets and assume that nonintervention was almost always superior to interference . '' Yet a deep and cutting critique of regulation preceded the new Chicago School approach . In 1952 , Harvard 's Samuel P. Huntington wrote in the Yale Law Journal that the `` attitude of the railroads towards the [ Interstate Commerce ] Commission since 1935 can only be described as one of satisfaction , approbation , and confidence . '' Huntington called for abolishing the agency , saying it had lost `` its objectivity and impartiality by becoming dependent upon the support of a single , narrow interest group '' : the railroads .
Jaffe , writing in that 1954 Harvard Law Review article , similarly acknowledged that most regulators had underperformed . Drawing on the extensive writings of former Harvard Law School Dean James Landis , Jaffe noted that administrative supervision of industry was the dream of the Progressive Era and then of the New Deal . But the `` planning thesis took almost no account of the character and psychology of our administrators '' and `` gave too little weight to the dynamism of the industrial system . ''
Cleaning up the regulatory mess fell , in part , to a Cornell economist : the late Alfred Kahn , an earnest New Dealer for all of his days . Appointed by President Jimmy Carter to head the Civil Aeronautics Board in 1977 , Kahn intended to reform the agency . But he found that greater price competition , not to mention service innovation , could not be realized within the model he inherited . Kahn discovered deregulation not by imbibing Chicago School Kool-Aid but through fealty to the public 's actual interests . It was because he took his fiduciary obligations seriously that he sought to overturn the `` common carrier '' approach of the 1938 Air Carriers Act , ultimately ending the agency via bipartisan congressional reform .
Kahn 's early scholarly work channeled Thorsten Veblen , who was as critical of consumers ' choices as Brandeis was . Yet Kahn studied on . He came to see `` that society 's choices are always between or among imperfect systems '' but that markets generated a dynamism , giving them an edge : `` Wherever it seems likely to be effective , even very imperfect competition is preferable to regulation . '' Paring back controls over air routes and fares has resulted in consumer gains conservatively estimated by the Brookings Institution at $ 10 billion annually .
No , air travel is not perfect . Yes , I 've flown United . But it 's all relative . The Civil Aeronautics Board was a comparative disaster for efficiency , innovation , and customers—particularly the low- and middle-income Americans , then earthbound , who now dot the sky .
Policy makers gave the `` common carrier '' theory of regulation a marathon test drive following the 1934 Communications Act . The FCC , under its `` public interest , convenience , or necessity '' standard , enhanced Ma Bell 's market power . That was , literally and practically , `` network neutrality '' —the same philosophy endorsed by Lina Khan as a promising pathway for regulating tech giants today .
How did it work out ? In 1974 , the U.S. Justice Department filed a massive antitrust suit against the company . Settled in 1982 , it dissolved the giant into seven `` Baby Bells '' and an independent AT & T Long Lines .
The ███ for the lawsuit was that AT & T , a `` common carrier , '' was preventing competition by using antidiscrimination rules enforced by the Federal Communications Commission . `` The FCC was trying to block MCI from competing in ordinary long-distance services when the AT & T case was filed by the Department of Justice in 1974 , '' explained Robert Crandall and Cliff Winston of the Brookings Institution in a 2003 Journal of Economic Perspectives article . `` Thus , antitrust policy did not triumph in this case over restrictive practices by a monopolist to block competition , but instead it overcame anticompetitive policies by a federal regulatory agency . ''
There is no secret formula that produces enormous gains from blockbuster innovation without the disruption of old markets and obsolete business models . The `` Great Enrichment '' that economist Deirdre McCloskey describes—an approximately 30-fold increase in capitalist country incomes between 1800 and 2000 , which upended the economic flatline of history—was and is a rough-and-tumble process . That 's why Joseph Schumpeter dubbed it `` creative destruction . ''
There are good reasons to be wary of large organizations of any stripe , including giant tech platforms . But far more dangerous—to consumers , workers , and the economy as a whole—are hipster antitrust promises of a magical fix .","Jeff Bezos ""is worried about me,"" grinned Donald Trump back in 2016 while discussing Amazon's bald-headed billionaire. ""He thinks I would go after him for antitrust, because he's got a huge antitrust problem because he's controlling so much."" President Trump has continued to threaten Amazon and other tech giants with the trust-busting lash. This year, on CNBC, he informatively announced his role model: ""The European Union is suing them all of the time. Well, we should be doing this. They're our companies.""

You will not be surprised to hear that Fox News talker Tucker Carlson agrees with Trump. But you might blink when told that he arrived at this agreement via a lecture delivered by Professor Elizabeth Warren. The Massachusetts senator has gained traction in a crowded Democratic presidential field by announcing pre-election antitrust verdicts to bust up Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook—no legal proceedings required.

Carlson sprinkles conservative holy water upon Warren's Plan for Economic Patriotism, saying her ""policy prescriptions make obvious sense."" Warren would treat the rise of big tech firms like an exploding offshore oil rig: an emergency to be met by capping, closing, and hosing down the fiery mess. Carlson gushes that Warren ""sounds like Trump at his best.""

This bipartisan pot of pols and pundits is echoing a school of thought known as the ""new structuralism."" But you're more likely to hear its nickname: ""hipster antitrust."" It claims a historical hero in the late Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, and its manifesto is Lina Khan's 2017 Yale Law Journal article ""Amazon's Antitrust Paradox.""

The antitrust hipsters fear the ""winner take all"" rivalry in tech platforms while romanticizing the drowsy world of ""common carrier"" regulation. As seen in transport and communications, this regime has had its unfortunate place in history. While imposing so-called ""nondiscrimination"" rules on service providers under the auspices of giving everyone equal access, the regulations widely and deeply favor incumbents and legacy technologies at the expense of upstarts and innovation.

In the hipsters' telling, regulation and antitrust are princes riding white horses to our salvation. The computer company IBM was an unrepentant oligopolist, they say, until it was put on the straight and narrow by a federal antitrust suit in 1969. That police action opened the market for Microsoft, which then started monopolizing the software business. Thankfully, the 1998 U.S. v. Microsoft suit busted that diabolical plot. If not for this victory for the Department of Justice Antitrust Division, Google would have been nipped in the bud. Alas, Google's search function then got much too popular, and now it must be disciplined. Indeed, Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple have all grown too big for their britches. Each needs to be split up. They would already have been, in fact, had the cop on the beat not dozed off.

This pattern-recognition exercise is a reprise of Justice Brandeis' early 20th century legal attacks on price-slashing innovators such as A&P, Safeway, Sears, Montgomery Ward, and J.C. Penney. Then, as now, each triggering offense was a daring market breakthrough that consumers flocked to embrace. Legislation procured by those who, like Brandeis, saw these commercial successes as threats did more to promote cartels than to promote competition: Oligopolies flourished under the auspices of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, with grim effects. Under the rule of the CAB, for example, air carrier competition was drastically reduced. In one of the ""most bizarre and illuminating chapters in the history of regulation,"" Harvard law professor Louis Jaffe wrote in the Harvard Law Review in 1954, only 30 percent of air traffic could be sold at coach fares—and that discounting existed only because ""unscheduled"" airlines brazenly evaded a government ban. ""The CAB is completely committed to the existing certificated carriers,"" Jaffe explained.

And while the ICC brought stability to railroads, it did so while creating higher average prices. The agency, which was established in 1887, was abolished in 1995 for undermining railroad and trucking efficiencies, wasting fuel, savaging the environment, killing economic growth, and waterboarding consumers. With less ""public interest"" and more open market rivalry, shipping costs were slashed, pollution declined, and innovation sprouted. A Brookings Institution study pegged efficiencies at $18 billion in 1996 alone, while crediting deregulation for allowing the emergence of new competitors in overnight shipping, including Federal Express.

Waves of deregulation produced protean results elsewhere, too. Legacy markets have been disrupted and powerful incumbents have fallen, with the choices available to consumers proliferating. The emergence of competitive wireless networks—granting 6 billion human beings access to global communications, 5 billion of them new phone subscribers—is itself a prime example of this liberalization. The antitrust hipsters present themselves as populists, but it is a curiously elitist form of populism that would undo the laws that allowed those mass market gains.

Antitrust was recently pushed to advance consumers' welfare. That was part of the liberalization trend. Now it's being tugged back to form a support system protecting ""competitors""—guarding against low prices, escalating quality, and market rivalry.

Amazon Crime

For Khan, a legal scholar currently based at Columbia University, the problem with today's market is epitomized by the operations of one firm. Amazon ""generates meager profits,"" electing to keep prices low while ""choosing to expand at a speed and scale that is pushing it into the red,"" she writes. It has risen to become the world's second most valuable firm, worth about $1 trillion, because it is ""at the center of e-commerce"" and owns ""essential infrastructure for a host of other businesses that depend upon it.""

That infrastructure—a platform spanning the planet—certainly is valuable. Amazon lists more than 400 million product pages from more than 300,000 independent vendors, creating the ""long tail"" of niche goods and services that shoppers adore. Recode reported in 2018 that ""more than 100 million items in the U.S. are now eligible for two-day shipping."" Most of these are sold by companies other than Amazon, which not only hosts ""rival"" vendors but takes orders, ships products, and collects payments on their behalf. About half of these businesses generate over $100,000 a year.

For Khan, Amazon creates competition but also crushes competition. It is ensnared in a maze of conflicts, she says, and it routinely engages in predatory tactics—such as favoring its own listings—that steamroll pesky upstarts to protect Amazon's ruthless march to world domination. Yet Amazon's prices have been low for 25 years now. Khan doesn't deny that. In fact, it's what she complains about: The company's offerings are too good for other sellers to compete with.

There is a germ of truth in Khan's complaints about Amazon's conflicts, but she fails to see the ubiquity of conflicts in economic rivalry—and in government regulation, which can worsen outcomes for consumers and the overall economy. Hence, she interprets vertical integration—Amazon supplying an online store and then stocking some of the shelves with its own products—in a naive and counterproductive way.

Every business acquires inputs and then sells outputs. In between, some magical process creates new value. Cooperative deals between suppliers and buyers today may well erupt in rivalrous tension tomorrow. That's actually a good thing: We want to encourage shifting alliances. Customers change; technologies advance; firms learn; efficiencies evolve. Amazon hosting its retail rivals is no weirder than Costco displaying its own Kirkland champagne side-by-side with Veuve Clicquot or the Dodgers hosting the Giants in Dodger Stadium.

Antitrust scribblers may imagine Amazon squelching independent sellers and stealing their profits, but that's not the reality according to the vendors. Hundreds of thousands of third-party sellers have made Amazon ""the Everything Store."" From 1999 to 2018, Amazon's own share of the products it sells dropped from 97 percent to 42 percent. And even that overstates Amazon's vertical integration. Marketplace—the platform for third parties who offer goods through Amazon—now accounts for 68 percent of the platform's retail revenues.

""More buyers transacting more often on Amazon will naturally attract third-party sellers,"" eMarketer analyst Andrew Lipsman told TechCrunch last year. ""But because third-party transactions are also more profitable, Amazon has every incentive to make the process as seamless as possible for those selling on the platform."" In May 2019, Business Insider headlined the news ""3rd-party sellers are thriving on Amazon.""

In Khan's telling, all the economic forces move in opposite fashion. She recommends a ban on mergers and more aggressive actions to limit or scale back the platform.

Take Amazon's recent acquisition of Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. Khan blasted the combination in a June 2017 New York Times op-ed titled ""Amazon Bites Off Even More Monopoly Power."" The fear was that a company with 0.8 percent of U.S. grocery sales (Amazon) gobbling up a competitor with 1.7 percent (Whole Foods) would leave American shoppers powerless to resist. Walmart's 26 percent share of total grocery sales, not to mention Kroger's 10 percent or Albertson's 5 percent, would not constrain the beast. Neither would the fact that, in the year the merger went through, just 3.8 percent of U.S. groceries were sold online.

""Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods will expand its dominance and heighten conflicts of interest,"" Khan predicted. ""By bundling services and integrating grocery stores into its logistics network, the company will be able to shut out or disfavor rival grocers and food delivery services.""

Her predictions have thus far proven wrong: Amazon's rivals gained after the merger. ""In the past year,"" the Harvard Business Review reported in April 2019, ""Walmart, Kroger, Costco, and Target have driven down costs and introduced delivery capabilities in new regions, cutting into Amazon's market share."" They're afraid of the online retail giant? Good.

The rivals' fortunes may still change. Who knows? Not Khan, not the Justice Department, not Amazon. Absent demonstrable harm, letting things play out produces robust competition, oodles of innovation, and even new competitors, such as Instacart, launched in 2012 by a former Amazonian. That company boasts that it delivers alcoholic beverages to your home in as little as one hour. Which is, of course, not a moment too soon.

Khan ignores these dynamics. Or rather, she actively opposes them.

Conventional wisdom holds that U.S. corporations are painfully shortsighted. It's said they scurry about with an eye to quarterly earnings while ignoring the broader horizon. It's said that this undermines the risk-taking and R&D investments that are needed to unlock better worlds. But Khan launches her 96-page essay with this quote from The New York Times: ""Even as Amazon became one of the largest retailers in the country, it never seemed interested in charging enough to make a profit. Customers celebrated and the competition languished."" She also quotes the biographer Ida Tarbell, who said that one of John D. Rockefeller's ""most impressive characteristics [was] patience.""

The Fable of the Diapers

Back in the day, Khan argues, antitrust policy would have stopped the clear and present danger of Amazon. But free market economists, mostly from the University of Chicago, have twisted the law to focus solely on ""consumer welfare"" as measured by ""prices and outputs."" And so, she says, monopolies thrive. Things that look to be amazing new efficiencies, driven by economies of scale, are a trick: Predatory tactics displace competitors, steal markets, and dominate entire industries in the long run.

The paradigmatic illustration is Amazon's acquisition nine years ago of Diapers.com. Yet a close look at her selected case study undercuts the lessons taught in Lina Khan's academy.

In short: Marc Lore and Vinit Bharara launched the online retailer Quidsi in 2005. The startup sold baby products online, and its Diapers.com website gained a toehold. In November 2010, the pair sold their company to Amazon. Khan claims that Amazon actually squished them like a bug, using its massive data intelligence capabilities to crack their strategy. By figuring out how to reduce its own diaper prices, it drove Quidsi to the financial brink and then devoured it via merger in order to eliminate a retail rival. The upstart was vanquished, the monopolist got fatter, and all potential challengers were forewarned.

Khan's story is sourced from Brad Stone's 2013 book The Everything Store. Stone reports, but Khan does not, that the story of Amazon's strategy is in dispute. This missing detail is one among many. But it turns out to be a harmless oversight, because Khan's own facts, nested in the context of competitive innovation, are indisputably hostile to her theory.

First, there was no barrier to entry. Quidsi got into the business of selling Pampers and Huggies online, which Amazon could not prevent. The newcomer then pioneered innovative methods, particularly in shipping, using boxes that fit orders exactly so as to lower costs. This welcome progress stands in stark contrast to what happens under ""public utility"" regimes in which ""licenses of convenience and necessity"" are routinely denied to upstarts. Airlines, railroads, medical services, trucking, shipping, broadcasting, telecommunications, energy—in every one of these cases, commissions have erected artificial entry barriers deterring competition. Not a single new trunk airline was approved for launch by the Civil Aeronautics Board from 1938 to 1978. With unregulated diapers sold online, two guys from New Jersey formed a firm and walked right in.

Second, the Jersey boys did a better job of cleaning up the babies' bottoms. Yes, Amazon sells competing products, and yes, it has bots that relentlessly monitor competitive offers. But by 2010, Diapers.com was outselling the ogre from Seattle by about four to one. When Lore and Bharara sold to Amazon, they received a payoff of $545 million, or about $400 million above invested capital. If Amazon is a predator trying to discourage entrants, it is going to need some powerful corporate messaging to overcome the language its cash is speaking.

Third, founder Marc Lore didn't lose his entrepreneurial bent. In 2014, he founded Jet.com, an online retailer and direct rival to Amazon. In 2016, he sold that start-up for $3.3 billion to Walmart. Lore—a billionaire who bought a $43 million flat in one of New York City's finest buildings in 2018—now heads the brick-and-mortar retailer's eCommerce division. If this is what Amazon's economic brutality looks like, quick—let's crowdfund AdultDiapers.com and get pummeled.

Fourth, the gains for consumers were not just temporary. Khan says Amazon immediately ceased its price discounts on products sold by Diapers.com after absorbing the site. But hers is a vague and selective presentation; suffice it to say that the evidence would not be admissible in a court of law. I do not have a dataset as extensive as Amazon's, but online prices for many brands over time can be found on Google. Huggies, Snuggles, Pampers, Luvs, and Seventh Generations were about 18 percent cheaper in online stores (free delivery with minimum purchase!) in 2019 than they were in mid-2010. Mommies and daddies clicked away—and won. No predatory exclusion, no monopoly, no price hikes to recoup the investment. Just good, clean, bottom-up consumer welfare.

Finally, Khan makes a major concession when she argues (uncompellingly) that prices rose after the Amazon-Quidsi merger. Throughout her critique of modern antitrust, she complains about the fact that the law focuses ""primarily on price and output effects as metrics of competition."" But there's a good reason for that, and courts ought to be encouraged to do more of it. These are the indices that impact customers and distinguish efficient rivalry from predatory conduct. Under the latter, prices fall, but only temporarily, and the price increases that come after wipe out the benefits for customers.

So Khan was right to consider Pampers prices as a metric of consumer impact. Alas, she makes no serious commitment to this approach. If she did, she would have to demand that regulatory measures advance their stated purpose and that they do not sabotage the constituency being offered protection. Attacking low prices with antitrust rules that retard innovation and freeze technologies does exactly that.

Even more problematic: As I witnessed up close while testifying as an economic expert retained by the winning side in a class-action suit against a firm found to have engaged in predation, judges can be lost when it comes to what remedies to administer.

""For much of its history,"" write scholars Joshua Wright, Elyse Dorsey, Jonathan Klick, and Jan M. Rybnicek, ""antitrust has done more harm than good."" Rulings that block pro-competitive conduct may ""have resounding chilling effects…likely to discourage other firms from engaging in similarly beneficial conduct."" Leaving an overly dominant firm intact, on the other hand, often creates less social risk, because it generates its own offset: The profits earned by the miscreant announce opportunities for others.

Khan falls into this trap when she offers Quidsi as the quintessential upstart entrant but fails to mention its empirical reality. Or, for that matter, its inspiration: Amazon. Lore and Bharara idolized the online giant. They privately referred to Jeff Bezos as ""sensei"" and wanted to be him. And their decision to get into the game was funded by, among others, Accel Partners, a company flush with early-stage windfalls from Facebook. All these monopolies, so many startups.

Brandeis' Folly

The antitrust hipsters' lodestar, Louis Brandeis, championed local enterprises—""the small dealers and worthy men,"" as his Supreme Court predecessor Rufus Peckham called them—that found themselves fighting the emerging national chains. To Brandeis, the big retailers' low prices were a bug, not a feature. In 1915, the future justice amazed Rep. Alben Barkley (D–Ky.) by testifying that volume discounts were ""fraught with very great evil"" and should be banned. ""Knowing the quantity discounts were as old as business itself,"" wrote Thomas McCraw in his Pulitzer Prize–winning Prophets of Regulation (1984), Barkley ""could not believe he had heard Brandeis correctly."" He had.

In this way of thinking, the efficiencies of the Industrial Revolution were a problem we needed government to counter. Brandeis condemned the consumer as ""servile, self-indulgent, indolent, ignorant,"" because she would blithely shop for lower prices and higher quality without concern for the social ramifications. It was an unambiguous loss, he believed, for A&P to displace the local grocer and for Sears, Roebuck and Co. to out-compete the town dry goods shop. Brandeis supported cartels to raise prices and protect inefficient producers. He rejected the interests of the ""supine"" customer, who ""deserves to suffer"" for patronizing vendors based on cost and convenience. As McCraw put it, Brandeis attacked consumer welfare as an objective because ""consumers had betrayed him: They had refused to follow his precepts."" Instead, they were eagerly buying ""the endless stream of goods that flowed"" from the large, integrated businesses that ""Brandeis so detested.""

Brandeis' view nonetheless gained traction. In 1962, the Supreme Court blocked Brown Shoe (a company producing 4 percent of U.S. footwear) from merging with Kinney's (a company retailing 1.2 percent). The antitrust enforcers then put the kibosh on Vons-Shopping Bag in 1966, saving America from a supermarket behemoth that would have dominated the Los Angeles retail grocery market by cornering—as the third-largest local seller—7.5 percent of sales. That, the high court said, indicated a ""threatening trend toward concentration."" One wonders what the justices were drinking, but that may have been answered a few days later, when the Court upheld the Department of Justice's move to stop a Pabst-Blatz merger as well.

Just to be clear: If the beer market were being monopolized, I would be the first to buy a case for the legal beagle filing suit. But here I'm not even opening a tab. As the Supreme Court explained: ""In 1958, the year of the merger, Pabst was the tenth largest brewer in the Nation and Blatz ranked eighteenth. The merger would have made Pabst the Nation's fifth largest brewer with 4.49% of the industry's total sales. By 1961, three years after the merger, Pabst had increased its share of the beer market to 5.83% and had become the third-largest brewer in the country."" The Court ominously noted that their combined shares totaled 23.95 percent of the all-important Wisconsin beer market, raising the prospect of an ""incipient"" monopoly.

Justice William O. Douglas attached a 1966 Washington Post column, written by humorist Art Buchwald, as an appendix to his concurring opinion in the Pabst case. Buchwald's piece considered a future (1978) merger case involving the last two companies in America—Samson, controlling all corporate assets west of the Mississippi, and Delilah, owning everything to the east. The essay had the Court finding no competitive issue. An excellent analogy for Pabst-Blatz: After those two companies assume control of all but 94.17 percent of U.S. beer production, what's left?

Beware the Big Fix

Antitrust hipsters present the free market economists of the University of Chicago as their historical villains. Yet these scholars began their journey not far from Brandeis. The late Nobel laureate George Stigler started as a ""bust 'em up"" guy: In 1952 he wrote an article in Fortune stating the ""case against Big Business"" and calling for the dissolution of General Motors. But through observation and analysis, Stigler's view progressed until he arrived at an antitrust policy that gave dynamic forces their due and put consumer interests at the center. He came to see government institutions as imperfect, and he posited in a 1971 paper the theory of ""regulatory capture,"" whereby ""regulation is acquired by the industry and is designed and operated primarily for its benefit.""

Khan claims that ideological motives explain this ""effort to idealize competitive markets and assume that nonintervention was almost always superior to interference."" Yet a deep and cutting critique of regulation preceded the new Chicago School approach. In 1952, Harvard's Samuel P. Huntington wrote in the Yale Law Journal that the ""attitude of the railroads towards the [Interstate Commerce] Commission since 1935 can only be described as one of satisfaction, approbation, and confidence."" Huntington called for abolishing the agency, saying it had lost ""its objectivity and impartiality by becoming dependent upon the support of a single, narrow interest group"": the railroads.

Jaffe, writing in that 1954 Harvard Law Review article, similarly acknowledged that most regulators had underperformed. Drawing on the extensive writings of former Harvard Law School Dean James Landis, Jaffe noted that administrative supervision of industry was the dream of the Progressive Era and then of the New Deal. But the ""planning thesis took almost no account of the character and psychology of our administrators"" and ""gave too little weight to the dynamism of the industrial system.""

Cleaning up the regulatory mess fell, in part, to a Cornell economist: the late Alfred Kahn, an earnest New Dealer for all of his days. Appointed by President Jimmy Carter to head the Civil Aeronautics Board in 1977, Kahn intended to reform the agency. But he found that greater price competition, not to mention service innovation, could not be realized within the model he inherited. Kahn discovered deregulation not by imbibing Chicago School Kool-Aid but through fealty to the public's actual interests. It was because he took his fiduciary obligations seriously that he sought to overturn the ""common carrier"" approach of the 1938 Air Carriers Act, ultimately ending the agency via bipartisan congressional reform.

Kahn's early scholarly work channeled Thorsten Veblen, who was as critical of consumers' choices as Brandeis was. Yet Kahn studied on. He came to see ""that society's choices are always between or among imperfect systems"" but that markets generated a dynamism, giving them an edge: ""Wherever it seems likely to be effective, even very imperfect competition is preferable to regulation."" Paring back controls over air routes and fares has resulted in consumer gains conservatively estimated by the Brookings Institution at $10 billion annually.

No, air travel is not perfect. Yes, I've flown United. But it's all relative. The Civil Aeronautics Board was a comparative disaster for efficiency, innovation, and customers—particularly the low- and middle-income Americans, then earthbound, who now dot the sky.

Policy makers gave the ""common carrier"" theory of regulation a marathon test drive following the 1934 Communications Act. The FCC, under its ""public interest, convenience, or necessity"" standard, enhanced Ma Bell's market power. That was, literally and practically, ""network neutrality""—the same philosophy endorsed by Lina Khan as a promising pathway for regulating tech giants today.

How did it work out? In 1974, the U.S. Justice Department filed a massive antitrust suit against the company. Settled in 1982, it dissolved the giant into seven ""Baby Bells"" and an independent AT&T Long Lines.

The reason for the lawsuit was that AT&T, a ""common carrier,"" was preventing competition by using antidiscrimination rules enforced by the Federal Communications Commission. ""The FCC was trying to block MCI from competing in ordinary long-distance services when the AT&T case was filed by the Department of Justice in 1974,"" explained Robert Crandall and Cliff Winston of the Brookings Institution in a 2003 Journal of Economic Perspectives article. ""Thus, antitrust policy did not triumph in this case over restrictive practices by a monopolist to block competition, but instead it overcame anticompetitive policies by a federal regulatory agency.""

There is no secret formula that produces enormous gains from blockbuster innovation without the disruption of old markets and obsolete business models. The ""Great Enrichment"" that economist Deirdre McCloskey describes—an approximately 30-fold increase in capitalist country incomes between 1800 and 2000, which upended the economic flatline of history—was and is a rough-and-tumble process. That's why Joseph Schumpeter dubbed it ""creative destruction.""

There are good reasons to be wary of large organizations of any stripe, including giant tech platforms. But far more dangerous—to consumers, workers, and the economy as a whole—are hipster antitrust promises of a magical fix.",www.reason.com,right,C0FrXeChfZa4Op4M

Socolow , author of Six Minutes in Berlin : Broadcast Spectacle and Rowing Gold at the Nazi Olympics , is an associate professor of communication and journalism at the University of Maine .
Margaret Sullivan was having fun . The Washington Post media critic and former public editor of the New York Times collaborated in the production of a humorous musical video on TikTok earlier this month . “ You hardened journos may think this is pointless , ” she tweeted , “ but the street cred I now have with my 12-year-old twin goddaughters ... ” A few days later , another Washington Post TikTok popped up , tweeted by Dave Jorgenson , the Post ’ s in-house TikTok expert . In it , happy newsroom faces flash by in a series of quick cuts , with the notable exception of a deadpan Marty Baron , the paper ’ s executive editor .
Set to upbeat music , these quirky videos seem relatively harmless . They ’ re simple promotional vehicles , and they attract young TikTok-loving audiences . But America ’ s journalists , like America ’ s youth , are falling in love with the most effective medium ever introduced to extend Chinese media practices into the United States . Journalists should not be promoting a platform with a documented history of political censorship . Nor should journalists use TikTok as a news medium , because TikTok—unlike other attempts to extend authoritarian media globally , such as RT ( Russia Today ) —relies on its users ’ ignorance of its origins and practices . How many teens , or journalists , are aware TikTok ’ s Chinese parent company , Bytedance , paid what was at the time the largest fine in Federal Trade Commission history for invading the privacy of underage users ?
TikTok seems like a great new media story , and , in some ways , it is . For a relatively new social media platform , TikTok ’ s numbers are staggering . It is the No . 1 app downloaded in the iOS store , and it ’ s estimated that in the first quarter of 2019 , more than 220 million TikTok app downloads occurred between Google Play and Apple ’ s iOS store . Funny TikTok memes pop up on Twitter , Facebook and Instagram , as well as in its proprietary app . If TikTok seems like it ’ s everywhere these days , that ’ s because Bytedance spends a fortune to keep teens hooked and to keep everyone else talking about it . In September , TikTok was the top advertiser on Snapchat , and the second-largest advertiser on Youtube . The Wall Street Journal reports that Bytedance plans to spend an astounding $ 1 billion advertising TikTok this year .
But from a journalistic perspective , the question of what can ’ t be found on TikTok is more important than the quirky music videos that dominate the app . TikTok , which is called Douyin in China , is the first successful global social media giant pioneered domestically under the Chinese censorship regime , and since the app ’ s introduction , questions have swirled about what videos are allowed to appear on the platform . According to internal documents describing TikTok ’ s guidelines obtained by the Guardian—policies that TikTok now claims are outdated and no longer employed—TikTok censored videos mentioning taboo topics in China , such as Tiananmen Square , Tibetan and Taiwanese independence and the Falun Gong . Likewise , videos and hashtags about the Hong Kong protests “ barely exist on TikTok , ” the Washington Post noted . A former TikTok content moderator told the New York Times that , in the newspaper ’ s words , “ managers in the United States had instructed moderators to hide videos that included any political messages or themes , not just those related to China . ”
TikTok is both an audacious attempt to extend Chinese global media reach and a fun app that promotes joy . Those two realities aren ’ t mutually exclusive . In fact , they ’ re symbiotic . According to the documents obtained by the Guardian , TikTok censored numerous subjects that extend beyond the obvious topics deemed dangerous to the Chinese state . According to the Guardian ’ s reporting on the directives in the documents , TikTok suppressed videos about “ a specific list of 20 ‘ foreign leaders or sensitive figures ’ including Kim Jong-il , Kim Il-sung , Mahatma Gandhi , Vladimir Putin , Donald Trump , Barack Obama , Kim Jong-un , [ and ] Shinzo Abe. ” Think of how much social media vitriol is generated by figures on that list , and it ’ s easy to understand why a fun app would want to blacklist those politically divisive figures .
After the documents were revealed , the company issued a statement denying it continues its previous policies . “ Let us be very clear , ” the company said , “ TikTok does not remove content based on sensitivities related to China . We have never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content and we would not do so if asked . Period . Our U.S. moderation team , which is led out of California , reviews content for adherence to our U.S. policies—just like other U.S. companies in our space . We are not influenced by any foreign government , including the Chinese government . ”
Still , despite TikTok ’ s new claims to be observing standard U.S. media practices , it ’ s clear that until very recently TikTok more closely monitored its content than its American social media competitors did . Even if TikTok might not formally remove content , the former content moderator interviewed by the New York Times noted that TikTok employed what ’ s commonly known as “ shadow banning , ” a practice that would allow “ such political posts to remain on users ’ profile pages but … prevent them from being shared more widely in TikTok ’ s main video feed . ”
The global debate over the tension between free expression and social harmony is seemingly playing out everywhere today . China ’ s enormous economic leverage has created new parameters for conduct and behavior by business partners seeking access to the Chinese market . Just as the NBA had to very carefully navigate a tweet by a Houston Rockets executive supporting the Hong Kong protests that infuriated the Chinese state , so too must Hollywood producers , video game corporations , book and newspaper publishers , and numerous other businesses navigate Chinese censorship demands . These demands are becoming more common and more insistent , and on platforms like TikTok , they ’ ll no doubt continue to emerge .
Chinese censorship has gone global . Just as the U.S. government spent the second half of the 20th century encouraging the global expansion of American values , such as freedom of expression , the Chinese government has now opened the first half of the 21st century by promoting global restrictions intended to ensure approving portrayals of Chinese state authority . The consequences of this evolution in global media culture arise almost daily . When Facebook ’ s Mark Zuckerberg proclaims the importance of free speech , as he did recently in a speech at Georgetown University , his implicit target is the Chinese regime that bans Facebook , not progressives who want Facebook to more tightly regulate political advertising and hate speech . Facebook , it should be noted , will soon launch “ Lasso , ” a direct competitor to TikTok .
In recent public pronouncements and congressional hearings , some U.S. politicians argue Twitter and Facebook are , in fact , doing too little to combat the dangerous spread of misinformation and inflammatory propaganda . Under this line of thinking , moderation policies like TikTok ’ s might offer a remedy to America 's social media ills . Senator Kamala Harris , for example , has called for Twitter to shutter President Donald Trump ’ s account because of what she says are his violations of Twitter ’ s terms of service . Zuckerberg had no answer when Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked him whether Facebook would prohibit political advertisements featuring provable and obvious lies .
This battle between free expression and policing of content is playing out within TikTok , too . The Wall Street Journal recently reported that ISIS uploaded gruesome torture and beheading videos—set to danceable music and accompanied with celebratory emojis—to TikTok . The videos were not detected and deleted by TikTok until the newspaper made the company aware of their existence . By then , they had been shared thousands of times . When terrorists and criminals violate terms of service by spreading messages or portraying crimes that directly inspire violence through algorithmic networks , some level of content control might be deemed legitimate even by libertarian critics . Questions like these speak to the most fundamental notions of what constitutes an ethical and responsible public sphere and how a society should organize and regulate its media .
Democracy and efficiency often sit in conflict . The issues arising with TikTok , Facebook and Twitter are forcing every nation and society to calibrate its tolerance for media freedom on a spectrum that runs from the protection of liberty through the encouragement of accuracy to the enforcement of harmony .
It ’ s the responsibility of journalists to explain this context , and right now , they ’ re falling down on the job . Not long ago , the New York Times published a largely celebratory article about TikTok and its embrace by American high school students and educators . The reporter , Taylor Lorenz , noted parenthetically that TikTok ’ s corporate owner Bytedance is a “ Chinese tech conglomerate , ” but nowhere was TikTok ’ s history of censorship of content inimical to the Chinese state ’ s authority mentioned .
Perhaps more important , nowhere did Lorenz mention TikTok paid a $ 5.7 million fine to the U.S. government earlier this year . The fine , paid to settle violations identified by the FTC , involved the illegal collection of “ names , email addresses , pictures and locations of kids under age 13 , ” as the Washington Post reported , adding that it was “ a record penalty for violations of the nation ’ s child privacy law. ” One would think a feature article celebrating a social media app ’ s enormous popularity among American teens would note that it had not only demographically targeted users younger than 13 , but that it had also admitted illegally collecting information about them .
For users who might consider employing TikTok in schools—and news sites—around America , the inclusion of such relevant information is essential . The general tone of the piece would not have to change at all ; TikTok is , in many ways , a liberating social technology that brings much joy to the lives of millions of American teenagers . But it ’ s also a Chinese social media program that ’ s settled with the FTC for illegally collecting information on underage users , has a history of censoring user-generated content , and is now said to be under investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States , a governmental review panel . That national security investigation is looking into how the app sends data back to China .
Just as any article about Facebook would be incomplete if it ignored Facebook ’ s history of apologies for admitted privacy violations , any article about TikTok that omits its record of censorship and illegal behavior is irresponsible .
This might be the juncture where TikTok and its American counterparts meet .

Yet it seems clear all social media—whether TikTok , Weibo , Facebook or Twitter—privilege state or corporate authority above the public ’ s interest .

technology,Politico,0,https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/22/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign-479351,Cambridge Analytica boss went from 'aromatics' to psyops to Trump's campaign,2018-03-22,"Josh Meyer, Steven Overly, Jack Shafer","Long before the political data firm he oversees , Cambridge Analytica , helped Donald Trump become president , Nigel Oakes tried a very different form of influencing human behavior . It was called “ marketing aromatics , ” or the use of smells to make consumers spend more money .
In the decades since , the Eton-educated British businessman has styled himself as an expert on a wide variety of “ mind-bending ” techniques — from scents to psychological warfare to campaign politics .
But some 25 years after his foray into aromatics , a bad odor has arisen around his use of data to influence voter behavior . Oakes and his partners , who include Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix , are under intense scrutiny over their methods in the 2016 campaign , including the alleged improper use of Facebook data . Some news reports have also found links to Russia that the company has downplayed .
Oakes and SCL Group , the company he co-founded in 2005 along with Nix , have now drawn the interest of congressional officials . Three Republican senators wrote Oakes a letter this week requesting information and a briefing related to Facebook ’ s sudden suspension last Friday of Cambridge Analytica , which is a closely affiliated subsidiary of SCL .
The request — from Senate Commerce Committee members John Thune of South Dakota , Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Jerry Moran of Kansas — came after recent allegations that Cambridge Analytica used inappropriately harvested private Facebook data on nearly 50 million users and exploited the information to assist President Donald Trump ’ s 2016 campaign .

That has triggered wider questions about whether Cambridge Analytica , whose board once included former Trump political strategist Steve Bannon , might have played some role in the Kremlin ’ s scheme to manipulate U.S. social media in 2016 . The company denies that .
Captured on an undercover video by Britain ’ s Channel 4 News , Nix boasted that the firm “ did all the research , all the data , all the analytics , all the targeting , ” for the Trump campaign , adding that “ our data informed all the strategy. ” ( Trump officials call that an exaggeration . )
Adding to the concern is the role of Aleksandr Kogan , a Russian-born researcher at Cambridge University who collected the Facebook data without disclosing that it would be used commercially , and who was also working for a university in St. Petersburg , Russia , at the time . Cambridge Analytica also reportedly discussed a business relationship in 2014 and 2015 with the Kremlin-connected Russian oil giant Lukoil , which expressed interest in how data is used to target American voters , according to The New York Times .
The recent flurry of coverage has barely mentioned the 55-year-old Oakes , a virtual unknown in the U.S. but someone who is more familiar in Great Britain , in part because of his relationship in the 1990s with a member of the royal Windsor family .
But data analytics experts described Oakes as a hidden hand running both SCL and Cambridge Analytica .
“ Anyone right now that is focusing on the problems with Cambridge Analytica should be backtracking to the source , which is Nigel Oakes , ” said Sam Woolley , research director of the Digital Intelligence Lab at the Silicon Valley-based Institute for the Future .
“ My research has shown that Cambridge Analytica is the tip of the iceberg of Nigel Oakes ’ empire of psy-ops and information ops around the world , ” said Woolley , whose research aims to help protect democracy from the nefarious use of rapidly evolving communications technology . “ As you start to dig into that , you find out a lot of very concerning things . ”
Woolley said he attended a Cambridge Analytica “ meet-up ” in April 2016 during the New York presidential primary in New York . At the time , the company was working for another candidate , Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-Texas ) , and gave a wide-ranging overview of their activities , Woolley said .
It was clear from the session that the two companies are completely intertwined , Woolley said . He recalled that Cambridge Analytica leaders “ conflated all of their work with SCL ’ s work , ” including in several overseas elections . Based on his ongoing research , he described the two firms as selling “ political marketing to the highest bidder , whether you ’ re in government , the military or politics , even authoritarian ” regimes .
Oakes and SCL Group did not return calls seeking comment through a spokesperson .
SCL Group — like its predecessor , Strategic Communication Laboratories , which Oakes co-founded in 1993 — is no stranger to controversies related to foreign elections , including in connection with alleged dirty tricks it has allegedly employed on behalf of political clients from Europe to Africa and Asia .
The company also made headlines in 2005 when it billed itself at a global arms fair in London as the first private company to provide psychological warfare services , or “ psyops , ” to the British military .
At the time , Oakes , as chief executive , said he was confident that psyops could shorten military conflicts and that governments would buy such a service , which SCL had provided commercially .

“ We ought to bring Alexander Nix back and , quite frankly , the other Cambridge Analytica witnesses that had been on our witness list . Still a lot of questions . ”","Long before the political data firm he oversees, Cambridge Analytica, helped Donald Trump become president, Nigel Oakes tried a very different form of influencing human behavior. It was called “marketing aromatics,” or the use of smells to make consumers spend more money.

In the decades since, the Eton-educated British businessman has styled himself as an expert on a wide variety of “mind-bending” techniques — from scents to psychological warfare to campaign politics.

But some 25 years after his foray into aromatics, a bad odor has arisen around his use of data to influence voter behavior. Oakes and his partners, who include Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, are under intense scrutiny over their methods in the 2016 campaign, including the alleged improper use of Facebook data. Some news reports have also found links to Russia that the company has downplayed.

Oakes and SCL Group, the company he co-founded in 2005 along with Nix, have now drawn the interest of congressional officials. Three Republican senators wrote Oakes a letter this week requesting information and a briefing related to Facebook’s sudden suspension last Friday of Cambridge Analytica, which is a closely affiliated subsidiary of SCL.

The request — from Senate Commerce Committee members John Thune of South Dakota, Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Jerry Moran of Kansas — came after recent allegations that Cambridge Analytica used inappropriately harvested private Facebook data on nearly 50 million users and exploited the information to assist President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign.

That has triggered wider questions about whether Cambridge Analytica, whose board once included former Trump political strategist Steve Bannon, might have played some role in the Kremlin’s scheme to manipulate U.S. social media in 2016. The company denies that.

Captured on an undercover video by Britain’s Channel 4 News, Nix boasted that the firm “did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting,” for the Trump campaign, adding that “our data informed all the strategy.” (Trump officials call that an exaggeration.)

Adding to the concern is the role of Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-born researcher at Cambridge University who collected the Facebook data without disclosing that it would be used commercially, and who was also working for a university in St. Petersburg, Russia, at the time. Cambridge Analytica also reportedly discussed a business relationship in 2014 and 2015 with the Kremlin-connected Russian oil giant Lukoil, which expressed interest in how data is used to target American voters, according to The New York Times.

The recent flurry of coverage has barely mentioned the 55-year-old Oakes, a virtual unknown in the U.S. but someone who is more familiar in Great Britain, in part because of his relationship in the 1990s with a member of the royal Windsor family.

But data analytics experts described Oakes as a hidden hand running both SCL and Cambridge Analytica.

“Anyone right now that is focusing on the problems with Cambridge Analytica should be backtracking to the source, which is Nigel Oakes,” said Sam Woolley, research director of the Digital Intelligence Lab at the Silicon Valley-based Institute for the Future.

“My research has shown that Cambridge Analytica is the tip of the iceberg of Nigel Oakes’ empire of psy-ops and information ops around the world,” said Woolley, whose research aims to help protect democracy from the nefarious use of rapidly evolving communications technology. “As you start to dig into that, you find out a lot of very concerning things.”

Woolley said he attended a Cambridge Analytica “meet-up” in April 2016 during the New York presidential primary in New York. At the time, the company was working for another candidate, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and gave a wide-ranging overview of their activities, Woolley said.

It was clear from the session that the two companies are completely intertwined, Woolley said. He recalled that Cambridge Analytica leaders “conflated all of their work with SCL’s work,” including in several overseas elections. Based on his ongoing research, he described the two firms as selling “political marketing to the highest bidder, whether you’re in government, the military or politics, even authoritarian” regimes.

Oakes and SCL Group did not return calls seeking comment through a spokesperson.

SCL Group — like its predecessor, Strategic Communication Laboratories, which Oakes co-founded in 1993 — is no stranger to controversies related to foreign elections, including in connection with alleged dirty tricks it has allegedly employed on behalf of political clients from Europe to Africa and Asia.

The company also made headlines in 2005 when it billed itself at a global arms fair in London as the first private company to provide psychological warfare services, or “psyops,” to the British military.

At the time, Oakes, as chief executive, said he was confident that psyops could shorten military conflicts and that governments would buy such a service, which SCL had provided commercially.

“We used to be in the business of mind-bending for political purposes,” he told a reporter, “but now we are in the business of saving lives.""

Those who know Oakes, or know of him, are somewhat skeptical.

One private investigator said the company is known to have done extensive work for the U.S. military and other government agencies against targets including Iran. SCL got its start in the U.S. by selling the same psychological warfare product as it did to the British, including manipulation of elections and “perception management,” or the intentional spread of fake news.

The State Department confirmed to Defense One this week that it retains SCL Group on a contract to ""provide research and analytical support in connection with our mission to counter terrorist propaganda and disinformation overseas.""

Company literature describes some of SCL's services, besides ""psychological warfare,"" as ""influence operations"" and ""public diplomacy.”

Absent from such descriptions is some of the more bombastic rhetoric of Oakes’ youth.

""We use the same techniques as Aristotle and Hitler,” he told an interviewer in 1992. “We appeal to people on an emotional level to get them to agree on a functional level.""

On its website, SCL Group does not highlight its connections to Cambridge Analytica.

“Our vision is to be the premier provider of data analytics and strategy for behavior change,” the website says.

“Our mission is to create behavior change through research, data, analytics, and strategy for both domestic and international government clients.”

But Oakes and his company have a history of secrecy, making the hidden-camera footage of Nix all the more shocking. In the footage aired by Channel 4, Nix appears to tell a journalist posing as a potential client that the company could, for instance, send Ukrainian sex workers to an opponent’s house to sabotage him.

Schiff said Wednesday he wants Nix to come back and testify, as well as witnesses the committee Democrats wanted to interview.

“We didn’t get the information that we needed, and in light of these whistleblower allegations, there are serious questions about the truthfulness of Mr. Nix’s testimony,” Schiff said.

technology,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/conversations/2017/12/14/16776236/net-neutrality-made-internet-awesome-fcc-vote,“Net neutrality is the secret sauce that has made the internet awesome”,2017-12-14,"Eric Allen Been, Alissa Wilkinson, Sigal Samuel, Terry Nguyen, Rebecca Jennings, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz","The internet as we know it is about to change drastically .
Net neutrality — the standard that internet service providers , or ISPs , must treat all traffic equally — was repealed Thursday in a party-line vote by the Federal Communications Commission in Washington . FCC chair Ajit Pai , flanked by two Republican allies , has a majority on the commission .
Commercial ISPs like Comcast , AT & T , and Verizon will be free to block content , throttle users ’ internet use , and prioritize their own services at the expense of competitors ’ . It ’ s a wide-reaching and controversial issue that some have called one of the “ biggest corporate giveaways in history . ”
As net neutrality proponents see it , these protections are essential to providing open and equal access to the internet . The plan by Pai , a former Verizon attorney , is a wide-ranging dismantling of not only the safeguards put in place by the Obama administration but ones that have been embedded in the World Wide Web since its invention in 1989 .
Pai maintains that his proposal is a standard rollback in government regulation that gives ISPs more freedom for things like infrastructure investments . But critics argue that this would result in fast and slow lanes for internet access and could lead to favoritism and the entrenchment of wealthy players . In other words , nothing could stop AT & T from slowing down Netflix in an effort to prioritize its own cable TV package , or outright blocking a website that ’ s critical of its business practices .
To better understand what ’ s at stake , I spoke to Barbara van Schewick , a net neutrality expert and a professor at Stanford Law School , before the vote . The conversation has been lightly edited and condensed .
Why should ordinary people care about net neutrality , which can seem very complicated ?
The internet is n't a specialized service for geeks anymore . It 's long become woven into everyone 's daily lives and every sector of the economy . Net neutrality is the secret sauce that has made the internet awesome . It ensures that we , not Comcast or Verizon , get to choose what content we read , what websites we go to , and what services we use on the internet .
That 's been the case since the beginning of the internet in the US , and it has stayed that way because the FCC , under the leadership of Democrats and Republicans alike , ensured that the companies we pay to get online could not interfere with the free markets and free marketplaces of ideas .
Pai 's proposal will change that . It will allow broadband providers to block websites on content grounds , decide which apps we can use , charge online services simply to reach subscribers at all , create fast lanes that favor companies and speakers with deep pockets , and make it more expensive for local and niche sites to reach readers .
Americans understand this . That ’ s why Pai 's move to abolish net neutrality protections that date [ to ] long before 2015 has led to such a loud and sustained outcry by Americans of all political affiliations . Americans filed millions of comments with the FCC , even more than were filed in 2014 . Startups , small businesses , investors , faith groups , musicians , and community activists have filed comments , held rallies , written op-eds , and called and met with their members of Congress . Americans have placed more than 1 million calls to Congress urging that the protections stay in place , and that 's just through BattleForTheNet.com alone .
If net neutrality protections are stripped , ISPs in theory would have the right to block any website or content they see fit , even a newspaper whose editorials it doesn ’ t like . But do you think that 's something they would ever do ? That ISPs would go that far ?
Blocking and throttling , like how Comcast once restricted the peer-to-peer file sharing application BitTorrent , really is a concern .

The regime that Pai is now proposing , which is that the Federal Trade Commission will now police ISPs — that ’ s putting our internet under an agency that has no rules against blocking or discrimination .

The markets for internet access in Europe are a lot more competitive than the markets in the United States . Here , 51 percent of Americans only have one ISP to choose from . So those people have no other option if they don ’ t like how their ISP is behaving .
But Europe has a lot more competition because they require the phone companies to open their networks to independent ISPs . So the Europeans said , `` We think net neutrality is a problem that can be fixed with competition . '' So if ISPs said to customers that they are blocking or slowing down websites , then customers who do n't like that can go to another ISP that does n't do the same . And this threat of people switching providers would discipline the ISPs and ultimately prevent blocking and discrimination . That won ’ t work in the US , and it didn ’ t in Europe .
And that 's exactly the rhetoric Pai is using : that competition will keep ISPs honest .
So that 's his argument . And it sounds really nice in theory , but it does n't work in practice because there are so few ISPs available to many people in the US . We know that because the European Union ran this experiment for us . After they adopted their regime , they had widespread blocking and discrimination [ even with the additional competition ] . Looking to Europe , we can see what a world without net neutrality looks like .
In the Netherlands , the telecommunication company KPN was losing a lot of money because so many people were using online text messaging apps like WhatsApp . People were n't paying for the traditional , expensive text messages over a cellular network .
KPN said , `` We are losing all this money . That 's not sustainable . We will switch to plans that do not include the right to use online text messaging . '' And if someone wanted to use online text messaging , they had to buy an online text messaging option . That got such a huge outcry in the Netherlands that they became the first country to adopt a net neutrality law that banned blocking and slowing down and speeding up websites .
And we had a German ISP that blocked access to websites that were criticizing its business practices . We have never seen this in the US because under our net neutrality regime , that would n't be legal . Our regime says an ISP can not block legal content , applications , and services . That means if it 's legal , the ISP ca n't block it . Let 's say we do n't like online gun sales or whatever it is . The ISP can only say , `` Look I ca n't do anything about it , because as long as it 's legal , we have to transmit it . ''
A lot of ISPs have been touting their own net neutrality pledges and saying that even if these regulations are stripped , they will still abide by net neutrality guidelines . But Comcast , for instance , recently deleted their original net neutrality pledge the same day the FCC announced its first draft to appeal these regulations . And then the new one they put up contained no promise related to not engaging in paid priority . Can we take these corporate pledges seriously ?
I would not want the future of the internet to depend on an ISP 's willingness to voluntarily behave in a good way . We have seen in Europe that it 's not necessarily in the ISP 's interest to behave in the way that 's required by net neutrality . And ISPs can change their promises , and already the promises are so much narrower than what the net neutrality protections require .
None of the ISPs talk about a promise to manage networks in a way that does not single out applications or classes of applications . None of them commit to not charging websites for access . These are essential components for net neutrality , and so I do not think at all that we should leave the future of this really critical infrastructure to promises by the ISPs that can change at any time .
Pai has claimed that the real threat to the open internet is from social media companies like Twitter because it moderates and has removed conservative content from its platform . Do you think there ’ s any truth there ?
I think that 's really just an effort to distract people . I know there are a lot of people who are unhappy with the specific way in which companies like Twitter or Google or Facebook manage their services and how they limit certain content on their site . We can have a long debate about that . But there is a key difference between the website that runs on top of the internet and the actual internet . And the difference is , if a website blocks certain content , I can go to a different website . But if my ISP blocks access to a certain website , then there 's no way to get around that .
And I think part of what was so surprising about Pai using this example is because if people are concerned and unhappy that companies like Twitter or other internet platform companies are policing certain content on their sites , these people should really be fighting for net neutrality protections . They are the only thing that prevents the ISPs from engaging in the same behavior .
The debate about net neutrality has been increasingly cast as a liberal versus conservative issue . Do you think that ’ s a good or bad thing for protecting the open internet ?
It 's really misleading . Net neutrality is n't a partisan issue . Polls consistently show that Americans , whether Republican or Democrat , support the current net neutrality protections . A poll that was published in July shows that 77 percent of Americans support the current protections at the FCC — and that 73 percent of Republicans , 80 percent of Democrats , and 76 percent of independents want to keep the current protections . And if you look on some of the more conservative subreddits on Reddit or even Breitbart , there was huge , vibrant opposition to Pai 's plan .
Net neutrality protections are absolutely consistent with a free market framework . They are really a way to protect all these free markets that arose from and depend on the internet .

Net neutrality — the standard that internet service providers, or ISPs, must treat all traffic equally — was repealed Thursday in a party-line vote by the Federal Communications Commission in Washington. FCC chair Ajit Pai, flanked by two Republican allies, has a majority on the commission.

Commercial ISPs like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon will be free to block content, throttle users’ internet use, and prioritize their own services at the expense of competitors’. It’s a wide-reaching and controversial issue that some have called one of the “biggest corporate giveaways in history.”

As net neutrality proponents see it, these protections are essential to providing open and equal access to the internet. The plan by Pai, a former Verizon attorney, is a wide-ranging dismantling of not only the safeguards put in place by the Obama administration but ones that have been embedded in the World Wide Web since its invention in 1989.

Pai maintains that his proposal is a standard rollback in government regulation that gives ISPs more freedom for things like infrastructure investments. But critics argue that this would result in fast and slow lanes for internet access and could lead to favoritism and the entrenchment of wealthy players. In other words, nothing could stop AT&T from slowing down Netflix in an effort to prioritize its own cable TV package, or outright blocking a website that’s critical of its business practices.

To better understand what’s at stake, I spoke to Barbara van Schewick, a net neutrality expert and a professor at Stanford Law School, before the vote. The conversation has been lightly edited and condensed.

Eric Allen Been

Why should ordinary people care about net neutrality, which can seem very complicated?

Barbara van Schewick

The internet isn't a specialized service for geeks anymore. It's long become woven into everyone's daily lives and every sector of the economy. Net neutrality is the secret sauce that has made the internet awesome. It ensures that we, not Comcast or Verizon, get to choose what content we read, what websites we go to, and what services we use on the internet.

That's been the case since the beginning of the internet in the US, and it has stayed that way because the FCC, under the leadership of Democrats and Republicans alike, ensured that the companies we pay to get online could not interfere with the free markets and free marketplaces of ideas.

Pai's proposal will change that. It will allow broadband providers to block websites on content grounds, decide which apps we can use, charge online services simply to reach subscribers at all, create fast lanes that favor companies and speakers with deep pockets, and make it more expensive for local and niche sites to reach readers.

Americans understand this. That’s why Pai's move to abolish net neutrality protections that date [to] long before 2015 has led to such a loud and sustained outcry by Americans of all political affiliations. Americans filed millions of comments with the FCC, even more than were filed in 2014. Startups, small businesses, investors, faith groups, musicians, and community activists have filed comments, held rallies, written op-eds, and called and met with their members of Congress. Americans have placed more than 1 million calls to Congress urging that the protections stay in place, and that's just through BattleForTheNet.com alone.

technology,Jonathan Haidt,1,https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/12/social-media-democracy/600763/,The Dark Psychology of Social Networks,,Tobias Rose-Stockwell,"Suppose that the biblical story of Creation were true : God created the universe in six days , including all the laws of physics and all the physical constants that apply throughout the universe . Now imagine that one day , in the early 21st century , God became bored and , just for fun , doubled the gravitational constant . What would it be like to live through such a change ? We ’ d all be pulled toward the floor ; many buildings would collapse ; birds would fall from the sky ; the Earth would move closer to the sun , reestablishing orbit in a far hotter zone . To hear more feature stories , see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app . Let ’ s rerun this thought experiment in the social and political world , rather than the physical one . The U.S. Constitution was an exercise in intelligent design . The Founding Fathers knew that most previous democracies had been unstable and short-lived . But they were excellent psychologists , and they strove to create institutions and procedures that would work with human nature to resist the forces that had torn apart so many other attempts at self-governance .
For example , in “ Federalist No . 10 , ” James Madison wrote about his fear of the power of “ faction , ” by which he meant strong partisanship or group interest that “ inflamed [ men ] with mutual animosity ” and made them forget about the common good . He thought that the vastness of the United States might offer some protection from the ravages of factionalism , because it would be hard for anyone to spread outrage over such a large distance . Madison presumed that factious or divisive leaders “ may kindle a flame within their particular States , but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other States. ” The Constitution included mechanisms to slow things down , let passions cool , and encourage reflection and deliberation . Madison ’ s design has proved durable . But what would happen to American democracy if , one day in the early 21st century , a technology appeared that—over the course of a decade—changed several fundamental parameters of social and political life ? What if this technology greatly increased the amount of “ mutual animosity ” and the speed at which outrage spread ? Might we witness the political equivalent of buildings collapsing , birds falling from the sky , and the Earth moving closer to the sun ? America may be going through such a time right now . What Social Media Changed Facebook ’ s early mission was “ to make the world more open and connected ” —and in the first days of social media , many people assumed that a huge global increase in connectivity would be good for democracy . As social media has aged , however , optimism has faded and the list of known or suspected harms has grown : Online political discussions ( often among anonymous strangers ) are experienced as angrier and less civil than those in real life ; networks of partisans co-create worldviews that can become more and more extreme ; disinformation campaigns flourish ; violent ideologies lure recruits .
The problem may not be connectivity itself but rather the way social media turns so much communication into a public performance . We often think of communication as a two-way street . Intimacy builds as partners take turns , laugh at each other ’ s jokes , and make reciprocal disclosures . What happens , though , when grandstands are erected along both sides of that street and then filled with friends , acquaintances , rivals , and strangers , all passing judgment and offering commentary ? The social psychologist Mark Leary coined the term sociometer to describe the inner mental gauge that tells us , moment by moment , how we ’ re doing in the eyes of others . We don ’ t really need self-esteem , Leary argued ; rather , the evolutionary imperative is to get others to see us as desirable partners for various kinds of relationships . Social media , with its displays of likes , friends , followers , and retweets , has pulled our sociometers out of our private thoughts and posted them for all to see . Human beings evolved to gossip , preen , manipulate , and ostracize . We are easily lured into this new gladiatorial circus . If you constantly express anger in your private conversations , your friends will likely find you tiresome , but when there ’ s an audience , the payoffs are different—outrage can boost your status . A 2017 study by William J. Brady and other researchers at NYU measured the reach of half a million tweets and found that each moral or emotional word used in a tweet increased its virality by 20 percent , on average . Another 2017 study , by the Pew Research Center , showed that posts exhibiting “ indignant disagreement ” received nearly twice as much engagement—including likes and shares—as other types of content on Facebook .
The philosophers Justin Tosi and Brandon Warmke have proposed the useful phrase moral grandstanding to describe what happens when people use moral talk to enhance their prestige in a public forum . Like a succession of orators speaking to a skeptical audience , each person strives to outdo previous speakers , leading to some common patterns . Grandstanders tend to “ trump up moral charges , pile on in cases of public shaming , announce that anyone who disagrees with them is obviously wrong , or exaggerate emotional displays. ” Nuance and truth are casualties in this competition to gain the approval of the audience . Grandstanders scrutinize every word spoken by their opponents—and sometimes even their friends—for the potential to evoke public outrage . Context collapses . The speaker ’ s intent is ignored . Human beings evolved to gossip , preen , manipulate , and ostracize . We are easily lured into this new gladiatorial circus , even when we know that it can make us cruel and shallow . As the Yale psychologist Molly Crockett has argued , the normal forces that might stop us from joining an outrage mob—such as time to reflect and cool off , or feelings of empathy for a person being humiliated—are attenuated when we can ’ t see the person ’ s face , and when we are asked , many times a day , to take a side by publicly “ liking ” the condemnation . From October 2018 : America is living James Madison ’ s nightmare In other words , social media turns many of our most politically engaged citizens into Madison ’ s nightmare : arsonists who compete to create the most inflammatory posts and images , which they can distribute across the country in an instant while their public sociometer displays how far their creations have traveled .
Upgrading the Outrage Machine At its inception , social media felt very different than it does today . Friendster , Myspace , and Facebook all appeared between 2002 and 2004 , offering tools that helped users connect with friends . The sites encouraged people to post highly curated versions of their lives , but they offered no way to spark contagious outrage . This changed with a series of small steps , designed to improve user experience , that collectively altered the way news and anger spread through American society . In order to fix social media—and reduce its harm to democracy—we must try to understand this evolution . When Twitter arrived in 2006 , its primary innovation was the timeline : a constant stream of 140-character updates that users could view on their phone . The timeline was a new way of consuming information—an unending stream of content that , to many , felt like drinking from a fire hose . Later that year , Facebook launched its own version , called the News Feed . In 2009 , it added the “ Like ” button , for the first time creating a public metric for the popularity of content . Then it added another transformative innovation : an algorithm that determined which posts a user would see , based on predicted “ engagement ” —the likelihood of an individual interacting with a given post , figuring in the user ’ s previous likes . This innovation tamed the fire hose , turning it into a curated stream .
The News Feed ’ s algorithmic ordering of content flattened the hierarchy of credibility . Any post by any producer could stick to the top of our feeds as long as it generated engagement . “ Fake news ” would later flourish in this environment , as a personal blog post was given the same look and feel as a story from The New York Times .
Twitter also made a key change in 2009 , adding the “ Retweet ” button . Until then , users had to copy and paste older tweets into their status updates , a small obstacle that required a few seconds of thought and attention . The Retweet button essentially enabled the frictionless spread of content . A single click could pass someone else ’ s tweet on to all of your followers—and let you share in the credit for contagious content . In 2012 , Facebook offered its own version of the retweet , the “ Share ” button , to its fastest-growing audience : smartphone users . Chris Wetherell was one of the engineers who created the Retweet button for Twitter . He admitted to BuzzFeed earlier this year that he now regrets it . As Wetherell watched the first Twitter mobs use his new tool , he thought to himself : “ We might have just handed a 4-year-old a loaded weapon. ” The coup de grâce came in 2012 and 2013 , when Upworthy and other sites began to capitalize on this new feature set , pioneering the art of testing headlines across dozens of variations to find the version that generated the highest click-through rate . This was the beginning of “ You won ’ t believe … ” articles and their ilk , paired with images tested and selected to make us click impulsively . These articles were not usually intended to cause outrage ( the founders of Upworthy were more interested in uplift ) . But the strategy ’ s success ensured the spread of headline testing , and with it emotional story-packaging , through new and old media alike ; outrageous , morally freighted headlines proliferated in the following years . In Esquire , Luke O ’ Neil reflected on the changes wrought on mainstream media and declared 2013 to be “ The Year We Broke the Internet. ” The next year , Russia ’ s Internet Research Agency began mobilizing its network of fake accounts , across every major social-media platform—exploiting the new outrage machine in order to inflame partisan divisions and advance Russian goals .
The internet , of course , does not bear sole responsibility for the pitch of political anger today . The media have been fomenting division since Madison ’ s time , and political scientists have traced a portion of today ’ s outrage culture to the rise of cable television and talk radio in the 1980s and ’ 90s . A multiplicity of forces are pushing America toward greater polarization . But social media in the years since 2013 has become a powerful accelerant for anyone who wants to start a fire . The Decline of Wisdom Even if social media could be cured of its outrage-enhancing effects , it would still raise problems for the stability of democracy . One such problem is the degree to which the ideas and conflicts of the present moment dominate and displace older ideas and the lessons of the past . As children grow up in America , rivers of information flow continually into their eyes and ears—a mix of ideas , narratives , songs , images , and more . Suppose we could capture and quantify three streams in particular : information that is new ( created within the past month ) , middle-aged ( created 10 to 50 years ago , by the generations that include the child ’ s parents and grandparents ) , and old ( created more than 100 years ago ) . Citizens are now more connected to one another , on platforms that have been designed to make outrage contagious .

Suppose that the biblical story of Creation were true: God created the universe in six days, including all the laws of physics and all the physical constants that apply throughout the universe. Now imagine that one day, in the early 21st century, God became bored and, just for fun, doubled the gravitational constant. What would it be like to live through such a change? We’d all be pulled toward the floor; many buildings would collapse; birds would fall from the sky; the Earth would move closer to the sun, reestablishing orbit in a far hotter zone. To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app. Let’s rerun this thought experiment in the social and political world, rather than the physical one. The U.S. Constitution was an exercise in intelligent design. The Founding Fathers knew that most previous democracies had been unstable and short-lived. But they were excellent psychologists, and they strove to create institutions and procedures that would work with human nature to resist the forces that had torn apart so many other attempts at self-governance.

For example, in “Federalist No. 10,” James Madison wrote about his fear of the power of “faction,” by which he meant strong partisanship or group interest that “inflamed [men] with mutual animosity” and made them forget about the common good. He thought that the vastness of the United States might offer some protection from the ravages of factionalism, because it would be hard for anyone to spread outrage over such a large distance. Madison presumed that factious or divisive leaders “may kindle a flame within their particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other States.” The Constitution included mechanisms to slow things down, let passions cool, and encourage reflection and deliberation. Madison’s design has proved durable. But what would happen to American democracy if, one day in the early 21st century, a technology appeared that—over the course of a decade—changed several fundamental parameters of social and political life? What if this technology greatly increased the amount of “mutual animosity” and the speed at which outrage spread? Might we witness the political equivalent of buildings collapsing, birds falling from the sky, and the Earth moving closer to the sun? America may be going through such a time right now. What Social Media Changed Facebook’s early mission was “to make the world more open and connected”—and in the first days of social media, many people assumed that a huge global increase in connectivity would be good for democracy. As social media has aged, however, optimism has faded and the list of known or suspected harms has grown: Online political discussions (often among anonymous strangers) are experienced as angrier and less civil than those in real life; networks of partisans co-create worldviews that can become more and more extreme; disinformation campaigns flourish; violent ideologies lure recruits.

The problem may not be connectivity itself but rather the way social media turns so much communication into a public performance. We often think of communication as a two-way street. Intimacy builds as partners take turns, laugh at each other’s jokes, and make reciprocal disclosures. What happens, though, when grandstands are erected along both sides of that street and then filled with friends, acquaintances, rivals, and strangers, all passing judgment and offering commentary? The social psychologist Mark Leary coined the term sociometer to describe the inner mental gauge that tells us, moment by moment, how we’re doing in the eyes of others. We don’t really need self-esteem, Leary argued; rather, the evolutionary imperative is to get others to see us as desirable partners for various kinds of relationships. Social media, with its displays of likes, friends, followers, and retweets, has pulled our sociometers out of our private thoughts and posted them for all to see. Human beings evolved to gossip, preen, manipulate, and ostracize. We are easily lured into this new gladiatorial circus. If you constantly express anger in your private conversations, your friends will likely find you tiresome, but when there’s an audience, the payoffs are different—outrage can boost your status. A 2017 study by William J. Brady and other researchers at NYU measured the reach of half a million tweets and found that each moral or emotional word used in a tweet increased its virality by 20 percent, on average. Another 2017 study, by the Pew Research Center, showed that posts exhibiting “indignant disagreement” received nearly twice as much engagement—including likes and shares—as other types of content on Facebook.

The philosophers Justin Tosi and Brandon Warmke have proposed the useful phrase moral grandstanding to describe what happens when people use moral talk to enhance their prestige in a public forum. Like a succession of orators speaking to a skeptical audience, each person strives to outdo previous speakers, leading to some common patterns. Grandstanders tend to “trump up moral charges, pile on in cases of public shaming, announce that anyone who disagrees with them is obviously wrong, or exaggerate emotional displays.” Nuance and truth are casualties in this competition to gain the approval of the audience. Grandstanders scrutinize every word spoken by their opponents—and sometimes even their friends—for the potential to evoke public outrage. Context collapses. The speaker’s intent is ignored. Human beings evolved to gossip, preen, manipulate, and ostracize. We are easily lured into this new gladiatorial circus, even when we know that it can make us cruel and shallow. As the Yale psychologist Molly Crockett has argued, the normal forces that might stop us from joining an outrage mob—such as time to reflect and cool off, or feelings of empathy for a person being humiliated—are attenuated when we can’t see the person’s face, and when we are asked, many times a day, to take a side by publicly “liking” the condemnation. From October 2018: America is living James Madison’s nightmare In other words, social media turns many of our most politically engaged citizens into Madison’s nightmare: arsonists who compete to create the most inflammatory posts and images, which they can distribute across the country in an instant while their public sociometer displays how far their creations have traveled.

Upgrading the Outrage Machine At its inception, social media felt very different than it does today. Friendster, Myspace, and Facebook all appeared between 2002 and 2004, offering tools that helped users connect with friends. The sites encouraged people to post highly curated versions of their lives, but they offered no way to spark contagious outrage. This changed with a series of small steps, designed to improve user experience, that collectively altered the way news and anger spread through American society. In order to fix social media—and reduce its harm to democracy—we must try to understand this evolution. When Twitter arrived in 2006, its primary innovation was the timeline: a constant stream of 140-character updates that users could view on their phone. The timeline was a new way of consuming information—an unending stream of content that, to many, felt like drinking from a fire hose. Later that year, Facebook launched its own version, called the News Feed. In 2009, it added the “Like” button, for the first time creating a public metric for the popularity of content. Then it added another transformative innovation: an algorithm that determined which posts a user would see, based on predicted “engagement”—the likelihood of an individual interacting with a given post, figuring in the user’s previous likes. This innovation tamed the fire hose, turning it into a curated stream.

Mark Pernice

The News Feed’s algorithmic ordering of content flattened the hierarchy of credibility. Any post by any producer could stick to the top of our feeds as long as it generated engagement. “Fake news” would later flourish in this environment, as a personal blog post was given the same look and feel as a story from The New York Times.

Twitter also made a key change in 2009, adding the “Retweet” button. Until then, users had to copy and paste older tweets into their status updates, a small obstacle that required a few seconds of thought and attention. The Retweet button essentially enabled the frictionless spread of content. A single click could pass someone else’s tweet on to all of your followers—and let you share in the credit for contagious content. In 2012, Facebook offered its own version of the retweet, the “Share” button, to its fastest-growing audience: smartphone users. Chris Wetherell was one of the engineers who created the Retweet button for Twitter. He admitted to BuzzFeed earlier this year that he now regrets it. As Wetherell watched the first Twitter mobs use his new tool, he thought to himself: “We might have just handed a 4-year-old a loaded weapon.” The coup de grâce came in 2012 and 2013, when Upworthy and other sites began to capitalize on this new feature set, pioneering the art of testing headlines across dozens of variations to find the version that generated the highest click-through rate. This was the beginning of “You won’t believe …” articles and their ilk, paired with images tested and selected to make us click impulsively. These articles were not usually intended to cause outrage (the founders of Upworthy were more interested in uplift). But the strategy’s success ensured the spread of headline testing, and with it emotional story-packaging, through new and old media alike; outrageous, morally freighted headlines proliferated in the following years. In Esquire, Luke O’Neil reflected on the changes wrought on mainstream media and declared 2013 to be “The Year We Broke the Internet.” The next year, Russia’s Internet Research Agency began mobilizing its network of fake accounts, across every major social-media platform—exploiting the new outrage machine in order to inflame partisan divisions and advance Russian goals.

The internet, of course, does not bear sole responsibility for the pitch of political anger today. The media have been fomenting division since Madison’s time, and political scientists have traced a portion of today’s outrage culture to the rise of cable television and talk radio in the 1980s and ’90s. A multiplicity of forces are pushing America toward greater polarization. But social media in the years since 2013 has become a powerful accelerant for anyone who wants to start a fire. The Decline of Wisdom Even if social media could be cured of its outrage-enhancing effects, it would still raise problems for the stability of democracy. One such problem is the degree to which the ideas and conflicts of the present moment dominate and displace older ideas and the lessons of the past. As children grow up in America, rivers of information flow continually into their eyes and ears—a mix of ideas, narratives, songs, images, and more. Suppose we could capture and quantify three streams in particular: information that is new (created within the past month), middle-aged (created 10 to 50 years ago, by the generations that include the child’s parents and grandparents), and old (created more than 100 years ago). Citizens are now more connected to one another, on platforms that have been designed to make outrage contagious. Whatever the balance of these categories was in the 18th century, the balance in the 20th century surely shifted toward the new as radios and television sets became common in American homes. And that shift almost certainly became still more pronounced, and quickly so, in the 21st century. When the majority of Americans began using social media regularly, around 2012, they hyper-connected themselves to one another in a way that massively increased their consumption of new information—entertainment such as cat videos and celebrity gossip, yes, but also daily or hourly political outrages and hot takes on current events—while reducing the share of older information. What might the effect of that shift be?

In 1790, the Anglo-Irish philosopher and statesman Edmund Burke wrote, “We are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private stock of reason; because we suspect that this stock in each man is small, and that the individuals would do better to avail themselves of the general bank and capital of nations and of ages.” Thanks to social media, we are embarking on a global experiment that will test whether Burke’s fear is valid. Social media pushes people of all ages toward a focus on the scandal, joke, or conflict of the day, but the effect may be particularly profound for younger generations, who have had less opportunity to acquire older ideas and information before plugging themselves into the social-media stream.

DETROIT ( AP ) — Three crashes involving Teslas that killed three people have increased scrutiny of the company ’ s Autopilot driving system just months before CEO Elon Musk has planned to put fully self-driving cars on the streets .
On Sunday , a Tesla Model S sedan left a freeway in Gardena , California , at a high speed , ran a red light and struck a Honda Civic , killing two people inside , police said .

The company contends that Teslas with Autopilot are safer than vehicles without it , but cautions that the system does not prevent all crashes .
Even so , experts and safety advocates say a string of Tesla crashes raises serious questions about whether drivers have become too reliant on Tesla ’ s technology and whether the company does enough to ensure that drivers keep paying attention . Some critics have said it ’ s past time for NHTSA to stop investigating and to take action , such as forcing Tesla to make sure drivers pay attention when the system is being used .

DETROIT (AP) — Three crashes involving Teslas that killed three people have increased scrutiny of the company’s Autopilot driving system just months before CEO Elon Musk has planned to put fully self-driving cars on the streets.

On Sunday, a Tesla Model S sedan left a freeway in Gardena, California, at a high speed, ran a red light and struck a Honda Civic, killing two people inside, police said.

On the same day, a Tesla Model 3 hit a parked firetruck on an Indiana freeway, killing a passenger in the Tesla.

And on Dec. 7, yet another Model 3 struck a police cruiser on a Connecticut highway, though no one was hurt.

The special crash investigation unit of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is looking into the California crash. The agency hasn’t decided whether its special-crash unit will review the crash that occurred Sunday near Terre Haute, Indiana. In both cases, authorities have yet to determine whether Tesla’s Autopilot system was being used.

NHTSA also is investigating the Connecticut crash, in which the driver told police that the car was operating on Autopilot, a Tesla system designed to keep a car in its lane and a safe distance from other vehicles. Autopilot also can change lanes on its own.

Tesla has said repeatedly that its Autopilot system is designed only to assist drivers, who must still pay attention and be ready to intervene at all times. The company contends that Teslas with Autopilot are safer than vehicles without it, but cautions that the system does not prevent all crashes.

Even so, experts and safety advocates say a string of Tesla crashes raises serious questions about whether drivers have become too reliant on Tesla’s technology and whether the company does enough to ensure that drivers keep paying attention.

Messages were left Thursday seeking comment from Tesla.

Raj Rajkumar, an electrical and computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said it’s likely that the Tesla in Sunday’s California crash was operating on Autopilot, which has become confused in the past by lane lines. He speculated that the lane line was more visible for the exit ramp, so the car took the ramp because it looked like a freeway lane. He also suggested that the driver might not have been paying close attention.

“No normal human being would not slow down in an exit lane,” he said.

In April, Musk said he expected to start converting the company’s electric cars to fully self-driving vehicles in 2020 to create a network of robotic taxis to compete against Uber and other ride-hailing services.

At the time, experts said the technology isn’t ready and that Tesla’s camera and radar sensors weren’t good enough for a self-driving system. Rajkumar and others say additional crashes have proved that to be true.

Many experts say they’re not aware of fatal crashes involving similar driver-assist systems from General Motors, Mercedes and other automakers. GM monitors drivers with cameras and will shut down the driving system if they don’t watch the road.

“Tesla is nowhere close to that standard,” he said.

He predicted more deaths involving Teslas if NHTSA fails to take action.

They weren ’ t cheering for Bolsonaro or his running mate or their party ; instead , they were reciting the names of social media platforms .
They were crediting the platforms with their man ’ s victory , and they aren ’ t entirely wrong . During the campaign , a conservative pro-business interest group funded a massive disinformation campaign on WhatsApp ( the popular messaging app owned by Facebook ) . False and damaging information about Bolsonaro ’ s left-wing opponent , including fake news mocked up to look like neutral fact-checks , spread like wildfire in the runup to the October 8 vote . This deluge , according to one Brazilian expert , played a role in Bolsonaro ’ s victory .
The glee Bolsonaro ’ s supporters exhibited points to a troubling development , one familiar to many Americans : Social media , once seen as a profoundly democratic technology , is increasingly serving the needs of authoritarians and their allies .
Many observers have noted that entrenched authoritarian states , like Russia and China , have gotten very good at manipulating these platforms to marginalize domestic dissidents and destabilize democracies abroad . What ’ s gotten less attention is how authoritarian factions inside democratic states — far-right politicians and parties that are at best indifferent to democratic norms — benefit from the nature of modern social media platforms .
Authoritarians of both sorts benefit from spreading falsehoods about their opponents , ginning up panics about minority groups , and undermining people ’ s trust in the independent media . Both the 2016 US election and the 2018 Brazilian vote proved social media is a perfect tool for this kind of activity .
Social media can certainly help pro-democracy movements at times , but they overall give far-right parties and authoritarians an advantage . These platforms , once seen as democracy ’ s ally , have increasingly become its enemy .
It is easier to spread misinformation on social media than to correct it , and easier to inflame social divisions than to mend them . The very nature of how we engage with Facebook and the rest now helps far-right , authoritarian factions weaken the foundations of democratic systems — and even give themselves an easier pathway to seizing power .
It seems we have to admit a somewhat uncomfortable truth : Social media , in the way that it ’ s used now , is an authoritarian medium .
The Journal of Democracy is one of the premier academic venues for analyzing the current state of democratic politics . Its most recent issue features an essay from Ronald Deibert , a political scientist and director of the University of Toronto ’ s tech-focused Citizen Lab , on the role of social media in modern politics . His conclusion is pretty grim .
“ It seems undeniable , ” Deibert writes , “ that social media must bear some of the blame for the descent into neo-fascism . ”
Ten years ago , Deibert ’ s view — now widely shared among journalists and scholars — would have sounded absurd .
In 2009 , Iranians rose up to protest against a rigged election , the so-called “ Green Movement ” using Facebook and YouTube clips of protests to spread their message globally . Two years later , the Arab Spring protests showed the true power of these mediums , as protest movements that made skillful use of social media for coordination and messaging toppled regimes in Tunisia and Egypt .
At the time , the consensus among observers was that social media was , by its very nature , democratizing . Social media facilitates the swift spread of information , allowing citizens to easily get around government censors . Social media allows rapid communication among large groups of disparate people , giving citizen activists new tools for organizing actions . The spread of social media would necessarily weaken authoritarian states and strengthen democracies — or , at least , that ’ s how the argument went .
There were some dissenters , like the acerbic writer Evgeny Morosov , but they were largely brushed aside in an Arab Spring-induced high . More representative was the 2013 issue of the MIT Technology Review titled “ Big Data Will Save Politics , ” featuring an interview with the singer Bono declaring that new technologies would be “ deadly to dictators . ”
This theory turned out to be partly true : It can be difficult to simply repress the spread of information on social media . But as we ’ ve come to discover , it ’ s equally difficult to repress the spread of disinformation . The core feature of social media that gives it democratic promise , the rapid spread of information , can be used against democracy via information overload .
A savvy person or political party looking to discredit online critics doesn ’ t need to ban their speech to hamstring it . Instead , they can respond with a deluge of false or misleading information , making it very hard for ordinary citizens to figure out what ’ s actually going on .
Deibert ’ s essay usefully summarizes a number of different studies documenting how well the twisted jiujitsu of misinformation and information overload works :
An always-on , real-time information tsunami creates the perfect environment for the spread of falsehoods , conspiracy theories , rumors , and “ leaks. ” Unsubstantiated claims and narratives go viral while fact-checking efforts struggle to keep up . Members of the public , including researchers and investigative journalists , may not have the expertise , tools , or time to verify claims . By the time they do , the falsehoods may have already embedded themselves in the collective consciousness . Meanwhile , fresh scandals or outlandish claims are continuously raining down on users , mixing fact with fiction . Worse yet , studies have found that attempts “ to quash rumors through direct refutation may facilitate their diffusion by increasing fluency. ” In other words , efforts to correct falsehoods can ironically contribute to their further propagation and even acceptance . The constant bombardment of tainted leaks , conspiracy theories , and other misinformation in turn fuels cynicism , with citizens growing fatigued as they try to discern objective truth amid the flood of news . Questioning the integrity of all media — one aim of authoritarianism — can in turn lead to a kind of fatalism and policy paralysis .
The WhatsApp propaganda in Brazil is one example of the effect Deibert is talking about . A well-funded campaign to spread false information was extremely difficult for Bolsonaro ’ s opponents and Brazil ’ s independent press to expose or discredit . The falsehoods these messages spread likely became truth in the eyes of a significant percentage of people who encountered them , many of whom would never see rebuttals and wouldn ’ t believe them if they did .
Donald Trump and his allies in the more unscrupulous parts of the American conservative movement employ a similar strategy . The president lies , a lot ; while the mainstream press debunks him , right-wing outlets spread those falsehoods or manufactured supporting evidence on social media , where they cement as fact in the eyes of the president ’ s hardcore supporters .
A recent study found that conservatives were more than four times as likely to share fake news on Facebook as liberals . Another study , from researchers at the University of Oxford , found that conservative users were overwhelmingly more likely to spread “ junk news ” ( defined as outlets that “ deliberately publish misleading , deceptive or incorrect information ” ) .
“ On Twitter , a network of Trump supporters consumes the largest volume of junk news , and junk news is the largest proportion of news links they share , ” the Oxford researchers write . “ Extreme hard right [ Facebook ] pages — distinct from Republican pages — share more junk news than all the other audiences put together . ”
We ’ re seeing the same phenomenon beyond the US and Brazil . The Philippines ’ Rodrigo Duterte has cultivated an online fan base — even bringing popular social media influencers into the government — that ’ s known for “ patriotic trolling ” : sending hate messages to his critics and spreading smears about them . The Philippine news site Rappler has identified a network of more than 12 million pro-Duterte propaganda accounts on various platforms , reporting that led to a concerted smear campaign against the site from Duterte ’ s fans . An # UnfollowRappler social media campaign cost the site tens of thousands of Facebook followers , a huge hit for an online publication that depends on clicks to stay profitable .
Social media isn ’ t the only — or even the primary — reason far-right populists have been able to win elections . There are all sorts of more fundamental reasons , ranging from ethnic divisions to anxiety about crime to the weakness of the political opposition that these leaders have exploited in their rise to power . It would be absurd to blame technology for a phenomenon that has much deeper political roots .
But while the global challenge to democracy from within isn ’ t social media ’ s fault , the major platforms do seem to be making this crisis worse . The platforms by their nature allow far-right politicians to marginalize opponents , consolidate their base , and exacerbate the social divisions that helped them rise to power . It helps them act like authoritarians even inside the confines of a democratic political system .
“ Social media [ outlets ] not only are compatible with authoritarianism ; they may be one of the main reasons why authoritarian practices are now spreading worldwide , ” as Deibert puts it .
But it ’ s possible we need to go even further than Deibert and the studies he cites . It ’ s not just that social media is happening to help spread authoritarian behavior as a matter of chance or circumstance . Rather , it ’ s that the platforms by their very nature give anti-democratic politicians a leg up over their opponents .
To understand why , it ’ s worth dividing a politician ’ s use of social media into two basic types : normal use and abuse . Normal use of social media is simply an online extension of typical democratic campaign tactics : paying for ads spreading your message or uploading a campaign video to YouTube . Abuse involves the deliberate spread of false information , attempts to undermine faith in established reality , trolling , and harassment .
Normal use of social media can be equally helpful to all politicians , far-right or otherwise . But the negative use of social media , as in the Trump and Bolsonaro campaigns , intrinsically advantages anti-democratic political factions over their opponents .
Now , spreading misinformation isn ’ t necessarily a silver bullet for winning elections . It sure seems social media abuse helped Bolsonaro , but the extent is not quite clear . Studies conflict on whether fake news helped Trump win the 2016 election . A review from a group of leading interdisciplinary experts , published in the prestigious journal Science last March , found that there was not yet sufficient evidence to determine how effective abuses of social media are in shifting voting behavior . They could matter , and could even matter a lot ; right now , we just don ’ t know enough to say .
But the abuse of social media can have more subtly corrosive effects on a democracy . Authoritarians don ’ t win solely by spreading their own message ; they win by exploiting conditions under which citizens become either indifferent to democratic institutions or actively hostile to them . By working to increase political apathy and undermining trust in established institutions , far-right parties strengthen themselves at the expense of mainstream parties .
The abuse of social media can be used to inflame these tensions — in essence , providing oxygen to the underlying social trends that produced far-right authoritarians in the first place . When fake news is flying around , no matter who ’ s spreading it , people lose faith in the trustworthiness of their social institutions or perhaps even in the very idea of truth in politics . The spread of that attitude disproportionately benefits authoritarian factions in elections and weakens democratic ones .
The University of Oxford ’ s Samantha Bradshaw and Philip Howard put out a report last year on the political abuse of social media platforms in 48 countries . They argue that in each of these cases , the use of tools like fake news and trolling undermine the health of democratic regimes and benefit authoritarians .
“ There is mounting evidence that social media are being used to manipulate and deceive the voting public — and to undermine democracies and degrade public life , ” they write . “ Social media have gone from being the natural infrastructure for sharing collective grievances and coordinating civic engagement , to being a computational tool for social control , manipulated by canny political consultants , and available to politicians in democracies and dictatorships alike . ”
Social media disproportionately serves far-right politicians in another way : by helping them stoke social divisions .

The ease with which rumors and false information can be spread on social media , and the intrinsic difficulty in debunking these ideas once they ’ re out there , makes them ideal platforms to spread demagogic messages . You can abuse social media to demonize out-groups , but it ’ s much harder to do so to improve their images with the public . A study in Germany found that , all other things being equal , areas with higher rates of Facebook use saw higher rates of hate crimes targeting immigrants .
Pro-democracy politicians are much less likely to benefit from these kinds of illiberal messages . Their core supporters are much more likely to hold basic democratic commitments to equality and freedom , and thus they will lose rather than win support by stoking prejudice . The more anger there is out there , the better off anti-democratic forces are .
A BuzzFeed analysis found that between 2012 and 2017 , seven of the 10 most popular articles about German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Facebook were false . Merkel is widely seen as a champion of European liberal values and inclusiveness , one of the major bulwarks against the far-right tide on the continent . Three of the seven false articles in the BuzzFeed list were attacks on her immigration record , all focusing on making immigrants seem like threats to Germany and Merkel unreasonably sympathetic .
Social media appears to be better suited to dividing than uniting , at least when it comes to politics . The glut of information , impossible to sort through for the ordinary citizen , shakes people ’ s understanding of the world and causes them to retreat back to their own biases . Social media , in the way it ’ s used now , objectively favors authoritarians .
Now , to be fair , there are places where the Arab Spring-era promise of social media hasn ’ t been extinguished .
In Hungary , where Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has all but stamped out the independent press , Facebook has been a useful tool for citizens who want to counter government propaganda . Citizens opposed to Turkey ’ s elected authoritarian , President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , have been able to effectively spread anti-Erdogan messages online .
Even in more traditional dictatorships , social media ’ s democratic potential hasn ’ t been entirely repressed . The Sudanese government was forced to block a number of platforms in early January in response to a burgeoning protest movement using social media to spread its message .
But all these examples show is that not every authoritarian populist , or even straight-up authoritarian , is good at handling social media . There ’ s nothing about Hungarian Facebook that makes it more resistant to fake news than Brazilian Facebook . It ’ s just that Bolsonaro and his supporters have done a better job at realizing social media ’ s propaganda potential than Orbán and his camp .
It ’ s best to think of the nature of social media as a medium that gives authoritarians an advantage , but not an insurmountable one . It can end up favoring pro-democracy forces , in certain situations and under the right conditions .
But if both sides are equally skilled , the authoritarians should have a leg up . The deluge of information on social media overwhelms current platforms ’ potential to spread important information .
Social media right now is functioning as a kind of parody of the classic “ marketplace of ideas ” mode of the public square . Instead of the best ideas winning out in free debate , there are so many bad ideas that the good ones simply get drowned out .
In August 2018 , MIT Technology Review revisited its 2013 “ Big Data Will Save Politics ” cover , publishing a series of essays examining whether the technology had lived up to its promise . The overwhelming conclusion was that the magazine had been far too naive .

Correction : An earlier version of this piece misstated the last name of the of the MIT Technology Review ’ s editor as Gideon Richfield ; it is Gideon Lichfield .","At the inauguration of Brazil’s new far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, in early January, a crowd of his supporters began a surprising chant. They weren’t cheering for Bolsonaro or his running mate or their party; instead, they were reciting the names of social media platforms.

“Facebook, Facebook, Facebook!” the crowd yelled. “WhatsApp, WhatsApp, WhatsApp!”

They were crediting the platforms with their man’s victory, and they aren’t entirely wrong. During the campaign, a conservative pro-business interest group funded a massive disinformation campaign on WhatsApp (the popular messaging app owned by Facebook). False and damaging information about Bolsonaro’s left-wing opponent, including fake news mocked up to look like neutral fact-checks, spread like wildfire in the runup to the October 8 vote. This deluge, according to one Brazilian expert, played a role in Bolsonaro’s victory.

The glee Bolsonaro’s supporters exhibited points to a troubling development, one familiar to many Americans: Social media, once seen as a profoundly democratic technology, is increasingly serving the needs of authoritarians and their allies.

Many observers have noted that entrenched authoritarian states, like Russia and China, have gotten very good at manipulating these platforms to marginalize domestic dissidents and destabilize democracies abroad. What’s gotten less attention is how authoritarian factions inside democratic states — far-right politicians and parties that are at best indifferent to democratic norms — benefit from the nature of modern social media platforms.

Authoritarians of both sorts benefit from spreading falsehoods about their opponents, ginning up panics about minority groups, and undermining people’s trust in the independent media. Both the 2016 US election and the 2018 Brazilian vote proved social media is a perfect tool for this kind of activity.

Social media can certainly help pro-democracy movements at times, but they overall give far-right parties and authoritarians an advantage. These platforms, once seen as democracy’s ally, have increasingly become its enemy.

It is easier to spread misinformation on social media than to correct it, and easier to inflame social divisions than to mend them. The very nature of how we engage with Facebook and the rest now helps far-right, authoritarian factions weaken the foundations of democratic systems — and even give themselves an easier pathway to seizing power.

It seems we have to admit a somewhat uncomfortable truth: Social media, in the way that it’s used now, is an authoritarian medium.

How the far right exploits social media

The Journal of Democracy is one of the premier academic venues for analyzing the current state of democratic politics. Its most recent issue features an essay from Ronald Deibert, a political scientist and director of the University of Toronto’s tech-focused Citizen Lab, on the role of social media in modern politics. His conclusion is pretty grim.

“It seems undeniable,” Deibert writes, “that social media must bear some of the blame for the descent into neo-fascism.”

Ten years ago, Deibert’s view — now widely shared among journalists and scholars — would have sounded absurd.

In 2009, Iranians rose up to protest against a rigged election, the so-called “Green Movement” using Facebook and YouTube clips of protests to spread their message globally. Two years later, the Arab Spring protests showed the true power of these mediums, as protest movements that made skillful use of social media for coordination and messaging toppled regimes in Tunisia and Egypt.

At the time, the consensus among observers was that social media was, by its very nature, democratizing. Social media facilitates the swift spread of information, allowing citizens to easily get around government censors. Social media allows rapid communication among large groups of disparate people, giving citizen activists new tools for organizing actions. The spread of social media would necessarily weaken authoritarian states and strengthen democracies — or, at least, that’s how the argument went.

There were some dissenters, like the acerbic writer Evgeny Morosov, but they were largely brushed aside in an Arab Spring-induced high. More representative was the 2013 issue of the MIT Technology Review titled “Big Data Will Save Politics,” featuring an interview with the singer Bono declaring that new technologies would be “deadly to dictators.”

This theory turned out to be partly true: It can be difficult to simply repress the spread of information on social media. But as we’ve come to discover, it’s equally difficult to repress the spread of disinformation. The core feature of social media that gives it democratic promise, the rapid spread of information, can be used against democracy via information overload.

A savvy person or political party looking to discredit online critics doesn’t need to ban their speech to hamstring it. Instead, they can respond with a deluge of false or misleading information, making it very hard for ordinary citizens to figure out what’s actually going on.

Deibert’s essay usefully summarizes a number of different studies documenting how well the twisted jiujitsu of misinformation and information overload works:

An always-on, real-time information tsunami creates the perfect environment for the spread of falsehoods, conspiracy theories, rumors, and “leaks.” Unsubstantiated claims and narratives go viral while fact-checking efforts struggle to keep up. Members of the public, including researchers and investigative journalists, may not have the expertise, tools, or time to verify claims. By the time they do, the falsehoods may have already embedded themselves in the collective consciousness. Meanwhile, fresh scandals or outlandish claims are continuously raining down on users, mixing fact with fiction. Worse yet, studies have found that attempts “to quash rumors through direct refutation may facilitate their diffusion by increasing fluency.” In other words, efforts to correct falsehoods can ironically contribute to their further propagation and even acceptance. The constant bombardment of tainted leaks, conspiracy theories, and other misinformation in turn fuels cynicism, with citizens growing fatigued as they try to discern objective truth amid the flood of news. Questioning the integrity of all media — one aim of authoritarianism — can in turn lead to a kind of fatalism and policy paralysis.

The WhatsApp propaganda in Brazil is one example of the effect Deibert is talking about. A well-funded campaign to spread false information was extremely difficult for Bolsonaro’s opponents and Brazil’s independent press to expose or discredit. The falsehoods these messages spread likely became truth in the eyes of a significant percentage of people who encountered them, many of whom would never see rebuttals and wouldn’t believe them if they did.

Donald Trump and his allies in the more unscrupulous parts of the American conservative movement employ a similar strategy. The president lies, a lot; while the mainstream press debunks him, right-wing outlets spread those falsehoods or manufactured supporting evidence on social media, where they cement as fact in the eyes of the president’s hardcore supporters.

A recent study found that conservatives were more than four times as likely to share fake news on Facebook as liberals. Another study, from researchers at the University of Oxford, found that conservative users were overwhelmingly more likely to spread “junk news” (defined as outlets that “deliberately publish misleading, deceptive or incorrect information”).

“On Twitter, a network of Trump supporters consumes the largest volume of junk news, and junk news is the largest proportion of news links they share,” the Oxford researchers write. “Extreme hard right [Facebook] pages — distinct from Republican pages — share more junk news than all the other audiences put together.”

We’re seeing the same phenomenon beyond the US and Brazil. The Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte has cultivated an online fan base — even bringing popular social media influencers into the government — that’s known for “patriotic trolling”: sending hate messages to his critics and spreading smears about them. The Philippine news site Rappler has identified a network of more than 12 million pro-Duterte propaganda accounts on various platforms, reporting that led to a concerted smear campaign against the site from Duterte’s fans. An #UnfollowRappler social media campaign cost the site tens of thousands of Facebook followers, a huge hit for an online publication that depends on clicks to stay profitable.

Social media isn’t the only — or even the primary — reason far-right populists have been able to win elections. There are all sorts of more fundamental reasons, ranging from ethnic divisions to anxiety about crime to the weakness of the political opposition that these leaders have exploited in their rise to power. It would be absurd to blame technology for a phenomenon that has much deeper political roots.

But while the global challenge to democracy from within isn’t social media’s fault, the major platforms do seem to be making this crisis worse. The platforms by their nature allow far-right politicians to marginalize opponents, consolidate their base, and exacerbate the social divisions that helped them rise to power. It helps them act like authoritarians even inside the confines of a democratic political system.

“Social media [outlets] not only are compatible with authoritarianism; they may be one of the main reasons why authoritarian practices are now spreading worldwide,” as Deibert puts it.

Why social media advantages the far right over democracies

But it’s possible we need to go even further than Deibert and the studies he cites. It’s not just that social media is happening to help spread authoritarian behavior as a matter of chance or circumstance. Rather, it’s that the platforms by their very nature give anti-democratic politicians a leg up over their opponents.

To understand why, it’s worth dividing a politician’s use of social media into two basic types: normal use and abuse. Normal use of social media is simply an online extension of typical democratic campaign tactics: paying for ads spreading your message or uploading a campaign video to YouTube. Abuse involves the deliberate spread of false information, attempts to undermine faith in established reality, trolling, and harassment.

Normal use of social media can be equally helpful to all politicians, far-right or otherwise. But the negative use of social media, as in the Trump and Bolsonaro campaigns, intrinsically advantages anti-democratic political factions over their opponents.

Now, spreading misinformation isn’t necessarily a silver bullet for winning elections. It sure seems social media abuse helped Bolsonaro, but the extent is not quite clear. Studies conflict on whether fake news helped Trump win the 2016 election. A review from a group of leading interdisciplinary experts, published in the prestigious journal Science last March, found that there was not yet sufficient evidence to determine how effective abuses of social media are in shifting voting behavior. They could matter, and could even matter a lot; right now, we just don’t know enough to say.

But the abuse of social media can have more subtly corrosive effects on a democracy. Authoritarians don’t win solely by spreading their own message; they win by exploiting conditions under which citizens become either indifferent to democratic institutions or actively hostile to them. By working to increase political apathy and undermining trust in established institutions, far-right parties strengthen themselves at the expense of mainstream parties.

The abuse of social media can be used to inflame these tensions — in essence, providing oxygen to the underlying social trends that produced far-right authoritarians in the first place. When fake news is flying around, no matter who’s spreading it, people lose faith in the trustworthiness of their social institutions or perhaps even in the very idea of truth in politics. The spread of that attitude disproportionately benefits authoritarian factions in elections and weakens democratic ones.

The University of Oxford’s Samantha Bradshaw and Philip Howard put out a report last year on the political abuse of social media platforms in 48 countries. They argue that in each of these cases, the use of tools like fake news and trolling undermine the health of democratic regimes and benefit authoritarians.

“There is mounting evidence that social media are being used to manipulate and deceive the voting public — and to undermine democracies and degrade public life,” they write. “Social media have gone from being the natural infrastructure for sharing collective grievances and coordinating civic engagement, to being a computational tool for social control, manipulated by canny political consultants, and available to politicians in democracies and dictatorships alike.”

Social media disproportionately serves far-right politicians in another way: by helping them stoke social divisions.

Far-right parties demonize out-groups, whether racial minorities, immigrants, or even (in Duterte’s case) drug users. Their arguments center on making these groups look scary and dangerous, and ginning up fear and hatred targeting them.

The ease with which rumors and false information can be spread on social media, and the intrinsic difficulty in debunking these ideas once they’re out there, makes them ideal platforms to spread demagogic messages. You can abuse social media to demonize out-groups, but it’s much harder to do so to improve their images with the public. A study in Germany found that, all other things being equal, areas with higher rates of Facebook use saw higher rates of hate crimes targeting immigrants.

Pro-democracy politicians are much less likely to benefit from these kinds of illiberal messages. Their core supporters are much more likely to hold basic democratic commitments to equality and freedom, and thus they will lose rather than win support by stoking prejudice. The more anger there is out there, the better off anti-democratic forces are.

Three of the seven false articles in the BuzzFeed list were attacks on her immigration record, all focusing on making immigrants seem like threats to Germany and Merkel unreasonably sympathetic.

Social media appears to be better suited to dividing than uniting, at least when it comes to politics. The glut of information, impossible to sort through for the ordinary citizen, shakes people’s understanding of the world and causes them to retreat back to their own biases. Social media, in the way it’s used now, objectively favors authoritarians.

It’s not all bad, is it?

Now, to be fair, there are places where the Arab Spring-era promise of social media hasn’t been extinguished.

In Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has all but stamped out the independent press, Facebook has been a useful tool for citizens who want to counter government propaganda. Citizens opposed to Turkey’s elected authoritarian, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, have been able to effectively spread anti-Erdogan messages online.

Even in more traditional dictatorships, social media’s democratic potential hasn’t been entirely repressed. The Sudanese government was forced to block a number of platforms in early January in response to a burgeoning protest movement using social media to spread its message.

But if both sides are equally skilled, the authoritarians should have a leg up. The deluge of information on social media overwhelms current platforms’ potential to spread important information.

Social media right now is functioning as a kind of parody of the classic “marketplace of ideas” mode of the public square. Instead of the best ideas winning out in free debate, there are so many bad ideas that the good ones simply get drowned out.

Human nature wins.

In articles appearing everywhere from the New York Times and the Washington Post to The Nation and The New Republic, writers have told her that she “can’t have it all” and have derided the “emptiness of leaning in.” They “punctured” her myth and declared that her book has been “discredited for good.”

These commentators are responding to a blockbuster article in the New York Times that exposed how Facebook responded to Russian effort to use Facebook to influence the 2016 election and to Cambridge Analytica’s deceptive efforts to obtain private user data. There is no real evidence that either effort had a meaningful impact on the 2016 election (truly, Russian efforts were “tiny” compared with overall campaign spending), but just as Facebook was hyped in Obama’s 2012 victory, it is hyped in Hillary’s 2016 defeat.

Twitter, quite simply, is flailing. It has drafted an extensive hateful-conduct policy that’s broad enough to encompass an enormous amount of speech on contentious topics yet also vague enough to empower blatant double standards. Thus, Twitter preserves a platform for a man like Louis Farrakhan, who recently called Jews “termites.” When it is specific — as when it bans “targeted misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals” — its clear priority is putting its thumb on the scales for social justice.

What is going on? The answer lies in a crucial section of the Times exposé:

But as evidence accumulated that Facebook’s power could also be exploited to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg stumbled. Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view. At critical moments over the last three years, they were distracted by personal projects, and passed off security and policy decisions to subordinates, according to current and former executives.

It turns out that when you give human beings access to public platforms — and when you create a marketplace of ideas — you often unleash forces that you can’t control. Human nature asserts itself.

It also turns out that when you place even idealistic progressive icons in the crosshairs of a public-relations nightmare that threatens their life’s work, they will react defensively. They’ll seek first to preserve their corporation and their reputation. Human nature asserts itself again.

I’ve been critical of the social-media giants. I believe that in the United States they should default in favor of free speech and adopt a First Amendment–based approach to free expression — reminding disgruntled users that they can liberally use the mute and block functions to protect themselves from speech they don’t like.

But I also have a degree of sympathy. Imagine that you’re a Christian and you create a product that you truly believe will not only be commercially successful, but also will enhance people’s lives by leading indirectly to the spread of the Gospel. Imagine that the vast majority of your colleagues and employees share your same Christian worldview and your same hopes regarding the ultimate purpose of your product. Then imagine that your product instead enables a surge in Muslim or Buddhist influence, and is also tied to a surge in hate, divisiveness, and human misery.

Then imagine that you have no real idea how to fix it — how to bring it into alignment with its original purpose.

Our social-media companies face a series of fateful choices. If they choose to be primarily platforms for human expression, they’ll empower many millions of voices that they despise. They’ll facilitate outcomes they may loathe. If, by contrast, they choose to prioritize progressive ideology and progressive outcomes, they’ll limit their reach, their influence, and their wealth. They’ll open themselves up to aggressive competition.

What’s the lesson here? When you empower people, you find that they have their own will. When you seek to control that will, you find that they’ll rebel. The idealism of tech is dead. Human nature killed it. Nobody can have it all.",www.nationalreview.com,right,G5S3X174OiUcZSqa

The big reveal was somewhat thwarted by contributing researchers at NASA , who accidentally made a draft paper available . Not prone to understating its successes , Google made its bold assertion in the title of its research paper : “ Quantum supremacy using a programmable superconducting processor. ” Though the paper was quickly taken down , copies of it were archived and are floating around the web .

Here ’ s what we do know about Google ’ s claim to quantum supremacy .
Quantum supremacy is the point at which quantum computers can solve problems that are practically unsolvable for “ classical ” ( non-quantum ) computers to complete in any reasonable timeframe .
In principle , even the most simple universal computer can solve anything that is computable ⁠ ( i.e . can be represented as a formal problem for which there is an answer , or set of possible answers⁠ ) given infinite time to do so . So , “ supremacy ” is a matter of how quickly and reliably a computer can solve a problem .
“ The purpose is to show that you 've built a quantum device that can do at least one thing which is outside the reach of classical machines , ” said David Gosset , an associate professor at the Institute of Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo .
It is generally believed that at least 49 qubits are required to cross the quantum supremacy line . Qubits behave very differently to bits in classical computers . Bits represent either a “ 1 ” or a “ 0 , ” and computers read and perform operations on one bit at a time . In contrast , qubits can represent a combination state made up of both “ 1 ” and “ 0 , ” due to the peculiar quantum effects in which properties like particle position , direction , and momentum are not well-defined . This allows for a system to be in multiple states at the same time , called quantum indeterminacy .
Quantum computers can use quantum operators ( a mathematical transformation ) on all possible values within a qubit state , so it can read and change a “ 1 ” and a “ 0 ” piece of information at the same time . The ability to instantly process more information and simultaneously act on that information is what enables quantum computers to perform extremely complex tasks much faster than classical computers .
Before the inadvertent announcement about supremacy , Google was already leading the pack in terms of the sheer size of its quantum computer . Last year it revealed a new 73-qubit computer , putting it ahead of closest rival IBM , which happened to announce its own development of a 53-qubit computer on September 18 .
For its supremacy demonstration , however , Google used a different , smaller computer , named Sycamore .
As described in the leaked paper , Google used a 53-qubit processor ( originally 54 qubits , but one qubit let the team down ) to perform a sampling task . First , a classical computer was used to generate a series of quantum instructions called quantum gates , the equivalent of logic gates which act on the 1s and 0s in classical computers . This series , collectively called a quantum circuit , was sent to the quantum computer to perform only on qubits in pure zero states , generating a probability distribution for resulting states . ( This is a function that assigns probabilities to all possible values , because of the indeterminacy features of quantum physics . ) Finally , the quantum computer was asked to output samples from the probability distribution .
To check that the quantum computer actually performed this task , the team had to use a classical computer as a “ simulator ” to verify that samples of the quantum computer ’ s output are close to the expected values .
The classical simulator uses mathematical techniques to generate a similar probability distribution function to compare with the quantum computer , but it doesn ’ t actually execute the same operations—this would undermine the demonstration of quantum supremacy . The simulation takes a huge amount of resource and time , increasing with the size of the quantum computer it is checking . Using classical computers to verify quantum supremacy is only possible when quantum computers are around 50 qubits or less .
It looks like Sycamore did complete this job pretty quickly , within the allowed error thresholds . In a shorter summary paper which also appeared online , Google ’ s researchers estimate it would take the most advanced classical computer today 10,000 years to do sampling that the quantum computer did in 200 seconds .
This doesn ’ t rule out the possibility that there is a very efficient algorithm which could enable a classical computer to do the same task in a reasonable timeframe . Currently , no one has proven mathematically that such an algorithm does not exist , but there are weaker proofs that make it unlikely that a yet-undiscovered super-fast classical algorithm exists .

Here’s what we do know about Google’s claim to quantum supremacy.

What is ‘quantum supremacy’?

Quantum supremacy is the point at which quantum computers can solve problems that are practically unsolvable for “classical” (non-quantum) computers to complete in any reasonable timeframe.

In principle, even the most simple universal computer can solve anything that is computable ⁠(i.e. can be represented as a formal problem for which there is an answer, or set of possible answers⁠) given infinite time to do so. So, “supremacy” is a matter of how quickly and reliably a computer can solve a problem.

“The purpose is to show that you've built a quantum device that can do at least one thing which is outside the reach of classical machines,” said David Gosset, an associate professor at the Institute of Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo.

It is generally believed that at least 49 qubits are required to cross the quantum supremacy line. Qubits behave very differently to bits in classical computers. Bits represent either a “1” or a “0,” and computers read and perform operations on one bit at a time. In contrast, qubits can represent a combination state made up of both “1” and “0,” due to the peculiar quantum effects in which properties like particle position, direction, and momentum are not well-defined. This allows for a system to be in multiple states at the same time, called quantum indeterminacy.

Quantum computers can use quantum operators (a mathematical transformation) on all possible values within a qubit state, so it can read and change a “1” and a “0” piece of information at the same time. The ability to instantly process more information and simultaneously act on that information is what enables quantum computers to perform extremely complex tasks much faster than classical computers.

What did Google do?

Before the inadvertent announcement about supremacy, Google was already leading the pack in terms of the sheer size of its quantum computer. Last year it revealed a new 73-qubit computer, putting it ahead of closest rival IBM, which happened to announce its own development of a 53-qubit computer on September 18.

(This is a function that assigns probabilities to all possible values, because of the indeterminacy features of quantum physics.) Finally, the quantum computer was asked to output samples from the probability distribution.

To check that the quantum computer actually performed this task, the team had to use a classical computer as a “simulator” to verify that samples of the quantum computer’s output are close to the expected values.

The classical simulator uses mathematical techniques to generate a similar probability distribution function to compare with the quantum computer, but it doesn’t actually execute the same operations—this would undermine the demonstration of quantum supremacy. The simulation takes a huge amount of resource and time, increasing with the size of the quantum computer it is checking. Using classical computers to verify quantum supremacy is only possible when quantum computers are around 50 qubits or less.

Currently, no one has proven mathematically that such an algorithm does not exist, but there are weaker proofs that make it unlikely that a yet-undiscovered super-fast classical algorithm exists.

How important is this result?

In response to the leaked announcement, presidential candidate Andrew Yang declared that it meant “no code is uncrackable.” He was roundly roasted.

See, a major concern about quantum computing in general is that our current security and encryption protocols will no longer be safe from ultra-fast and powerful machines.

Putting claims of supremacy aside, the key innovation is Google’s superconducting processor is programmable, so it can receive instructions for different tasks, some of which may be beyond the reach of classical computers.

Net neutrality has become a major flash point with liberal activists and a broad swath of the online community saying the rules prevent internet companies from slowing down or otherwise hindering access to some websites .
“ This is a fight for the most powerful platform for commerce and communications in the history of the internet , ” said Sen. Ed Markey , Massachusetts Democrat , who is leading the new effort .
Democrats are using the Congressional Review Act to try to overturn the December decision by the Federal Communications Commission to cancel net neutrality .
The CRA , which Republicans used to revoke more than a dozen Obama-era rules , sets up a speedy timeline for action in Congress and only requires a majority vote in the Senate .
Democrats say they can reach that threshold , with all 49 members of their caucus and Sen. Susan Collins , Maine Republican , prepared to vote with them . With Sen. John McCain , Arizona Republican , having missed votes this year as he battles cancer , the 50-49 vote would be enough to clear the Senate .

“ The administration supports the FCC ’ s efforts and at the same time the White House certainly has and always will support a free and fair internet , ” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in December , at the time of the FCC ’ s vote .
Mrs. Sanders said the White House wants to see Congress take action to ensure fair rules for everyone , rather than the FCC through its rule-making process .
Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce , Science , and Transportation Sen. John Thune , South Dakota Republican , called the Democrats ’ push for a vote “ political theater . ”

Republican senators say Democrats are looking to restore outdated regulations rather than working together on a forward-thinking , bipartisan fix .

Net neutrality has become a major flash point with liberal activists and a broad swath of the online community saying the rules prevent internet companies from slowing down or otherwise hindering access to some websites.

“This is a fight for the most powerful platform for commerce and communications in the history of the internet,” said Sen. Ed Markey, Massachusetts Democrat, who is leading the new effort.

At eBay ’ s annual board retreat in Half Moon Bay , Calif. , in June , the company ’ s 12 directors found themselves moving in a somewhat unexpected direction : breaking up the company just as the hedge fund billionaire Carl C. Icahn had suggested .
Only six months earlier , eBay had rejected Mr. Icahn ’ s call to spin off PayPal , the payment processor , which generated nearly half of the overall company ’ s revenue . At the time , management insisted that keeping the company together made more sense .

We “ got to the same place that Carl said early on , ” Mr. Donahoe said in an interview .
By September , the directors had formally decided to pursue a strategy that their onetime nemesis had advocated all along . On Tuesday , the company announced that PayPal would be spun off as a separate publicly traded company , letting each of eBay ’ s two main businesses chart its own course while maintaining most of their important business ties .
The spinoff , set to be completed in the second half of next year , is one of the biggest changes in the nearly 20-year history of eBay , in a single stroke reducing the company largely to its enormous online marketplaces . And it makes PayPal , which has grown tremendously since eBay bought it in 2002 , an independent company free to pursue its own strategy .
Investors applauded the move , pushing eBay ’ s shares up 7.5 percent on Tuesday , to $ 56.63 .
The breakup of eBay is among the most prominent in corporate America this year , as companies have looked to simplify their businesses in hopes of appeasing shareholders hungry for ways to bolster stock prices . Spinoffs have been especially popular among activist shareholders , who buy stakes in companies and call for changes .
But the decision was especially notable given eBay ’ s full-throated defense against the often vitriolic assault by Mr. Icahn , who called eBay among the worst-run companies he had ever seen and described Mr. Donahoe as “ either incompetent or negligent. ” On Tuesday , even Mr. Icahn , a longtime corporate raider , seemed surprised by the apparent change of heart , writing on his corporate blog , “ We are happy that eBay ’ s board and management have acted responsibly concerning the separation — perhaps a little later than they should have , but earlier than we expected . ”

On Tuesday, the company announced that PayPal would be spun off as a separate publicly traded company, letting each of eBay’s two main businesses chart its own course while maintaining most of their important business ties.

The spinoff, set to be completed in the second half of next year, is one of the biggest changes in the nearly 20-year history of eBay, in a single stroke reducing the company largely to its enormous online marketplaces.

Ultimately, Mr. Icahn succeeded, though Mr. Donahoe contended that the company had arrived at its conclusion through “a deliberate process” and not by reacting to outside pressure.

Several factors were weighing on the eBay board.

Since its acquisition, PayPal has grown far beyond being just the payment processor for countless online auctions. Indeed, it has been one of the fastest-growing parts of eBay, accounting for 41 percent of its parent’s total net revenue last year. Over the last 12 months, PayPal processed about $203 billion in payment volume and now has roughly 153 million active digital wallets.

technology,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53425822,Major US Twitter accounts hacked in Bitcoin scam,,,"Billionaires Elon Musk , Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates are among many prominent US figures targeted by hackers on Twitter in an apparent Bitcoin scam .
The official accounts of Barack Obama , Joe Biden and Kanye West also requested donations in the cryptocurrency .
`` Everyone is asking me to give back , '' a tweet from Mr Gates ' account said . `` You send $ 1,000 , I send you back $ 2,000 . ''
The US Senate Commerce committee has demanded Twitter brief it about the incident next week .
Twitter said it was a `` co-ordinated '' attack targeting its employees `` with access to internal systems and tools '' .
`` We know they [ the hackers ] used this access to take control of many highly-visible ( including verified ) accounts and Tweet on their behalf , '' the company said in a series of tweets .
It added that `` significant steps '' had been taken to limit access to such internal systems and tools while the company 's investigation was ongoing .
The firm has also blocked users from being able to tweet Bitcoin wallet addresses for the time being .
Meanwhile , Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey tweeted : `` Tough day for us at Twitter . We all feel terrible this happened . ''
The UK 's National Cyber Security Centre said its officers had `` reached out '' to the tech firm .
`` While this appears to be an attack on the company rather than individual users , we would urge people to treat requests for money or sensitive information on social media with extreme caution , '' it added in a statement .
US politicians also have questions . Republican Senator Josh Hawley has written to the company asking if President Trump 's account had been vulnerable .
President Trump 's account was not compromised , the White House said . `` The president will remain on Twitter . His account was secure and not jeopardised during these attacks , '' a statement said .
The chair of the Senate Commerce committee has also been in contact with Twitter .
`` It can not be overstated how troubling this incident is , both in its effects and in the apparent failure of Twitter 's internal controls to prevent it , '' Senator Roger Wicker wrote to the firm .
He added that the company must brief the committee 's staff about the hack no later than Thursday 23 July .
One cyber-security expert said that the breach could have been a lot worse in other circumstances .
`` If you were to have this kind of incident take place in the middle of a crisis , where Twitter was being used to either communicate de-escalatory language or critical information to the public , and suddenly it 's putting out the wrong messages from several verified status accounts - that could be seriously destabilising , '' Dr Alexi Drew from King 's College London told the BBC .
Twitter earlier had to take the extraordinary step of stopping many verified accounts marked with blue ticks from tweeting altogether .
Password reset requests were also being denied and some other `` account functions '' disabled .
By 20:30 EDT ( 00:30 GMT Thursday ) users with verified account started to be able to send tweets again , but Twitter said it was still working on a fix .
Dmitri Alperovitch , who co-founded cyber-security company CrowdStrike , told Reuters news agency : `` This appears to be the worst hack of a major social media platform yet . ''
On the official account of Mr Musk , the Tesla and SpaceX chief appeared to offer to double any Bitcoin payment sent to the address of his digital wallet `` for the next 30 minutes '' .
`` I 'm feeling generous because of Covid-19 , '' the tweet added , along with a Bitcoin link address .
The tweets were deleted just minutes after they were first posted .
But as the first such tweet from Musk 's account was removed , another one appeared , then a third .
former US Vice-President Joe Biden , who is the current Democratic presidential candidate
The Biden campaign said Twitter had `` locked down the account within a few minutes of the breach and removed the related tweet '' .
A spokesman for Bill Gates told AP news agency : `` This appears to be part of a larger issue that Twitter is facing . ''
The name `` Anthony Elias '' was used to register the website , but may be a pseudonym - it appears to be a play on `` an alias '' .
Cryptoforhealth is also a registered user name on Instagram , apparently set up contemporaneously to the hack .
The description of the profile read `` It was us '' , alongside a slightly smiling face emoticon .
The Instagram profile also posted a message that said : `` It was a charity attack . Your money will find its way to the right place . ''
In any case , the real identities of the perpetrators are as yet unknown .
These `` double your Bitcoin '' scams have been a persistent pest on Twitter for years but this is unprecedented with the actual accounts of public figures hijacked and on a large scale .
The fact that so many different users have been compromised at the same time implies that this is a problem with Twitter 's platform itself .

Billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates are among many prominent US figures targeted by hackers on Twitter in an apparent Bitcoin scam.

The official accounts of Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Kanye West also requested donations in the cryptocurrency.

""Everyone is asking me to give back,"" a tweet from Mr Gates' account said. ""You send $1,000, I send you back $2,000.""

The US Senate Commerce committee has demanded Twitter brief it about the incident next week.

Twitter said it was a ""co-ordinated"" attack targeting its employees ""with access to internal systems and tools"".

""We know they [the hackers] used this access to take control of many highly-visible (including verified) accounts and Tweet on their behalf,"" the company said in a series of tweets.

It added that ""significant steps"" had been taken to limit access to such internal systems and tools while the company's investigation was ongoing.

The firm has also blocked users from being able to tweet Bitcoin wallet addresses for the time being.

Meanwhile, Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey tweeted: ""Tough day for us at Twitter. We all feel terrible this happened.""

The UK's National Cyber Security Centre said its officers had ""reached out"" to the tech firm.

""While this appears to be an attack on the company rather than individual users, we would urge people to treat requests for money or sensitive information on social media with extreme caution,"" it added in a statement.

US politicians also have questions. Republican Senator Josh Hawley has written to the company asking if President Trump's account had been vulnerable.

President Trump's account was not compromised, the White House said. ""The president will remain on Twitter. His account was secure and not jeopardised during these attacks,"" a statement said.

The chair of the Senate Commerce committee has also been in contact with Twitter.

""It cannot be overstated how troubling this incident is, both in its effects and in the apparent failure of Twitter's internal controls to prevent it,"" Senator Roger Wicker wrote to the firm.

He added that the company must brief the committee's staff about the hack no later than Thursday 23 July.

One cyber-security expert said that the breach could have been a lot worse in other circumstances.

""If you were to have this kind of incident take place in the middle of a crisis, where Twitter was being used to either communicate de-escalatory language or critical information to the public, and suddenly it's putting out the wrong messages from several verified status accounts - that could be seriously destabilising,"" Dr Alexi Drew from King's College London told the BBC.

Emergency response

Twitter earlier had to take the extraordinary step of stopping many verified accounts marked with blue ticks from tweeting altogether.

Password reset requests were also being denied and some other ""account functions"" disabled.

By 20:30 EDT (00:30 GMT Thursday) users with verified account started to be able to send tweets again, but Twitter said it was still working on a fix.

Dmitri Alperovitch, who co-founded cyber-security company CrowdStrike, told Reuters news agency: ""This appears to be the worst hack of a major social media platform yet.""

On the official account of Mr Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX chief appeared to offer to double any Bitcoin payment sent to the address of his digital wallet ""for the next 30 minutes"".

""I'm feeling generous because of Covid-19,"" the tweet added, along with a Bitcoin link address.

The tweets were deleted just minutes after they were first posted.

But as the first such tweet from Musk's account was removed, another one appeared, then a third.

Others targeted included:

the rapper Kanye West

reality TV star Kim Kardashian West

former US President Obama

former US Vice-President Joe Biden, who is the current Democratic presidential candidate

media billionaire Mike Bloomberg

the ride-sharing app Uber

the iPhone-maker Apple

The Biden campaign said Twitter had ""locked down the account within a few minutes of the breach and removed the related tweet"".

A spokesman for Bill Gates told AP news agency: ""This appears to be part of a larger issue that Twitter is facing.""

Instagram message

The BBC can report from a security source that a web address - cryptoforhealth.com - to which some hacked tweets directed users was registered by a cyber-attacker using the email address mkeyworth5@gmail.com.

The name ""Anthony Elias"" was used to register the website, but may be a pseudonym - it appears to be a play on ""an alias"".

Cryptoforhealth is also a registered user name on Instagram, apparently set up contemporaneously to the hack.

The description of the profile read ""It was us"", alongside a slightly smiling face emoticon.

The Instagram profile also posted a message that said: ""It was a charity attack. Your money will find its way to the right place.""

In any case, the real identities of the perpetrators are as yet unknown.

An unprecedented 'smash and grab'

These ""double your Bitcoin"" scams have been a persistent pest on Twitter for years but this is unprecedented with the actual accounts of public figures hijacked and on a large scale.

The fact that so many different users have been compromised at the same time implies that this is a problem with Twitter's platform itself.

Early suggestions are that someone has managed to get hold of some sort of administration privileges and bypassed the passwords of pretty much any account they want.

With so much power at their fingertips the attackers could have done a lot more damage with more sophisticated tweets that could have harmed an individual or organisation's reputation.

But the motive seems to be clear - make as much money as quickly as they can. The hackers would have known that the tweets wouldn't stay up for long so this was the equivalent of a ""smash and grab"" operation.

There are conflicting accounts of how much money the hackers have made and even when a figure is settled upon, it's important to remember that cyber-criminals are known to add their own funds into their Bitcoin wallets to make the scam seem more legitimate.

Either way, it's going to be very hard to catch the criminals by following the money. Law enforcement, as well as many angry users, will have some strong questions for Twitter about how this could have happened.

Cameron Winklevoss, who was declared the world's first Bitcoin billionaire in 2017 along with his twin brother Tyler, tweeted a message on Wednesday warning people not to participate in the ""scam"".

In the short time it was online, the link displayed in the tweets of targeted accounts received hundreds of contributions totalling more than $100,000 (£80,000), according to publicly available blockchain records.

The Twitter accounts targeted have millions of followers.

Last year, Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey's account was hacked, but the company said it had fixed the flaw that left his account vulnerable.

No such progressive zealotry exists today in Silicon Valley and its affiliated tech spin-offs. And the result is a Roman gladiatorial spectacle with no laws in the arena.

In the last two elections, Facebook has sold its user data to Democratic and, apparently more controversially, Republican campaign affiliates.

This might seem harmless on some level , but these accounts had been disseminating incredibly divisive ( and oftentimes fake ) stories about Brexit , Ukraine , and Syria , plus anti-immigration articles from outlets like Breitbart and excessively schismatic articles from the Daily Mail . The researcher also found that these accounts only tweeted between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Moscow time , and only during the week—almost as if it were someone ’ s job in Russia to do so .

Before Trump co-opted the term “fake news” to describe entirely accurate, if unfavorable, stories about him, real fake news was being created and proliferated at scale. Algorithms on Facebook didn’t work to try to stop this from happening, but rather to ensure that these fake stories landed right on the digital doorsteps of the people who might find them most interesting, and who might change their votes as a result of that content. Twitter’s problem with political bots has existed for as long as I can remember. Earlier this year, a data researcher noticed that there were hundreds of Twitter accounts ending with a string of eight numbers (like @DavidJo52951945) that only tweeted about hot-button political topics, all of which followed each other. This might seem harmless on some level, but these accounts had been disseminating incredibly divisive (and oftentimes fake) stories about Brexit, Ukraine, and Syria, plus anti-immigration articles from outlets like Breitbart and excessively schismatic articles from the Daily Mail. The researcher also found that these accounts only tweeted between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Moscow time, and only during the week—almost as if it were someone’s job in Russia to do so. The accounts have tens of thousands of followers, and the suspected propagandists behind them stoked the flames of dissent by creating far-left bots which would go after Trump and his supporters.

I don’t actually see these issues as massive problems within themselves. Of course people are going to try to manipulate these technologies. The larger issue, however, is that these enormous, profoundly wealthy companies aren’t doing enough to stop them, and are not being held accountable. (Twitter and Facebook have attempted to crackdown on trolls in some ways since the election.) Curiously, Wall Street, which still remains oddly buoyant in the Trump era (it’s amazing what the rich will sacrifice for tax reform) is not chastising Silicon Valley for the extensive role it played in the mess we find ourselves in today. Facebook is worth $491 billion, despite months’ worth of news stories indicating it allowed Russian accounts to buy and target pages and ads on its network during the election, which estimates say could have reached 70 million Americans. Twitter’s stock, while bumpy, has barely moved since news definitively broke about all of the “fake Americans” that Russia created and operated on the social network during the election. (Here’s a fun game: go look at Donald Trump’s latest followers on Twitter and see how long it takes you to find a real human being who has recently joined and followed him. Most accounts have names like @N4wapWLVHmeYKAq and @Aiana37481266.)",www.vanityfair.com,left,ovvVMg4WrMwf9BAE

Facebook has been criticized in recent days , including by Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren , for its ad policy , which exempts politicians from third-party fact-checking and arguably facilitates the spread of disinformation .

When asked about the gatherings , a senior Trump administration official said “ the White House is looking for meaningful steps from Facebook on a number of fronts , ” including “ competition , free speech for everybody including conservatives , and privacy . ”
As part of the series , Zuckerberg met earlier this year with Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham , who insinuated that Facebook had become a monopoly during a congressional hearing last year ; Fox News host Tucker Carlson , who has fingered Zuckerberg as contributing to “ the death of free speech in America ” ; and conservative radio talk host Hugh Hewitt , who has cautioned against a DOJ enforcement action but has called for a “ new regulatory regime ” to minimize “ big tech bias ” against conservatives .
CNN commentator Mary Katharine Ham , conservative commentator Ben Shapiro , AEI fellow and former Washington Free Beacon editor Matt Continetti , Town Hall editor and Fox News contributor Guy Benson , and Media Research Center founder Brent Bozell have also attended the dinners , according to the person familiar with the gatherings . Washington Examiner chief political correspondent and Fox News contributor Byron York also confirmed his attendance but declined to disclose the contents of the dinner because there was a prior agreement that it was off-the-record .
A spokesman for Graham confirmed that the South Carolina senator has spoken with Zuckerberg . Carlson , Continetti , Benson , Bozell and Hewitt declined to comment . Ham and Shapiro did not respond to requests for comment . A spokesperson for Facebook , noting Zuckerberg 's recent meetings in Washington with Democrats , said in a statement , “ For years , Mark Zuckerberg has met with elected officials and thought leaders all across the political spectrum . ”
Each dinner has been hosted at one of Zuckerberg ’ s homes in California , and at least one lasted around two-and-a-half to three hours . The conversations center around “ free expression , unfair treatment of conservatives , the appeals process for real or perceived unfair treatment , fact checking , partnerships , and privacy , ” the source familiar with the meetings said .
`` My perception of him was more positive than I anticipated , ” this person added , referring to Zuckerberg . “ He was receptive and thoughtful . ”
“ I ’ ve always thought that he wanted to make things right by conservatives , ” said another person familiar with the dinners . “ I think he ’ s been genuine in hoping that might happen . Sometimes I think the headwinds are so strong in Palo Alto that I don ’ t think even he can succeed . ”
Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has engaged in similar outreach to conservatives in an attempt to gain their trust , and hosted a private dinner in Washington , D.C. with GOP political operatives and commentators in July 2018 , according to the Washington Post .
Facebook changed its policies following Russia ’ s election interference in 2016 in an attempt to halt the spread of false news and foreign-bought ads . But the company has also been working to minimize and correct the appearance of bias in those policies ever since it was reported that the company ’ s employees may have suppressed stories from right-leaning publications and authors in its “ Trending Topics ” section .
As part of those efforts , the company launched a yearlong “ conservative bias audit ” in 2018 , which was conducted by former Sen. Jon Kyl and a team from his law firm Covington and Burling .
Kyl interviewed 133 conservative lawmakers and groups for the audit , which ended in August and resulted in changes to its advertising policies . It ’ s unclear whether the Zuckerberg dinners are another facet of that project .
Allegations that Facebook censors conservatives , however , have gone largely unsubstantiated—conservative publications including Fox , Breitbart , and Shapiro ’ s Daily Wire were among the top publishers on Facebook as of this past May , according to data from the social media tracking firm Newswhip .
Trump ’ s 2016 campaign also took advantage of Facebook ’ s offer to embed employees , who acted as political operatives and provided critical support to the campaign ’ s social media operations , according to a study released in November 2017 . ( Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign declined a similar offer . )
Facebook ’ s critics on the left have argued that the company is overcorrecting and trying to curry favor with the Trump administration as it faces increasing scrutiny over its sloppy privacy practices and potential monopoly in social media . “ Facebook made a grave mistake in allowing external political actors to direct an assessment of company policy and practices , ” Henry Fernandez , senior fellow at the Center for American Progress , said after the “ conservative bias ” audit was completed in August .
The ongoing talks between Zuckerberg and prominent conservatives have attracted the attention of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , which conducts oversight on issues related to telecommunications and consumer protection and is “ aware ” of allegations that conservatives “ are trying to work the refs ” ahead of 2020 , according to a person with knowledge of the matter .
The committee ’ s Democrats sent a previously unreported letter to Facebook in June , after a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went viral on the platform , asking what the company was doing to address “ the spreading of political disinformation by real accounts . ”
“ We are concerned that you and your company are not taking these occurrences seriously and are grossly unprepared for the 2020 election , ” they wrote . “ Specifically , we are concerned that there may be a potential conflict of interest between Facebook ’ s bottom line and immediately addressing political disinformation on your platform . ”
Facebook ’ s vice president of U.S. public policy , Kevin Martin , responded three weeks later in a letter , also obtained by ███ . In it , he said the company has been working with third-party fact checkers to “ remove fake accounts , disrupt the financial incentives behind propagating false and misleading information , ” and letting users know “ when they are reading or sharing information ( excluding satire and opinion ) that has been disputed or debunked . ”
“ Leading up to 2020 we know that combating misinformation is one of the most important things we can do , ” Martin wrote .
But the social media giant has come under fire recently for its ad policy , which considers politicians ’ claims—if made directly on their Facebook page , in an ad or on their website—to be “ direct speech and ineligible for our third-party fact checking program. ” In keeping with that policy , Facebook has allowed a Trump campaign ad making false claims about Joe Biden ’ s ties to Ukraine to remain on the platform .
Warren , who has proposed breaking up Facebook , Amazon , and other tech giants , tested the limits of that policy last week by releasing an ad making the deliberately false claim that Zuckerberg and Facebook had endorsed Trump ’ s re-election .
“ If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad , most networks will refuse to air it , ” said the Warren ad . “ But Facebook just cashes Trump ’ s checks . Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once . Now , they ’ re deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people . It ’ s time to hold Mark Zuckerberg accountable — add your name if you agree . ”
Facebook hit back on Saturday night , likening the company ’ s policies on candidate speech to that of the Federal Communications Commission .
“ The FCC doesn ’ t want broadcast companies censoring candidates ’ speech , ” the company tweeted . “ We agree it ’ s better to let voters—not companies—decide . ”
Zuckerberg held a closed-door meeting with half a dozen senators last month to discuss what Sen. Mark Warner ( D-Va. ) described at the time as an opportunity for lawmakers to air their concerns about Facebook ’ s role in American democracy directly with the company ’ s founder . On that same trip to Washington , Zuckerberg also met with Trump , Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House social media director Dan Scavino .
He is due in Washington next week to testify before the House Financial Services Committee , where he ’ s expected to discuss Facebook ’ s controversial cryptocurrency plans .
After this story was published , Zuckerberg posted on Facebook : `` There 's some press today discussing dinners I 've had with conservative politicians , media and thinkers .

The need for benign neglect

The more squared-away among us have been doing their Christmas shopping for a while. People like me are getting started.

It’s fashionable to dislike shopping. Men of course aren’t supposed to enjoy shopping, because shopping is a stereotypically female thing, and we men are weirdly delicate in the face of such threats. But many women say they dislike shopping, too: It’s a hassle, it’s stressful, and taking pleasure in the mere exercise of consumption strikes many as suggestive of shallowness. It’s a fine argument, but I don’t buy it.

Phone hacking 'all too common'

Analysis by Jane Wakefield, BBC News technology reporter

A hack such as this was ""horribly easy to do once the vulnerability involved had been discovered,"" says computer expert Prof Alan Woodward. The seemingly innocent video would have contained malware that surreptitiously installed itself on the targeted phone.

From there it would have been possible for the hacker to gain access to all the functions of the phone, from the GPS locator, to the camera, to the banking facilities and messaging apps.

Such access is made possible via bugs in the code and, last year, a security flaw in WhatsApp was revealed that would have allowed hackers to hide malicious code inside video files.

Phone hacking is, says Prof Woodward, all too common in certain countries that are keen to keep an eye on journalists, dissidents and other activists perceived to be a threat to their regimes. So-called stalkerware is available off the shelf to these governments.

But what about the involvement of the Saudi crown prince? Was it really him who installed the malware? It is unlikely that he set the phone up himself. So was his phone also being spied on? Or was he simply a vessel being used by the Saudi authorities?

The plot thickens.

technology,Reason,2,https://reason.com/blog/2017/12/05/no-the-fcc-isnt-overturning-net-neutrali,"No, the FCC Isn’t 'Overturning Net Neutrality'",2017-12-05,"""Andrea OSullivan"", Christian Britschgi, Josh Blackman, Xander Peters, Cosmo Wenman, Joe Setyon, Zuri Davis","The left is in a veritable state of hysteria as the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) moves to vote on Chairman Pai 's deregulatory `` Restoring Internet Freedom '' ( RIF ) order on Dec. 14 . It 's gotten so bad that incensed supporters of so-called `` net neutrality '' have taken to harassing commissioners ' children and even threatening to kill a congressman .
It 's a nasty state of affairs , and it 's one unfortunately driven by a lot of false rhetoric and outright fearmongering over how policy is actually changing . Telling people that a policy change will `` end the internet as we know it '' or `` kill the internet '' can agitate troubled people into doing crazy things .
In truth , the Obama administration-era `` Open Internet Order '' ( OIO ) that the FCC is overturning has little to with `` net neutrality '' at all . In fact , the OIO would still allow internet service providers ( ISPs ) to block content—to say nothing of the many non-ISP tech companies that can and do openly suppress access to content .
Furthermore , repealing the OIO does not mean that the principles of `` net neutrality '' will not be upheld , nor that ISPs will be `` unregulated . '' Rather , the RIF will rightly transfer oversight of ISPs to other regulatory bodies in an ex post fashion .
One of the biggest misconceptions of the OIO saga is that it achieved `` net neutrality . '' It did n't . While proponents like to spin a lot of rhetoric about `` treating all traffic equally , '' the actual implementation of the Obama administration 's regulations did nothing of the sort .
As my Mercatus Center colleague Brent Skorup has tirelessly pointed out , the OIO did not require all internet actors—ranging from ISPs to content platforms to domain name registrars and everything else—to be content-blind and treat all traffic the same . Rather , it erected an awkward permission-and-control regime within the FCC that only affected a small portion of internet technology companies .
Not even ISPs would be truly content-neutral under the OIO . Because of First Amendment concerns , the FCC could not legally prohibit ISPs from engaging in editorial curation . The U.S. Court of Appeals made this very clear in its 2016 decision upholding the OIO . ISPs that explicitly offer `` 'edited ' services '' to its customers would be virtually free from OIO obligations . It 's a huge loophole , and it massively undercuts any OIO proponent 's claims that they are supporting `` net neutrality . ''
But importantly , the OIO still allowed the vast majority of internet companies to filter and block away to their heart 's content . Indeed , one could argue that content aggregators and search engines , like Facebook and Google , have proven to be much more draconian in their censorship of controversial but legal content than the ISPs over which so many agonize . Consider the recent incident where Twitter decided to block the political speech of a pro-life American politician . Most people are far more worried that social media companies will block their content rather than Comcast or Verizon .
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai made this very point last week at an R Street Institute event on the repeal . Major edge service providers like Google , Facebook , Reddit , and Twitter have made their opposition to OIO deregulation loud and clear to their user base . Some have displayed automatic messages on their front pages , urging visitors to take action and encourage others to do the same . Yet at the same time , these services engage in kinds of content blocking that they say broadband providers could possibly do .
This hypocrisy is relevant for more than just ideological inconsistency . It 's about economic power . By encouraging harsh regulation of ISPs that effectively controls the rates that major tech companies can be charged for bandwidth , these companies are engaging in a kind of regulatory capture . ( It should be noted that there is some division within these firms : Google 's Eric Schmidt , for instance , famously discouraged the Obama administration from pursuing these regulations in 2014 . )
Not only is it unfair , it is absolutely disingenuous to the user bases that they have so inflamed with their rhetoric . These companies are not taking principled stands at all . They are trying to use the force of the state to improve their economic outlook . In Pai 's words , `` they might cloak their advocacy in the public interest , but the real interest of these Internet giants is in using the regulatory process to cement their dominance in the Internet economy . ''
The second biggest misconception about the OIO repeal is that consumers will simply be at the mercy of unscrupulous broadband service providers without recourse or protection . This has never been true , and will not be true under the RIF either .
OIO supporters imagine a world where ISPs slice and dice internet access into tiered packages , similar to cable subscriptions . This misleading image is a popular one : It shows a hypothetical broadband package where consumers are forced to pay $ 10 for a `` Hollywood '' package including YouTube and Hulu , and a $ 5 `` Playground '' offering access to Steam and World of Warcraft . Of course , no ISP has ever come close to proposing anything like this arrangement , but this scenario has curiously lodged itself as a chief anxiety of many `` net neutrality '' supporters .
Recently , this hypothetical fear metastasized into a seemingly real threat . None other than Tim Wu himself , the brains behind the concept of `` net neutrality , '' shared a scary story about the dystopian world of Portuguese broadband provision , where ISPs had seemingly started to act more like cable companies . An image shared by Silicon Valley congressman Ro Khanna seemed to confirm this worst-case-scenario , sharing an image of a breakdown of Portuguese telecom packages by category .
But there was a huge problem with this story , as an excellent post by Ben Thompson pointed out . That Portuguese telecom provider was not slicing and dicing the 'net for no ███ , but rather was an offer for an extra 10 GB of access to a collection of apps on top of the existing family data plan for €25 a month , or about $ 30 . There are examples from the U.S. , too . In 2010 , then-tiny MetroPCS began offering zero-rated , or discounted , access to YouTube content to be competitive . But net neutrality activists went berserk over this benefit to MetroPCS customers , putting this and similar services in legal jeopardy . Consumers like these kinds of plans because they can be cheaper than all-inclusive data packages while giving them access to the services that they really need .
These kinds of unhelpful hoaxes underscore the fears that `` net neutrality '' rhetoric has instilled into the public . Sometimes , as is the case with Portuguese example , an alleged `` violation '' is actually a valued ( and voluntary ! ) option for many consumers . But in general , people believe that the OIO repeal will usher in a world where ISPs can do whatever they want without having to answer to anyone . Of course , this was not true before the OIO was instituted in 2015 , and it will be even less true under the RIF .
The debate has never been over `` regulation '' vs. `` no regulation '' of ISPs . Rather , it 's a question of whether it is more appropriate for an oversight body to observe market activities and intervene when foul play is suspected , called `` ex post regulation , '' or whether a beefed-up precautionary regulator should preemptively prohibit new service innovations until private bodies can prove them to be in the public interest , known as `` ex ante regulation . ''
The latter approach obviously stems new innovation and investment considerably , and in fact a study from the Phoenix Center found that broadband investment was choked to the tune of some $ 30 billion each year due to the OIO . Furthermore , introducing a Soviet-style ex ante regulator into the mix creates opportunities for regulatory capture and corruption .
The RIF will actually provide a more robust regulatory framework that then one that proceeded the OIO . It will transfer oversight of ISPs to the Federal Trade Commission , which has decades of experience ensuring consumer protection , privacy , and security . It will return to transparency rules established by the FCC in 2010 , which would require broadband providers to disclose their network management practices , thereby cutting down on the potential for sneaky behavior . And most importantly , it would achieve these `` neutral network '' goals without erecting a Depression-era system of permission and control that is both costly and susceptible to corruption .
The OIO allowed content filtering anyway . The RIF is a far better way to promote a fair and innovative internet that does not bring the many costs of the OIO .
People who maintain that the sky will fall and the internet will forever change for the worse after the FCC votes to ratify the RIF later this month are either misinformed or unfortunately opportunistic . Moving oversight of ISPs from a permissioned ex ante regulatory regime to a permissionless ex post one not only makes plain sense , it is the kind of framework that allowed the internet to develop into the powerhouse of innovation that we enjoy today . The internet is important in our lives , and it is easy to see how people can get upset when they are told that a policy change will ruin it forever . But a brief examination of the facts shows no such threat , and in fact the RIF is what can actually preserve the internet that we all know and love .","The left is in a veritable state of hysteria as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) moves to vote on Chairman Pai's deregulatory ""Restoring Internet Freedom"" (RIF) order on Dec. 14.

In truth, the Obama administration-era ""Open Internet Order"" (OIO) that the FCC is overturning has little to with ""net neutrality"" at all. In fact, the OIO would still allow internet service providers (ISPs) to block content—to say nothing of the many non-ISP tech companies that can and do openly suppress access to content.

Furthermore, repealing the OIO does not mean that the principles of ""net neutrality"" will not be upheld, nor that ISPs will be ""unregulated."" Rather, the RIF will rightly transfer oversight of ISPs to other regulatory bodies in an ex post fashion.

The OIO allows all kinds of content filtering

One of the biggest misconceptions of the OIO saga is that it achieved ""net neutrality."" It didn't. While proponents like to spin a lot of rhetoric about ""treating all traffic equally,"" the actual implementation of the Obama administration's regulations did nothing of the sort.

As my Mercatus Center colleague Brent Skorup has tirelessly pointed out, the OIO did not require all internet actors—ranging from ISPs to content platforms to domain name registrars and everything else—to be content-blind and treat all traffic the same. Rather, it erected an awkward permission-and-control regime within the FCC that only affected a small portion of internet technology companies.

Not even ISPs would be truly content-neutral under the OIO. Because of First Amendment concerns, the FCC could not legally prohibit ISPs from engaging in editorial curation. The U.S. Court of Appeals made this very clear in its 2016 decision upholding the OIO. ISPs that explicitly offer ""'edited' services"" to its customers would be virtually free from OIO obligations. It's a huge loophole, and it massively undercuts any OIO proponent's claims that they are supporting ""net neutrality.""

But importantly, the OIO still allowed the vast majority of internet companies to filter and block away to their heart's content. Indeed, one could argue that content aggregators and search engines, like Facebook and Google, have proven to be much more draconian in their censorship of controversial but legal content than the ISPs over which so many agonize. Consider the recent incident where Twitter decided to block the political speech of a pro-life American politician. Most people are far more worried that social media companies will block their content rather than Comcast or Verizon.

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai made this very point last week at an R Street Institute event on the repeal. Major edge service providers like Google, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter have made their opposition to OIO deregulation loud and clear to their user base. Some have displayed automatic messages on their front pages, urging visitors to take action and encourage others to do the same. Yet at the same time, these services engage in kinds of content blocking that they say broadband providers could possibly do.

This hypocrisy is relevant for more than just ideological inconsistency. It's about economic power. By encouraging harsh regulation of ISPs that effectively controls the rates that major tech companies can be charged for bandwidth, these companies are engaging in a kind of regulatory capture. (It should be noted that there is some division within these firms: Google's Eric Schmidt, for instance, famously discouraged the Obama administration from pursuing these regulations in 2014.)

Not only is it unfair, it is absolutely disingenuous to the user bases that they have so inflamed with their rhetoric. These companies are not taking principled stands at all. They are trying to use the force of the state to improve their economic outlook. In Pai's words, ""they might cloak their advocacy in the public interest, but the real interest of these Internet giants is in using the regulatory process to cement their dominance in the Internet economy.""

Regulators will still go after bad actors

The second biggest misconception about the OIO repeal is that consumers will simply be at the mercy of unscrupulous broadband service providers without recourse or protection. This has never been true, and will not be true under the RIF either.

OIO supporters imagine a world where ISPs slice and dice internet access into tiered packages, similar to cable subscriptions. This misleading image is a popular one: It shows a hypothetical broadband package where consumers are forced to pay $10 for a ""Hollywood"" package including YouTube and Hulu, and a $5 ""Playground"" offering access to Steam and World of Warcraft. Of course, no ISP has ever come close to proposing anything like this arrangement, but this scenario has curiously lodged itself as a chief anxiety of many ""net neutrality"" supporters.

Recently, this hypothetical fear metastasized into a seemingly real threat. None other than Tim Wu himself, the brains behind the concept of ""net neutrality,"" shared a scary story about the dystopian world of Portuguese broadband provision, where ISPs had seemingly started to act more like cable companies. An image shared by Silicon Valley congressman Ro Khanna seemed to confirm this worst-case-scenario, sharing an image of a breakdown of Portuguese telecom packages by category.

But there was a huge problem with this story, as an excellent post by Ben Thompson pointed out. That Portuguese telecom provider was not slicing and dicing the 'net for no reason, but rather was an offer for an extra 10 GB of access to a collection of apps on top of the existing family data plan for €25 a month, or about $30. There are examples from the U.S., too. In 2010, then-tiny MetroPCS began offering zero-rated, or discounted, access to YouTube content to be competitive. But net neutrality activists went berserk over this benefit to MetroPCS customers, putting this and similar services in legal jeopardy. Consumers like these kinds of plans because they can be cheaper than all-inclusive data packages while giving them access to the services that they really need.

These kinds of unhelpful hoaxes underscore the fears that ""net neutrality"" rhetoric has instilled into the public. Sometimes, as is the case with Portuguese example, an alleged ""violation"" is actually a valued (and voluntary!) option for many consumers. But in general, people believe that the OIO repeal will usher in a world where ISPs can do whatever they want without having to answer to anyone. Of course, this was not true before the OIO was instituted in 2015, and it will be even less true under the RIF.

The debate has never been over ""regulation"" vs. ""no regulation"" of ISPs. Rather, it's a question of whether it is more appropriate for an oversight body to observe market activities and intervene when foul play is suspected, called ""ex post regulation,"" or whether a beefed-up precautionary regulator should preemptively prohibit new service innovations until private bodies can prove them to be in the public interest, known as ""ex ante regulation.""

The latter approach obviously stems new innovation and investment considerably, and in fact a study from the Phoenix Center found that broadband investment was choked to the tune of some $30 billion each year due to the OIO. Furthermore, introducing a Soviet-style ex ante regulator into the mix creates opportunities for regulatory capture and corruption.

The RIF will actually provide a more robust regulatory framework that then one that proceeded the OIO. It will transfer oversight of ISPs to the Federal Trade Commission, which has decades of experience ensuring consumer protection, privacy, and security. It will return to transparency rules established by the FCC in 2010, which would require broadband providers to disclose their network management practices, thereby cutting down on the potential for sneaky behavior. And most importantly, it would achieve these ""neutral network"" goals without erecting a Depression-era system of permission and control that is both costly and susceptible to corruption.

The OIO allowed content filtering anyway. The RIF is a far better way to promote a fair and innovative internet that does not bring the many costs of the OIO.

Keep calm and binge on

People who maintain that the sky will fall and the internet will forever change for the worse after the FCC votes to ratify the RIF later this month are either misinformed or unfortunately opportunistic. Moving oversight of ISPs from a permissioned ex ante regulatory regime to a permissionless ex post one not only makes plain sense, it is the kind of framework that allowed the internet to develop into the powerhouse of innovation that we enjoy today. The internet is important in our lives, and it is easy to see how people can get upset when they are told that a policy change will ruin it forever. But a brief examination of the facts shows no such threat, and in fact the RIF is what can actually preserve the internet that we all know and love.",www.reason.com,right,5pCmAglvwMk6B48n

Mobile payments are having a heyday. Apple Pay has been splashed across the news and 20-somethings are paying for taxis with their smartphones. Yet one stalwart risks being left out of the conversation: PayPal.

The key to mobile payments is ease of use -- wave a smartphone or tap a button to transfer funds. No need to hit the ATM for cash or write a check and wait for it to be deposited. The less the customer has to think about it, the better, which is why companies like Stripe Inc., and potentially Apple Inc.’s new technology to pay with the swipe of a smartphone, are taking off.

That’s part of the reason PayPal is getting spun off from EBay Inc., giving the business more flexibility to innovate and become the method of choice to replace your wallet. Once known as the ground-breaking startup founded by the likes of Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Max Levchin before it was purchased by EBay in 2002, PayPal is now facing new competitors from Square Inc. to Apple Pay, which will be introduced in the U.S. this month.

“If you’re below 30, PayPal’s not relevant,” Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos., said in an interview. “With consumer awareness, Apple is out there overnight. That’s a piece PayPal is desperately struggling with.”

A key ingredient will be changing the perception among younger, smartphone-tethered customers like Arielle Gurin, a 22-year-old student at the University of Maryland, who says PayPal is “outdated already.”

“I know you have to have it for like EBay, or you can use it for Amazon,” she said. “But I feel like it’s not big anymore.”

Mobile Attempts

While the Web-payments pioneer has more than 152 million active registered accounts, the de facto focus for payments has become the smartphone, a market that PayPal had already tried to break into without much success. The company had the Beacon check-out device for retailers and restaurants that triggered a customer’s PayPal app on their phone, but people just weren’t using it -- so much so that former CEO David Marcus had said that 2014 was the year for campaigning to lure consumers.

About a quarter of PayPal’s active users in the U.S. are 18 to 35 years old, said Chris Morse, a spokesman for the company. That’s more than researcher Forrester’s estimate that 18 percent of online adults fall in that age range, Morse said.

The payment company had tried to get concert-goers to download its app to pay for food -- an attempt thwarted by weak network connections.

Market Growth

In-store payments via smartphone is a revenue opportunity worth fighting for, even if that means reversing course after vowing earlier this year to keep EBay and PayPal together. The mobile payments market is potentially huge, with EMarketer projecting it to total $118 billion in the U.S. by 2018, up from $3.5 billion this year.

While PayPal may be a go-to for secure e-commerce transactions online, Davis Meiering, an undergraduate student at the NYU Stern School of Business, said it’s not what he turns to on his phone, whether it’s for payments between friends or in stores.

“I don’t use the PayPal app on my phone,” Meiering, 20, said. “I only ever use it online.”

Marcus, who had helped turn around PayPal by boosting active accounts more than 30 percent to almost 150 million during his tenure, left in June for Facebook Inc. It was an exit that EBay CEO John Donahoe called “unexpected.” Dan Schulman, an executive from American Express Co., is joining PayPal and will take over as CEO after the split.

Now, the separation of the companies next year may help PayPal keep up with the pace of innovation and competitiveness in the mobile payments industry, EBay said in a statement.

“As an independent company, its strategic flexibility and opportunity to capitalize on this opportunity has never been higher,” Donahoe said on a conference call this week. “PayPal is uniquely positioned as this landscape really begins to emerge in interesting ways.”

An independent PayPal would have more latitude to forge alliances with retailers and other financial firms as Google Inc. and Apple seek to turn their products -- Google Wallet and Apple Pay -- into tools for digital payments.

Square Inc., started by Twitter Inc. co-founder Jack Dorsey, has made headway in signing up many small merchants to use the company’s card reader and a smartphone or tablet to process payments.

‘Tough Road’

“To stay relevant over the next five years, they have a tough road ahead of them,” Munster said of PayPal.

Apple accelerated its move into mobile payments with partnerships -- aligning with financial companies like Citigroup Inc. and American Express, as well as merchants such as McDonald’s Corp. and Whole Foods Market Inc. Instead of working with PayPal on the development of its payments system, Apple struck a deal with Stripe. To make a payment, a person swipes an iPhone at the checkout counter and confirms the transaction by using the fingerprint scanner on their iPhone.

The advantage it has over PayPal is that the payments system is integrated directly into the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The Cupertino, California-based tech giant already sold 10 million of the new devices in their debut weekend alone.

Some analysts, including Donald Fandetti at Citigroup, expect merchants to be eager to sign up. That would hand Apple Pay an immediate advantage in an area where PayPal has struggled to gain traction -- with in-store purchases.

Apple’s Advantage

“Competitors will be forced to counter Apple’s smart phone advantage,” Fandetti wrote in a Sept. 23 note. “We see good merchant and consumer adoption over time.”

One thing becoming an independent company could help is other businesses’ willingness to work with PayPal, Praveen Menon and Paul Sweeney, analysts with Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a note this week.

“PayPal’s ownership by EBay may have made other e-commerce merchants or technology companies reluctant to work closely with the unit, as evidenced by recent announcements by Apple and Twitter to partner with upstart payment rival Stripe,” they wrote.

Another place PayPal could turn to for inspiration is in-house. Venmo, a peer-to-peer payments startup, was added to the fold when EBay bought Venmo’s parent company, Braintree Payment Solutions LLC, last year. Venmo has inundated millennials’ smartphones, letting users download a mobile-payment app that can connect to bank and credit-card accounts, enabling them to pass funds between friends with just a few clicks on their phone.

Venmo Inspiration

Gurin, the student in Maryland, says she tries to persuade everyone she knows to use Venmo because of its convenience for passing money between friends, say for a shared restaurant bill. When it comes to checking out at a store, Gurin says it’s hard to top the convenience of her credit card.

There was a recession messing badly with the tech sector at the time , which we dubbed the Econalypse . But we decided to make a loud prediction right before our seventh All Things Digital conference anyway , because we saw that the digital tidal wave sweeping the world just wasn ’ t stopping .
[ W ] hat ’ s the seminal development that ’ s ushering in the era of Web 3.0 ? It ’ s the real arrival , after years of false predictions , of the thin client , running clean , simple software , against cloud-based data and services . The poster children for this new era have been the Apple iPhone and iPod Touch , which have sold 37 million units in less than two years and attracted 35,000 apps and one billion app downloads in just nine months . The excitement and energy around the iPhone and the Touch — and the software and services being written for them — remind us of the formative years of the PC and PC software , in the early 1980s , or the early days of the Web in the mid-1990s . It ’ s a big deal . But this is not just about one company , one platform or even one form factor . No , this new phenomenon is about handheld computers from many companies , with software platforms and distribution mechanisms tightly tied to cloud-based services , whether they are multi-player games , e-commerce offerings or corporate databases . Some of these handheld computers will make phone calls , but others won ’ t . Some will fit in a pocket , but others will be tablets or even laptop-type clamshells . But , like the iPhone , all will be fusions of clever new hardware , innovative client software and powerful server-based components .
Pretty prescient , right ? Smartphones and the app universe — spawned by the Apple iPhone release in June 2007 — bore a new era of innovation , heralding in a spate of companies dependent on mobile . It was , as I have written before , a Cambrian explosion . Would there be Uber , Lyft , Tinder , and so many others without the mobile phone ? Would companies like Facebook , Twitter , and Slack have grown so large in its absence ?
Now , I must declare that revolution officially over . After a very long run , Web 3.0 is on its last legs and needs to get out of the way for what ’ s next .
And what ’ s that ? Well , as it turns out , a lot of things that include tech , politics , social mores , and more that have gained traction over the past few years and that are mashing together in ways that are still sorting themselves out .
That ’ s why I did a PowerPoint — and trust me when I tell you , I hate PowerPoints — to try to get my own head around it . I edit it almost constantly , as new ideas pop into my head , and am always trying to make new connections between and among the key trends .
Let ’ s start with the title that I first put on it : “ It ’ s not just Amazon ( well , you need to be scared of them too ) . ” Sure , it could be catchier , but it ’ s that for a good reason . Over the past few years , there has been a big focus on individual companies — especially Amazon , Facebook , and Google — rather than the overall trends they represent around the toxic impacts of tech . While each has grown into a powerful and sometimes troublesome entity , the changes that are happening now across tech are much bigger than any one company . We ’ re talking about pervasive ecosystem changes .
That ’ s because tech companies come and go , even the titans , and the natural instinct is to name the company rather than see the bigger ideas that their actions are shaping — and that are shaping them .
Let ’ s start with the most important trend : artificial intelligence . The others include robotics and automation ; self-driving ; endless choice ; privacy under assault , when data is gold ; continuous partial hacking ; continuous partial attention ; and political and social unrest .
Starting with AI , there ’ s a line that I think pretty much encapsulates the one thing you absolutely need to know about the future of machine learning that I have used again and again : Everything that can be digitized will be digitized .
What do I mean by that ? Computing as we know it is being changed by AI and machine learning . It is already everywhere — from when you talk to Apple ’ s Siri or Amazon ’ s Alexa or see your list of movies on Netflix or interact with a chatbot . Its use , both generally and for highly specific things , has and will continue to impact innumerable fields , resulting in massive job disruption .
Economists and consulting firms have long predicted that AI will change workplaces and the workforce , but I think they ’ ve been underselling it . For example , when a Google deep learning program can quickly study a super-complex multiplayer strategy game and then kick the crap out of the best human players on the planet , perhaps we should think hard about where it will go next .
Whether it kills jobs or adds them , a matter of much debate , it will lead to things like multi-careers , more gig-oriented work , and a need for reeducation .
On the downside , which jobs will be impacted ? It ’ s not just factory workers , burger flippers , and long-haul truckers . Highly paid lawyers , skilled doctors ( don ’ t let your daughter be a radiologist ) , and , yes , even lowly journalists will need to find new lines of work . And those tectonic workplace realignments will only become more profound as the AI becomes inevitably — and exponentially — better .
To thrive in this environment will require being in a profession that is creative , where analog interactions are critical — one that can not be easily made digital . Think art , think the caring professions , think anything in which being human trumps cyborg . And since AI becomes ever smarter , it will make sense to allow it to do more and more as we become ever less so .
It is a path humanity is already on , of course : When was the last time you ever read a map rather than got directions from Google ? Or cracked a book to find an errant fact ? It ’ ll be like that for so many things we do , as normal practices change to reflect and take advantage of the convenience and precision of AI .
We ’ ll also soon see the effects of radical advances in robotics and automation , which will probably be more behind the scenes than having a robot maid in our home ( though we will get to that ) . Yes , the way we wage war is changing dramatically , but it ’ s not the killer robots we think of when we envision a world in which the Terminator movies become a reality . As Elon Musk told Walt and me in an interview several years ago , these AI-powered robots and platforms will think of us more like house cats than enemies . So I guess that ’ s a plus .
If advances in sentience and responsiveness are as dramatic as I think they might be , the implications will be even more interesting — and problematic . Will we someday have to contemplate their rights ? It ’ s been a constant in science fiction , but now we seem to be really on the doorstep of rethinking what it means to be human in an era when biotechnology — whether implanting chips that could enhance intelligence , altering genetic code to eliminate disease , or wearing exoskeletons that enhance human strength — is on the cutting edge .
Currently , companies like the FDA-approved ReWalk are focused on using these devices to allow those with spinal cord injuries to walk again , but there are many military and factory experiments ongoing . These “ exo suits ” and other mechanized clothing are only the vanguard of a body-enhancing movement that is likely to get even larger in the coming decades . Where this innovation emerges is also a consideration , since tech ’ s increasingly dominant player — China — is making strong moves in the sector .
The next trend will be around transportation , especially the use of cars and trucks . I recently called them the “ horses of tomorrow ” in a New York Times column , noting that I would never buy and likely never own another car as long as I live .
While many reacted to the piece by proclaiming that Americans will never give up car ownership , especially in rural areas , I am confident that a combination of ride-sharing , autonomous vehicles , and breakthroughs in other modes of transport will lead to profound changes that will impact the entire ecosystem and economy , especially as much of the human race lives near major metropolitan areas . We will need to build smarter cities as this shift happens .
While regulatory and technical issues are still complex , such obstacles are most certainly not impossible as we rethink our relationship with the entire transportation system and are forced to make changes as the planet becomes more congested and more impacted by climate change . To me , the change in this sector will have reverberations far beyond any others , despite what will seem like a slow rollout .
What is moving a lot faster is the concept of everything-on-demand , from instant delivery of goods to the perfect anticipation of needs thanks to AI-enhanced computing . That ’ s already here in many ways , seen most clearly by the leaps of services like Amazon Prime . Again , here the impact is massive , fundamentally changing the way we shop and consume . Hunting and gathering is dead : Large-footprint stores will be gone , to be replaced by those that can differentiate themselves from the commodity-based goods . I ’ d bet in a decade your favorite little boutique will be there long after a giant Target will be .
( Of course , all this does not mean there will not be a backlash over these changes , since they increase consumerism and emissions and , you know , your box pile at home . )
This will be true across all sectors , including media . The old and failed concept of push — in which information was thrown at you , clogging the early internet ’ s pipes — will return . In that paradigm , you will not pick but be picked for ; you will not seek , but it will be found . This is already happening , but it will intensify . Obviously , this has great societal implications , and we are already seeing the downside of screen addiction that is bringing social unrest , depression , and a kind of ennui about human interaction .
That trend has been and will be fueled by the end of any true semblance of privacy , a process that is already well on its way . I do not mean to belabor an issue that has gotten a lot of attention already , except to repeat what former Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy said two decades ago : “ You have zero privacy anyway . Get over it. ” Yep . You and your data have been the fuel of the internet age , and that will not abate .
Can regulation save us ? There has been some pushback to this grim state of affairs , especially in Europe with its General Data Protection Rules — but also in Silicon Valley ’ s backyard , with California ’ s Consumer Privacy Act set to go into effect next year . But there is no national privacy bill in the US — and don ’ t get your hopes up , either , Bernie Bros . Meanwhile , countries like China push the envelope further by building what are essentially surveillance economies using facial recognition and intense monitoring of its citizens ’ every move and keystroke .
That , of course , leaves us deeply vulnerable to even more hacking as we are jacked into the system in ways that were heretofore impossible . And this hacking will not be hard to pull off — just ask any systems engineer or coder — as an increasingly interconnected Internet of Things brings porous platforms into our kitchens , cars , and wallets . The system was built for access and connectivity ; malevolent players can simply use the tools on offer . In this fight , companies like Facebook are now battling nation-states , even if they themselves have become the digital equivalent of that .
The will to win this fight — even define its terms — has been weak on the consumer side , but incursions in the 2016 election have shown us the real goal of some of these hackers : to disrupt our society and create discord . The Russians lost the Cold War , but they have proven to be quite a bit better at the Cyber War . Increasingly , as even more nefarious players ramp up , that could mean more attacks on basic infrastructure , from electric grids to phone systems . And as our devices are ever more connected , battling it will be like pushing back the ocean .
Ten years ago , when Walt and I wrote our Web 3.0 missive , the iPhone was just a couple of years old , a novelty for rich people that barely could make a call . Think how quaint that all sounds now . But that one device unleashed a never-ending revolution of change , each cycle accelerating faster than the last . These technologies have unmoored people from their communities and removed once-sacred societal strictures . This is the first time that humanity has been allowed to talk to each other without gatekeepers or any other mechanisms of control .
It is not going well . And we now are surprised when we realize , for example , how so many have been radicalized by videos on YouTube or 8chan message boards . But with new and more immersive technologies just around the corner , you haven ’ t seen anything yet .
If it appears as if the forces of evil are winning here , it is because they are .
That might seem dire . Well , it is . While it is critical that we now put in some guardrails to make these profound developments less unsettling , having not done so at the start — the original sin of pushing growth over everything else — presents humanity with a massive challenge . If change is the constant , ever morphing as we move to control it , how can we manage what we have invented ?
There ’ s only one way as far as I can tell . Long ago , Steve Jobs launched a marketing campaign that urged people to “ Think Different. ” That has never been more true , except I would adjust it slightly . To face the modern age — and the future we have created but don ’ t yet understand — we not only have to think different as all these new technologies roll out ever more quickly . We have to be different .
If that is a cliffhanger , so be it , because a cliff is exactly where we are .

There was a recession messing badly with the tech sector at the time, which we dubbed the Econalypse. But we decided to make a loud prediction right before our seventh All Things Digital conference anyway, because we saw that the digital tidal wave sweeping the world just wasn’t stopping.

And we said so:

But, like the iPhone, all will be fusions of clever new hardware, innovative client software and powerful server-based components.

Pretty prescient, right? Smartphones and the app universe — spawned by the Apple iPhone release in June 2007 — bore a new era of innovation, heralding in a spate of companies dependent on mobile. It was, as I have written before, a Cambrian explosion. Would there be Uber, Lyft, Tinder, and so many others without the mobile phone? Would companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Slack have grown so large in its absence?

Now, I must declare that revolution officially over. After a very long run, Web 3.0 is on its last legs and needs to get out of the way for what’s next.

And what’s that? Well, as it turns out, a lot of things that include tech, politics, social mores, and more that have gained traction over the past few years and that are mashing together in ways that are still sorting themselves out.

That’s why I did a PowerPoint — and trust me when I tell you, I hate PowerPoints — to try to get my own head around it. I edit it almost constantly, as new ideas pop into my head, and am always trying to make new connections between and among the key trends.

Let’s start with the title that I first put on it: “It’s not just Amazon (well, you need to be scared of them too).” Sure, it could be catchier, but it’s that for a good reason. Over the past few years, there has been a big focus on individual companies — especially Amazon, Facebook, and Google — rather than the overall trends they represent around the toxic impacts of tech.

We’re talking about pervasive ecosystem changes.

That’s because tech companies come and go, even the titans, and the natural instinct is to name the company rather than see the bigger ideas that their actions are shaping — and that are shaping them.

Let’s start with the most important trend: artificial intelligence. The others include robotics and automation; self-driving; endless choice; privacy under assault, when data is gold; continuous partial hacking; continuous partial attention; and political and social unrest.

Starting with AI, there’s a line that I think pretty much encapsulates the one thing you absolutely need to know about the future of machine learning that I have used again and again: Everything that can be digitized will be digitized.

Full stop.

What do I mean by that? Computing as we know it is being changed by AI and machine learning. It is already everywhere — from when you talk to Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa or see your list of movies on Netflix or interact with a chatbot. Its use, both generally and for highly specific things, has and will continue to impact innumerable fields, resulting in massive job disruption.

Economists and consulting firms have long predicted that AI will change workplaces and the workforce, but I think they’ve been underselling it. For example, when a Google deep learning program can quickly study a super-complex multiplayer strategy game and then kick the crap out of the best human players on the planet, perhaps we should think hard about where it will go next.

Highly paid lawyers, skilled doctors (don’t let your daughter be a radiologist), and, yes, even lowly journalists will need to find new lines of work. And those tectonic workplace realignments will only become more profound as the AI becomes inevitably — and exponentially — better.

To thrive in this environment will require being in a profession that is creative, where analog interactions are critical — one that cannot be easily made digital. Think art, think the caring professions, think anything in which being human trumps cyborg. And since AI becomes ever smarter, it will make sense to allow it to do more and more as we become ever less so.

It is a path humanity is already on, of course: When was the last time you ever read a map rather than got directions from Google? Or cracked a book to find an errant fact? It’ll be like that for so many things we do, as normal practices change to reflect and take advantage of the convenience and precision of AI.

We’ll also soon see the effects of radical advances in robotics and automation, which will probably be more behind the scenes than having a robot maid in our home (though we will get to that). Yes, the way we wage war is changing dramatically, but it’s not the killer robots we think of when we envision a world in which the Terminator movies become a reality.

Will we someday have to contemplate their rights? It’s been a constant in science fiction, but now we seem to be really on the doorstep of rethinking what it means to be human in an era when biotechnology — whether implanting chips that could enhance intelligence, altering genetic code to eliminate disease, or wearing exoskeletons that enhance human strength — is on the cutting edge.

Currently, companies like the FDA-approved ReWalk are focused on using these devices to allow those with spinal cord injuries to walk again, but there are many military and factory experiments ongoing. These “exo suits” and other mechanized clothing are only the vanguard of a body-enhancing movement that is likely to get even larger in the coming decades. Where this innovation emerges is also a consideration, since tech’s increasingly dominant player — China — is making strong moves in the sector.

The next trend will be around transportation, especially the use of cars and trucks. I recently called them the “horses of tomorrow” in a New York Times column, noting that I would never buy and likely never own another car as long as I live.

While many reacted to the piece by proclaiming that Americans will never give up car ownership, especially in rural areas, I am confident that a combination of ride-sharing, autonomous vehicles, and breakthroughs in other modes of transport will lead to profound changes that will impact the entire ecosystem and economy, especially as much of the human race lives near major metropolitan areas. We will need to build smarter cities as this shift happens.

While regulatory and technical issues are still complex, such obstacles are most certainly not impossible as we rethink our relationship with the entire transportation system and are forced to make changes as the planet becomes more congested and more impacted by climate change. To me, the change in this sector will have reverberations far beyond any others, despite what will seem like a slow rollout.

What is moving a lot faster is the concept of everything-on-demand, from instant delivery of goods to the perfect anticipation of needs thanks to AI-enhanced computing. That’s already here in many ways, seen most clearly by the leaps of services like Amazon Prime. Again, here the impact is massive, fundamentally changing the way we shop and consume. Hunting and gathering is dead: Large-footprint stores will be gone, to be replaced by those that can differentiate themselves from the commodity-based goods. I’d bet in a decade your favorite little boutique will be there long after a giant Target will be.

(Of course, all this does not mean there will not be a backlash over these changes, since they increase consumerism and emissions and, you know, your box pile at home.)

This will be true across all sectors, including media. The old and failed concept of push — in which information was thrown at you, clogging the early internet’s pipes — will return. In that paradigm, you will not pick but be picked for; you will not seek, but it will be found. This is already happening, but it will intensify. Obviously, this has great societal implications, and we are already seeing the downside of screen addiction that is bringing social unrest, depression, and a kind of ennui about human interaction.

That trend has been and will be fueled by the end of any true semblance of privacy, a process that is already well on its way. I do not mean to belabor an issue that has gotten a lot of attention already, except to repeat what former Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy said two decades ago: “You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it.” Yep. You and your data have been the fuel of the internet age, and that will not abate.

Can regulation save us? There has been some pushback to this grim state of affairs, especially in Europe with its General Data Protection Rules — but also in Silicon Valley’s backyard, with California’s Consumer Privacy Act set to go into effect next year. But there is no national privacy bill in the US — and don’t get your hopes up, either, Bernie Bros. Meanwhile, countries like China push the envelope further by building what are essentially surveillance economies using facial recognition and intense monitoring of its citizens’ every move and keystroke.

That, of course, leaves us deeply vulnerable to even more hacking as we are jacked into the system in ways that were heretofore impossible. And this hacking will not be hard to pull off — just ask any systems engineer or coder — as an increasingly interconnected Internet of Things brings porous platforms into our kitchens, cars, and wallets. The system was built for access and connectivity; malevolent players can simply use the tools on offer. In this fight, companies like Facebook are now battling nation-states, even if they themselves have become the digital equivalent of that.

The will to win this fight — even define its terms — has been weak on the consumer side, but incursions in the 2016 election have shown us the real goal of some of these hackers: to disrupt our society and create discord. The Russians lost the Cold War, but they have proven to be quite a bit better at the Cyber War. Increasingly, as even more nefarious players ramp up, that could mean more attacks on basic infrastructure, from electric grids to phone systems. And as our devices are ever more connected, battling it will be like pushing back the ocean.

Ten years ago, when Walt and I wrote our Web 3.0 missive, the iPhone was just a couple of years old, a novelty for rich people that barely could make a call. Think how quaint that all sounds now. But that one device unleashed a never-ending revolution of change, each cycle accelerating faster than the last. These technologies have unmoored people from their communities and removed once-sacred societal strictures. This is the first time that humanity has been allowed to talk to each other without gatekeepers or any other mechanisms of control.

It is not going well. And we now are surprised when we realize, for example, how so many have been radicalized by videos on YouTube or 8chan message boards. But with new and more immersive technologies just around the corner, you haven’t seen anything yet.

If it appears as if the forces of evil are winning here, it is because they are.

That might seem dire. Well, it is. While it is critical that we now put in some guardrails to make these profound developments less unsettling, having not done so at the start — the original sin of pushing growth over everything else — presents humanity with a massive challenge. If change is the constant, ever morphing as we move to control it, how can we manage what we have invented?

There’s only one way as far as I can tell. Long ago, Steve Jobs launched a marketing campaign that urged people to “Think Different.” That has never been more true, except I would adjust it slightly. To face the modern age — and the future we have created but don’t yet understand — we not only have to think different as all these new technologies roll out ever more quickly. We have to be different.

If that is a cliffhanger, so be it, because a cliff is exactly where we are.

It turned out to be impossible.

House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer’s office talked up his new iPhone app — Whipwatch — which blasts out push-notice alerts when there’s about to be a floor vote. It’s a nice improvement on an outdated system but is really just a mobile app.

Rep. Suzan DelBene, the co-chair of the Internet of Things Caucus, wears a Microsoft Band on her wrist and had recently shown me how she pays for her coffee with a Starbucks app. Surely she’s using it in the Capitol? Um, no, her staff replied. Sen. Harry Reid’s office uses fancy Evoko tablets that let staffers pre-schedule conference rooms via their computer or phone, but it’s an internal system that no one else has access to.

Did someone say ""Smart Cheetos""? There are indeed networked vending machines in service all around Washington, notifying drivers which ones need to be restocked, but not here: Jim Gousha, a machine repairman fixing a fan on a Pepsi machine in the basement of the Russell Senate Office Building, told me his company doesn’t have any deployed in the Capitol.

Then I discovered there’s a reason I was striking out. Stephen Ayers, the architect of the Capitol, wrote via email that Congress has plenty of advanced technology — smart lighting that senses the level of daylight; carbon monoxide sensors that know when the garages need fresh air.

But, he wrote, “None of it is connected to the Internet.”

It turns out that Congress has a deliberate “air gap” between its own networks and the Internet that the rest of us use. (Lawmakers and their staff can still browse the Web from their computers, through a firewall. It's buildings' high-tech internal systems that don't connect at all.) “From my perspective,” Ayers said, “the Internet of Things is currently focused on the homeowner or personal market, and has yet to display the necessary security features for widespread commercial use.”

In other words, no matter how much some members of Congress want to cheerlead the adoption of the IOT, the people who protect Congress don’t quite trust the technology enough to use it.

It’s tempting to see this as kind of a metaphor for Capitol Hill — a cluster of buildings disconnected from the rest of America in the most literal way possible. But Congress’ air gap isn’t unique: Others also exist around nuclear power plants, classified military networks and other systems where a break-in could be catastrophic.

And in a way, it’s kind of reassuring: If anyone maliciously hacks in and scrambles the Senate meeting room schedule, they’ll know it’s probably an inside job.

Today ’ s hack appears to be from the same group that attacked a number of YouTube celebrities last week on Twitter , including beauty vlogger James Charles , Shane Dawson , and comedian King Bach . The hackers also allegedly gained access to the late Desmond “ Etika ” Amofah ’ s Gmail account , as seen by screenshots collected in their Discord server . At the time , many of the people who ’ d been affected suggested their accounts were breached following a SIM card swap conducted by AT & T employees .
“ We are working with law enforcement , have restored the customers ’ service , and discussed ways to secure the account , ” an AT & T spokesperson told ███ after the previous Chuckle Squad attacks . AT & T has not responded to a request for comment today .
Other attacks that occurred on Twitter also resemble Chuckle Squad ’ s tactics . Riverdale ’ s Cole Sprouse also blamed a hack on his Twitter account on his “ cell service provider. ” It ’ s not clear if that was the same group .
In addition to some ugly tweets , today ’ s hackers plugged a Discord server , asking people to join it . ( The server invitation link tweeted out by the hackers no longer works . ) “ Both the server and the server owner were permanently removed from Discord within minutes of this being reported to us , ” a Discord representative told ███ .
“ Encouraging any kind of hacking is in direct violation of our Terms of Service , ” the representative said . “ We will continue to monitor and investigate this incident . ”
Dorsey ’ s account has been hacked before . In 2016 , the security firm OurMine hacked @ Jack to send out a message about “ testing your security. ” The tweet also had a video and a link to OurMine ’ s website . ( OurMine also hacked other CEOs , such as Facebook ’ s Mark Zuckerberg and Google ’ s Sundar Pichai . )
███ has reached out to Twitter for more information about the specifics of the attack , and it will update if more information becomes available .

The tweets appear to have come via Cloudhopper, a company that Twitter previously acquired to help with its SMS service. If you text 404-04 from the phone number linked to your Twitter account, that text will post to Twitter. The source in the tweet will be given as “Cloudhopper.”

Today’s hack appears to be from the same group that attacked a number of YouTube celebrities last week on Twitter, including beauty vlogger James Charles, Shane Dawson, and comedian King Bach. The hackers also allegedly gained access to the late Desmond “Etika” Amofah’s Gmail account, as seen by screenshots collected in their Discord server. At the time, many of the people who’d been affected suggested their accounts were breached following a SIM card swap conducted by AT&T employees.

“We are working with law enforcement, have restored the customers’ service, and discussed ways to secure the account,” an AT&T spokesperson told The Verge after the previous Chuckle Squad attacks. AT&T has not responded to a request for comment today.

Other attacks that occurred on Twitter also resemble Chuckle Squad’s tactics. Riverdale’s Cole Sprouse also blamed a hack on his Twitter account on his “cell service provider.” It’s not clear if that was the same group.

In addition to some ugly tweets, today’s hackers plugged a Discord server, asking people to join it. (The server invitation link tweeted out by the hackers no longer works.) “Both the server and the server owner were permanently removed from Discord within minutes of this being reported to us,” a Discord representative told The Verge.

“Encouraging any kind of hacking is in direct violation of our Terms of Service,” the representative said. “We will continue to monitor and investigate this incident.”

Dorsey’s account has been hacked before. In 2016, the security firm OurMine hacked @Jack to send out a message about “testing your security.” The tweet also had a video and a link to OurMine’s website. (OurMine also hacked other CEOs, such as Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s Sundar Pichai.)

The Verge has reached out to Twitter for more information about the specifics of the attack, and it will update if more information becomes available.

Update, 8:27PM ET: Added Twitter’s explanation that a cell carrier vulnerability allowed the hackers to send tweets via text message, and that’s how they were added to Dorsey’s account.",www.theverge.com,left,XW4LWGk288SwqDhM

But they’ll soon fade from our attention.

Sune Lehmann is a professor of applied mathematics and computer science at the Technical University of Denmark, where he’s been conducted research for the past several years. He, like a lot of us, was wondering, “Am I becoming a grumpy old man, or are things moving more quickly?”

Recently, he and colleagues published a paper in Nature Communications that suggests the latter is true — the length of time our “collective attention” is on any given event has grown shorter, and topics become popular and then drop out of public view at an accelerating rate. The result: It’s no surprise if it feels harder and harder to dwell deeply on any topic.

It’s hard to know from this research how our collective attention impacts our individual ability to pay attention. But it outlines a broader problem with media and entertainment, and our online environments. The amount of coverage a topic gets — or doesn’t get — influences the public’s perception of what’s important.

It might not matter that no one will be talking about the Avengers in a few weeks time. But it’s often frustrating how quickly the public moves on from talking about a mass shooting. For politicians, it’s strategic to just wait out a scandal, because “if you just wait a few days, people will have forgotten,” Lehmann says.

The problem is likely to grow worse, too, as media, entertainment, and advertising companies get better at knowing how to capture attention and target individual users. As competition grows more intense in the attention economy, our individual attention might get more frazzled than ever.

The news really is moving faster than ever before

A good place to start in studying the pace of collective attention is on Twitter. Twitter, for all its problems, is still the place to find out what people are paying attention to in real time. So Lehmann and his colleagues dove into its archives, analyzing an enormous number of tweets to see if our collective attention spans have become more frazzled.

They measured collective attention on Twitter by looking at how long individual hashtags stayed in the list of 50 most popular hashtags. In 2013, they remained, on average, for 17.5 hours.

Which is to say these topics aren’t getting more attention overall; they’re just flaring up and burning out quicker. Which means each trending topic receives less collective attention overall, despite the furious pace at which they become popular.

And it’s not just on Twitter. Lehmann and his colleagues looked elsewhere for evidence of a quickening pace of collective attention. They found it in Reddit threads — topics seem to gain popularity quicker than before.

A similar pattern is also found in our offline environments, namely in movie ticket sales. Blockbuster movies maybe be breaking ticket sale records, but they are popular for shorter periods of time.

“We define a ‘blockbuster event’ as a time when there is a very large [150 percent] increase of movie ticket sales for one movie from one week to the next,” Philipp Lorenz-Spreen, a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute and a co-author on the study, says. “In the ’80s, this happened on average every four months; now this can be observed every two weeks.”

“Nowadays, we have all these sophisticated systems to push ever more information to us, because there are big corporations making money off us looking at information,” Lehmann says.

With digital tools, companies keep getting better at knowing how to capture attention, targeting ads and content to particular users. We at Vox play this game too. We don’t track our individual readers — but we’re constantly wondering about, and experimenting with, topics and stories that will capture the greatest amount of attention.

All our competitors in the attention economy are getting better at knowing what grabs attention, too. The consequence, Lehmann says, “is there’s less time for depth, because there’s so much other attractive stuff out there, also vying for your attention.”

And while our attention becomes more scattered, it also might be becoming more uniform.

Eventually, people move on from Avengers and the cycle starts over again, with a new trending topic.

What does this mean for individuals?

Collective attention isn’t the same as individual attention. More work needs to be done to explain how the collective attention cycle affects an individual’s mind.

But many scientists are concerned about a growing “national attention deficit.” “Our attention is being captured by devices rather than being voluntarily regulated,” Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin Madison, told Vox late last year. “We are like a sailor without a rudder on the ocean — pushed and pulled by the digital stimuli to which we are exposed rather than by the intentional direction of our own mind.”

We can’t control what irrationally annoys us any more than we can control our taste in food or music — it’s the result of a thousand invisible factors working in complicated ways. In my case, for the last couple months, I’ve been weirdly, unfortunately fixated on the dumb, bad-faith, please-jam-sporks-into-my-eyes-right-now arguments between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton supporters playing out on my Facebook feed and, to an even greater extent, on Twitter.

What makes me desperate for the sporks is the extent to which many people engaging in online arguments on both sides of the Democratic primary turn into nasty, bullying blowhards incapable of seeing their ideological opponents’ basic humanity.

Twitter is blocking the right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones from posting to its platform for a week.

The InfoWars broadcaster's past tweets will, however, remain viewable to others while his account is locked in a ""read-only"" mode.

The social network has not confirmed what prompted the action.

But the New York Times reported Mr Jones had tweeted a link to a video in which he called on his followers to ready their ""battle rifles"".

The BBC understands that Twitter judged this to be a violation of its rules against abusive behaviour.

The restriction was initially only effective against the @RealAlexJones account, which has 890,000 followers.

Mr Jones subsequently posted a video in which he discusses the move to a separate @Infowars feed - with about 431,000 followers - which he described as being a ""sub-account"".

Twitter then locked that account in read-only mode too.

Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey told NBC that Mr Jones had been put on a ""timeout"".

NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt suggested to Mr Dorsey that the seven-day suspension was too lenient a punishment.

Mr Dorsey said: ""Well, I feel, you know, any suspension, whether it be a permanent one or a temporary one, makes someone think about their actions and their behaviours.""

The anchorman asked Mr Dorsey if he really believed Mr Jones would tone down the rhetoric after a one-week suspension.

The Twitter boss said he did not know, but that was the company policy.

Conspiracy theories

Mr Jones has previously been widely criticised for repeating claims that the 9/11 attacks in New York were staged by the US government.

He has also claimed that many of the children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre were actors. The parents of two children shot in that attack are suing him for defamation, saying he had made ""false, cruel, and dangerous assertions"".

Image copyright Twitter Image caption Twitter sent this message to Mr Jones complaining of abusive behaviour

Apple's iTunes, Facebook and YouTube removed podcasts and other content by Mr Jones and InfoWars from their services last week.

Other tech firms have since taken similar action, including:

the video site Vimeo

the social networks LinkedIn and Pinterest

the photo site Flickr

the audio-streaming services Spotify, Stitcher and TuneIn

the online marketing tool MailChimp

However, Twitter had resisted imposing a similar ban.

It said Mr Jones' accounts had not breached its rules, although CNN later highlighted past tweets that appeared to contradict this.

The social network did, however, promise to take action if there were ever any fresh infractions.

According to the terms of the suspension, Mr Jones will still be able to use his account to view and search for other people's content. He can also send direct messages. But he will not be able to tweet, like, comment or retweet others' material.

Techcrunch reported that he had also been required to delete the link to his earlier Periscope video session, which itself is no longer online.

Among the last messages Mr Jones posted before the ban came into effect was a claim that InfoWars' main website had been forced offline by a cyber-attack.

Although he now faces many restrictions to his online activity, there are several outlets that have not blocked his content.

They include the social networks Google+, Gab and Tumblr. In addition, Google's Play store and Apple's iOS equivalent continue to host the InfoWars app.",www.bbc.com,center,KSilxuRAKolyBcTK

Here ’ s the Project Veritas headline and story :
Insider Blows Whistle & Exec Reveals Google Plan to Prevent “ Trump situation ” in 2020 on Hidden Cam
( New York City ) — Project Veritas has released a new report on Google which includes undercover video of a Senior Google Executive , leaked documents , and testimony from a Google insider . The report appears to show Google ’ s plans to affect the outcome of the 2020 elections and “ prevent ” the next “ Trump situation . ”
The report includes undercover footage of longtime Google employee and Head of Responsible Innovation , Jen Gennai , saying :
“ Elizabeth Warren is saying we should break up Google . And like , I love her but she ’ s very misguided , like that will not make it better it will make it worse , because all these smaller companies who don ’ t have the same resources that we do will be charged with preventing the next Trump situation , it ’ s like a small company can not do that . ”
“ This is the third tech insider who has bravely stepped forward to expose the secrets of Silicon Valley . These new documents , supported by undercover video , raise questions of Google ’ s neutrality and the role they see themselves fulfilling in the 2020 elections . ”
Jen Gennai is the head of “ Responsible Innovation ” for Google , a sector that monitors and evaluates the responsible implementation of Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) technologies .

So with all those investigations into interference by Russians in the 2016 election — will there be a congressional investigation into Google ? In fact , Google executive Gennai already has an answer on what happens when Congress requests Google execs to show up for a hearing :

Project Veritas and founder James O’Keefe have scored a scoop from an identified Google whistleblower, replete with video and inside documents. Here’s the Project Veritas headline and story:

Insider Blows Whistle & Exec Reveals Google Plan to Prevent “Trump situation” in 2020 on Hidden Cam

The story begins this way:

(New York City) — Project Veritas has released a new report on Google which includes undercover video of a Senior Google Executive, leaked documents, and testimony from a Google insider. The report appears to show Google’s plans to affect the outcome of the 2020 elections and “prevent” the next “Trump situation.”

The report includes undercover footage of longtime Google employee and Head of Responsible Innovation, Jen Gennai, saying:

“Elizabeth Warren is saying we should break up Google. And like, I love her but she’s very misguided, like that will not make it better it will make it worse, because all these smaller companies who don’t have the same resources that we do will be charged with preventing the next Trump situation, it’s like a small company cannot do that.”

Said Project Veritas founder James O’Keefe:

“This is the third tech insider who has bravely stepped forward to expose the secrets of Silicon Valley. These new documents, supported by undercover video, raise questions of Google’s neutrality and the role they see themselves fulfilling in the 2020 elections.”

Jen Gennai is the head of “Responsible Innovation” for Google, a sector that monitors and evaluates the responsible implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. In the video, Gennai says Google has been working diligently to “prevent” the results of the 2016 election from repeating in 2020:

“We all got screwed over in 2016, again it wasn’t just us, it was, the people got screwed over, the news media got screwed over, like, everybody got screwed over so we’re rapidly been like, what happened there and how do we prevent it from happening again. “We’re also training our algorithms, like, if 2016 happened again, would we have, would the outcome be different?”

So with all those investigations into interference by Russians in the 2016 election — will there be a congressional investigation into Google? In fact, Google executive Gennai already has an answer on what happens when Congress requests Google execs to show up for a hearing:

“We got called in front of Congress multiple times, so we’ve not shown up because we know that they’re just going to attack us. We’re not going to change our, we’re not going to change our mind. There’s no use sitting there being attacked over something we know we’re not going to change. They can pressure us but we’re not changing. But we also have to be aware of what they’re doing and what they’re accusing us of.”

The anonymous Google insider, whose identity and voice were shadowed and changed to protect him, also said in his detailed interview with O’Keefe that the Google-owned YouTube has deliberately targeted Dennis Prager’s “Prager U” and conservative talker Dave Rubin for content suppression because they are “right-wing.” Not to put too fine a point on this, but in some real time searching the contents of YouTube and just what the heck is on there one of the answers is — pornography. Lots of it. Suffice to say Prager U and Dave Rubin would seem to be the least of the site’s content problems.

As noted in this space a while back, Google was revealed by the Daily Caller to have blacklisted The American Spectator and several other conservative sites.

Not only is Google about blacklisting, an internal document, found here, makes it plain that basic facts will be manipulated to fit the far left wing’s social justice agenda. The document says this: “If a representation is factually accurate, can it still be algorithmic unfairness?”

The document defines “algorithmic unfairness” this way:

“algorithmic unfairness” means unjust or prejudicial treatment of people that is related to sensitive characteristics such as race, income, sexual orientation, or gender, through algorithmic systems or algorithmically aided decision-making.”

By way of example the document says:

… imagine that a Google image query for “CEOs” shows predominantly men. Even if it were factually accurate representation of the world, it would be algorithmic unfairness because it would reinforce a stereotype about the role of women in leadership positions.

Got that? Facts — reality — are “algorithmic unfairness” if they do not promote the far left wing’s social justice agenda. Identity politics is all.

What we have here with this newest undercover work from Project Veritas is exactly what the Google whistleblower says it is: fascism. Fascism straight up. The Googler compares what’s going on inside Google to the famous George Orwell 1949 novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Recall that Orwell’s book originated the concept of “doublethink,” defined this way, bold print for emphasis supplied:

Even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink. For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of doublethink one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth.

Clearly, at Google “doublethink” is called “algorithmic unfairness.”

All of this kind of fascistic-type behavior is drawing the attention of Congress. Considering the free speech implications, it will have to tread very carefully. But without doubt, this report from Project Veritas will make an impact on a discussion about the clear intent of Google to use its size and massive technology to manipulate the 2020 election.

Whomever this Google whistleblower is, he has done his country a tremendous service. The question now is — what to do about it.

Facebook is also turning outside its own organization for help . It will meet with journalists to understand how they verify information , and is exploring partnerships with third-party fact-checking organizations .
Zuckerberg also noted that fake news was becoming a big business , and said Facebook is looking for ways to disrupt the economics of it .
His remarks come just a few days after he said it was “ crazy ” to think that fake news on Facebook influenced the outcome of the election .

But it's a good chance that by the time we're on the other side, a new class of unassailable giants will have cropped up without regulators noticing. And then we can start the theatrics all over again.

Tim Cook just gave the FBI the middle finger. Or something close to it.

Let's back up. One of the perpetrators of the December mass shooting in San Bernardino owned an iPhone. That iPhone is locked, and when an iPhone is locked, there's just no way to get inside it. Or, you know, maybe not.

According to Apple, the FBI is trying to do this through an obscure law known as the All Writs Act of 1789.

And Apple is refusing, because the corporate values at Apple don't allow this sort of thing to happen, at least not without a fight.

The problems with the FBI's iOS demand are manifold. Basically, whoever has this backdoor could do anything with any iPhone on the planet. Get all the data on it, including sensitive material like your texts or your health information. Track your location. Listen to you via the microphone. And even if you think the feds should have this capacity, and the capacity to do it without a warrant, there is simply no way to guarantee they would be the only ones with it.

Regardless of your views on civil liberties, a universal backdoor inside one of the most popular operating systems in the world is, for technological reasons, an atrocious idea. The security risks are enormous. It's no surprise that Mike Lee, one of the most conservative senators (and one of the very best), has come out against the idea.

But Tim Cook didn't have to do this. Apple is now probably going to end up with a lawsuit. And it's going to have to have some unpleasant conversations with the government behind closed doors.

Emails seen by ███ show that the Amazon executive Anne Rung communicated with a top official at the General Services Administration ( GSA ) about the approach the government would take to create the new portal , even before the legislation that created it – known to its critics as the “ Amazon amendment ” – was signed into law late last year .
Amazon and the Trump administration appear to have an antagonistic relationship because of the president ’ s frequent Twitter attacks on the Amazon founder , Jeff Bezos , who also owns the Washington Post . But the behind-the-scenes lobbying by Amazon officials underscores how the company has quietly amassed an unrivalled position of power with the federal government .
The 2017 correspondence between Rung – a former official in the Obama administration credited with transforming the federal government ’ s procurement policies before she joined Amazon – and Mary Davie at the GSA , offers new insights into how Amazon has used key former government officials it now employs – directly and as consultants – to gain influence and potentially shape lucrative government contracts .
It has not yet been determined which companies will build the US government ’ s new e-commerce portal , but Amazon is widely expected to take on a dominant role , giving it a major foothold in the $ 53bn market for federal procurement of commercial products .
Amazon is also the frontrunner to win a separate $ 10bn cloud computing contract with the Pentagon , known as Jedi , which will in effect move the defense department ’ s data on to a commercially run cloud computing system .
Amazon already operates a cloud service for the US intelligence community , including a contract with the CIA , and has said it can protect even the most top secret data on a cloud that is walled off from the public internet .
The company ’ s strength in its defense and intelligence business had largely been attributed to its hiring in 2011 of Steven Spano , a former brigadier general in the air force who has since left the company .
Last year , Amazon also won a contract worth up to $ 5.5bn that made it the chief supplier of goods , including stationery and books , to tens of thousands of local governments and municipalities across the US .

In one early morning email sent from her hotmail account on 20 September 2017 , Rung told Davie that she would like to have a conversation with her – she called it a “ gut check ” – so that they could discuss their upcoming meeting .
She wrote : “ IF the legislation is enacted , I have a sense of how GSA will want to approach this ( first you have to select providers , then you will want to implement something incrementally/phased approach ) , but I want to make sure that I ’ m not way off the mark .

When Rung asked Davie if they should wait until after the legislation is passed to discuss it , Davie responded that the administration was planning on moving ahead regardless of the outcome of the bill on Capitol Hill .

Devin Nunes ( R-CA ) , the ranking member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence , told ███ he is “ very concerned ” about the rising threat of the “ tech oligarchs ” at Twitter , Facebook , Google , and other tech giants censoring conservatives in an effort to stymie free speech and push a leftist agenda .
Nunes , who is suing Twitter right now in Virginia , said in an exclusive appearance on ███ Sunday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 this weekend that that company “ has been the worst ” and that tech companies have gotten away with bias against conservative for years because of a special “ carveout ” in federal law .
“ Well , in general , I have a real concern overall about what I call the ‘ tech oligarchs , ’ ” Nunes said . “ But Twitter has been the worst , especially to me . So if you look at what they ’ ve done , specifically to me , is they enforce their rules selectively . So I ’ m arguing they ’ ve operated their property negligibly . They ’ ve been negligent with the operation of their property , and they ’ re actually content developers . They have had it their way for a long time by having this ability to get out from lawsuits because Congress has actually carved out a special provision in law for them because they were supposed to be an open square—an open public square ; they ’ re the Internet . So they ’ re not treated like someone like , say , some other kind of product would be treated like a car , for example , or a kitchen appliance . They ’ ve had this special carveout for 20 years . ”
Especially since President Donald Trump was elected in 2016 , Nunes argued , the tech giants have warped their products into pushing a certain ideology rather than being open platforms .
“ Now , what has happened in the last two or three years , especially since President Trump was elected , is they now no longer are—it ’ s not an open square where people can just go on there and say whatever they want , ” Nunes said . “ They now are regulating the content , and they ’ re deciding how to regulate the content—and it ’ s clearly biased against conservatives . So we are looking at them for operating their property in a negligent way , and then we ’ re suing others for defamation . Look , this is not the way I want to go about it , especially for someone like me . I don ’ t like going to have to use the court system , but it ’ s really the system of last resort . And that ’ s where I ’ m at . If you go right now—don ’ t do it because I don ’ t use Google , and I don ’ t ask people to use Google—but if you did , you ’ d find hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of fake news stories about me . The only way I can clean all this up is to have multiple retractions done by the defamers and the slanderers . This often goes back to the Russia hoax investigation that I ran , and we uncovered a lot of mischief , to say it politely . ”
Nunes said the solution to this problem would be “ easiest ” if the tech companies went back to being open platforms on their own , but he does not have any confidence they will do so .
“ What ’ s the easiest—I ’ m going to tell you the easiest way that this can all be solved . However , I ’ m going to tell you that this is not going to happen , ” Nunes said . “ I ’ ve run out of patience . This is just not going to happen , and then we ’ ll go to what are the solutions out there . The easiest way , I believe , to solve this—especially for Twitter and Facebook , who have already done some of this—is just get out of the content development business . Just say , ‘ Look , we ’ re just like it used to be . We ’ re an open square . The only way we ’ re going to come in is if there is breaking of a federal or state law , ’ and police it that way , kind of like when somebody calls the police : You go in . You check it out . If there ’ s child pornography or foul language or something that may be against the rules there that they have , then great , then take the tweet down . As it relates to Google , just stop the bias . If Matt Boyle gets Googled 50,000 times—a story that you do on Breitbart gets Googled 50,000 times—and the Washington Post story is 20,000 , then Matt Boyle ’ s story should be first . It ’ s really simple . It ’ s really , really simple for them to solve this problem . But I have no faith that they ’ re going to get out of the content development business . I think they ’ re in it . ”
Nunes also said he believes the Democrats talk about regulating or holding tech companies accountable only as a “ fake threat , ” meant to intimidate them into becoming subservient to the left ’ s agenda .
“ I think when you see the Democrats talking about going after these companies , that ’ s a fake threat , ” Nunes said . “ They ’ re doing that to basically warn them that you better do what we want . You better make sure that Democrats and leftists and all of our causes are put at the top . You better make sure that anything Breitbart reports or Epoch Times reports—they ’ re the latest one—it disappears . And that ’ s what ’ s happening . ”
Given that Democrats are in the majority right now in the House of Representatives , Nunes said , there is “ nothing ” that Congress can do to combat the tech giants until after the 2020 election . That ’ s why Nunes is suing Twitter in a Virginia state court , seeking to hold the company accountable and putting himself forward to do so , given that he has been the victim of smears , lies , fake accounts , and inaccurate attacks .
“ So I am very concerned . You ask what can be done . The answer right now is nothing can be done because Nancy Pelosi controls the House , and she is going to ensure that nothing happens to these companies as we sit right now , ” Nunes said . “ So it ’ s going to have to be word of mouth , through conservatives and through Republicans , and we ’ re just going to have to overwhelm them . Hopefully , someone will come up with a better search engine . But I think that ’ s going to be very difficult . So what does that leave ? It leaves the court system . I ’ m in the best position to do it because I ’ m one of the ones who ’ s been most slandered . So hopefully , the courts will step in , right ? If I can win one of these cases , it will really set these guys back . If the Covington school kids can win a case , that would set them back . So I think between defamation laws and treating these tech companies what they are , which is property , this is going to be the fastest and only way to solve it before 2020 . ”

You better make sure that anything Breitbart reports or Epoch Times reports—they’re the latest one—it disappears. And that’s what’s happening.”

Given that Democrats are in the majority right now in the House of Representatives, Nunes said, there is “nothing” that Congress can do to combat the tech giants until after the 2020 election. That’s why Nunes is suing Twitter in a Virginia state court, seeking to hold the company accountable and putting himself forward to do so, given that he has been the victim of smears, lies, fake accounts, and inaccurate attacks.

“So I am very concerned. You ask what can be done. The answer right now is nothing can be done because Nancy Pelosi controls the House, and she is going to ensure that nothing happens to these companies as we sit right now,” Nunes said. “So it’s going to have to be word of mouth, through conservatives and through Republicans, and we’re just going to have to overwhelm them. Hopefully, someone will come up with a better search engine. But I think that’s going to be very difficult. So what does that leave? It leaves the court system. I’m in the best position to do it because I’m one of the ones who’s been most slandered. So hopefully, the courts will step in, right? If I can win one of these cases, it will really set these guys back. If the Covington school kids can win a case, that would set them back. So I think between defamation laws and treating these tech companies what they are, which is property, this is going to be the fastest and only way to solve it before 2020.”

SAN FRANCISCO — Wall Street didn't get the user growth it was looking for. But Twitter did show investors the money.

In the fourth quarter, Twitter added new users far more slowly than analysts anticipated, heaping yet more doubt on Twitter's chances of regaining momentum.

Yet shares jumped 11% in after-hours trading Thursday as executives promised a return to robust user growth in 2015 — and delivered a 97% jump in revenue to $479 million, walloping estimates.

Another piece of good news: Though Twitter remains unprofitable, the fourth-quarter loss was narrower than expected.

""The quarter was good on the metrics that mattered,"" Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said. ""The issue around making this into a business of scale is not about users at this stage. It's about developing a compelling advertising proposition"" that sets Twitter apart from competitors such as Facebook and Google.

Twitter CEO Dick Costolo and his new leadership team are trying to prove Twitter has mainstream appeal and generate revenue growth while wriggling under the Wall Street microscope.

Twitter users post messages of 140 characters or less. The service, frequented by celebrities, world leaders and politicians, is one of the best known around the world.

But the company has struggled to grow in the long shadow of Facebook, the largest social network with 1.39 billion users. Twitter is even dwarfed by Instagram, the photo-sharing service owned by Facebook that recently surpassed Twitter with 300 million monthly users.

Twitter has rolled out a series of features to make the service easier to use and to persuade people to spend more time on it.

But the company has also seen a string of departures from senior executives in recent months. And Costolo is facing growing criticism from Wall Street.

Twitter (TICKER: TWTR) said revenue in the three months ended Dec. 31 was $479 million, up from $243 million a year ago.

Analysts forecast sales of $453.14 million, up 87% from $242.7 million in the year-ago quarter.

Twitter reported a loss of $125.4 million, or 20 cents a share, down from the year-ago loss of $511.5 million or $1.41 a share. Excluding certain costs, earnings per share rose to 12 cents a share from 2 cents a share.

""The bright spot for Twitter remains their advertising business, which is growing,"" eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson said. ""But all of that solid, substantial growth is really overshadowed by the usage issue.""

Twitter had 288 million monthly active users in the quarter, the smallest gain in the company's history.

Wall Street had anticipated that Twitter would have a tough time reversing the slowdown in user growth. Analysts reduced estimates for the fourth quarter, forecasting user growth of just 2.8% to 292 million.

Yet Twitter couldn't meet dampened expectations. Twitter said it added 4 million monthly active users in the fourth quarter for a total of 288 million, a growth rate of just 1.4%. Twitter ended the third quarter with 284 million monthly active users. That was an increase of less than 5% from the second quarter.

The suspected gunman did everything he could to make his shooting spree go viral . He live-streamed the attack on social media , wearing a body camera to simulate a video game . He shared a rambling 74-page manifesto espousing white supremacy that was full of memes and easter eggs meant to invite attention from all corners of the internet and admiration from other extremists who live online . The shooter had laid a trap across the internet that exploited the newsworthiness of the attack and leaned into peoples ’ inclination to gawk at horror and violence . Even professional journalistic institutions gave in to the temptation to air video of the massacre .
Scrubbing the video from the internet was like playing a game of whack-a-mole . Facebook quickly removed the alleged gunman ’ s Facebook and Instagram accounts — but not because its algorithm or moderators had flagged the violent content in real time . New Zealand authorities had to ask for the video to be taken down . Internet service providers in New Zealand rushed to “ close off ” websites that were distributing the video , but then a number of copy-cat sites immediately started popping up .
It soon didn ’ t matter that the original video was removed . The clip had already been downloaded and re-upped online faster than tech companies could respond . Facebook alone says it removed 1.5 million videos within the first 24 hours of the attack . And those are just the clips they were able to catch .
Friday ’ s massacre exemplified a larger problem that ’ s plaguing the internet . Platforms are struggling to self-police problematic content created by its users , while the lawmakers who would ostensibly impose regulations are either too reluctant or ill-equipped to do so — and many in both camps are predisposed to treat far-right rhetoric less seriously than other forms of extremism , to boot .
As the death toll rises — now 50 lives have been taken since Friday ’ s shooting , making it one of the deadliest terror attacks carried out by a far-right extremist in recent memory — the attack adds extra weight to the question that tech companies , policymakers , and social media users have been asking : How do you effectively police online hate ?
The shooter ’ s viral video outpaced social media company ’ s content moderation
The world ’ s largest tech companies were forced to scramble on Friday to keep the violent screed from spreading . Facebook said it was removing any praise or support of the shooting , and had a process to flag the digital fingerprint of disturbing materials . YouTube said it was “ working vigilantly ” to remove violent footage , while Twitter said it suspended the account that posted the original video . Reddit on Friday eventually resorted to taking down two infamous subreddits , r/watchpeopledie and r/gory .
Despite those efforts , videos of the attack were easy to find through simple searches online , even hours and days after the initial shooting spree . The swift dissemination highlights how ill-equipped tech companies remain in addressing the vile , racist , and excessively violent content that ’ s being shared on their platforms .
Took me about 30 seconds to find YouTube videos of the ripped livestream : pic.twitter.com/TFkQHIqQbf — Jason Abbruzzese ( @ JasonAbbruzzese ) March 15 , 2019
Moderators already face an uphill battle in keeping offensive and violent content offline ; the Christchurch terror attack shows the difficulty of catching deeply problematic video live-streams in real time .
For one , it ’ s generally easier for software to scan text and offensive comments as opposed to moving images in a video . But even when the technical tools exist , policing-breaking news poses unique problems . YouTube , for example , does have a system for automatically removing copyrighted content or prohibited materials , and told the Verge ’ s Julia Alexander that any exact re-uploads of the alleged shooter ’ s videos would be automatically deleted . But the algorithm can ’ t be used to tamp down on edited versions of the Christchurch shooting , because Youtube wants to “ ensure that news videos that use a portion of the video for their segments aren ’ t removed in the process ” :
YouTube ’ s safety team thinks of it as a balancing act , according to sources familiar with their thinking . For major news events like yesterday ’ s shooting , YouTube ’ s team uses a system that ’ s similar to its copyright tool , Content ID , but not exactly the same . It searches re-uploaded versions of the original video for similar metadata and imagery . If it ’ s an unedited re-upload , it ’ s removed . If it ’ s edited , the tool flags it to a team of human moderators , both full-time employees at YouTube and contractors , who determine if the video violates the company ’ s policies .
That process is not just traumatizing for the individual moderators who are forced to watch the horrific footage , it ’ s also an imperfect system to limit its reach — particularly in a fast-moving event like Friday ’ s tragedy .
Tech companies are expected to self-police . So far , they ’ re falling short .
At this point , in theory , tech companies should be well-practiced in the art of blocking far-right hate speech and violence from their platforms . They ’ ve been having to deal with it for years .
After the 2017 Unite the Right rally of neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville , Virginia — where a woman was mowed down and killed by an avowed Nazi sympathizer — tech companies faced intense public pressure to block prominent instigators of explicit far-right extremism . Twitter suspended a bunch of white supremacists and prominent provocateurs — including Milo Yiannoppolis , Alex Jones , and Gavin McInnes — but was hesitant to target other alt-right leaders like Richard Spencer . Gab and the Daily Stormer , two havens for neo-Nazis , were similarly banished to the darker recesses of the internet .

The Christchurch shooter livestreamed his attack . The video was disseminated across the internet even as platforms desperately worked to remove it . — Ellie Hall ( @ ellievhall ) March 16 , 2019","The hate-filled terror rampage at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, was meticulously designed to maximize the number of witnesses around the globe, highlighting the difficulty in putting a lid on extremist hate that spreads online.

The suspected gunman did everything he could to make his shooting spree go viral. He live-streamed the attack on social media, wearing a body camera to simulate a video game. He shared a rambling 74-page manifesto espousing white supremacy that was full of memes and easter eggs meant to invite attention from all corners of the internet and admiration from other extremists who live online. The shooter had laid a trap across the internet that exploited the newsworthiness of the attack and leaned into peoples’ inclination to gawk at horror and violence. Even professional journalistic institutions gave in to the temptation to air video of the massacre.

Scrubbing the video from the internet was like playing a game of whack-a-mole. Facebook quickly removed the alleged gunman’s Facebook and Instagram accounts — but not because its algorithm or moderators had flagged the violent content in real time. New Zealand authorities had to ask for the video to be taken down. Internet service providers in New Zealand rushed to “close off” websites that were distributing the video, but then a number of copy-cat sites immediately started popping up.

It soon didn’t matter that the original video was removed. The clip had already been downloaded and re-upped online faster than tech companies could respond. Facebook alone says it removed 1.5 million videos within the first 24 hours of the attack. And those are just the clips they were able to catch.

Friday’s massacre exemplified a larger problem that’s plaguing the internet. Platforms are struggling to self-police problematic content created by its users, while the lawmakers who would ostensibly impose regulations are either too reluctant or ill-equipped to do so — and many in both camps are predisposed to treat far-right rhetoric less seriously than other forms of extremism, to boot.

As the death toll rises — now 50 lives have been taken since Friday’s shooting, making it one of the deadliest terror attacks carried out by a far-right extremist in recent memory — the attack adds extra weight to the question that tech companies, policymakers, and social media users have been asking: How do you effectively police online hate?

The shooter’s viral video outpaced social media company’s content moderation

The world’s largest tech companies were forced to scramble on Friday to keep the violent screed from spreading. Facebook said it was removing any praise or support of the shooting, and had a process to flag the digital fingerprint of disturbing materials. YouTube said it was “working vigilantly” to remove violent footage, while Twitter said it suspended the account that posted the original video. Reddit on Friday eventually resorted to taking down two infamous subreddits, r/watchpeopledie and r/gory.

Despite those efforts, videos of the attack were easy to find through simple searches online, even hours and days after the initial shooting spree. The swift dissemination highlights how ill-equipped tech companies remain in addressing the vile, racist, and excessively violent content that’s being shared on their platforms.

Moderators already face an uphill battle in keeping offensive and violent content offline; the Christchurch terror attack shows the difficulty of catching deeply problematic video live-streams in real time.

For one, it’s generally easier for software to scan text and offensive comments as opposed to moving images in a video. But even when the technical tools exist, policing-breaking news poses unique problems. YouTube, for example, does have a system for automatically removing copyrighted content or prohibited materials, and told the Verge’s Julia Alexander that any exact re-uploads of the alleged shooter’s videos would be automatically deleted. But the algorithm can’t be used to tamp down on edited versions of the Christchurch shooting, because Youtube wants to “ensure that news videos that use a portion of the video for their segments aren’t removed in the process”:

YouTube’s safety team thinks of it as a balancing act, according to sources familiar with their thinking. For major news events like yesterday’s shooting, YouTube’s team uses a system that’s similar to its copyright tool, Content ID, but not exactly the same. It searches re-uploaded versions of the original video for similar metadata and imagery. If it’s an unedited re-upload, it’s removed. If it’s edited, the tool flags it to a team of human moderators, both full-time employees at YouTube and contractors, who determine if the video violates the company’s policies.

That process is not just traumatizing for the individual moderators who are forced to watch the horrific footage, it’s also an imperfect system to limit its reach — particularly in a fast-moving event like Friday’s tragedy.

Tech companies are expected to self-police. So far, they’re falling short.

At this point, in theory, tech companies should be well-practiced in the art of blocking far-right hate speech and violence from their platforms. They’ve been having to deal with it for years.

After the 2017 Unite the Right rally of neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia — where a woman was mowed down and killed by an avowed Nazi sympathizer — tech companies faced intense public pressure to block prominent instigators of explicit far-right extremism. Twitter suspended a bunch of white supremacists and prominent provocateurs — including Milo Yiannoppolis, Alex Jones, and Gavin McInnes — but was hesitant to target other alt-right leaders like Richard Spencer. Gab and the Daily Stormer, two havens for neo-Nazis, were similarly banished to the darker recesses of the internet. Reddit quarantined hate-fueled subreddits, while other companies like PayPal, GoDaddy, and Squarespace blocked white supremacists from using their services.

In effect, individual leaders and groups were targeted in response to a high-profile flashpoint in American politics and culture. But for many critics, those actions were hollow in addressing the underlying proliferation of racist and white supremacist ideas that are peddled online.

And even minimal efforts at reform have come with costs for the social media giants — big ones. As Vox’s Emily Stewart noted after Facebook’s stock saw the biggest one-day drop in history last fall (with $119 billion wiped off of its value after the company reported slower-than-expected revenue growth), social media companies’ efforts to address issues with their platforms garner “enormous backlash from Wall Street.”

The message from investors is clear: They’re nervous about what bad headlines and subsequent changes from social media platforms could do to their bottom lines. If Twitter and Facebook police their sites in a way that affects engagement or cracks down on content, or if privacy controls that ask users to opt in to their data being shared lead to more of them opting out, ad dollars could fall. And hiring workers to increase privacy protections and monitor activity is expensive. ... This week offers a lesson we don’t necessarily want executives to take away: try to be better, and potentially be severely punished by investors.

Many companies only start to take action on long-standing issues when the financial risks of not doing anything become higher than the likely costs they’ll encounter.

YouTube, for example, is under fire for failing to adequately combat conspiracies and prevent child exploitation from being circulated. Its algorithm has a troubling record of surfacing and recommending content that violates its own policies. Major advertisers —including Disney and Nestle — started to bolt earlier this year after finding that their ads were appearing in videos full of offensive and sexually explicit comments aimed at children. In response, YouTube purged hundreds of its users and said it would change the way new videos are elevated and surfaced, following up on a crackdown in 2017 from reports that videos full of predatory comments were being recommended to kids.

Some lawmakers are growing impatient with tech companies’ self-regulation — but it’s not clear they can do it any better

Even as platforms have tried to regulate themselves in recent years, some policymakers’ patience for letting them do so is growing short. But the legislative solutions some of them have proposed — or lack thereof — also struggle to match the pace of change in internet culture and the communities that foster extremist ideas and behaviors.

Congress so far has struggled to grapple with — or even understand — the many tentacles of problems plaguing social networks, from tackling the spread of misinformation to regulating how sites handle user data and privacy.

Some members of Congress have been woefully ill-prepared to even talk about tech issues (during one hearing last year, a lawmaker asked the Google CEO questions about his iPhone). And even when they are interested and equipped to talk about regulating the internet, many US lawmakers have been “reticent to clamp down at the risk of harming growth,” Stewart noted:

In a Senate hearing in April, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) asked Zuckerberg what “sorts of legislative changes” he thought should be enacted to prevent a Cambridge Analytica repeat. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who also pressed Zuckerberg on whether Facebook is a monopoly, asked the executive to submit some proposed regulations to him.

Elizabeth Warren has gone as far as proposing to break up Google, Facebook, and Amazon, while Sen. Amy Klobuchar is expected to make tech reform a banner issue for her campaign.

There’s a growing appetite for reform elsewhere in the world. The European Union took a stand on privacy concerns with General Data Protection Regulation Act, or GDPR, a law enacted last year to compel transparency around the data that companies collect and how it is used. And now some countries want to crack down on extremist content, too.

After rolling out Apple Pay, the company introduced the audience to the long-awaited Apple Watch and its set of sensors.

technology,Quillette,2,https://quillette.com/2019/06/23/how-free-speech-dies-online/,How Free Speech Dies Online,2019-06-23,"Klaus C., Jonny Sclerotic, David Of Kirkland, David Of Sydney, Denny Sinnoh, Geary Johansen, Trevor Machine, Bumble Bee","Last year , I explained why it is wrong to consider weakening speech protections to allow bans on speech by the alt-right , neo-Nazis , or other far-Right groups : it is safer to let Nazis speak in a society that places high value on individual rights and has strong legal protections for those rights than it is to risk letting Nazis take control of institutional power in a society where protections on individual rights have been eroded . I explained , with specific examples , how easy it would be for a far-Right regime to turn restrictions on violent or hateful speech against its enemies .
However , since then , while free speech has remained a controversial topic , the focus of the debate has moved away from restrictions on speech by state actors , and toward the question of how corporate entities that privately control the platforms which host a great deal of our speech and debate should regulate and moderate their users .
These platforms are not bound by the US Constitution or by other legal regimes that protect private speech from state coercion , but their rule-making processes should be guided by the same principles that led all Western democracies to implement strong protections for speech—even speech that others may find offensive .
For most of modern history , states have been the only institutions with the coercive power to restrain speech , and so most policymaking related to free speech has focused on what the limitations on that state power should be .
In the United States , the Constitution permits almost no regulation of private speech by the government , with a few very narrow exceptions for defamation , “ fighting words ” or incitement to violence , obscenity , and regulation of commercial speech to prevent false advertising . Other Western states permit the regulation of some categories of hate speech , but most still have fairly robust free speech protections .
However , in the last decade , the public square has been privatized by social media networks . These companies—primarily Google ( which owns YouTube ) , Facebook ( which owns Instagram ) , Apple ( which controls access to lots of content through its App Store and its Podcast app ) , the crowdfunding platform Patreon , and Twitter—have offered platforms to billions of people and created media ecosystems that support the livelihoods of many content creators who may not have previously had the opportunity to be media professionals . But the livelihoods of people who professionally produce content disseminated over social media , as well as the smaller platforms of millions of other non-professional users of these networks , are now subject to the whims of these companies .
These networks have already demonstrated the power they can wield over the fortunes of content creators . The influence of figures like Milo Yiannopoulos and Alex Jones waxed as their follower and subscriber counts grew into seven figures on networks like Twitter , Facebook , and YouTube . But their reach waned considerably after those networks banned them and stripped them of access to their platforms . Yiannopoulos is now said to be millions of dollars in debt and peddling a self-published 96-page book entitled How to Be Poor . It ’ s a little simplistic to attribute the fall of Milo to the loss of his Twitter platform ; while Milo ’ s influence may have begun to crumble after his Twitter ban , subsequent outrage over his statements about child abuse caused a conservative publishing imprint to cancel his book and CPAC to cancel his appearance , and public revelations of Milo ’ s connections to white nationalists caused the billionaire Republican fundraiser Robert Mercer to yank his support from Milo Inc . But in the wake of high-profile bans like Jones ’ s , numerous less-prominent creators have had their income streams disrupted by various YouTube demonetization waves , as a result of YouTube cracking down on content creators to assuage the fears of advertisers .
In 2018 , Patreon banned anti-feminist YouTuber Carl “ Sargon of Akkad ” Benjamin , who had been earning $ 12,000 per month on the site , after he used a racial epithet to describe white-nationalists , who he said had assumed the negative qualities they impute to groups they hate . Despite the fact that the epithet had not been directed at a black person , Patreon determined he had violated its rules . Sam Harris , Dave Rubin , and Jordan Peterson , who were all earning good money through the platform , left in protest . Peterson is launching a new platform called Thinkspot , which Rubin and Benjamin will be joining . However , they likely lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in income as a result of leaving the more popular Patreon platform .
Recently , Carlos Maza , a progressive host and producer of Strikethrough , a Vox media web show , complained that YouTube should punish the right-wing comedian Steven Crowder for harassment . Crowder had been uploading clips rebutting Maza ’ s Strikethrough videos , and Crowder often mocked Maza with schoolyard insults that referenced Maza ’ s sexuality and ethnicity . After YouTube determined that Crowder ’ s videos had not violated its policies , Google experienced extensive blowback from both social media users and mainstream media . In response , YouTube promulgated a new set of policies banning racist videos and denials of events like the Holocaust and the Sandy Hook massacre . They demonetized Crowder ’ s channel for linking to a merch store that sold a t-shirt with an offensive epithet printed on it .
Activists who sided with Maza weren ’ t satisfied with YouTube ’ s response , and have demanded more decisive action . And , fanning the flames of outrage , the New York Times ran a major feature contending that YouTube permits a flourishing ecosystem of far-Right creators on its platform , and that its recommendation algorithms push impressionable viewers toward extreme content . The implication is that YouTube should do something to change this .
Meanwhile , Twitter is conducting research into how white nationalists and other far right groups use its service in response to widespread calls for the service to ban Nazis .
Social media platforms already have more restrictive speech codes than most Western states . All platforms have rules barring content that promotes violence or terrorism . Facebook and Instagram prohibit white nationalism , white supremacy , and hate groups . YouTube has a policy against threats of violence as well as harassment and cyberbullying that “ crosses the line into malicious attack , ” but does not remove videos that are merely “ annoying or petty. ” Twitter has anti-harassment rules which bar targeted harassment and “ hateful conduct . ”
Milo Yiannopoulos was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment after he posted doctored screenshots of tweets that made it appear that Saturday Night Live and Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones had said provocative things . These images incited angry mobs of his fans to brigade in Jones ’ s mentions and bombard her with racist invective .
After a video of the beheading of captured journalist James Foley was circulated on social media in 2014 , social media platforms began cracking down on ISIS under policies barring terrorism and posts and tweets supporting terrorist groups . Twitter banned hundreds of thousands of ISIS-promoting accounts , and unleashed automated systems to purge terrorist accounts from its services . However , the algorithm hit a lot of false positives , including Arabic-language broadcasters , antiterror watchdog groups , and regular users who were flagged by the software for various reasons . This outcome was considered preferable to allowing terror groups to use the platform as a propaganda tool .
Some users and media outlets , as well as workers inside Twitter have argued that white nationalists should be considered a terror threat similar to ISIS in the wake of violent attacks by far-right activists in Charlottesville , Virginia , at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh , and against two mosques in Christchurch , New Zealand . Therefore , they believe it is appropriate for the auto-ban algorithms that Twitter used against ISIS to be deployed against the far-Right . A minor firestorm erupted in April 2019 , when Vice ’ s Motherboard vertical reported that Twitter won ’ t turn on the algorithms to purge white nationalists the way it did for Islamic State terrorists because it fears some of the false positives will be Republican politicians .
But while the spin was that Twitter felt white nationalists were indistinguishable from Republicans , Twitter ’ s concern actually seemed to be that it is difficult to draw the line between the unacceptable far-Right and the acceptable mainstream Right in a way that a computer can understand . And , if the algorithm were turned loose , the same blunt tool would probably hit a bunch of mainstream media outlets as well .
For example , David Neiwert , a DailyKos reporter who covers the far-Right , was recently banned from Twitter over his book cover , which depicts the American flag with little Klan hoods on all the stars . Similarly , a history teacher whose channel contained archival footage of Nazi rallies from the 1940s , was banned from YouTube after the platform implemented new policies against hateful content in the wake of the Maza/Crowder dustup . These bans were implemented by human moderators , who are typically low-paid contract workers who must rigidly apply a detailed set of policies to the content they moderate with little leeway for discretion . If these platforms used algorithms to ban people , the false positives would likely increase .
And anyway , Twitter doesn ’ t need to deploy its algorithms to find prominent white nationalists and far-Right personalities like Richard Spencer , Faith Goldy , and Stefan Molyneux , because it knows exactly who they are and it allows them to remain on the platform . Why ? Because , they aren ’ t breaking its rules .
So , to get rid of them , there will need to be new rules .
The thing about Nazis is that they ’ re not all illiterates bellowing epithets at minorities and tweeting gas chamber memes at journalists . Many of the most prominent alt-right figures promulgate their ideologies without calling for violence , without targeting individuals for harassment , and without tweeting anything that explicitly runs afoul of the hateful content policies of Twitter and YouTube .
Richard Spencer , the white nationalist who coined the term “ alt-right , ” has lately been calling for more explicit speech codes on Twitter and YouTube , so he can form a new “ code or lingo ” with which to spread his ideology under this new more restrictive regime . It makes sense that Spencer would be skeptical of the idea of free speech , because he holds the basic premises of liberalism in contempt . This is something he has in common with the people who want to ban him . Spencer accepts that those in power will restrict his speech , because if he were in their position , he ’ d do the same .
So Spencer invites speech codes because he prefers a rigid set of rules to a more nebulously-defined set of principles that will simply declare his ideology to be forbidden and ban him for being persona non-grata , without needing to find him responsible for any specific rules violation beyond just generally being Richard Spencer .
That ’ s what Facebook did in 2018 by banning “ hate organizations. ” It banned Spencer ’ s pages as well as those of other prominent white nationalists after journalists from Vice asked Facebook why a number of organizations branded as hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) were still on the site . This is the rule a lot of activists would like to see implemented at Twitter , and the effects of such a rule seems to be what Twitter is currently “ studying . ”
But Twitter ’ s current approach is right , and Facebook ’ s is wrong . Spencer was banned from Facebook because his National Policy Institute was labeled a hate group by the SPLC . But the SPLC has credibility problems of its own . Its list of hate groups has included Christian organizations that oppose gay rights like the Family Research Council and the Alliance Defending Freedom ( ADF ) , a conservative Christian lawyers ’ group . As a result of being labeled a hate group by SPLC , the ADF was barred from receiving charitable donations through the AmazonSmile program .
In 2018 , the SPLC paid $ 3.4 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the counter-extremist Muslim organization Quilliam and its founder , Maajid Nawaz , after the SPLC erroneously included them on a list of anti-Muslim hate groups . That wasn ’ t the first time the SPLC had experienced such a controversy ; in 2015 , it named surgeon , former Republican presidential candidate , and current US Housing Secretary Ben Carson an “ extremist. ” The SPLC later removed Carson from its “ Extremist File ” and apologized to him . Even if the SPLC is right about Spencer ’ s organization , do we really want this group making arbitrary determinations about who can use social media ?
And once the censors have finished prohibiting white nationalists , which other ideologies will they forbid ? The people crying loudest for censorship have long lists of enemies . Once they deplatform the alt-right , they ’ ll certainly be coming for gender critical feminists , immigration and security hawks , Tucker Carlson , and probably Ben Shapiro , who is often erroneously labeled “ alt-right ” by progressives , even though the alt-right hates him because of his identity as an Orthodox Jew and because of his politics , which are opposed to white nationalism .
Here is where they get around to me : I ’ m Jewish , so I ’ m not a big fan of Nazis . But I ’ m also pretty skeptical of progressive activists , because when they can ’ t find a Nazi to punch , they often settle for punching Jews . You see , while the far-Left hates the alt-right , it also hates the state of Israel . Because of this , gay Jewish groups have been banned from LGBT marches , campus Jewish organizations have been aggressively protested , American Jews have been accused of dual loyalty by members of Congress , and NYU ’ s Department of Social and Cultural Analysis voted to boycott their university ’ s own satellite campus in Tel Aviv .
I believe Israel has a right to exist as a Jewish state , and that is a hateful view to many progressive activists . They believe that Israel is an apartheid regime , that Palestine must be free from the river to the sea , and that , therefore , Jewish groups that support Israel are hate groups . All it takes to get Jews who support Jewish organizations like Hillel , B ’ nai Brith , Birthright Israel , and the Jewish Federation banned from Facebook is for some activists from Students for Justice in Palestine to go work at SPLC and get these organizations added to its hate list .
That may seem implausible ; these are mainstream organizations , and support for Israel is a mainstream view . But progressive opinion on Israel has shifted dramatically in the last five years . It is common for progressives to view Zionism as synonymous with white supremacy , and progressive activists are already accusing mainstream Jewish charities of being hate groups .
Richard Spencer hates me . But in order to muzzle him , I ’ d have to grant censorious power to people who hate him , but who also hate me . And they won ’ t stop at the groups I ’ ve mentioned . They ’ ll go after mainstream conservatives , and they ’ ll go after center-Right people like New York Times columnists Bari Weiss , David Brooks , and Bret Stephens . They ’ ll cancel Joe Biden . They ’ ll deny a platform to everyone to the right of Chapo Trap House , because , like Richard Spencer , they do not believe in free speech and they do not value the rights of people who disagree with them . Their cause is righteous , everyone who stands against them is a villain , and their creed doesn ’ t permit tolerance of dissent .
In 1977 , a group of Nazis decided to hold a march in Skokie , Illinois , a heavily Jewish Chicago suburb that was reputed to have more Holocaust survivors than any place outside of Israel . The planned march met with strong resistance , and state courts issued injunctions to prevent it from happening . But a Jewish lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union named David Goldberger took up the case to defend the Nazis ’ right to speak and assemble . Members of the ACLU ’ s board quit in disgust over the organization ’ s decision to represent the Nazis , but Goldberger believed that free speech was free speech , even for the most revolting figures . His view prevailed in the Supreme Court , and the Nazis were allowed to march .
When the event finally occurred in 1978 , only about 20 Nazis showed up , and they were met by 2,000 counter-protesters . They dispersed after about ten minutes . What was so dangerous about letting this small group of clowns march around for a few minutes , that it was worth compromising a fundamental liberty ?
And , on the same note , is it so dangerous to let Richard Spencer shitpost on Twitter that stopping him is worth giving up on the idea of social media being a forum for the free exchange of opinion ? His arguments do not seem to be gaining much traction . The 2016 convention of Spencer ’ s National Policy Institute , held less than two weeks after Donald Trump ’ s victory , drew a crowd of only about 275 . The 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville , one of the largest gatherings of far-Right activists in decades , which devolved into violent clashes during which a Nazi murdered a counter-protester with his car , had only about 500 attendees from a range of far-Right groups . And when the organizers of the Charlottesville rally decided to hold a second Unite the Right event in 2018 , only a few dozen far-Right activists showed up . By contrast , Bronycon , the convention for adult men who are fans of the television program My Little Pony : Friendship is Magic , drew a crowd of 5,500 attendees in 2018 . For every Nazi in America , there are eleven Bronies . Media outlets that fixate on the far-Right are vastly overstating the influence of these groups .
Given that the alt-right is really just a handful of angry dudes who can ’ t gather enough people in one place to fill a medium-sized hotel ballroom , the only decent argument that they ’ re a real threat revolves around the idea that they groom and radicalize mass shooters and other terrorists . Alex Fields , the Unite the Right killer , was obviously affiliated with far-Right groups . Robert Bowers , the Tree of Life synagogue shooter , was obsessed with the idea that Jews were supporting illegal immigration as a way of fomenting “ white genocide. ” Brenton Tarrant , the Christchurch shooter , left a 74-page manifesto full of racist rants and memes about “ gorilla warfare , ” which suggested he ’ d spent a lot of time on 4Chan .
But long before the alt-right or social media , violent lone psychos justified attacks with all sorts of fringe politics , and mass shootings in the past have been blamed on rap music , video games , and The Catcher in the Rye . If you ban every category of expression that might inspire some nutcase to do something violent , you don ’ t have individual rights anymore . If any of the far-Right voices on social media were directly connected to any act of violence , they would be guilty of crimes and they would be banned from social media under the existing rules ( and probably sent to prison ) . But none of them calls for violence on any of these platforms and the evidence of a causal connection between far-Right YouTube videos and mass-shootings is tenuous . Political speech is the most important category of speech and it is the first category of speech authoritarians will seek to constrain as they consolidate power .
I say let the Nazis speak . There is no evidence that the alt-right ’ s propagandists can turn impressionable YouTube viewers into deranged mass-shooters . We have little to fear from open debate . Let the Nazis preach white separatism and white supremacy . Let them deny the Holocaust . Let everybody see how full of shit they are . Let them openly sell a product nobody wants . These ideas have been around for decades , and few people are persuaded by them . There is significant reason to believe that Twilight Sparkle will prevail over the alt-right in the marketplace of ideas .

By contrast, Bronycon, the convention for adult men who are fans of the television program My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, drew a crowd of 5,500 attendees in 2018. For every Nazi in America, there are eleven Bronies. Media outlets that fixate on the far-Right are vastly overstating the influence of these groups.

Given that the alt-right is really just a handful of angry dudes who can’t gather enough people in one place to fill a medium-sized hotel ballroom, the only decent argument that they’re a real threat revolves around the idea that they groom and radicalize mass shooters and other terrorists. Alex Fields, the Unite the Right killer, was obviously affiliated with far-Right groups. Robert Bowers, the Tree of Life synagogue shooter, was obsessed with the idea that Jews were supporting illegal immigration as a way of fomenting “white genocide.” Brenton Tarrant, the Christchurch shooter, left a 74-page manifesto full of racist rants and memes about “gorilla warfare,” which suggested he’d spent a lot of time on 4Chan.

But long before the alt-right or social media, violent lone psychos justified attacks with all sorts of fringe politics, and mass shootings in the past have been blamed on rap music, video games, and The Catcher in the Rye. If you ban every category of expression that might inspire some nutcase to do something violent, you don’t have individual rights anymore. If any of the far-Right voices on social media were directly connected to any act of violence, they would be guilty of crimes and they would be banned from social media under the existing rules (and probably sent to prison). But none of them calls for violence on any of these platforms and the evidence of a causal connection between far-Right YouTube videos and mass-shootings is tenuous. Political speech is the most important category of speech and it is the first category of speech authoritarians will seek to constrain as they consolidate power.

I say let the Nazis speak. There is no evidence that the alt-right’s propagandists can turn impressionable YouTube viewers into deranged mass-shooters. We have little to fear from open debate. Let the Nazis preach white separatism and white supremacy. Let them deny the Holocaust. Let everybody see how full of shit they are. Let them openly sell a product nobody wants. These ideas have been around for decades, and few people are persuaded by them. There is significant reason to believe that Twilight Sparkle will prevail over the alt-right in the marketplace of ideas.

Stodgy world of planes, trains and automobiles, meet the billionaires with “Star Trek” dreams.

Technology moguls are brimming with ideas for bringing flying robots, self-driving cars, people-moving tubes and space-traveling tourists to the sleepy realm of transportation, which hasn’t seen a major shakeup in decades.

Amazon’s Jeff Bezos wants his drones to air-drop packages to your house, Google is putting big money into driverless cars, PayPal entrepreneur Elon Musk has outlined a concept for shooting passengers through a giant “Hyperloop” and Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic would launch tourists around the Earth.

But the people who changed the way you shop, send money and search for information are finding it won’t be as easy to change the way you drive, ride and fly.

They’re confronting a transportation sector where public investments are drying up, engineers complain about crumbling roads and bridges and it’s been ages since government initiatives created the likes of the Interstate Highway System. So the billionaires are trying to adapt their shared disrupt-or-die ethos to an industry marked by an obsession with safety, heavy regulations and a fear of failure.

If they succeed, these tycoons would go down in the history books not just next to Bill Gates and Steve Jobs but also alongside Henry Ford and the Wright brothers. But their visions vary wildly in their practicality — self-driving cars could be on the road as soon as 2020, while Musk’s Hyperloop is a pie-in-the-sky proposal that may never move beyond the idea stage.

Can these big-thinking magnates fill transportation’s innovation void?

“You clearly have got companies that are in it to disrupt the space,” said Scott Belcher, president of the Intelligent Transportation Society of America, a trade group that works at the intersection of technology and transportation. “They don’t want to get dragged down by the government or by the traditional provider.”

But he warned that no single company can single-handedly transform transportation.

Here’s a look at how each of the billionaires’ ideas may fare:

1) Amazon’s drones

Bezos’s announcement Sunday that Amazon hopes to use drones to deliver smaller packages in the next “four, five years” generated a wave of both gee-whiz headlines and skepticism. The FAA has been noncommittal about Bezos’s plan, and even industry backers said the technology needs to improve before drones can deliver DVDs and dresses to people’s front doors.

( Also on POLITICO: Obstacles to Amazon drones)

But Bezos was clearly reveling in the space-age nature of his plan when he revealed it to Charlie Rose on “60 Minutes.”

“I know this looks like science fiction,” he said. “It’s not.”

Deploying the drones would create a major challenge to UPS, FedEx, the Postal Service and other dominant “last-mile” shippers.

Amazon seems to know it will have to persuade the FAA to change its regulatory roadmap, which for now doesn’t include allowing the pilot-less autonomous drones that Bezos’s ideas depend on. The FAA confirmed to POLITICO that Bezos had reached out to safety regulators before Sunday’s announcement, and it’s unlikely Amazon will remain quiet.

How likely? It’ll happen, but Bezos will need cooperation from the FAA and local governments to meet an ambitious timeline.

2) Musk’s Hyperloop

Frustration with the delays and high costs plaguing California’s $68 billion high-speed rail project led Musk to seek an alternative.

“How could it be that the home of Silicon Valley and JPL — doing incredible things like indexing all the world’s knowledge and putting rovers on Mars — would build a bullet train that is both one of the most expensive per mile and one of the slowest in the world?” Musk wrote in a blog post introducing his idea in August.

`` I do n't think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies judge to be 100 % true , '' Zuckerberg said during a nearly 40-minute speech at Georgetown University .
The remarks highlight the social network 's controversial approach to political speech as it tries to strike a balance between free speech and combating misinformation during elections . They could also escalate tensions between Facebook and politicians as the 2020 campaign season heats up . Democrats and civil rights groups swiftly criticized Zuckerberg 's speech , arguing that the company has n't learned from its past mistakes .
Zuckerberg said providing people a voice and including everyone are central to everything he creates , comments that come as he fends off criticism that his company wields too much power over social and political discourse . He championed the role of technology platforms , saying they had `` decentralized '' power .
`` People no longer have to rely on traditional gatekeepers , '' Zuckerberg said . `` I actually believe that the much bigger story is how much these platforms have decentralized power by putting it directly into people 's hands . ''
He also pushed back against the idea of banning political ads , arguing that this would favor incumbents and whoever the media chooses to cover . But it 's an idea the company has considered , Zuckerberg said .
Facebook has faced mounting pressure to do more to combat misinformation , hate speech and other offensive content on the world 's largest social network , which has 2.5 billion users . The company also faces allegations that it censors conservative speech . Facebook has repeatedly denied that charge .
I do n't think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies judge to be 100 percent true . Mark Zuckerberg
Over the last month , the company 's hands-off approach to political speech has sparked more outrage . In particular , Democrats have lambasted a policy that allows politicians to post false information in ads on the social network .
Earlier this month , Facebook rejected a request from Joe Biden 's presidential campaign to pull down an ad from President Donald Trump 's re-election campaign that contained misinformation about the former vice president . In response , presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren , a US Democratic senator from Massachusetts , ran an ad containing the deliberately false claim that Zuckerberg endorsed Trump . She did it to prove a point about the social network 's policy , and the ad noted that it included misinformation .
Zuckerberg said Facebook 's policy is n't designed to benefit politicians but `` because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying . '' In a Q & A after the speech , Zuckerberg said he does n't think that allowing politicians to lie in ads is `` pro-conservative . ''
Bill Russo , a spokesman for Biden 's presidential campaign , said in a statement that Facebook is allowing politicians to target Americans with `` disproven lies and conspiracy theories . ''
`` Zuckerberg attempted to use the Constitution as a shield for his company 's bottom line , and his choice to cloak Facebook 's policy in a feigned concern for free expression demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little it has learned over the past few years , '' Russo said .
Civil rights group Color of Change said Zuckerberg is `` doubling down on a business model '' that harms democracy .
`` Under the guise of protecting voice and free expression , Facebook , as in prior elections , is giving Trump and the right-wing a free pass to spread lies , hate and misinformation on the platform , '' Color of Change President Rashad Robinson said in a statement .
Zuckerberg has been talking to conservatives about their concerns regarding bias . He 's had a quiet series of dinners with aggrieved conservatives to hear their complaints . In September , he also visited Trump and lawmakers from both parties during a rare visit to Washington , DC . On Friday , Zuckerberg is scheduled to appear on Fox News for the first time .
But with the 2020 US presidential election just around the corner , lawmakers are more worried about the spread of misinformation on social media . One big concern : `` deepfake '' videos that use AI to make it appear like a person is uttering words they are n't .
`` I think figuring out which types of deepfakes are actually a threat today , versus are a theoretical future threat once the technology advances , is one of the things that we need to make sure we get right , '' Zuckerberg said in an interview with The Washington Post .
Earlier this year , Facebook faced criticism for keeping up a manipulated video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that made the Democrat seem like she was slurring her words . Facebook does n't ban misinformation but will show it lower in users ' news feeds if fact-checkers rate the information as false .
Zuckerberg 's speech touched on a wide range of topics , including calls to break up Facebook and the company 's previous efforts to enter China . Zuckerberg reiterated Facebook 's position that breaking off Instagram and WhatsApp from the company would n't solve woes around privacy and other issues . He said the social network could n't strike an agreement with China , but the silver lining is that the company has more freedom to fight for free expression .
During the speech , Zuckerberg referenced the Rev . Martin Luther King Jr. , the Vietnam War and movements such as # BlackLivesMatter and # MeToo . That did n't sit well with some civil rights activists .
King 's daughter , the Rev . Bernice King , said in a tweet that she wants Facebook to better understand the challenges her father faced from political disinformation campaigns .
`` These campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination , '' she tweeted .

On Thursday , the commission , whose deliberations were briefly delayed by a security concern , passed the widely expected decision on a 3–2 vote . Though the decision is a major setback for technology companies , consumer groups , and Democrats who lobbied aggressively against deregulation , it was all but a foregone conclusion .

Thousands watched Thursday 's meeting online via multiple livestreams , which were interrupted when Pai , halfway through his remarks on net neutrality , ordered a recess `` on advice of security . '' The chamber was cleared and police then brought in dogs to check the room for potential threats . People were let back into the room after about a 10-minute break .
The repeal of net neutrality has long been a heated political issue . It is a sweeping win for Republicans , who promised to roll back the efforts of the Obama administration , but it has proven highly unpopular among consumers . A recent survey showed that 83 % of Americans opposed the plan for deregulation .
The telecommunications industry was largely in favor of net neutrality 's repeal , saying the rules have handcuffed private internet providers to innovate on services and build out networks , particularly in rural America . But it 's been loudly criticized by multiple technology companies and consumer advocacy groups , who say net neutrality is essential for an open and competitive internet . A repeal , supporters of net neutrality say , would take away the level playing field of the internet and favor the bigger players online , harming smaller actors who wanted to get into the field and ultimately hurting consumers . In July , companies like Netflix , Twitter , and Reddit participated in a net neutrality Day of Action , embedding messages of support for net neutrality into their websites and apps .
This week , however , few tech companies participated in visible displays of opposition to a rollback of net neutrality rules . While Reddit , Etsy , and Kickstarter continued their protests online , tech 's biggest companies , like Facebook and Google , were noticeably silent . `` We ’ re disappointed in the FCC ’ s decision to gut the net neutrality protections that ushered in an unprecedented era of innovation , creativity and civic engagement , '' a Netflix spokesperson said in a statement . `` Today 's decision is the beginning of a longer legal battle . Netflix will stand with innovators , large and small , to oppose this misguided FCC order . ''
`` The FCC just gave Big Telecom an early Christmas present ''
`` We remain committed to the net neutrality policies that enjoy overwhelming public support , have been approved by the courts , and are working well for every part of the internet economy , '' a Google spokesperson said . `` We will work with other net neutrality supporters large and small to promote strong , enforceable protections . ''
Within hours of the vote , Twitter , Reddit , Etsy , Facebook and Airbnb also publicly slammed the FCC 's decision .
Though the vote was a landmark decision , it will be a few months before the deregulation goes into effect . And in the meantime , Democrats and consumer advocacy groups will likely file lawsuits to try and hinder that process . `` Why are we witnessing such an unprecedented groundswell of public support , for keeping the 2015 net neutrality protections in place ? '' asked Clyburn , an Obama-nominated FCC commissioner , in prepared remarks during the meeting . `` Because the public can plainly see , that a soon-to-be-toothless FCC , is handing the keys to the internet — the internet , one of the most remarkable , empowering , enabling inventions of our lifetime — over to a handful of multibillion-dollar corporations . ''","Alex Edelman / AFP / Getty Images A woman protests the repeal of net neutrality outside the Federal Communications Commission headquarters in Washington, DC, on Dec. 13.

A repeal, supporters of net neutrality say, would take away the level playing field of the internet and favor the bigger players online, harming smaller actors who wanted to get into the field and ultimately hurting consumers. In July, companies like Netflix, Twitter, and Reddit participated in a net neutrality Day of Action, embedding messages of support for net neutrality into their websites and apps.

FCC's #NetNeutrality hearing is being received well

This week, however, few tech companies participated in visible displays of opposition to a rollback of net neutrality rules. While Reddit, Etsy, and Kickstarter continued their protests online, tech's biggest companies, like Facebook and Google, were noticeably silent. ""We’re disappointed in the FCC’s decision to gut the net neutrality protections that ushered in an unprecedented era of innovation, creativity and civic engagement,"" a Netflix spokesperson said in a statement. ""Today's decision is the beginning of a longer legal battle. Netflix will stand with innovators, large and small, to oppose this misguided FCC order.""



""The FCC just gave Big Telecom an early Christmas present""

""We remain committed to the net neutrality policies that enjoy overwhelming public support, have been approved by the courts, and are working well for every part of the internet economy,"" a Google spokesperson said. ""We will work with other net neutrality supporters large and small to promote strong, enforceable protections.""

Within hours of the vote, Twitter, Reddit, Etsy, Facebook and Airbnb also publicly slammed the FCC's decision.

Though the vote was a landmark decision, it will be a few months before the deregulation goes into effect. And in the meantime, Democrats and consumer advocacy groups will likely file lawsuits to try and hinder that process. ""Why are we witnessing such an unprecedented groundswell of public support, for keeping the 2015 net neutrality protections in place?"" asked Clyburn, an Obama-nominated FCC commissioner, in prepared remarks during the meeting. ""Because the public can plainly see, that a soon-to-be-toothless FCC, is handing the keys to the internet — the internet, one of the most remarkable, empowering, enabling inventions of our lifetime — over to a handful of multibillion-dollar corporations.""",www.buzzfeed.com,left,BNVwDUgB3wmn9PYr

technology,CBS News,0,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-bans-deepfake-videos-with-exceptions/,"Facebook bans ""deepfake"" videos, with exceptions",,"Graham Kates, Privacy Issues","Facebook announced late Monday that it is banning certain types of so-called `` deepfakes '' — videos altered to appear as though people are doing or saying something they did n't actually do or say .
The policy marks the social media giant 's first foray into regulating deepfakes , but it comes with caveats . Facebook Vice President Monika Bickert wrote in a blog post Tuesday that the ban wo n't apply to `` parody or satire , or video that has been edited solely to omit or change the order of words . ''
Facebook 's moderators will remove videos edited through artificial intelligence or machine learning `` in ways that are n't apparent to an average person and would likely mislead '' viewers . Bickert did not describe how the company would assess an average person 's understanding of altered videos .
The new policy swiftly drew criticism that it would n't have barred perhaps the most well-known recent example of an altered video to go viral . In May , a video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi edited to make it seem as though she were slurring her words while speaking at a public event was viewed millions of times .
Call it what you want—deepfake or cheapfake—it ’ s still disinformation and @ Facebook needs to do more to stop it from spreading . Last year , I pressed Mark Zuckerberg on his lack of a plan to combat deepfakes & his refusal to remove a deceptively edited video of @ SpeakerPelosi . https : //t.co/NQkWnqoJ8T pic.twitter.com/euTLisKhNM — Rep. Jennifer Wexton ( @ RepWexton ) January 7 , 2020
But even if that video had ultimately been barred , the speed at which it spread means the company will struggle to regulate such videos in the future , said Jason Kint , the CEO of Digital Content Next , a trade group that represents digital publishers .
`` We 're entirely at risk here in letting Facebook turn this into a censorship debate while ignoring the fact these videos only receive their velocity and reach due to Facebook 's algorithm and recommendations not because they 're simply allowed to exist , '' Kint said . `` There is a lot of garbage on the Internet . The Pelosi video would be a tree in an empty forest if not for Facebook 's algorithms which are also the source of Facebook 's immense profits . ''
Kint also criticized the timing of Facebook 's announcement , noting that Bickert is scheduled to appear before a House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Wednesday .
`` I wish Facebook would proactively push out new policies in order to improve their product for the public , not just 48 hours before hearings or ( when ) press reports on them , '' Kint said .
Kint 's concern about the speed with which viral videos moves was echoed by Saniat Sohrawardi , a Rochester Institute of Technology researcher who studies deepfakes and methods used to identify them . Sohrawardi said it 's a process that ca n't yet be effectively automated , meaning it 's up to humans to identify suspicious videos from among the millions posted to Facebook
`` There are n't any very reliable ways to detect the fakes yet , at least none published that would be good for open-world detection , '' Sohrawardi said .
And when that technology is created , the fight against deepfakes will have only just begun , he said .
`` If we create a good enough detector and it gets popular enough that everybody knows about it , including the attackers , they will theoretically be able to create better fakes using that machine learning , '' said Sohrawardi .","Facebook announced late Monday that it is banning certain types of so-called ""deepfakes"" — videos altered to appear as though people are doing or saying something they didn't actually do or say.

""I wish Facebook would proactively push out new policies in order to improve their product for the public, not just 48 hours before hearings or (when) press reports on them,"" Kint said.

Kint's concern about the speed with which viral videos moves was echoed by Saniat Sohrawardi, a Rochester Institute of Technology researcher who studies deepfakes and methods used to identify them. Sohrawardi said it's a process that can't yet be effectively automated, meaning it's up to humans to identify suspicious videos from among the millions posted to Facebook

""There aren't any very reliable ways to detect the fakes yet, at least none published that would be good for open-world detection,"" Sohrawardi said.

And when that technology is created, the fight against deepfakes will have only just begun, he said.

""If we create a good enough detector and it gets popular enough that everybody knows about it, including the attackers, they will theoretically be able to create better fakes using that machine learning,"" said Sohrawardi.",www.cbsnews.com,left,wOj7GTKdq3JOoPeT
technology,Guest Writer - Left,0,https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c,Here’s how we can break up Big Tech,2019-10-11,Team Warren,"Twenty-five years ago , Facebook , Google , and Amazon didn ’ t exist . Now they are among the most valuable and well-known companies in the world . It ’ s a great story — but also one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies and promote competitive markets .
In the 1990s , Microsoft — the tech giant of its time — was trying to parlay its dominance in computer operating systems into dominance in the new area of web browsing . The federal government sued Microsoft for violating anti-monopoly laws and eventually reached a settlement . The government ’ s antitrust case against Microsoft helped clear a path for Internet companies like Google and Facebook to emerge .
The story demonstrates why promoting competition is so important : it allows new , groundbreaking companies to grow and thrive — which pushes everyone in the marketplace to offer better products and services . Aren ’ t we all glad that now we have the option of using Google instead of being stuck with Bing ?
Today ’ s big tech companies have too much power — too much power over our economy , our society , and our democracy . They ’ ve bulldozed competition , used our private information for profit , and tilted the playing field against everyone else . And in the process , they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation .
I want a government that makes sure everybody — even the biggest and most powerful companies in America — plays by the rules . And I want to make sure that the next generation of great American tech companies can flourish . To do that , we need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor .
That ’ s why my administration will make big , structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition — including breaking up Amazon , Facebook , and Google .
How the new tech monopolies hurt small businesses and innovation
America ’ s big tech companies provide valuable products but also wield enormous power over our digital lives . Nearly half of all e-commerce goes through Amazon . More than 70 % of all Internet referral traffic goes through sites owned or operated by Google or Facebook .
As these companies have grown larger and more powerful , they have used their resources and control over the way we use the Internet to squash small businesses and innovation , and substitute their own financial interests for the broader interests of the American people . To restore the balance of power in our democracy , to promote competition , and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last , it ’ s time to break up our biggest tech companies .
America ’ s big tech companies have achieved their level of dominance in part based on two strategies :
Using Mergers to Limit Competition . Facebook has purchased potential competitors Instagram and WhatsApp . Amazon has used its immense market power to force smaller competitors like Diapers.com to sell at a discounted rate . Google has snapped up the mapping company Waze and the ad company DoubleClick . Rather than blocking these transactions for their negative long-term effects on competition and innovation , government regulators have waved them through .

Google has snapped up the mapping company Waze and the ad company DoubleClick . Rather than blocking these transactions for their negative long-term effects on competition and innovation , government regulators have waved them through . Using Proprietary Marketplaces to Limit Competition . Many big tech companies own a marketplace — where buyers and sellers transact — while also participating on the marketplace . This can create a conflict of interest that undermines competition . Amazon crushes small companies by copying the goods they sell on the Amazon Marketplace and then selling its own branded version . Google allegedly snuffed out a competing small search engine by demoting its content on its search algorithm , and it has favored its own restaurant ratings over those of Yelp .
Weak antitrust enforcement has led to a dramatic reduction in competition and innovation in the tech sector . Venture capitalists are now hesitant to fund new startups to compete with these big tech companies because it ’ s so easy for the big companies to either snap up growing competitors or drive them out of business . The number of tech startups has slumped , there are fewer high-growth young firms typical of the tech industry , and first financing rounds for tech startups have declined 22 % since 2012 .
With fewer competitors entering the market , the big tech companies do not have to compete as aggressively in key areas like protecting our privacy . And some of these companies have grown so powerful that they can bully cities and states into showering them with massive taxpayer handouts in exchange for doing business , and can act — in the words of Mark Zuckerberg — “ more like a government than a traditional company . ”
We must ensure that today ’ s tech giants do not crowd out potential competitors , smother the next generation of great tech companies , and wield so much power that they can undermine our democracy .
America has a long tradition of breaking up companies when they have become too big and dominant — even if they are generally providing good service at a reasonable price .
A century ago , in the Gilded Age , waves of mergers led to the creation of some of the biggest companies in American history — from Standard Oil and JPMorgan to the railroads and AT & T . In response to the rise of these “ trusts , ” Republican and Democratic reformers pushed for antitrust laws to break up these conglomerations of power to ensure competition .
But where the value of the company came from its network , reformers recognized that ownership of a network and participating on the network caused a conflict of interest . Instead of nationalizing these industries — as other countries did — Americans in the Progressive Era decided to ensure that these networks would not abuse their power by charging higher prices , offering worse quality , reducing innovation , and favoring some over others . We required a structural separation between the network and other businesses , and also demanded that the network offer fair and non-discriminatory service .
In this tradition , my administration would restore competition to the tech sector by taking two major steps :
First , by passing legislation that requires large tech platforms to be designated as “ Platform Utilities ” and broken apart from any participant on that platform .
Companies with an annual global revenue of $ 25 billion or more and that offer to the public an online marketplace , an exchange , or a platform for connecting third parties would be designated as “ platform utilities . ”
These companies would be prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform . Platform utilities would be required to meet a standard of fair , reasonable , and nondiscriminatory dealing with users . Platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties .
For smaller companies ( those with annual global revenue of between $ 90 million and $ 25 billion ) , their platform utilities would be required to meet the same standard of fair , reasonable , and nondiscriminatory dealing with users , but would not be required to structurally separate from any participant on the platform .
To enforce these new requirements , federal regulators , State Attorneys General , or injured private parties would have the right to sue a platform utility to enjoin any conduct that violates these requirements , to disgorge any ill-gotten gains , and to be paid for losses and damages . A company found to violate these requirements would also have to pay a fine of 5 percent of annual revenue .
Amazon Marketplace , Google ’ s ad exchange , and Google Search would be platform utilities under this law . Therefore , Amazon Marketplace and Basics , and Google ’ s ad exchange and businesses on the exchange would be split apart . Google Search would have to be spun off as well .
Second , my administration would appoint regulators committed to reversing illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers .
Current antitrust laws empower federal regulators to break up mergers that reduce competition . I will appoint regulators who are committed to using existing tools to unwind anti-competitive mergers , including :
Unwinding these mergers will promote healthy competition in the market — which will put pressure on big tech companies to be more responsive to user concerns , including about privacy .
So what would the Internet look like after all these reforms ?
Here ’ s what won ’ t change : You ’ ll still be able to go on Google and search like you do today . You ’ ll still be able to go on Amazon and find 30 different coffee machines that you can get delivered to your house in two days . You ’ ll still be able to go on Facebook and see how your old friend from school is doing .
Here ’ s what will change : Small businesses would have a fair shot to sell their products on Amazon without the fear of Amazon pushing them out of business . Google couldn ’ t smother competitors by demoting their products on Google Search . Facebook would face real pressure from Instagram and WhatsApp to improve the user experience and protect our privacy . Tech entrepreneurs would have a fighting chance to compete against the tech giants .
Of course , my proposals today won ’ t solve every problem we have with our big tech companies .
We must give people more control over how their personal information is collected , shared , and sold — and do it in a way that doesn ’ t lock in massive competitive advantages for the companies that already have a ton of our data .
We must help America ’ s content creators — from local newspapers and national magazines to comedians and musicians — keep more of the value their content generates , rather than seeing it scooped up by companies like Google and Facebook .
And we must ensure that Russia — or any other foreign power — can ’ t use Facebook or any other form of social media to influence our elections .
Those are each tough problems , but the benefit of taking these steps to promote competition is that it allows us to make some progress on each of these important issues too . More competition means more options for consumers and content creators , and more pressure on companies like Facebook to address the glaring problems with their businesses .
Healthy competition can solve a lot of problems . The steps I ’ m proposing today will allow existing big tech companies to keep offering customer-friendly services , while promoting competition , stimulating innovation in the tech sector , and ensuring that America continues to lead the world in producing cutting-edge tech companies . It ’ s how we protect the future of the Internet .
We can get this done . We can make big , structural change . But it ’ s going to take a grassroots movement , and it starts right now .

Protecting the future of the internet

Tech entrepreneurs would have a fighting chance to compete against the tech giants.

Of course, my proposals today won’t solve every problem we have with our big tech companies.

We must give people more control over how their personal information is collected, shared, and sold — and do it in a way that doesn’t lock in massive competitive advantages for the companies that already have a ton of our data.

The fight for the soul of the Internet took a major turn Wednesday, as Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler's aggressive plan to keep the Internet open and neutral encountered enthusiastic support and threats of legal challenges.

After Wheeler outlined his plan to apply decades-old rules to label Internet service providers as public utilities, broadband Internet providers and their supporters quickly labeled it as unnecessary regulation that would stifle innovation. They vowed to thwart the plan via lawsuits and other tactics.

His backers — a diverse group ranging from Netflix and Google to an array of consumer groups — expressed their staunch approval in e-mails, comments and posts on Facebook and Twitter, reflecting the passion that net neutrality stirs among many.

First , a wave of new regulations may soon hit social media and the Internet . Second , the folks elected to write these regulations know fairly little about social media and the Internet .
Problems of that sort are endemic to the regulatory state . Relatively few of our regulations were written with a deep understanding of the industries they upended . Because the public knows even less about most industries than does Congress , however , most regulatory harm goes unnoticed .
Not so with social media . Mess with that industry , and people will notice .
The people pushing hardest for Congress to create that regulatory mess will soon complain most bitterly about the mess Congress creates . The case for increased regulation is hitting the Internet giants from two sides : for censoring too much innocuous speech , and for filtering out too few dangerous foreign bots .

First, a wave of new regulations may soon hit social media and the Internet. Second, the folks elected to write these regulations know fairly little about social media and the Internet.

Problems of that sort are endemic to the regulatory state. Relatively few of our regulations were written with a deep understanding of the industries they upended. Because the public knows even less about most industries than does Congress, however, most regulatory harm goes unnoticed.

Not so with social media. Mess with that industry, and people will notice.

The people pushing hardest for Congress to create that regulatory mess will soon complain most bitterly about the mess Congress creates. The case for increased regulation is hitting the Internet giants from two sides: for censoring too much innocuous speech, and for filtering out too few dangerous foreign bots. America is clamoring for regulations that stop censoring, improve filtering, and leave the basic user experience intact.

D**n the contradictions — full speed ahead!

Yet there is an elegant way out. As is often the case, the key lies not in greater regulation, but in appreciating the trouble that existing regulations have caused. In this case, the culprit is the safe harbor provision of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996.

That provision arose to address a very specific problem. In the early days of the Internet, most websites allowing third parties to post content were basically bulletin boards — anyone with a message and a thumbtack could post information. When people posted pornography, some of the websites’ owners pulled it down.

Because no good deed goes unpunished, those laudable efforts created a legal problem. Pruning objectionable content is a form of editing. Lawsuits arose claiming that Web sites whose owners exercised any control over content were editors or publishers — and thus liable for content that they allowed through.

Enter Washington, D.C. Proclaiming ""the Internet and other interactive computer services offer a forum for a true diversity of political discourse, unique opportunities for cultural development, and myriad avenues for intellectual activity,"" Congressional regulators created the CDA, an explicit policy ""to encourage the development of technologies which maximize user control over what information is received by individuals, families, and schools who use the Internet.""

The CDA thus created a generous exemption to longstanding general principles of law: ""No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.""

It’s unclear that Congress understood just how generous that exemption was. Over past 20-plus years, the Courts have acted as if Congress had announced that Internet sites that allowed third parties to post content were immune from all liability. Period.

Though that broad exemption allowed Internet companies to develop popular sites and powerful tools for weeding out objectionable content, its downside is becoming clear: Anyone who qualifies as ""an interactive computer service"" may edit or publish freed from the liabilities that typically restrain editorial abuse. It’s no surprise that the editing has become abusive.

In the offline world, companies providing information must decide whether they’re community bulletin boards or newspapers. That decision determines the actions they take, the rights they reserve, and the obligations and liabilities they assume. In the online world, companies need never make such a choice; they can claim to be bulletin boards while acting like editors.

Some immediate consequences? Fake news, viewpoint discrimination masquerading as balance, susceptibility to foreign interference, widespread public confusion, protection for those abetting sex trafficking, and (as Zuckerberg’s testimony made clear) idiosyncratic definitions of ""hate speech.""

The failure to choose is creating a public backlash. Google, Facebook, and other Internet giants provide far too much editorial oversight to qualify as bulletin boards, but far too little to qualify as responsible journalism. How do they see themselves? The time has come for them to choose. More importantly, the time has come to revisit the CDA’s safe harbor. Ideas that made sense given the Internet of 1996 do not necessarily make sense today.

The safe harbor is reaching its breaking point. No one should be exempt from choice. Internet journalism should be subject to the same constraints as off-line journalism.

And Internet sites who hold themselves out as bulletin boards should not be allowed to exercise editorial authority. There are plenty of ways to divorce content posting from content streaming. The law should force companies to choose whether they provide an open forum, a moderated service, or both — and treat them accordingly.

Life on the Internet should not be an exemption from responsibility.

We don’t need new regulations to promote responsible behavior.

We just need to rethink an old one.

The encrypted message from the number used by Mohammed bin Salman is believed to have included a malicious file that infiltrated the phone of the world ’ s richest man , according to the results of a digital forensic analysis .
This analysis found it “ highly probable ” that the intrusion into the phone was triggered by an infected video file sent from the account of the Saudi heir to Bezos , the owner of the Washington Post .

The extraordinary revelation that the future king of Saudi Arabia may have had a personal involvement in the targeting of the American founder of Amazon will send shockwaves from Wall Street to Silicon Valley .
It could also undermine efforts by “ MBS ” – as the crown prince is known – to lure more western investors to Saudi Arabia , where he has vowed to economically transform the kingdom even as he has overseen a crackdown on his critics and rivals .
The disclosure is likely to raise difficult questions for the kingdom about the circumstances around how US tabloid the National Enquirer came to publish intimate details about Bezos ’ s private life – including text messages – nine months later .

The settlement , which still needs Justice Department approval , shows that Facebook is finally getting a well-deserved punishment for abusing the privacy of those who use the service .
The Journal reported that the FTC hit Facebook with the $ 5 billion fine for violating a 2011 agreement that required the social media giant to notify users when Facebook was going to allow third parties to snoop through their personal information . The fine is a recognition that Facebook has not learned its lesson .

At President Trump ’ s social media summit at the White House Thursday , which I attended , House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif. , reminded us how the big tech companies work : “ You ’ re not buying a product , you are the product , ” he said .
The FTC began investigating Facebook after the social media company admitted that the British data firm Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed personal information of as many as 87 million Facebook users . Cambridge Analytica then used the information to build targeting databases and profit from them .

Sen. Marsha Blackburn , R-Tenn. , announced upcoming hearings and a Big Tech Task Force run by the Senate Judiciary Committee that will focus on privacy issues , data security , antitrust concerns , competition and censorship .
Blackburn joined the president in response to my question asking if he would use federal agencies to investigate abuses by the tech firms . The president said that was one of the things his administration is pursuing .
The leaders of the small group of technology companies that now control the majority of information and advertising in our country – and have an incredible view into our private lives – could not have expected to wield this much power .
Keep in mind that Google was not launched until 1998 , Facebook did not begin operations until 2004 , and Twitter didn ’ t begin until 2006 .
These companies started as small ventures , leaving their founders unprepared for their rapid growth and financial success . They are now outmatched by the capabilities of their technology . But that is no excuse for their repeated and systematic use of this power for malign purposes .
Now we must find a way to rein in the social media giants that does not offend our free market capitalist system . That does not mean we can ’ t use government intervention , but it does mean that turning to government should be a last resort .
What is called for now are investigations by Congress and the requisite federal agencies into the practices of the tech companies that violate either existing laws and regulations or that simply do not conform to what Rep. Dan Crenshaw , R-Texas , called “ the spirit of the First Amendment ” when he spoke at the social media summit .
These private firms are not bound by the First Amendment of our Constitution , which prohibits government restrictions on our freedom of speech .
But Crenshaw talked about the idea that all Americans should respect the spirit of free speech and work to ensure that they do not censor people without a very good reason .
Right now , the social media companies are rapidly moving in the direction of limiting many types of speech that simply offend some people . This is exactly the opposite of what the First Amendment does when it protects offensive speech . Inoffensive speech hardly needs protection .
The tech firms say they control and limit free speech to “ protect the health of public conversation. ” But how can you ever manage to account for all the potential ways that free speech will offend others – especially in light of the ongoing indoctrination on college campuses teaching Grievance Mongering 101 ?
It seems that virtually any comment can now be labeled a microaggression , a triggering event or hate speech by the snowflake generation .
In one example of this anti-free speech hysteria that sounds like a joke – but is true – Simmons University in Boston warned that telling another student “ God bless you ” after a sneeze can be a a microaggression , and so can wishing someone “ Merry Christmas. ” The university also warns of six other “ anti-oppression ” categories : “ anti-racism , ” “ anti-transmisia , ” “ anti-ableism , ” “ anti-Islamomisia , ” “ anti-sanism ” and “ anti-queermisia . ”
When social media companies adopt this kind of hypersensitivity – based on the left-wing sensibilities of Silicon Valley – conservatives tend to suffer by having their views labeled as unacceptable .
This type of viewpoint discrimination infects the pathways of our public discourse right now .
Facebook apparently paid the price this time , but there will be other incidents of misconduct . The tech firms either fail to grasp that their days of blithely mining their customers ’ private lives for gold in the form of personal information are over . And their free run deciding what content and ideas are worthy and which will be suppressed has ended .
Unfortunately , the tech giants have not adapted to this new paradigm , and that means even more pressure must be applied .
Ideally , a consortium of citizens , academics , think tanks , advocacy organizations and government should play a major role in protecting free speech .
Hopefully , an investigation will goad the social media companies into action . But if not , government action will be required .
Our ability to freely exchange ideas is the most precious commodity we have and we must fight with all available resources to regain control of our information space .","According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the Federal Trade Commission has approved a settlement under which Facebook will pay a record $5 billion fine for violating an FTC order regarding its privacy practices.

Right now, the social media companies are rapidly moving in the direction of limiting many types of speech that simply offend some people. This is exactly the opposite of what the First Amendment does when it protects offensive speech. Inoffensive speech hardly needs protection.

The tech firms say they control and limit free speech to “protect the health of public conversation.” But how can you ever manage to account for all the potential ways that free speech will offend others – especially in light of the ongoing indoctrination on college campuses teaching Grievance Mongering 101?

It seems that virtually any comment can now be labeled a microaggression, a triggering event or hate speech by the snowflake generation.

In one example of this anti-free speech hysteria that sounds like a joke – but is true – Simmons University in Boston warned that telling another student “God bless you” after a sneeze can be a a microaggression, and so can wishing someone “Merry Christmas.” The university also warns of six other “anti-oppression” categories: “anti-racism,” “anti-transmisia,” “anti-ableism,” “anti-Islamomisia,” “anti-sanism” and “anti-queermisia.”

When social media companies adopt this kind of hypersensitivity – based on the left-wing sensibilities of Silicon Valley – conservatives tend to suffer by having their views labeled as unacceptable.

This type of viewpoint discrimination infects the pathways of our public discourse right now.

Facebook apparently paid the price this time, but there will be other incidents of misconduct. The tech firms either fail to grasp that their days of blithely mining their customers’ private lives for gold in the form of personal information are over. And their free run deciding what content and ideas are worthy and which will be suppressed has ended.

Unfortunately, the tech giants have not adapted to this new paradigm, and that means even more pressure must be applied.

Ideally, a consortium of citizens, academics, think tanks, advocacy organizations and government should play a major role in protecting free speech.

Hopefully, an investigation will goad the social media companies into action. But if not, government action will be required.

Our ability to freely exchange ideas is the most precious commodity we have and we must fight with all available resources to regain control of our information space.

Whatever you think of Hawley, one thing is for sure: He wants to make a name for himself in Washington, and he’s going through Big Tech to do it. This FTC proposal is another iteration of that.

Hawley’s proposal, briefly explained

Hawley’s plan for the FTC, which you can read in full here, contains multiple planks that add up to what he describes as “multifaceted structural reform” through acts of Congress.

It would put the FTC under the DOJ for “clear and direct oversight.”

It would eliminate the FTC’s five-member structure and instead put it under a single director, who would be Senate-confirmed and serve a five-year term.

It would put the DOJ’s antitrust division in charge of reviewing mergers and acquisitions that previously might have been done by the FTC.

It would create a digital market research section within the FTC to focus on tech.

Hawley also proposes that Congress limit how much data firms are allowed to collect and how much ownership people have over their data, impose civil penalties for first-time violations, and give state attorneys general concurrent authority to enforce laws. (Hawley is the former attorney general of Missouri and launched probes into Google and Facebook from his perch there.) He is also pushing for stricter ethics requirements for FTC officials — for example, barring officials from working at large companies for a few years after their tenures.

The FTC was established in 1914 to protect consumers and promote competition in the US economy. It’s headed by five commissioners who determine its cases and rules. Commissioners have to be nominated by the president and approved by the Senate for seven-year terms, and no more than three of the commissioners can be from the same party. The FTC and DOJ currently share antitrust enforcement responsibilities. According to the watchdog group Public Citizen, three-quarters of FTC commissioners have “revolving-door conflicts” with tech companies and other industries, meaning they wind up becoming lawyers or lobbyists for corporate America once they leave the agency.

What Hawley is proposing would change a lot of this: one director instead of five, antitrust under a single government umbrella, stricter ethics considerations.

The FTC has issues, but is Hawley’s plan really the fix?

Hawley is hardly the only person to chastise the FTC or wonder whether antitrust enforcement in the US has become too lax in recent decades.

For example, Rohit Chopra, a Democratic commissioner of the agency, regularly criticizes it and calls for it to do more. In his dissent from the FTC’s Facebook decision, Chopra wrote that the settlement gave Facebook “a lot to celebrate” and noted how small the amount was compared to Facebook’s overall budget. “Large incumbents can easily afford to bankroll the kind of blockbuster settlements that generate headlines,” he wrote. As CNBC notes, the current heads of both the FTC’s and the DOJ’s antitrust division have said that if they were to start over, it would probably be a good idea to put antitrust enforcement under one umbrella.

But are Hawley’s proposals the fix? With President Donald Trump in the White House, if Hawley’s proposals were to be enacted (which is highly unlikely), it would put Attorney General Bill Barr in charge of the FTC. Given the president’s consistent railing against tech companies, you can imagine where that might raise concerns about the agency, under a single director, acting out vendettas against Twitter or Facebook.

It is true that Congress and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have become increasingly vocal about Big Tech as of late.

technology,Reason,2,https://reason.com/blog/2017/11/21/ajit-pai-net-neutrality-podcast,FCC Head Ajit Pai: Killing Net Neutrality Will Set the Internet Free ,2017-11-21,"Nick Gillespie, Ian Keyser, Jim Epstein, Christian Britschgi, Cosmo Wenman, Joe Setyon, Zuri Davis","In an exclusive interview today just hours after announcing his plan to repeal `` Net Neutrality '' rules governing the actions of Internet-service providers ( ISPs ) and mobile carriers , Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) Chairman Ajit Pai has an in-your-face prediction for his critics : `` Over the coming years , we 're going to see an explosion in the kinds of connectivity and the depth of that connectivity , '' he said this afternoon . `` Ultimately that means that the human capital in the United States that 's currently on the shelf—the people who do n't have digital opportunity—will become participants in the digital economy . ''
Pai stressed that regulating the Internet under a Title II framework originally created in the 1930s had led to less investment in infrastructure and a slower rate of innovation . `` Since the dawn of the commercial internet , ISPs have been investing as much as they can in networks in order to upgrade their facilities and to compete with each other , '' he says . `` Outside of a recession we 've never seen that sort of investment go down year over year . But we did in 2015 , after these regulations were adopted . '' In a Wall Street Journal column published today , Pai says Title II was responsible for a nearly 6 percent decline in broadband network investment as ISPs saw compliance costs rise and the regulatory atmosphere become uncertain . In his interview with ███ , Pai stressed that the real losers under Net Neutrality were people living in rural areas and low-income Americans who were stuck on the bad end of `` the digital divide . ''
Proponents of Net Neutrality maintain that rules that went into effect in 2015 are the only thing standing between rapacious businesses such as Comcast , Verizon ( where Pai once worked ) , and Spectrum and an Internet choking on throttled traffic , expensive `` fast lanes , '' and completely blocked sites that displease whatever corporate entity controls the last mile of fiber into your home or business . Pai says that is bunk and noted that today 's proposed changes , which are expected to pass full FCC review in mid-December , return the Internet to the light-touch regulatory regime that governed it from the mid-1990s until 2015 .
`` It 's telling that the first investigations that the prior FCC initiated under these so-called Net Neutrality rules were involving free data offerings , '' says Pai , pointing toward actions initiated by his predecessor against `` zero-rating '' services such as T-Mobile 's Binge program , which did n't count data used to stream Netflix , Spotify , and a host of other services against a customer 's monthly data allowance . `` To me it 's just absurd to say that the government should stand in the way of consumers who want to get , and companies that want to provide , free data . ''
The FCC is not completely evacuating its oversight role . ISPs , he says , will need to be completely transparent with customers about all practices related to prioritizing traffic , data caps , and more . Pai believes that market competition for customers will prove far more effective in developing better and cheaper services than regulators deciding what is best for the sector . `` In wireless , '' he says , `` there 's very intense competition—you have four national carriers and any number of regional carriers competing to provide 4G LTE , and a number of different services . In those marketplaces where there 's not as much competition as we 'd like to see , to me at least , the solution is n't to preemptively regulate as if it were a monopoly , as if we 're dealing with 'Ma Bell , ' but to promote more competition . ''
Pai says that one of the major mistakes of Net Neutrality is its pre-emptive nature . Rather than allowing different practices to develop and then having regulators intervene when problems or harms to customer arise , Net Neutrality is prescriptive and thus likely to serve the interests of existing companies in maintaining a status quo that 's good for them . In terms of enforcement of anti-competitive practices , Pai says the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) is better equipped to deal with problems . `` The FTC can take action even in the absence of finding harm , consumer harm , '' he notes , `` so even if consumers are n't harmed , if [ FTC regulators ] deem a particular business practice , any business practice to be unfair or deceptive , they have authority under Section 5 to take action against it . So that 's a pretty powerful tool that they 've used even in the last couple of years against telecom providers and others in the internet economy whom they believe are not protecting consumers . ''
In a wide-ranging conversation ( listen below as a ███ Podcast ) , I asked Pai to lay down specific benchmarks by which consumers might judge whether repealing Net Neutrality rules is n't a mistake . He pointed to factors such as the number of fixed and mobile connections , the average costs and speeds of internet plans , and the volume of capital investment as indicators by which his policy could be held accountable .
He also stressed that the increasing shift from traditional ISPs to mobile wireless will benefit from a looser regulatory framework , including the opening up of spectrum that is either under-utilized , off-limits , or otherwise gathering dust . `` We 're entering a new era of technology known of 5G and that 's going to involve massive amounts of investment in networks and spectrum . And that 's the kind of thing that will be a big breakthrough for consumers on the wireless side . '' Referencing Benedict Evans , a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz , Pai believes that `` mobile is eating the world '' : `` All of these services are migrating to wireless , and particularly in the future , whether we 're talking about low-bandwidth applications , like monitoring yogurt trucks that drive across the countryside , or high bandwidth applications like Virtual Reality , a lot of this is going to be taking place over wireless .

Nick Gillespie : Okay . Let 's get right to it . The big fear that many net neutrality proponents have is that once you let internet service providers and wireless carriers do whatever they want , the internet is going to turn into something worse than cable TV with some content being pushed over others because the parent company owns it , Comcast and Universal , that type of thing . Other content is going to be choked off because they 're not paying enough to get best service right to the end , or it 's just going to be completely blocked . Why is that wrong ?
Ajit Pai : It 's wrong for two different reasons . First , it 's not the experience we had before these regulations were imposed in 2015 . We were not living in some digital dystopia before then when ISPs were blocking lawful content . Secondly , we require under this proposal to require ISPs to be transparent about their business practices . If they 're blocking or throttling or doing any of that , they have to disclose it . Secondly , we empower the Federal Trade Commission to take aggressive action based on its consumer protection and competition authorities to take action against cases like that . If it 's network operator preferencing its own content , that 's something the FTC can look at . If it 's other companies blocking other content .
Nick Gillespie : Would that be legal though , under these rules ? And should it be legal ?
Ajit Pai : No , exactly . We 're requiring it to be transparent and additionally to the extent that a company is unlawfully throttling traffic , the FTC can look into that . In fact , the last couple of years the FTC has done that with respect to a few wireless carriers that were allegedly throttling traffic . They said , `` This is not a lawful practice . We 're going to sanction you for it . ''
Nick Gillespie : But , would it be an unlawful practice if you get rid of net neutrality ? Because there might be , or if a carrier says , `` You know what ? Yeah , we are going to throttle traffic because we want to privilege certain other services , '' would that be lawful as long as it 's transparent ?
Ajit Pai : Again , they have to disclose it and secondly , to the extent if they 're doing something anti-competitive , and it 's very fact dependent , but the FTC has a longstanding set of principles that it uses to evaluate conduct like that and so it could well be competitive . It just depends on the facts .
Nick Gillespie : Okay . Or it could be that they 're abrogating their own self declared terms of service . If they say , `` Hey , we 're not going to throttle anything , '' you find out they 're throttling or privileging content , then they 're in trouble because of their own promises .
Ajit Pai : Correct . But there are some ways that it can be pro-competitive . For example , if they say , We will allow you to stream all of these services exempt from your data limits , '' then that 's the kind of thing that would be good for consumers . So , we do n't want to prohibit different pro-competitive offerings like that .
Nick Gillespie : To get to that point , that 's already happening under net neutrality , is n't it ? Where certain , particularly wireless carriers privilege . You can stream on T-Mobile or something , a particular set of Netflix or music services that are not subject to your monthly cap .
Ajit Pai : That is what a lot of the companies have proposed , such as T-Mobile , and it 's telling that the first investigations that the prior FCC initiated under these so called net neutrality rules were involving free data offerings . To me it 's just absurd to say that the government should stand in the way of consumers who want to get and companies that want to provide free data . That 's the kind of thing that is good for the marketplace and I do n't think we should prevent that kind of service .
Nick Gillespie : Where is the competition in internet services ? Another major complaint , and these are things that make a lot of sense on face value , most people do n't really have two equally good options , much less three or four options to pick and choose from when it comes to an ISP . You 're stuck with whatever cable company got the monopoly 30 or even 40 years ago , when local municipalities handed this stuff out . Is that wrong ? A lot of what you 're talking about is that market 's which are based on competition drive innovation and they bring Joseph Schumpeter 101 . They bring more and better services increasingly at cheaper and cheaper prices but where 's the competition in internet services ?
Ajit Pai : Two different points . Number one , it does depend upon the marketplace . For example , in wireless there 's very intense competition . You have four national carriers and any number of regional carriers . You 're competing to provide 4G LTE and a number of different services . In those marketplaces where there is not as much competition as we 'd like to see , to me at least , the solution is n't to preemptively regulate as if it were a monopoly , as if we 're dealing with Ma Bell but it 's to promote more competition . Ironically enough , these Title two regulations , squeeze the smaller companies , the smaller internet service providers that want to enter the marketplace and gain a foothold against the big guys and they have told us , a number of them , once you see the order you 'll see that they 've written us and saying , it 's very difficult for us to raise to capital . It 's almost impossible for us to get a rate of return on our investment if these regulations are in place .
Ironically enough these heavy handed regulations disproportionately hurt the smaller companies . The big incumbents will always have fleets of lawyers and accountants to deal with these regulations . It 's the smaller companies . And I 've visited some of them . Even government owned ISPs in Iowa , for instance , that have told me that this their ability to build a business .
Nick Gillespie : In a Wall Street Journal piece that ran today , you talked about how the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association , which represents small fixed ISPs essentially , or wireless companies rather , that generally operate in rural America , 80 % of their members say they incurred additional expenses in complying with the Title two or the net neutrality rules , they had to later reduce network expansion to later reduce services and had because the rules cost money to comply with . You also pointed out and you touched on this , 19 municipal wifi services and one major company stopped rolling out an out of home wifi service . Net neutrality rules have had a cost . What was the major company that said that it would n't roll an out of home wifi service ?
Ajit Pai : It goes by Spectrum in a number of markets .
Nick Gillespie : Right . Then the other thing that you talked about was that in the Wall Street Journal piece , in the two years after the FCC 's decision , after the 2015 decision , in the years after that , broadband network dropped by almost 6 % , the first time a decline has happened outside of an recession . What does that mean ?
Ajit Pai : Historically since the dawn of commercial internet , ISPs have been investing as much as they can into networks in order to upgrade their facilities and to compete with each other . What we saw , and so outside of a recession we 've never seen that kind of investment go down year over year . But we did after 2015 , once these regulations were adopted . One of things that our economic analysis finds in the order is that these Title two regulations lowered the willingness of companies to invest and that unfortunately has a very bad impact on consumers who are on the wrong side of what I call the digital divide . Rural consumers , low income urban consumers , these are the folks for whom it 's very difficult as it is for a private company to build a business case for deploying infrastructure to them . They are going to be on the front lines if these heavy handed regulations persist . That 's part of the ███ why I proposed repealing them .
Nick Gillespie : What facts or developments over the next two years or the next five years , the next 10 years , down the road would convince you that the repeal of net neutrality was a bad mistake or a failure ? Be specific . What are the benchmarks that we can hold you or the FCC to in the coming years ?
Ajit Pai : Absolutely . My top line message when it comes to regulation is that the FCC should preemptively regulate only in cases where we have a market failure . If in the context of the internet we did see a market failure , we saw ISPs all over , of all sizes , behaving in uncompetitive ways , if we saw consumer being harmed , those are the kinds of things that we would want to take account of . We certainly do n't want to see that and my prediction is that these rules will actually take us in the opposite direction from that . They 'll promote more investment and competition .
Nick Gillespie : One benchmark would be is if we see persistent lower capital investment year over year . That would be a sign . And it might not because of repeal of net neutrality but that 's a bad sign . Would it also be things like the slower speed of average connections , cost of plans , number of fixed and mobile connections , either flat lining or going down ? Are those the other types of things that we should look for ?
Ajit Pai : Those are some of the indicia that we would take into account . Similar to make sure that we do n't see widespread blocking of lawful content . That 's not something I think anybody wants to see . That 's not the internet we 've had and I do n't expect that 's the internet we will have .
Nick Gillespie : That is , and I 'm thinking of , I 'm hearing defenders of net neutrality whispering in my ear as I say this , there 's the idea that before the , the first time when net neutrality was pushed by the FCC was in 2010 but then it was various court challenges et cetera in 2015 it becomes a reality where the internet is being regulated under Title two , these old telecommunications rules from the 30s . Can we rely on the experience of the internet from the early 90s or from the telecommunications act of 1996 until 2015 ? Is that the internet that we 'll go back to ?
Ajit Pai : I believe so . We will have a free and open internet as we had before 2015 . Moreover we 're going to see it become even better going forward and the ███ is that with technological innovation we 're entering , on the wireless side for example , a new era of technology known as 5G . That 's going to require massive amounts of investment in networks and in spectrum and that 's the kind of thing that will be a big breakthrough for consumers on the wireless side .
Nick Gillespie : Do you think , are we entering an era this is one of the criticisms of net neutrality is that it was essentially partly pushed by industries or companies that have a vested interest in things the way they are now . And that includes Netflix , it includes Google , it includes to a certain degree Amazon . That they wanted to stop the internet development as it is now and that they were all about fixed connections . Are we going to be , do you think it 's likely that we 're going to be entering an era of wireless where most things are based on wireless connectivity ?
Ajit Pai : I think so . There is one particularly insightful person up in Silicon Valley who 's talked about how , as he puts it , that mobile is eating the world . How all of these services are migrating to wireless and how particularly in future whether we are talking about low bandwidth applications like wireless monitoring yogurt trucks as they drive across the countryside or high bandwidth applications like virtual reality . A lot of this is going to be taking place over wireless .
Nick Gillespie : And mobile stuff . I 'm sorry , I confuse the terminology . That the idea that …
Nick Gillespie : And that we 're going to be , we 're already , I can actually say this at ███ 's traffic , more and more it 's mobile devices as opposed to people looking at their computer at work or at home . What else has to happen for 5G ? Are there other regulatory changes that have to happen for mobile wireless to go gigantic ?
Ajit Pai : A lot of them . Number one , the FCC needs to make more spectrum available . It does n't help if you have a bottleneck in terms of spectrum . We 're aggressively moving to get as much as we can out into the commercial marketplace . Both for license , the cell carriers and the like . But also unlicensed , the next generation of wifi . The second thing is we also need to make it easier to deploy a lot of the infrastructure . The future of wireless networks are not going to be ones where you 'll see a bunch of 100 foot cell towers , instead you 'll see hundreds if not thousands of small cells , some of which you could even hold in your hand . You wo n't even notice them on the sides of buildings and the like . But to deploy those , we need to make sure that we do n't impose the same onerous regulations that we do for a big cell tower . They should n't have to go through environmental and historic preservation review , for instance . We do n't want to states and localities also imposing moratoria on these kinds of siting applications . Those are some of the things that have to happen .
Nick Gillespie : That was common early on , going back 20 , 30 , 40 years when cellphones were really becoming popular , a lot of places put limits on where cell towers could be located or how many . When you say you do n't want them to have to go through historic review committees in small towns and stuff like that , is that based on the fact that these will be unobtrusive or what is the rationale for that ?
Ajit Pai : Part of it is that they will be unobtrusive in a lot of cases . And part of it is also that we do n't want to have a patchwork where it 's not just the federal government but 50 state governments , any number of municipalities and 567 federally recognized tribes , each are trying to have a bite of the regulatory apple , so to speak . If we really want to claim leadership in the 5G future and compete against countries like China and Korea and Japan , which have a much more , they are very eager to take the lead on 5G , then we need to make sure that our regulatory framework is streamlined . Preserves the public interest but also incentivizes investment . That 's not where we are right now .
Nick Gillespie : I see this as the next battleground in fair weather federalism ? Because it sounds like you so you 're going to have a Republican Congress , I assume . Or role making apparatus that is saying , `` No , the federal government really should control all of this . '' And then you 'll have Democrats who are normally adverse to states ' rights saying , `` No , no , it 's got ta be devolved down . '' Do think that 's a likely development ?
Ajit Pai : That could always happen but to me at least , the internet is inherently at this point , broadband internet is inherently an interstates service and interstate services traditionally the touchstone for federal regulation . My hope is that we can put the politics aside and focus on exactly how these networks operate and if we do that then there 's a strong case for federal government leadership here .
Nick Gillespie : Your plan will , according to a write up in Politico , and I think this is accurate , it quote , `` will jettison rules that prohibit internet service providers from blocking or slowing web traffic or creating so called paid internet fast lanes . '' Question for you , do you think fast lanes will become a thing ? What is the value of a internet fast lane ?
Ajit Pai : The answer to the first is we 're not sure . We 've never seen them before and that 's part of the ███ why I thought the rule in particular was , that was adopted in 2015 , was very premature banning something that 's simply did n't exist . But secondly , going forward , we could see pro-competitive and anti-competitive cases for those kinds of prioritization arrangements . For example , if you want to prioritize traffic in your healthcare provider that needs to monitor patients remotely , that 's the kind of traffic that should take precedence you might think , over cat videos and the like . Conversely we do n't want to see cases in which companies are behaving anti-competitively in structuring those kinds of prioritization arrangements . You could make a case either way and that 's part of the ███ why the federal trade commission is the right agency to handle that because that 's essentially an anti-trust question . That 's something that have long experience in taking care of .
Nick Gillespie : Mentioning the FTC though , is n't it also much more limited than the FCC was under Title two ? It really does n't have the same scope of authority to regulate , it ca n't do as much , can it ?
Ajit Pai : To the contrary it actually can do even more in a lot of cases . For example , they can take action even in the absence of a finding of harm , consumer harm . Even if consumers are n't harmed , if they deem a particular business practice , any business practice to be unfair or deceptive , they have authority under section five to take action against it . That 's a pretty powerful tool that they 've used , even in the last couple of years against telecom providers and others in the internet economy who they believe are not protecting consumers .
Nick Gillespie : Are you the first commission head to actually say no I want less power ?
Ajit Pai : I have talked to some of my predecessors going all the way back to the Reagan years . This is one of the constant battles that you see over the years is that in any administration , whether it 's a Republican administration where they are taking a free market position , their tact for that . Or a Democratic administration where they take a more regulatory view . This is a constant back and forth and so I see myself as the next in line in this long tradition not to break from that tradition .
Nick Gillespie : What do you make of the fact , and part of this is due John Oliver who called his army of internet trolls to bombard the FCC website with comments during the comment period about the proposed rollback , and that 's good things . It 's a amazing that we 've had tens of million of people who are suddenly motivated to talk about arcane subject of telecommunication policy . There were over 20 million comments against ending net neutrality , from one account I read . How do you process that kind of pushback against what you 're proposing ?
Ajit Pai : There was mix of opinion in the comments and we had to take a look at all of the comments in the record that were substantive and significant and that were contributing in helping to answer some of the questions that we keyed up in our notice of proposed rule making . It was n't easy but when you see the order , you 'll find that we did try to sort through as many as we possibly could and incorporated as many as we possibly could into our decision making .
Nick Gillespie : Let me switch topics slightly . I want to ask you about a different area that has to do with free speech and free expression and the free internet . Currently in the Senate there is a bill going through called the Stop Enabling Sexual Traffickers Act or SESTA , there 's a version of it in the House as well . In the name of cracking down on human trafficking , the legislation would , in the words of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which is in favor of net neutrality but they 're against this . They say that SESTA would eviscerate the immunity from liability for user generated comment . That internet intermediaries have under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and would also amend the federal criminal sex trafficking statue to sweep in companies who may not even be aware of what their users are doing .
Section 230 is one of those defining laws of the internet where it created a safe harbor for internet service providers and sites from content posted by users and whatnot . It 's widely credited with helping the internet and world wide web especially , the web , become what we know it as . Are you worried that 230 is being undermined by SESTA and that 230 is absolutely essentially to flourishing internet ?
Ajit Pai : Here I unfortunately have to give the unsatisfactory answer that I have n't read the legislation itself . I 've read press accounts obviously about the debate and I 've been following it from afar as it 's gone through the relevant committees . I have n't had a chance to study it and think through what the implication would be . I know there were fixes , for instance , that were adopted late in the process , before it went out of the committee and I have n't had a chance to think do those ameliorate the concerns that you 're talking about . At this point I 've been focused on what we 're doing over here at the FCC that I have n't had a chance to think about it .
Nick Gillespie : More broadly though , do you think that the safe harbor that 's provided in general by 230 is a good and very important thing ?
Ajit Pai : I do think , I do remember when I was in law school in the mid 90s there was a significant debate about this and we were debating at the time , I 'm really dating myself now , should bulletin boards owners be liable for what their users post ? It seems quaint now , but it 's amazing how vibrant this debate still is because there is a sense that online platform thrives precisely because the owner of that platform is n't liable necessarily for everything that 's posted on there . I can see the argument both ways and obviously this is an important issue in terms of sex trafficking that a lot of elected officials have their eyes on . Hopefully there 's a way to thread the needle that satisfies everybody 's concerns .
Nick Gillespie : Speaking like a Michigan alum , which you are , correct ? You are tackling yourself , are n't you ? You 're not going to answer that question , definitively I get that .
Ajit Pai : I just not a Michigan alum so I did n't want to offend any Big Blue fans out there
Nick Gillespie : I 'm sorry . Are you a Michigan resident then ? Or you grew up in Michigan ?
Ajit Pai : Grew up in Kansas . Undergrad Harvard Law School , University of Chicago .
Nick Gillespie : I apologize for besmirching you with any connection to Michigan other than having flown through it on a couple of occasions .
Ajit Pai : Especially in university 'cause my in-laws are all Ohio State fans . Thanksgiving would be a little difficult if they suddenly suspected some kind of Harbaugh connection .
Nick Gillespie : I can absolutely understand that . Going forward , what are you looking for on the near horizon besides 5G that most excites you about the internet and about telecommunications more broadly ?
Ajit Pai : To me at least , it 's our efforts to close the digital divide . And I understand that things like net neutrality will occupy 99 % of the oxygen in the room but to me at least , that percentage is more properly devoted to what we are doing to build out access to people on the wrong side of that divide who do n't have access to the internet today and to promote more competition using innovative technologies . We 've talked about 5G but this FCC over the last 10 months has already approved the first ever satellite applications , sending satellites into low Earth orbit and beaming very high speed connectivity back to Earth . We 're getting more spectrum out there for fixed wireless providers to use so they can compete without having to lay fiber . And for the smaller fiber providers we 've taken a number of steps both in terms of wiser distribution of our federal subsidies and our regulatory reform to give them a fighting chance .
Whether it 's in intercity Detroit or in rural Kansas , they are going to have a chance to compete . My hope is that over the next coming years we 're going to see an explosion in the kinds of connectivity and the depth of that connectivity and ultimately that means that the human capital in the United States that is currently on the shelf , the people who do n't have digital opportunity , will be able to be participants in the digital economy instead of just spectators .
Nick Gillespie : Where do get that new spectrum space from ? Are you taking it back from broadcast or are you freeing up stuff that 's just been collecting dust ? Or squeezing out more efficiency ?
Ajit Pai : It 's a little bit of mix . Squeezing out efficiency is the name of the game in some cases where you have , for example , federal agencies using the spectrum and we 're trying to see if there are creative ways for us to share that spectrum . Additionally there is some spectrum that 's been fallow for a while and because of technological innovation we 're able to now use it potentially for wireless service . There 's also some spectrum that has been owned by incumbents that we 've sold and then given share of the proceeds to those incumbents and then transferred it to other companies that want the spectrum . It 's an all hands on deck approach when it comes to the airways .
Nick Gillespie : You were appointed chairman by Donald Trump , by President Donald Trump . You were on the commission before that as a Republican appointee . Do you feel that you 're part of what former Trump advisor Steve Bannon said was an attempt to deconstruct the administrative state ? If so , can you make a positive case for being a regulator essentially , a bureaucrat who is saying , `` You should be seeing less and less of me as time goes on . ''
Ajit Pai : To me at least , having worked in this agency for the better part of the last decade , it was very clear to me when I came into office , there were a lot of rules on the books that simply were n't appropriate for 2017 . In some cases they were holding back investment and innovation . In other cases they were on books simply as a matter of regulatory inertia . And so we had a chance to think very broadly about how do we want to promote more competition and investment across all of these industries from broadband to media ? Over the last 10 months we 've had the chance to do that and over time folks are going to see the results speak for themselves . We do want the regulations to be more market based and light touch to reflect the law a congress gave it to us not whatever policy vision we might dream up for ourselves . That 's not just a free market deregulatory view , but it 's view that 's appropriate for the marketplace and for consumers in 2017 .
Nick Gillespie : Final question , in your Wall Street Journal piece and elsewhere , and it 's not just you , people were very upset , regulators were upset as well as , well I was upset , when Barack Obama really hammered the then chair of the FCC to pass net neutrality . It 's not quite unprecedented and it 's not quite wrong , but he really got on a soapbox and said , `` You know , you guys really have to do this and you have to get it done . '' It seemed to have a direct effect . There 's no question that Obama really squeezed what 's supposed to be an independent commission . Would you push back if Donald Trump suddenly came to you and said , `` You know what ? Like I really need you to put net neutrality back or I want you to do something that you think would undermine the integrity of market based approaches and rule of law approaches to telecommunications policy . ''
Ajit Pai : I 've said from day one since I became chair that this is an independent agency , that we will make our own decisions based on the facts as we find them and the law as we see and we 'll call the shots accordingly . We 're not going to let any political considerations from any quarter dictate or pressure us into making a decision that we truly believe is not in the public interest . I do n't know about my other , the fellow commissioners , but speaking for myself , that 's the one thing that gives our decisions credence in the eyes of the American people is that we 're seen as the experts on communications issues , not as political actors that sway with the wind depending on who 's weighing in .
Nick Gillespie : I certainly look forward to seeing what happens over the , not just the next couple of weeks , but the next couple of years . Thank you so much chairman Ajit Pai of the Federal Communication Commission for talking to The ███ podcast .","In an exclusive interview today just hours after announcing his plan to repeal ""Net Neutrality"" rules governing the actions of Internet-service providers (ISPs) and mobile carriers, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai has an in-your-face prediction for his critics: ""Over the coming years, we're going to see an explosion in the kinds of connectivity and the depth of that connectivity,"" he said this afternoon. ""Ultimately that means that the human capital in the United States that's currently on the shelf—the people who don't have digital opportunity—will become participants in the digital economy.""

Pai stressed that regulating the Internet under a Title II framework originally created in the 1930s had led to less investment in infrastructure and a slower rate of innovation. ""Since the dawn of the commercial internet, ISPs have been investing as much as they can in networks in order to upgrade their facilities and to compete with each other,"" he says. ""Outside of a recession we've never seen that sort of investment go down year over year. But we did in 2015, after these regulations were adopted."" In a Wall Street Journal column published today, Pai says Title II was responsible for a nearly 6 percent decline in broadband network investment as ISPs saw compliance costs rise and the regulatory atmosphere become uncertain. In his interview with Reason, Pai stressed that the real losers under Net Neutrality were people living in rural areas and low-income Americans who were stuck on the bad end of ""the digital divide.""

Proponents of Net Neutrality maintain that rules that went into effect in 2015 are the only thing standing between rapacious businesses such as Comcast, Verizon (where Pai once worked), and Spectrum and an Internet choking on throttled traffic, expensive ""fast lanes,"" and completely blocked sites that displease whatever corporate entity controls the last mile of fiber into your home or business. Pai says that is bunk and noted that today's proposed changes, which are expected to pass full FCC review in mid-December, return the Internet to the light-touch regulatory regime that governed it from the mid-1990s until 2015.

""It's telling that the first investigations that the prior FCC initiated under these so-called Net Neutrality rules were involving free data offerings,"" says Pai, pointing toward actions initiated by his predecessor against ""zero-rating"" services such as T-Mobile's Binge program, which didn't count data used to stream Netflix, Spotify, and a host of other services against a customer's monthly data allowance. ""To me it's just absurd to say that the government should stand in the way of consumers who want to get, and companies that want to provide, free data.""

The FCC is not completely evacuating its oversight role. ISPs, he says, will need to be completely transparent with customers about all practices related to prioritizing traffic, data caps, and more. Pai believes that market competition for customers will prove far more effective in developing better and cheaper services than regulators deciding what is best for the sector. ""In wireless,"" he says, ""there's very intense competition—you have four national carriers and any number of regional carriers competing to provide 4G LTE, and a number of different services. In those marketplaces where there's not as much competition as we'd like to see, to me at least, the solution isn't to preemptively regulate as if it were a monopoly, as if we're dealing with 'Ma Bell,' but to promote more competition.""

Pai says that one of the major mistakes of Net Neutrality is its pre-emptive nature. Rather than allowing different practices to develop and then having regulators intervene when problems or harms to customer arise, Net Neutrality is prescriptive and thus likely to serve the interests of existing companies in maintaining a status quo that's good for them. In terms of enforcement of anti-competitive practices, Pai says the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is better equipped to deal with problems. ""The FTC can take action even in the absence of finding harm, consumer harm,"" he notes, ""so even if consumers aren't harmed, if [FTC regulators] deem a particular business practice, any business practice to be unfair or deceptive, they have authority under Section 5 to take action against it. So that's a pretty powerful tool that they've used even in the last couple of years against telecom providers and others in the internet economy whom they believe are not protecting consumers.""

In a wide-ranging conversation (listen below as a Reason Podcast), I asked Pai to lay down specific benchmarks by which consumers might judge whether repealing Net Neutrality rules isn't a mistake. He pointed to factors such as the number of fixed and mobile connections, the average costs and speeds of internet plans, and the volume of capital investment as indicators by which his policy could be held accountable.

He also stressed that the increasing shift from traditional ISPs to mobile wireless will benefit from a looser regulatory framework, including the opening up of spectrum that is either under-utilized, off-limits, or otherwise gathering dust. ""We're entering a new era of technology known of 5G and that's going to involve massive amounts of investment in networks and spectrum. And that's the kind of thing that will be a big breakthrough for consumers on the wireless side."" Referencing Benedict Evans, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Pai believes that ""mobile is eating the world"": ""All of these services are migrating to wireless, and particularly in the future, whether we're talking about low-bandwidth applications, like monitoring yogurt trucks that drive across the countryside, or high bandwidth applications like Virtual Reality, a lot of this is going to be taking place over wireless.""

Nick Gillespie: Okay. Let's get right to it. The big fear that many net neutrality proponents have is that once you let internet service providers and wireless carriers do whatever they want, the internet is going to turn into something worse than cable TV with some content being pushed over others because the parent company owns it, Comcast and Universal, that type of thing. Other content is going to be choked off because they're not paying enough to get best service right to the end, or it's just going to be completely blocked. Why is that wrong?

Ajit Pai: It's wrong for two different reasons. First, it's not the experience we had before these regulations were imposed in 2015. We were not living in some digital dystopia before then when ISPs were blocking lawful content. Secondly, we require under this proposal to require ISPs to be transparent about their business practices. If they're blocking or throttling or doing any of that, they have to disclose it. Secondly, we empower the Federal Trade Commission to take aggressive action based on its consumer protection and competition authorities to take action against cases like that. If it's network operator preferencing its own content, that's something the FTC can look at. If it's other companies blocking other content.

Nick Gillespie: Would that be legal though, under these rules? And should it be legal?

Ajit Pai: No, exactly. We're requiring it to be transparent and additionally to the extent that a company is unlawfully throttling traffic, the FTC can look into that. In fact, the last couple of years the FTC has done that with respect to a few wireless carriers that were allegedly throttling traffic. They said, ""This is not a lawful practice. We're going to sanction you for it.""

Nick Gillespie: But, would it be an unlawful practice if you get rid of net neutrality? Because there might be, or if a carrier says, ""You know what? Yeah, we are going to throttle traffic because we want to privilege certain other services,"" would that be lawful as long as it's transparent?

Ajit Pai: Again, they have to disclose it and secondly, to the extent if they're doing something anti-competitive, and it's very fact dependent, but the FTC has a longstanding set of principles that it uses to evaluate conduct like that and so it could well be competitive. It just depends on the facts.

Nick Gillespie: Okay. Or it could be that they're abrogating their own self declared terms of service. If they say, ""Hey, we're not going to throttle anything,"" you find out they're throttling or privileging content, then they're in trouble because of their own promises.

Ajit Pai: Correct. But there are some ways that it can be pro-competitive. For example, if they say, We will allow you to stream all of these services exempt from your data limits,"" then that's the kind of thing that would be good for consumers. So, we don't want to prohibit different pro-competitive offerings like that.

Nick Gillespie: To get to that point, that's already happening under net neutrality, isn't it? Where certain, particularly wireless carriers privilege. You can stream on T-Mobile or something, a particular set of Netflix or music services that are not subject to your monthly cap.

Ajit Pai: That is what a lot of the companies have proposed, such as T-Mobile, and it's telling that the first investigations that the prior FCC initiated under these so called net neutrality rules were involving free data offerings. To me it's just absurd to say that the government should stand in the way of consumers who want to get and companies that want to provide free data. That's the kind of thing that is good for the marketplace and I don't think we should prevent that kind of service.

Nick Gillespie: Where is the competition in internet services? Another major complaint, and these are things that make a lot of sense on face value, most people don't really have two equally good options, much less three or four options to pick and choose from when it comes to an ISP. You're stuck with whatever cable company got the monopoly 30 or even 40 years ago, when local municipalities handed this stuff out. Is that wrong? A lot of what you're talking about is that market's which are based on competition drive innovation and they bring Joseph Schumpeter 101. They bring more and better services increasingly at cheaper and cheaper prices but where's the competition in internet services?

Ajit Pai: Two different points. Number one, it does depend upon the marketplace. For example, in wireless there's very intense competition. You have four national carriers and any number of regional carriers. You're competing to provide 4G LTE and a number of different services. In those marketplaces where there is not as much competition as we'd like to see, to me at least, the solution isn't to preemptively regulate as if it were a monopoly, as if we're dealing with Ma Bell but it's to promote more competition. Ironically enough, these Title two regulations, squeeze the smaller companies, the smaller internet service providers that want to enter the marketplace and gain a foothold against the big guys and they have told us, a number of them, once you see the order you'll see that they've written us and saying, it's very difficult for us to raise to capital. It's almost impossible for us to get a rate of return on our investment if these regulations are in place.

Ironically enough these heavy handed regulations disproportionately hurt the smaller companies. The big incumbents will always have fleets of lawyers and accountants to deal with these regulations. It's the smaller companies. And I've visited some of them. Even government owned ISPs in Iowa, for instance, that have told me that this their ability to build a business.

Nick Gillespie: In a Wall Street Journal piece that ran today, you talked about how the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association, which represents small fixed ISPs essentially, or wireless companies rather, that generally operate in rural America, 80% of their members say they incurred additional expenses in complying with the Title two or the net neutrality rules, they had to later reduce network expansion to later reduce services and had because the rules cost money to comply with. You also pointed out and you touched on this, 19 municipal wifi services and one major company stopped rolling out an out of home wifi service. Net neutrality rules have had a cost. What was the major company that said that it wouldn't roll an out of home wifi service?

Ajit Pai: That was Charter.

Nick Gillespie: Okay.

Ajit Pai: It goes by Spectrum in a number of markets.

Nick Gillespie: Right. Then the other thing that you talked about was that in the Wall Street Journal piece, in the two years after the FCC's decision, after the 2015 decision, in the years after that, broadband network dropped by almost 6%, the first time a decline has happened outside of an recession. What does that mean?

Ajit Pai: Historically since the dawn of commercial internet, ISPs have been investing as much as they can into networks in order to upgrade their facilities and to compete with each other. What we saw, and so outside of a recession we've never seen that kind of investment go down year over year. But we did after 2015, once these regulations were adopted. One of things that our economic analysis finds in the order is that these Title two regulations lowered the willingness of companies to invest and that unfortunately has a very bad impact on consumers who are on the wrong side of what I call the digital divide. Rural consumers, low income urban consumers, these are the folks for whom it's very difficult as it is for a private company to build a business case for deploying infrastructure to them. They are going to be on the front lines if these heavy handed regulations persist. That's part of the reason why I proposed repealing them.

Nick Gillespie: What facts or developments over the next two years or the next five years, the next 10 years, down the road would convince you that the repeal of net neutrality was a bad mistake or a failure? Be specific. What are the benchmarks that we can hold you or the FCC to in the coming years?

Ajit Pai: Absolutely. My top line message when it comes to regulation is that the FCC should preemptively regulate only in cases where we have a market failure. If in the context of the internet we did see a market failure, we saw ISPs all over, of all sizes, behaving in uncompetitive ways, if we saw consumer being harmed, those are the kinds of things that we would want to take account of. We certainly don't want to see that and my prediction is that these rules will actually take us in the opposite direction from that. They'll promote more investment and competition.

Nick Gillespie: One benchmark would be is if we see persistent lower capital investment year over year. That would be a sign. And it might not because of repeal of net neutrality but that's a bad sign. Would it also be things like the slower speed of average connections, cost of plans, number of fixed and mobile connections, either flat lining or going down? Are those the other types of things that we should look for?

Ajit Pai: Those are some of the indicia that we would take into account. Similar to make sure that we don't see widespread blocking of lawful content. That's not something I think anybody wants to see. That's not the internet we've had and I don't expect that's the internet we will have.

Nick Gillespie: That is, and I'm thinking of, I'm hearing defenders of net neutrality whispering in my ear as I say this, there's the idea that before the, the first time when net neutrality was pushed by the FCC was in 2010 but then it was various court challenges et cetera in 2015 it becomes a reality where the internet is being regulated under Title two, these old telecommunications rules from the 30s. Can we rely on the experience of the internet from the early 90s or from the telecommunications act of 1996 until 2015? Is that the internet that we'll go back to?

Ajit Pai: I believe so. We will have a free and open internet as we had before 2015. Moreover we're going to see it become even better going forward and the reason is that with technological innovation we're entering, on the wireless side for example, a new era of technology known as 5G. That's going to require massive amounts of investment in networks and in spectrum and that's the kind of thing that will be a big breakthrough for consumers on the wireless side.

Nick Gillespie: Do you think, are we entering an era this is one of the criticisms of net neutrality is that it was essentially partly pushed by industries or companies that have a vested interest in things the way they are now. And that includes Netflix, it includes Google, it includes to a certain degree Amazon. That they wanted to stop the internet development as it is now and that they were all about fixed connections. Are we going to be, do you think it's likely that we're going to be entering an era of wireless where most things are based on wireless connectivity?

Ajit Pai: I think so. There is one particularly insightful person up in Silicon Valley who's talked about how, as he puts it, that mobile is eating the world. How all of these services are migrating to wireless and how particularly in future whether we are talking about low bandwidth applications like wireless monitoring yogurt trucks as they drive across the countryside or high bandwidth applications like virtual reality. A lot of this is going to be taking place over wireless.

Nick Gillespie: And mobile stuff. I'm sorry, I confuse the terminology. That the idea that …

Ajit Pai: Oh no, no, no, mobile's actually right.

Nick Gillespie: And that we're going to be, we're already, I can actually say this at Reason's traffic, more and more it's mobile devices as opposed to people looking at their computer at work or at home. What else has to happen for 5G? Are there other regulatory changes that have to happen for mobile wireless to go gigantic?

Ajit Pai: A lot of them. Number one, the FCC needs to make more spectrum available. It doesn't help if you have a bottleneck in terms of spectrum. We're aggressively moving to get as much as we can out into the commercial marketplace. Both for license, the cell carriers and the like. But also unlicensed, the next generation of wifi. The second thing is we also need to make it easier to deploy a lot of the infrastructure. The future of wireless networks are not going to be ones where you'll see a bunch of 100 foot cell towers, instead you'll see hundreds if not thousands of small cells, some of which you could even hold in your hand. You won't even notice them on the sides of buildings and the like. But to deploy those, we need to make sure that we don't impose the same onerous regulations that we do for a big cell tower. They shouldn't have to go through environmental and historic preservation review, for instance. We don't want to states and localities also imposing moratoria on these kinds of siting applications. Those are some of the things that have to happen.

Nick Gillespie: That was common early on, going back 20, 30, 40 years when cellphones were really becoming popular, a lot of places put limits on where cell towers could be located or how many. When you say you don't want them to have to go through historic review committees in small towns and stuff like that, is that based on the fact that these will be unobtrusive or what is the rationale for that?

Ajit Pai: Part of it is that they will be unobtrusive in a lot of cases. And part of it is also that we don't want to have a patchwork where it's not just the federal government but 50 state governments, any number of municipalities and 567 federally recognized tribes, each are trying to have a bite of the regulatory apple, so to speak. If we really want to claim leadership in the 5G future and compete against countries like China and Korea and Japan, which have a much more, they are very eager to take the lead on 5G, then we need to make sure that our regulatory framework is streamlined. Preserves the public interest but also incentivizes investment. That's not where we are right now.

Nick Gillespie: I see this as the next battleground in fair weather federalism? Because it sounds like you so you're going to have a Republican Congress, I assume. Or role making apparatus that is saying, ""No, the federal government really should control all of this."" And then you'll have Democrats who are normally adverse to states' rights saying, ""No, no, it's gotta be devolved down."" Do think that's a likely development?

Ajit Pai: That could always happen but to me at least, the internet is inherently at this point, broadband internet is inherently an interstates service and interstate services traditionally the touchstone for federal regulation. My hope is that we can put the politics aside and focus on exactly how these networks operate and if we do that then there's a strong case for federal government leadership here.

Nick Gillespie: Your plan will, according to a write up in Politico, and I think this is accurate, it quote, ""will jettison rules that prohibit internet service providers from blocking or slowing web traffic or creating so called paid internet fast lanes."" Question for you, do you think fast lanes will become a thing? What is the value of a internet fast lane?

Ajit Pai: The answer to the first is we're not sure. We've never seen them before and that's part of the reason why I thought the rule in particular was, that was adopted in 2015, was very premature banning something that's simply didn't exist. But secondly, going forward, we could see pro-competitive and anti-competitive cases for those kinds of prioritization arrangements. For example, if you want to prioritize traffic in your healthcare provider that needs to monitor patients remotely, that's the kind of traffic that should take precedence you might think, over cat videos and the like. Conversely we don't want to see cases in which companies are behaving anti-competitively in structuring those kinds of prioritization arrangements. You could make a case either way and that's part of the reason why the federal trade commission is the right agency to handle that because that's essentially an anti-trust question. That's something that have long experience in taking care of.

Nick Gillespie: Mentioning the FTC though, isn't it also much more limited than the FCC was under Title two? It really doesn't have the same scope of authority to regulate, it can't do as much, can it?

Ajit Pai: To the contrary it actually can do even more in a lot of cases. For example, they can take action even in the absence of a finding of harm, consumer harm. Even if consumers aren't harmed, if they deem a particular business practice, any business practice to be unfair or deceptive, they have authority under section five to take action against it. That's a pretty powerful tool that they've used, even in the last couple of years against telecom providers and others in the internet economy who they believe are not protecting consumers.

Nick Gillespie: Are you the first commission head to actually say no I want less power?

Ajit Pai: I have talked to some of my predecessors going all the way back to the Reagan years. This is one of the constant battles that you see over the years is that in any administration, whether it's a Republican administration where they are taking a free market position, their tact for that. Or a Democratic administration where they take a more regulatory view. This is a constant back and forth and so I see myself as the next in line in this long tradition not to break from that tradition.

Nick Gillespie: What do you make of the fact, and part of this is due John Oliver who called his army of internet trolls to bombard the FCC website with comments during the comment period about the proposed rollback, and that's good things. It's a amazing that we've had tens of million of people who are suddenly motivated to talk about arcane subject of telecommunication policy. There were over 20 million comments against ending net neutrality, from one account I read. How do you process that kind of pushback against what you're proposing?

Ajit Pai: There was mix of opinion in the comments and we had to take a look at all of the comments in the record that were substantive and significant and that were contributing in helping to answer some of the questions that we keyed up in our notice of proposed rule making. It wasn't easy but when you see the order, you'll find that we did try to sort through as many as we possibly could and incorporated as many as we possibly could into our decision making.

Nick Gillespie: Let me switch topics slightly. I want to ask you about a different area that has to do with free speech and free expression and the free internet. Currently in the Senate there is a bill going through called the Stop Enabling Sexual Traffickers Act or SESTA, there's a version of it in the House as well. In the name of cracking down on human trafficking, the legislation would, in the words of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is in favor of net neutrality but they're against this. They say that SESTA would eviscerate the immunity from liability for user generated comment. That internet intermediaries have under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and would also amend the federal criminal sex trafficking statue to sweep in companies who may not even be aware of what their users are doing.

Section 230 is one of those defining laws of the internet where it created a safe harbor for internet service providers and sites from content posted by users and whatnot. It's widely credited with helping the internet and world wide web especially, the web, become what we know it as. Are you worried that 230 is being undermined by SESTA and that 230 is absolutely essentially to flourishing internet?

Ajit Pai: Here I unfortunately have to give the unsatisfactory answer that I haven't read the legislation itself. I've read press accounts obviously about the debate and I've been following it from afar as it's gone through the relevant committees. I haven't had a chance to study it and think through what the implication would be. I know there were fixes, for instance, that were adopted late in the process, before it went out of the committee and I haven't had a chance to think do those ameliorate the concerns that you're talking about. At this point I've been focused on what we're doing over here at the FCC that I haven't had a chance to think about it.

Nick Gillespie: More broadly though, do you think that the safe harbor that's provided in general by 230 is a good and very important thing?

Ajit Pai: I do think, I do remember when I was in law school in the mid 90s there was a significant debate about this and we were debating at the time, I'm really dating myself now, should bulletin boards owners be liable for what their users post? It seems quaint now, but it's amazing how vibrant this debate still is because there is a sense that online platform thrives precisely because the owner of that platform isn't liable necessarily for everything that's posted on there. I can see the argument both ways and obviously this is an important issue in terms of sex trafficking that a lot of elected officials have their eyes on. Hopefully there's a way to thread the needle that satisfies everybody's concerns.

Nick Gillespie: Speaking like a Michigan alum, which you are, correct? You are tackling yourself, aren't you? You're not going to answer that question, definitively I get that.

Ajit Pai: I just not a Michigan alum so I didn't want to offend any Big Blue fans out there

Nick Gillespie: I'm sorry. Are you a Michigan resident then? Or you grew up in Michigan?

Ajit Pai: Grew up in Kansas. Undergrad Harvard Law School, University of Chicago.

Nick Gillespie: I apologize for besmirching you with any connection to Michigan other than having flown through it on a couple of occasions.

Ajit Pai: Especially in university 'cause my in-laws are all Ohio State fans. Thanksgiving would be a little difficult if they suddenly suspected some kind of Harbaugh connection.

Nick Gillespie: I can absolutely understand that. Going forward, what are you looking for on the near horizon besides 5G that most excites you about the internet and about telecommunications more broadly?

Ajit Pai: To me at least, it's our efforts to close the digital divide. And I understand that things like net neutrality will occupy 99% of the oxygen in the room but to me at least, that percentage is more properly devoted to what we are doing to build out access to people on the wrong side of that divide who don't have access to the internet today and to promote more competition using innovative technologies. We've talked about 5G but this FCC over the last 10 months has already approved the first ever satellite applications, sending satellites into low Earth orbit and beaming very high speed connectivity back to Earth. We're getting more spectrum out there for fixed wireless providers to use so they can compete without having to lay fiber. And for the smaller fiber providers we've taken a number of steps both in terms of wiser distribution of our federal subsidies and our regulatory reform to give them a fighting chance.

Whether it's in intercity Detroit or in rural Kansas, they are going to have a chance to compete. My hope is that over the next coming years we're going to see an explosion in the kinds of connectivity and the depth of that connectivity and ultimately that means that the human capital in the United States that is currently on the shelf, the people who don't have digital opportunity, will be able to be participants in the digital economy instead of just spectators.

Nick Gillespie: Where do get that new spectrum space from? Are you taking it back from broadcast or are you freeing up stuff that's just been collecting dust? Or squeezing out more efficiency?

Ajit Pai: It's a little bit of mix. Squeezing out efficiency is the name of the game in some cases where you have, for example, federal agencies using the spectrum and we're trying to see if there are creative ways for us to share that spectrum. Additionally there is some spectrum that's been fallow for a while and because of technological innovation we're able to now use it potentially for wireless service. There's also some spectrum that has been owned by incumbents that we've sold and then given share of the proceeds to those incumbents and then transferred it to other companies that want the spectrum. It's an all hands on deck approach when it comes to the airways.

Nick Gillespie: You were appointed chairman by Donald Trump, by President Donald Trump. You were on the commission before that as a Republican appointee. Do you feel that you're part of what former Trump advisor Steve Bannon said was an attempt to deconstruct the administrative state? If so, can you make a positive case for being a regulator essentially, a bureaucrat who is saying, ""You should be seeing less and less of me as time goes on.""

Ajit Pai: To me at least, having worked in this agency for the better part of the last decade, it was very clear to me when I came into office, there were a lot of rules on the books that simply weren't appropriate for 2017. In some cases they were holding back investment and innovation. In other cases they were on books simply as a matter of regulatory inertia. And so we had a chance to think very broadly about how do we want to promote more competition and investment across all of these industries from broadband to media? Over the last 10 months we've had the chance to do that and over time folks are going to see the results speak for themselves. We do want the regulations to be more market based and light touch to reflect the law a congress gave it to us not whatever policy vision we might dream up for ourselves. That's not just a free market deregulatory view, but it's view that's appropriate for the marketplace and for consumers in 2017.

Nick Gillespie: Final question, in your Wall Street Journal piece and elsewhere, and it's not just you, people were very upset, regulators were upset as well as, well I was upset, when Barack Obama really hammered the then chair of the FCC to pass net neutrality. It's not quite unprecedented and it's not quite wrong, but he really got on a soapbox and said, ""You know, you guys really have to do this and you have to get it done."" It seemed to have a direct effect. There's no question that Obama really squeezed what's supposed to be an independent commission. Would you push back if Donald Trump suddenly came to you and said, ""You know what? Like I really need you to put net neutrality back or I want you to do something that you think would undermine the integrity of market based approaches and rule of law approaches to telecommunications policy.""

Ajit Pai: I've said from day one since I became chair that this is an independent agency, that we will make our own decisions based on the facts as we find them and the law as we see and we'll call the shots accordingly. We're not going to let any political considerations from any quarter dictate or pressure us into making a decision that we truly believe is not in the public interest. I don't know about my other, the fellow commissioners, but speaking for myself, that's the one thing that gives our decisions credence in the eyes of the American people is that we're seen as the experts on communications issues, not as political actors that sway with the wind depending on who's weighing in.

Nick Gillespie: I certainly look forward to seeing what happens over the, not just the next couple of weeks, but the next couple of years. Thank you so much chairman Ajit Pai of the Federal Communication Commission for talking to The Reason podcast.

Ajit Pai: Thank you sir.",www.reason.com,right,R0ZcjRYBmBViCHWe

As heated debate continues over how social media sites can improve the quality of news on their platforms while enforcing rules fairly , most Americans are pessimistic about these efforts and are highly concerned about several issues when it comes to social media and news .
Majorities say that social media companies have too much control over the news on their sites , and that the role social media companies play in delivering the news on their sites results in a worse mix of news for users . At the same time , social media is now a part of the news diet of an increasingly large share of the U.S. population .
These findings are based on a survey conducted July 8-21 , 2019 , among 5,107 U.S. adults who are members of ███ ’ s American Trends Panel . The study also examines Americans ’ perceptions of the biggest problems when it comes to social media and news , the political slant of news posts they see on social media , and which sites they go to for news .
Almost all Americans – about nine-in-ten ( 88 % ) – recognize that social media companies have at least some control over the mix of news people see . And most Americans feel this is a problem : About six-in-ten ( 62 % ) say social media companies have too much control over the mix of news that people see on their sites , roughly four times as many as say that they don ’ t have enough control ( 15 % ) . Just 21 % say that social media companies have the right amount of control over the news people see .
The largest social media platforms control the content on their feeds using computer algorithms that rank and prioritize posts and other content tailored to the interests of each user . These sites allow users to customize these settings , though previous research has found that many Americans feel uncertain about why certain posts appear in their news feed on Facebook specifically . Social media companies have also been public about their efforts to fight both false information and fake accounts on their sites .
While social media companies say these efforts are meant to make the news experience on their sites better for everyone , most Americans think they just make things worse . A majority ( 55 % ) say that the role social media companies play in delivering the news on their sites results in a worse mix of news . Only a small share ( 15 % ) say it results in a better mix of news , while about three-in-ten ( 28 % ) think their efforts make no real difference .
While most Americans are pessimistic about the control social media companies have over the news people see , Republicans tend to be more negative than Democrats . Three-quarters of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say social media companies have too much control over the mix of news that people see , compared with about half ( 53 % ) of Democrats and Democratic leaners . More Republicans ( 66 % ) than Democrats ( 49 % ) also say that these efforts result in a worse mix of news for users .
Most say that social media companies favor certain types of news organizations
A large majority of Americans believe that social media companies favor some news organizations over others . About eight-in-ten U.S. adults ( 82 % ) say social media sites treat some news organizations differently than others , about five times the share saying all news organizations are treated the same ( 16 % ) .
Social media companies do have established policies when it comes to publishers , including prioritizing certain news sources , banning or limiting others that produce lower-quality content , and using their monetization policies to discourage particular behaviors .
Among those U.S. adults who say social media companies treat some news organizations differently than others , there is broad agreement that they favor three types : those that produce attention-grabbing articles ( 88 % ) , those with a high number of social media followers ( 84 % ) and those whose coverage has a certain political stance ( 79 % ) .
While large social media companies have announced initiatives to favor high-quality news publishers in an effort to improve the news on their sites , fewer who say some news organizations are treated differently believe social media companies favor organizations that are well-established ( 56 % ) , have high reporting standards ( 34 % ) or have politically neutral coverage ( 18 % ) .
Americans are most concerned about biased and inaccurate news on social media ; many say the news content they see leans left
Many people – including President Donald Trump – have voiced concerns about social media companies potentially censoring the news that people see , whether by hiding posts or by banning specific users .

Fewer say that censorship of the news ( 35 % ) or news organizations or personalities being banned ( 24 % ) are very big problems .
As large majorities say that the tone of American political debate has become more negative in recent years , about a third of U.S. adults ( 35 % ) say that uncivil discussions about the news are a very big problem when it comes to news on social media . Additionally , about a quarter ( 27 % ) say that the harassment of journalists is a very big problem associated with news on social media .
Republicans and Democrats disagree somewhat about which issues on social media are very big problems , especially when it comes to censorship and harassment . Republicans and Republican leaners are more likely to see censorship of the news as a very big problem on social media ( 43 % ) than Democrats and Democratic leaners ( 30 % ) . Democrats , on the other hand , are about twice as likely as Republicans to say that harassment of journalists is a very big problem ( 36 % vs. 17 % ) . Despite these differences , one-sided news and inaccurate news top the list among both Republicans and Democrats .
Many Americans also say that the news posts they see on social media tend to lean to the left ideologically . Nearly half of social media news consumers ( 48 % ) describe the posts about news they see there as liberal or very liberal . A much smaller share – 14 % – say the news posts they see are conservative or very conservative , while 36 % say the news they see is moderate .

Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram have a higher proportion of women among their news users, while YouTube and Reddit news users are more likely to be men. And about seven-in-ten (69%) of Snapchat’s news consumers are ages 18 to 29, more than any other site.",www.journalism.org,center,Eo6esunjc9ljDK3l

So we connect more people.

What immediately struck me about this leaked memo was the line about ""all the questionable contact importing practices"".

When I downloaded my Facebook data recently, it was the presence of thousands of my phone contacts that startled me. But the company's attitude seemed to be that this was normal and it was up to users to switch off the function if they didn't like it.

What we now know is that in 2016 a very senior executive thought this kind of data gathering was questionable.

So, why is it only now that the company is having a debate about this and other dubious practices?

Until now, Facebook has not been leaky. Perhaps we will soon get more insights from insiders as this adolescent business tries to grow up and come to terms with its true nature.

Fact checking

The disclosure coincided with Facebook's latest efforts to address the public and investors' concerns with its management.

Its shares are trading about 14% lower than they were before the Cambridge Analytica scandal began, and several high profile figures have advocated deleting Facebook accounts.

The company hosted a press conference on Thursday, at which it said it had:

begun fact-checking photos and videos posted in France, and would expand this to other countries soon

developed a new fake account investigative tool to prevent harmful election-related activities

started work on a public archive that will make it possible for journalists and others to investigate political-labelled ads posted to its platform

In previous days it had also announced a revamp of its privacy settings, and said it would restrict the amount of data exchanged with businesses that collect information on behalf of advertisers.

The latest controversy is likely, however, to provide added ammunition for critics.

CNN reported earlier this week that Mr Zuckerberg had decided to testify before Congress ""within a matter of weeks"" after refusing a request to do so before UK MPs.

More On This...

The most popular alternative theory, it seems, is that the hack was carried out by disgruntled former Sony employees.

The FBI, though, stood by its original announcement on Tuesday.

""The FBI has concluded the Government of North Korea is responsible for the theft and destruction of data on the network of Sony Pictures Entertainment,"" the FBI said in a statement. ""Attribution to North Korea is based on intelligence from the FBI, the U.S. intelligence community, DHS, foreign partners and the private sector.""

The bureau added: ""There is no credible information to indicate that any other individual is responsible for this cyber incident.""

A State Department spokesman on Tuesday also stood by the conclusion that North Korea was responsible.

Some in the private sector have defended the FBI's case.

Dmitri Alperovitch, with security firm CrowdStrike, recently told Wired that the U.S. has more evidence proving North Korean involvement, and the government can't release it yet.

But Stammberger said he's confident the FBI will investigate further.

""They're smart folks. They will follow the evidence of the data trail, I'm confident of that,"" he said.

A post on Norse's company blog on Monday explained that their own investigation has focused on a group of at least six people who ""may have worked to compromise the company's networks, including at least one ex-employee who had the technical background and system knowledge to carry out the attack.""

According to the post, the researchers ""tracked the activities of the ex-employee on underground forums."" Investigators at Norse believe disgruntled workers or former workers ""may have joined forces with pro-piracy hacktivists, who have long resented the Sony's anti-piracy stance.""

""The fact that nobody has seen any data that connected this to North Korea is a little strange,"" he said. ""Also strange was the speed at which the FBI ... pinned it on them.""

Other security analysts have floated a similar theory.

David Kennedy, CEO of information security firm TrustedSec, told FoxNews.com last week that he thinks an angry insider at Sony was behind the attack.

""They were going for destroying the company,"" he said. He noted Sony had massive layoffs earlier this year, ""a lot of them in the systems administrator field.""

It ’ s been running apologetic ads on TV . It ’ s sent CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress . It ’ s rolled out new privacy settings . It ’ s employed new and improved content-moderation algorithms and filtering technologies , and hired more people to weed out the undesirable content that slips through the cracks . Advertisers are now under more rigorous scrutiny , and Facebook users must be informed about who paid for each political ad they see in their news feeds .
In the midst of all of this , Facebook has decided to launch a new initiative that will air exclusive TV-news programming from a range of content providers , including household names like Fox News , CNN , Univision , and BuzzFeed . In the view of the social media behemoth , this represents not just a way to get users to spend more time with the platform , but also another way to combat what it has dubbed “ false news. ” But the term for the problematic media the platform helped spread isn ’ t best captured by false news , or the more ubiquitous fake news . Instead , it ’ s a category of content that Oxford University ’ s Computational Propaganda Project calls “ junk news , ” which its researchers say provides a more accurate description , since it also applies to all sorts of information that—while not completely fake—still contributes to problematically uninformed , misinformed , bigoted , and hyperpolarized views . It ’ s an important distinction in the diagnosis of Facebook ’ s problems—and helps explain why the company ’ s new , sanctioned news programming may end up causing more trouble than good .
Facebook famously does everything it can to avoid being categorized as a media company . It doesn ’ t want to subject itself to the many regulations that apply to traditional media companies . Nor does it want to play the editorial gatekeeping role of evaluating which content is factual and relevant enough to be considered newsworthy—or , at least , it doesn ’ t want to be held responsible for doing so ( part of the reason why the company did away with its Trending Topics ) . While Facebook has started demoting posts that users and fact-checkers flag as false , the outsourcing of this judgment task allows it to keep insisting it ’ s just a technology company providing a forum for the exchange of viewpoints and information . Zuckerberg himself has said that making content decisions on behalf of users makes him “ fundamentally uncomfortable . ”
By establishing partnerships with a selected set of commercial news organizations , Facebook is making editorial choices .
This stance was on full display on Wednesday , when John Hegeman and Sara Su , who lead News Feed at the company , hosted an event in New York City to showcase Facebook ’ s efforts to fight false news . One of the journalists invited to the event , CNN ’ s Oliver Darcy , followed up after the event , writing in a tweet that Facebook had failed to provide a “ good answer ” when asked why Alex Jones ’ Infowars was still allowed on the site . Facebook reacted by using free speech as a shield : “ We see Pages on both the left and the right pumping out what they consider opinion or analysis—but others call fake news . We believe banning these Pages would be contrary to the basic principles of free speech. ” Over and over , the company expresses that it wants to be a forum for public discourse , enabling expression of your free-speech rights . The platform is completely neutral .
For years , Facebook has been met with criticism for its algorithmically aided and human decisions about what it censors and what it promotes . Important historical photos from respected sources get removed , and the accounts behind them get banned . But Russian trolls and purveyors of dangerous conspiracy theories remain mostly free to post outrageous falsehoods , so long as they don ’ t violate “ community standards. ” It ’ s not like Facebook has always been neutral about nudity , violence , racism , sexism or homophobia , though . It hasn ’ t always been evenhanded and uncontroversial in enforcing its guidelines , either . If anything , Facebook holds a reputation among academics , journalists , and users for its inconsistency in what it will and will not permit in your news feed .
Which brings us back to the company ’ s nascent foray into commissioning its own news programming . With a history of vacillating and incohesive semigatekeeping , Facebook hasn ’ t exactly won the world championship of content-curation discipline . But company leaders seem to see their investment in a new lineup of TV-news–style shows for Facebook Watch as a way to distance themselves even further from the gatekeeping process . Why ? Because , in their view , they ’ re outsourcing editorial decisions to established media outlets like CNN , Univision , ABC News , and Fox News . In doing so , the company seems to be selling the new strategy as a turn on the old Fox News Channel slogan . With the new news content on Facebook Watch , it ’ s : They report . You decide .
But by doing so , Facebook ’ s sliding further into becoming what it ’ s said it ’ s trying to avoid . By establishing partnerships with a selected set of commercial news organizations , Facebook is making editorial choices . It ’ s giving its seal of approval to certain news outlets rather than others .
Facebook makes another editorial decision when it decides how much time and resources it dedicates to the different partners . Fox News , for example , looks like it will be the biggest contributor of breaking-news updates with its short , twice-daily “ Fox News Update ” segments—heightening worries among those already concerned by the controversial partnership . It ’ s worth noting that , as ███ ’ s Will Oremus has written , “ the word news is key here , because Fox News distinguishes internally between its news programming ( think Shep Smith ) and its opinion programming ( think Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity ) , with the news programming being far less partisan ” and that Smith , who will anchor the Facebook Watch segments , “ has a reputation as a relatively down-the-middle newsman. ” It ’ s likely something that Zuckerberg and Co. will use to justify the choice of a self-proclaimed partisan news outlet .
Facebook has released its viewing schedule for the new Facebook Watch platform - and WOW that ’ s a lot of Fox News ! https : //t.co/RH6ESy73uT pic.twitter.com/S8jMHmwePR — Mark Di Stefano 🤙🏻 ( @ MarkDiStef ) July 11 , 2018
But regardless of how relatively objective Smith may seem against the right-wing punditry and vitriol that ’ s otherwise found on the network , it ’ s still a questionable move . By giving Fox News a dominant spot , and by making a serious investment in the programming and promotion of it , Facebook helps legitimize a media outlet that journalism and media scholars consider to be little more than a propaganda organization . Even if the Fox News segments on Facebook turn out to have a high degree of journalistic integrity , it won ’ t change the fact that the Fox News Channel churns out junk news and falsehoods several hours a day on TV through its commentary programs led by hosts like Sean Hannity , Tucker Carlson , and Laura Ingraham . And that ’ s not counting the stories that are published on Fox News ’ website .
Because almost half of all Americans get their news from Facebook , it matters when the company tells its users that they can trust Fox News ( or , for that matter , can trust CNN , ABC News , Univision , BuzzFeed , Mic , Quartz , ATTN , or the other handful of branded news-programming providers it ’ s bringing to Facebook Watch , or has been paying to produce Facebook Live content ) . It matters that it has chosen to even go down the partisan route instead of striking up a partnership with news organizations that have no commercial or political interests , like NPR or PBS . It matters that the company is spending millions commissioning this news programming—plus the untold value it will give it by promoting it in users ’ feeds—at the same time it ’ s been deprioritizing news content from other outlets ( including , to be transparent , this publication ) and incorrectly flagging promoted posts from some publishers . It ’ s a choice . And it ’ s an editorial one .
What ’ s more , these editorial choices will only raise more . What is Zuckerberg going to do if one of these media partners produces a Facebook Watch segment that contains questionable reporting—a glaring omission of relevant facts , a lack of credible sourcing , a hyperpartisan or bigoted slant ? What happens if one of these branded partners engages in that original sin : spreading false news ? What if it does it repeatedly ? Will it hold this sanctioned content to higher standards than its other pages ? Will someone at Facebook step in to correct it ? Or will they simply let it slide ?
Perhaps we should cut the ifs here—we know the missteps and biases that already plague some of these TV-news outlets will inevitably show up on Facebook ’ s version of it too . And it will be another editorial decision of the sort that Facebook says it wants nothing to do with . It ’ s a good thing Facebook is just a platform , otherwise it would be in trouble . Possibly antitrust violations–level trouble .
By favoring some media outlets over others , Facebook seems to be pursuing a strategy that , in some ways , echoes a case that landed the Associated Press in legal hot water in the 1940s . Among other practices at the time , the cooperative association engaged in gathering and distributing news decided it was best for its business to refuse to let member newspapers sell or provide its news to outlets that weren ’ t members of the association . ( Members were also notorious for blocking new memberships from newspapers it saw as competitors , making the association even more exclusive . ) It didn ’ t go well . The issue ultimately went to the U.S. Supreme Court , which decided that the AP was in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act , even though it wasn ’ t a monopoly . The population ’ s access to news and information , it ruled , was of higher priority than the AP ’ s right to conduct its business as it saw fit . Justice Hugo Black wrote the opinion for the court and wrote that the First Amendment was contingent on the “ widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources , ” which he deemed “ essential to the welfare of the public ” . Black also concluded that while freedom to publish is guaranteed by the Constitution , “ freedom to combine to keep others from publishing is not . ”
Facebook may believe it ’ s protecting First Amendment rights by pretending to be a platform rather than a media outlet . But Facebook surrenders its feigned neutrality when it selects a group of preferred content providers , gives them its seal of approval , and lets some of them have more access to users than others . It ’ s a choice that could be viewed as “ combining to keep others from publishing , ” or , at least , from letting others have the same access to reach users on its mega-powerful media-distributing platform .
On the one hand , Facebook claims to be a neutral forum and defends this position as the reason why it should be exempt from the regulation that traditional media faces . On the other hand , the company makes highly consequential editorial decisions—and ones that , by virtue of its outsize role as a content distributor , may not always align with that “ widest possible dissemination of information ” the Supreme Court has deemed “ essential to the welfare of the public. ” How long will Facebook be able to call itself just a platform before it loses even more of the public trust it ’ s been fighting so hard to regain ?","CNN anchor Anderson Cooper adjusts his earpiece during a commercial break while moderating a Democratic presidential debate sponsored by CNN and Facebook at Wynn Las Vegas on Oct. 13, 2015 in Las Vegas.

Facebook has been trying awfully hard to repair the past two years of damage to its reputation. It’s been running apologetic ads on TV. It’s sent CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress. It’s rolled out new privacy settings.

If anything, Facebook holds a reputation among academics, journalists, and users for its inconsistency in what it will and will not permit in your news feed.

Which brings us back to the company’s nascent foray into commissioning its own news programming. With a history of vacillating and incohesive semigatekeeping, Facebook hasn’t exactly won the world championship of content-curation discipline. But company leaders seem to see their investment in a new lineup of TV-news–style shows for Facebook Watch as a way to distance themselves even further from the gatekeeping process. Why? Because, in their view, they’re outsourcing editorial decisions to established media outlets like CNN, Univision, ABC News, and Fox News. In doing so, the company seems to be selling the new strategy as a turn on the old Fox News Channel slogan. With the new news content on Facebook Watch, it’s: They report. You decide.

But by doing so, Facebook’s sliding further into becoming what it’s said it’s trying to avoid. By establishing partnerships with a selected set of commercial news organizations, Facebook is making editorial choices. It’s giving its seal of approval to certain news outlets rather than others.

Facebook makes another editorial decision when it decides how much time and resources it dedicates to the different partners. Fox News, for example, looks like it will be the biggest contributor of breaking-news updates with its short, twice-daily “Fox News Update” segments—heightening worries among those already concerned by the controversial partnership. It’s worth noting that, as Slate’s Will Oremus has written, “the word news is key here, because Fox News distinguishes internally between its news programming (think Shep Smith) and its opinion programming (think Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity), with the news programming being far less partisan” and that Smith, who will anchor the Facebook Watch segments, “has a reputation as a relatively down-the-middle newsman.” It’s likely something that Zuckerberg and Co. will use to justify the choice of a self-proclaimed partisan news outlet.

Facebook has released its viewing schedule for the new Facebook Watch platform - and WOW that’s a lot of Fox News! https://t.co/RH6ESy73uT pic.twitter.com/S8jMHmwePR — Mark Di Stefano 🤙🏻 (@MarkDiStef) July 11, 2018

But regardless of how relatively objective Smith may seem against the right-wing punditry and vitriol that’s otherwise found on the network, it’s still a questionable move. By giving Fox News a dominant spot, and by making a serious investment in the programming and promotion of it, Facebook helps legitimize a media outlet that journalism and media scholars consider to be little more than a propaganda organization. Even if the Fox News segments on Facebook turn out to have a high degree of journalistic integrity, it won’t change the fact that the Fox News Channel churns out junk news and falsehoods several hours a day on TV through its commentary programs led by hosts like Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, and Laura Ingraham. And that’s not counting the stories that are published on Fox News’ website.

Because almost half of all Americans get their news from Facebook, it matters when the company tells its users that they can trust Fox News (or, for that matter, can trust CNN, ABC News, Univision, BuzzFeed, Mic, Quartz, ATTN, or the other handful of branded news-programming providers it’s bringing to Facebook Watch, or has been paying to produce Facebook Live content). It matters that it has chosen to even go down the partisan route instead of striking up a partnership with news organizations that have no commercial or political interests, like NPR or PBS. It matters that the company is spending millions commissioning this news programming—plus the untold value it will give it by promoting it in users’ feeds—at the same time it’s been deprioritizing news content from other outlets (including, to be transparent, this publication) and incorrectly flagging promoted posts from some publishers. It’s a choice. And it’s an editorial one.

What’s more, these editorial choices will only raise more. What is Zuckerberg going to do if one of these media partners produces a Facebook Watch segment that contains questionable reporting—a glaring omission of relevant facts, a lack of credible sourcing, a hyperpartisan or bigoted slant? What happens if one of these branded partners engages in that original sin: spreading false news? What if it does it repeatedly? Will it hold this sanctioned content to higher standards than its other pages? Will someone at Facebook step in to correct it? Or will they simply let it slide?

Perhaps we should cut the ifs here—we know the missteps and biases that already plague some of these TV-news outlets will inevitably show up on Facebook’s version of it too. And it will be another editorial decision of the sort that Facebook says it wants nothing to do with. It’s a good thing Facebook is just a platform, otherwise it would be in trouble. Possibly antitrust violations–level trouble.

By favoring some media outlets over others, Facebook seems to be pursuing a strategy that, in some ways, echoes a case that landed the Associated Press in legal hot water in the 1940s. Among other practices at the time, the cooperative association engaged in gathering and distributing news decided it was best for its business to refuse to let member newspapers sell or provide its news to outlets that weren’t members of the association. (Members were also notorious for blocking new memberships from newspapers it saw as competitors, making the association even more exclusive.) It didn’t go well. The issue ultimately went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which decided that the AP was in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, even though it wasn’t a monopoly. The population’s access to news and information, it ruled, was of higher priority than the AP’s right to conduct its business as it saw fit. Justice Hugo Black wrote the opinion for the court and wrote that the First Amendment was contingent on the “widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources,” which he deemed “essential to the welfare of the public”. Black also concluded that while freedom to publish is guaranteed by the Constitution, “freedom to combine to keep others from publishing is not.”

Facebook may believe it’s protecting First Amendment rights by pretending to be a platform rather than a media outlet. But Facebook surrenders its feigned neutrality when it selects a group of preferred content providers, gives them its seal of approval, and lets some of them have more access to users than others. It’s a choice that could be viewed as “combining to keep others from publishing,” or, at least, from letting others have the same access to reach users on its mega-powerful media-distributing platform.

On the one hand, Facebook claims to be a neutral forum and defends this position as the reason why it should be exempt from the regulation that traditional media faces. On the other hand, the company makes highly consequential editorial decisions—and ones that, by virtue of its outsize role as a content distributor, may not always align with that “widest possible dissemination of information” the Supreme Court has deemed “essential to the welfare of the public.” How long will Facebook be able to call itself just a platform before it loses even more of the public trust it’s been fighting so hard to regain?

It ’ s a technology-enabled , surveillance-based nationwide program designed to nudge citizens toward better behavior . The ultimate goal is to “ allow the trustworthy to roam everywhere under heaven while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step , ” according to the Chinese government .
In place since 2014 , the social credit system is a work in progress that could evolve by next year into a single , nationwide point system for all Chinese citizens , akin to a financial credit score . It aims to punish for transgressions that can include membership in or support for the Falun Gong or Tibetan Buddhism , failure to pay debts , excessive video gaming , criticizing the government , late payments , failing to sweep the sidewalk in front of your store or house , smoking or playing loud music on trains , jaywalking , and other actions deemed illegal or unacceptable by the Chinese government . It can also award points for charitable donations or even taking one ’ s own parents to the doctor . Punishments can be harsh , including bans on leaving the country , using public transportation , checking into hotels , hiring for high-visibility jobs , or acceptance of children to private schools . It can also result in slower internet connections and social stigmatization in the form of registration on a public blacklist . China ’ s social credit system has been characterized in one pithy tweet as “ authoritarianism , gamified. ” Authoritarianism , gamified . https : //t.co/V7JARJwU7t ht @ VitalikButerin @ FrankPasquale — Steve Randy Waldman ( @ interfluidity ) October 4 , 2015 At present , some parts of the social credit system are in force nationwide and others are local and limited ( there are 40 or so pilot projects operated by local governments and at least six run by tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent ) .
Beijing maintains two nationwide lists , called the blacklist and the red list—the former consisting of people who have transgressed , and the latter people who have stayed out of trouble ( a “ red list ” is the Communist version of a white list . ) These lists are publicly searchable on a government website called China Credit . The Chinese government also shares lists with technology platforms . So , for example , if someone criticizes the government on Weibo , their kids might be ineligible for acceptance to an elite school . Public shaming is also part of China ’ s social credit system . Pictures of blacklisted people in one city were shown between videos on TikTok in a trial , and the addresses of blacklisted citizens were shown on a map on WeChat . Some Western press reports imply that the Chinese populace is suffocating in a nationwide Skinner box of oppressive behavioral modification . But some Chinese are unaware that it even exists . And many others actually like the idea . One survey found that 80 % of Chinese citizens surveyed either somewhat or strongly approve of social credit system . It can happen here Many Westerners are disturbed by what they read about China ’ s social credit system . But such systems , it turns out , are not unique to China . A parallel system is developing in the United States , in part as the result of Silicon Valley and technology-industry user policies , and in part by surveillance of social media activity by private companies . Here are some of the elements of America ’ s growing social credit system .
Insurance companies The New York State Department of Financial Services announced earlier this year that life insurance companies can base premiums on what they find in your social media posts . That Instagram pic showing you teasing a grizzly bear at Yellowstone with a martini in one hand , a bucket of cheese fries in the other , and a cigarette in your mouth , could cost you . On the other hand , a Facebook post showing you doing yoga might save you money . ( Insurance companies have to demonstrate that social media evidence points to risk , and not be based on discrimination of any kind—they can ’ t use social posts to alter premiums based on race or disability , for example . ) The use of social media is an extension of the lifestyle questions typically asked when applying for life insurance , such as questions about whether you engage in rock climbing or other adventure sports . Saying “ no , ” but then posting pictures of yourself free-soloing El Capitan , could count as a “ yes. ” PatronScan A company called PatronScan sells three products—kiosk , desktop , and handheld systems—designed to help bar and restaurant owners manage customers . PatronScan is a subsidiary of the Canadian software company Servall Biometrics , and its products are now on sale in the United States , Canada , Australia , and the United Kingdom . PatronScan helps spot fake IDs—and troublemakers . When customers arrive at a PatronScan-using bar , their ID is scanned . The company maintains a list of objectionable customers designed to protect venues from people previously removed for “ fighting , sexual assault , drugs , theft , and other bad behavior , ” according to its website . A “ public ” list is shared among all PatronScan customers . So someone who ’ s banned by one bar in the U.S. is potentially banned by all the bars in the U.S. , the U.K. , and Canada that use the PatronScan system for up to a year . ( PatronScan Australia keeps a separate system . ) Judgment about what kind of behavior qualifies for inclusion on a PatronScan list is up to the bar owners and managers . Individual bar owners can ignore the ban , if they like . Data on non-offending customers is deleted in 90 days or less . Also : PatronScan enables bars to keep a “ private ” list that is not shared with other bars , but on which bad customers can be kept for up to five years . PatronScan does have an “ appeals ” process , but it ’ s up to the company to grant or deny those appeals .
Uber and Airbnb Thanks to the sharing economy , the options for travel have been extended far beyond taxis and hotels . Uber and Airbnb are leaders in providing transportation and accommodation for travelers . But there are many similar ride-sharing and peer-to-peer accommodations companies providing similar services . Airbnb—a major provider of travel accommodation and tourist activities—bragged in March that it now has more than 6 million listings in its system . That ’ s why a ban from Airbnb can limit travel options . Airbnb can disable your account for life for any reason it chooses , and it reserves the right to not tell you the reason . The company ’ s canned message includes the assertion that “ This decision is irreversible and will affect any duplicated or future accounts . Please understand that we are not obligated to provide an explanation for the action taken against your account. ” The ban can be based on something the host privately tells Airbnb about something they believe you did while staying at their property . Airbnb ’ s competitors have similar policies . It ’ s now easy to get banned by Uber , too . Whenever you get out of the car after an Uber ride , the app invites you to rate the driver . What many passengers don ’ t know is that the driver now also gets an invitation to rate you . Under a new policy announced in May : If your average rating is “ significantly below average , ” Uber will ban you from the service . WhatsApp You can be banned from communications apps , too . For example , you can be banned on WhatsApp if too many other users block you . You can also get banned for sending spam , threatening messages , trying to hack or reverse-engineer the WhatsApp app , or using the service with an unauthorized app . WhatsApp is small potatoes in the United States . But in much of the world , it ’ s the main form of electronic communication . Not being allowed to use WhatsApp in some countries is as punishing as not being allowed to use the telephone system in America .
What ’ s wrong with social credit , anyway ? Nobody likes antisocial , violent , rude , unhealthy , reckless , selfish , or deadbeat behavior . What ’ s wrong with using new technology to encourage everyone to behave ? The most disturbing attribute of a social credit system is not that it ’ s invasive , but that it ’ s extralegal . Crimes are punished outside the legal system , which means no presumption of innocence , no legal representation , no judge , no jury , and often no appeal . In other words , it ’ s an alternative legal system where the accused have fewer rights . Social credit systems are an end-run around the pesky complications of the legal system . Unlike China ’ s government policy , the social credit system emerging in the U.S. is enforced by private companies . If the public objects to how these laws are enforced , it can ’ t elect new rule-makers . An increasing number of societal “ privileges ” related to transportation , accommodations , communications , and the rates we pay for services ( like insurance ) are either controlled by technology companies or affected by how we use technology services . And Silicon Valley ’ s rules for being allowed to use their services are getting stricter . If current trends hold , it ’ s possible that in the future a majority of misdemeanors and even some felonies will be punished not by Washington , D.C. , but by Silicon Valley .

It’s a technology-enabled, surveillance-based nationwide program designed to nudge citizens toward better behavior. The ultimate goal is to “allow the trustworthy to roam everywhere under heaven while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step,” according to the Chinese government.

In place since 2014, the social credit system is a work in progress that could evolve by next year into a single, nationwide point system for all Chinese citizens, akin to a financial credit score. It aims to punish for transgressions that can include membership in or support for the Falun Gong or Tibetan Buddhism, failure to pay debts, excessive video gaming, criticizing the government, late payments, failing to sweep the sidewalk in front of your store or house, smoking or playing loud music on trains, jaywalking, and other actions deemed illegal or unacceptable by the Chinese government. It can also award points for charitable donations or even taking one’s own parents to the doctor. Punishments can be harsh, including bans on leaving the country, using public transportation, checking into hotels, hiring for high-visibility jobs, or acceptance of children to private schools. It can also result in slower internet connections and social stigmatization in the form of registration on a public blacklist. China’s social credit system has been characterized in one pithy tweet as “authoritarianism, gamified.” Authoritarianism, gamified. https://t.co/V7JARJwU7t ht @VitalikButerin @FrankPasquale — Steve Randy Waldman (@interfluidity) October 4, 2015 At present, some parts of the social credit system are in force nationwide and others are local and limited (there are 40 or so pilot projects operated by local governments and at least six run by tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent).

Beijing maintains two nationwide lists, called the blacklist and the red list—the former consisting of people who have transgressed, and the latter people who have stayed out of trouble (a “red list” is the Communist version of a white list.) These lists are publicly searchable on a government website called China Credit. The Chinese government also shares lists with technology platforms. So, for example, if someone criticizes the government on Weibo, their kids might be ineligible for acceptance to an elite school. Public shaming is also part of China’s social credit system. Pictures of blacklisted people in one city were shown between videos on TikTok in a trial, and the addresses of blacklisted citizens were shown on a map on WeChat. Some Western press reports imply that the Chinese populace is suffocating in a nationwide Skinner box of oppressive behavioral modification. But some Chinese are unaware that it even exists. And many others actually like the idea. One survey found that 80% of Chinese citizens surveyed either somewhat or strongly approve of social credit system. It can happen here Many Westerners are disturbed by what they read about China’s social credit system. But such systems, it turns out, are not unique to China. A parallel system is developing in the United States, in part as the result of Silicon Valley and technology-industry user policies, and in part by surveillance of social media activity by private companies. Here are some of the elements of America’s growing social credit system.

Insurance companies The New York State Department of Financial Services announced earlier this year that life insurance companies can base premiums on what they find in your social media posts. That Instagram pic showing you teasing a grizzly bear at Yellowstone with a martini in one hand, a bucket of cheese fries in the other, and a cigarette in your mouth, could cost you. On the other hand, a Facebook post showing you doing yoga might save you money. (Insurance companies have to demonstrate that social media evidence points to risk, and not be based on discrimination of any kind—they can’t use social posts to alter premiums based on race or disability, for example.) The use of social media is an extension of the lifestyle questions typically asked when applying for life insurance, such as questions about whether you engage in rock climbing or other adventure sports. Saying “no,” but then posting pictures of yourself free-soloing El Capitan, could count as a “yes.” PatronScan A company called PatronScan sells three products—kiosk, desktop, and handheld systems—designed to help bar and restaurant owners manage customers. PatronScan is a subsidiary of the Canadian software company Servall Biometrics, and its products are now on sale in the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. PatronScan helps spot fake IDs—and troublemakers. When customers arrive at a PatronScan-using bar, their ID is scanned. The company maintains a list of objectionable customers designed to protect venues from people previously removed for “fighting, sexual assault, drugs, theft, and other bad behavior,” according to its website. A “public” list is shared among all PatronScan customers. So someone who’s banned by one bar in the U.S. is potentially banned by all the bars in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada that use the PatronScan system for up to a year. (PatronScan Australia keeps a separate system.) Judgment about what kind of behavior qualifies for inclusion on a PatronScan list is up to the bar owners and managers. Individual bar owners can ignore the ban, if they like. Data on non-offending customers is deleted in 90 days or less. Also: PatronScan enables bars to keep a “private” list that is not shared with other bars, but on which bad customers can be kept for up to five years. PatronScan does have an “appeals” process, but it’s up to the company to grant or deny those appeals.

Uber and Airbnb Thanks to the sharing economy, the options for travel have been extended far beyond taxis and hotels. Uber and Airbnb are leaders in providing transportation and accommodation for travelers. But there are many similar ride-sharing and peer-to-peer accommodations companies providing similar services. Airbnb—a major provider of travel accommodation and tourist activities—bragged in March that it now has more than 6 million listings in its system. That’s why a ban from Airbnb can limit travel options. Airbnb can disable your account for life for any reason it chooses, and it reserves the right to not tell you the reason. The company’s canned message includes the assertion that “This decision is irreversible and will affect any duplicated or future accounts. Please understand that we are not obligated to provide an explanation for the action taken against your account.” The ban can be based on something the host privately tells Airbnb about something they believe you did while staying at their property. Airbnb’s competitors have similar policies. It’s now easy to get banned by Uber, too. Whenever you get out of the car after an Uber ride, the app invites you to rate the driver. What many passengers don’t know is that the driver now also gets an invitation to rate you. Under a new policy announced in May: If your average rating is “significantly below average,” Uber will ban you from the service. WhatsApp You can be banned from communications apps, too. For example, you can be banned on WhatsApp if too many other users block you. You can also get banned for sending spam, threatening messages, trying to hack or reverse-engineer the WhatsApp app, or using the service with an unauthorized app. WhatsApp is small potatoes in the United States. But in much of the world, it’s the main form of electronic communication. Not being allowed to use WhatsApp in some countries is as punishing as not being allowed to use the telephone system in America.

What’s wrong with social credit, anyway? Nobody likes antisocial, violent, rude, unhealthy, reckless, selfish, or deadbeat behavior. What’s wrong with using new technology to encourage everyone to behave? The most disturbing attribute of a social credit system is not that it’s invasive, but that it’s extralegal. Crimes are punished outside the legal system, which means no presumption of innocence, no legal representation, no judge, no jury, and often no appeal. In other words, it’s an alternative legal system where the accused have fewer rights. Social credit systems are an end-run around the pesky complications of the legal system. Unlike China’s government policy, the social credit system emerging in the U.S. is enforced by private companies. If the public objects to how these laws are enforced, it can’t elect new rule-makers. An increasing number of societal “privileges” related to transportation, accommodations, communications, and the rates we pay for services (like insurance) are either controlled by technology companies or affected by how we use technology services. And Silicon Valley’s rules for being allowed to use their services are getting stricter. If current trends hold, it’s possible that in the future a majority of misdemeanors and even some felonies will be punished not by Washington, D.C., but by Silicon Valley. It’s a slippery slope away from democracy and toward corporatocracy. In other words, in the future, law enforcement may be determined less by the Constitution and legal code, and more by end-user license agreements.",www.fastcompany.com,center,CO7Plo6gJafNInxf

However, Trump’s decision has faced pushback from Democrats and others. The New York Times was even accused of publishing a ""public relations effort"" on behalf of the WHO.

How does Zuckerberg handle the pressure?

Zuckerberg has never before faced the kind of adversarial questioning he’s likely to receive from lawmakers during the hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday.

His tone and attitude will be extremely important, particularly given the outrage in Congress over the data scandal and Russia’s election interference. If Zuckerberg, 33, comes across as arrogant, the hearings could turn into a debacle for Facebook, experts say.

“He’s got to try to be authentic and humble and avoid any degree of arrogance and glib answers. He’s got to be thoughtful and avoid what happened to Bill Gates in the antitrust case. He was arrogant and slouched,” said Lanny Davis, a crisis communications expert and columnist for The Hill.

Zuckerberg has been practicing for his testimony with Facebook’s Washington team and advisers have urged him to be humble, according to The New York Times.

In that vein, Zuckerberg is poised to begin his testimony with an apology, according to his prepared remarks for the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

“We didn’t take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake. It was my mistake, and I’m sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I’m responsible for what happens here,” Zuckerberg plans to say.



How aggressively do lawmakers question him?

Lawmakers for years have clamored to hear from Zuckerberg directly about Facebook’s practices. Now, more than 14 years after the company launched, they will get their chance.

Senators will get the first crack at Zuckerberg on Tuesday in a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees.

Ahead of the hearing, members like Sens. Ed Markey Edward (Ed) John MarkeyOvernight Defense: Families sue over safety hazards at Army base | Lawmakers, NBA's Enes Kanter speak out ahead of Erdoğan visit | Washington braces for public impeachment hearings NBA's Enes Kanter speaks out against Erdoğan ahead of White House visit Democrats unifying against Joe Kennedy Senate bid MORE (D-Mass.) and John Kennedy John Neely KennedyMORE (R-La.) have voiced discontent with Facebook and signaled that the company’s response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal has been inadequate.

How does he explain Facebook’s response to Cambridge Analytica?

Facebook’s handling of the Cambridge Analytica controversy is certain to be a major focus of lawmakers’ questions.

The company says it first discovered in 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had improperly obtained user data. In response, it asked the firm to certify that the data would be destroyed.

Cambridge Analytica agreed to those terms but then violated that agreement, as The New York Times and The Observer reported last month. Instead, the firm used the data as part of its work on campaigns.

Facebook says it was deceived by the firm and has suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform. But that timeline of events isn’t sitting well with lawmakers, who question why it took the company so long to take action.

Zuckerberg and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg have both said that they’re not aware of any other instances of improperly harvested data. But Zuckerberg has said that Facebook is still working to uncover any other violations that may have occurred.



What does Zuckerberg say about Russia’s election interference?

Members of Congress are certain to come armed with questions about how Russia used Facebook during the 2016 presidential race.

In his written testimony to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Zuckerberg confirmed that in the summer of 2016 the company shut down a group of accounts with suspected ties to the Kremlin. The accounts, believed to be a part of the Russian espionage group called APT 28, “created fake personas that were used to seed stolen information to journalists,” Zuckerberg said.

Since then, Zuckerberg has vowed to improve the platform’s safeguards against disinformation and election meddling.

“We were too slow to spot and respond to Russian interference, and we’re working hard to get better,” he plans to say on Wednesday.



Does the hearing fuel calls for regulation?

The biggest worry for Facebook and other tech companies is that the scrutiny from Washington will ultimately result in new laws and regulations.

Over the past year, policymakers have grown more critical of the tech industry, though they have yet to translate their frustration into action.

Some privacy advocates want the U.S. to develop a regulatory framework like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the far-reaching European Union law that will go into effect next month and gives internet users greater control over their own data.

Under that law, websites in Europe will have to be more transparent about what they do with that data and offer users simple controls to restrict how it’s used.

Though the GDPR will only apply to the EU, Zuckerberg has promised to extend the privacy controls required by the law to all Facebook users around the world.

Soon after President Donald Trump was inaugurated in 2017, Breitbart appeared to be on the ropes.

BuzzFeed exposed its star writer’s ties to white nationalists. The site embarrassingly attacked accusers of alleged pedophile and failed Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. Onetime Trump adviser Steve Bannon stepped down after daring to question the president. Seemingly plummeting traffic numbers fueled a narrative of decline.

But Breitbart still had Facebook. And its influence on the platform, which will be key in Trump’s reelection campaign, has been massive during the impeachment fight.

Breitbart has drawn more likes, comments, and shares than CNN’s main page in each of the past three months, according to the analytics firm CrowdTangle. Users have interacted with Breitbart’s posts 20 percent more often than CNN’s primary account over that period, despite having just one-eighth the following.

“We’ve been dominating in our neck of the woods,” Breitbart Editor Alex Marlow told VICE News.

“We’ve been dominating in our neck of the woods.”

It means more reach for Breitbart’s ideas, more fuel for Breitbart’s business, and more eyeballs for Facebook’s $55 billion targeted advertising machine. The upshot is that an “overwhelmingly pro-Trump” outlet — Marlow’s words — is gobbling up an outsized portion of Americans’ mindshare as local media atrophies and more national outlets move behind paywalls.

Engagements, a rough gauge of user attention, are a key metric for Facebook. The CrowdTangle data suggest Breitbart has aptly gamed that incentive structure, offering a snapshot of how the platform shapes the broader ecosystem for news.

Emotion is currency on Facebook, which serves users more posts from pages the more they engage with them. But comments are particularly valuable to News Feed rankings, a spokesperson said, and Fox News and Breitbart have both prioritized them.

Brietbart’s top three Facebook posts in November were all open discussion threads with banal questions. “SHOULD REP. ADAM SCHIFF RESIGN AND BE INVESTIGATED?” one Nov. 15 post screamed. The next day, the page asked, “DO YOU STILL SUPPORT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AFTER THIS WEEK’S IMPEACHMENT HEARING?” It posed nearly the exact same inquiry four days later. Cue hundreds of thousands of likes, comments, and shares.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg essentially defended the move as a diversity hire. “I think you want to have content that represents different perspectives, but is doing so in a way that complies with the standards that we have for this,” he said.

News,0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jeff-bezos-internet-confirmation-bias-machine-215003176.html,Jeff Bezos: 'The internet ... is a confirmation bias machine',2018-10-15,"Melody Hahm, Senior Writer","Amazon ( AMZN ) founder and CEO Jeff Bezos told a Wired event that social media companies are fomenting polarization by creating echo chambers for their users .
“ I think social media is increasing , unfortunately , identity politics , [ and ] tribalism . I think the internet in its current incarnation is a confirmation bias machine , ” Bezos said in a surprise interview at the Wired 25 conference on Monday afternoon . “ If you have a going in point of view and you go do some searches , you find confirmation of your point of view . If your newsfeed is showing you things , it ’ s showing you things that confirm your point of view … by and large . ”
This was in response to Wired editor-at-large Steven Levy asking Bezos “ how you ’ re viewing this difficult moment for technology . ”
A 2017 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggested that social media algorithms partly rely on confirmation biases to surface the most relevant content for users .
“ Our analysis showed that two well-shaped , highly segregated , and mostly non-interacting communities exist around scientific and conspiracy-like topics , ” Alessandro Bessi , a postdoctoral researcher with the Information Science Institute at the University of Southern California who co-authored the paper , told CNN . “ Users show a tendency to search for , interpret , and recall information that confirm their pre-existing beliefs . ”
Last week , Facebook ( FB ) announced it had removed an additional 800 pages and accounts that were stirring up political engagement ahead of November ’ s midterm elections by publishing misleading or fake stories that preyed on people ’ s ingrained biases .
Google ’ s ( GOOG ) search has consistently been accused of political bias . However , according to Google ’ s explainer on how Google News chooses items , most headlines a user sees are selected via Google ’ s algorithms that are based on past usage history on Google Search , YouTube , the News app itself , and other properties . And conspiracy theory rabbit holes on YouTube show how users can create confirmation bias feedback loops for themselves .
Twitter CEO ( TWTR ) Jack Dorsey has consistently been criticized for tribalistic abuse to run rampant on the platform and recently announced a plan to start addressing the problem .
Bezos added he remains “ incredibly optimistic about technology ” despite its egregious shortcomings . Earlier in the interview , he argued : “ You want risk taking — you want people to have a vision that most people don ’ t agree with . You have to find something where your particular life path has led you to see something in a particular way so you can pursue it , contribute to society … but in a unique way . ”
As any technologist would posit , Bezos believes ultimately it ’ s better to disrupt than not innovate at all .
“ The last thing you ’ d ever want to do is stop the progress of new technologies even when they are dual use , ” he said . “ Biotech is going to be amazing — it ’ s going to save your children and it ’ s going to cure your cancer and many other things . But it ’ s going to have dual use too . ”
While Bezos was quick to point the finger at social media giants , the world ’ s richest man on paper also said that he welcomes scrutiny and criticism .","Amazon (AMZN) founder and CEO Jeff Bezos told a Wired event that social media companies are fomenting polarization by creating echo chambers for their users.

Confirmation bias as a feature, not a bug

A 2017 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggested that social media algorithms partly rely on confirmation biases to surface the most relevant content for users.

“Our analysis showed that two well-shaped, highly segregated, and mostly non-interacting communities exist around scientific and conspiracy-like topics,” Alessandro Bessi, a postdoctoral researcher with the Information Science Institute at the University of Southern California who co-authored the paper, told CNN. “Users show a tendency to search for, interpret, and recall information that confirm their pre-existing beliefs.”

Last week, Facebook (FB) announced it had removed an additional 800 pages and accounts that were stirring up political engagement ahead of November’s midterm elections by publishing misleading or fake stories that preyed on people’s ingrained biases.

Google’s (GOOG) search has consistently been accused of political bias. However, according to Google’s explainer on how Google News chooses items, most headlines a user sees are selected via Google’s algorithms that are based on past usage history on Google Search, YouTube, the News app itself, and other properties. And conspiracy theory rabbit holes on YouTube show how users can create confirmation bias feedback loops for themselves.

Twitter CEO (TWTR) Jack Dorsey has consistently been criticized for tribalistic abuse to run rampant on the platform and recently announced a plan to start addressing the problem.

‘Incredibly optimistic about technology’

Bezos added he remains “incredibly optimistic about technology” despite its egregious shortcomings. Earlier in the interview, he argued: “You want risk taking — you want people to have a vision that most people don’t agree with. You have to find something where your particular life path has led you to see something in a particular way so you can pursue it, contribute to society … but in a unique way.”

As any technologist would posit, Bezos believes ultimately it’s better to disrupt than not innovate at all.

“The last thing you’d ever want to do is stop the progress of new technologies even when they are dual use,” he said. “Biotech is going to be amazing — it’s going to save your children and it’s going to cure your cancer and many other things. But it’s going to have dual use too.”

While Bezos was quick to point the finger at social media giants, the world’s richest man on paper also said that he welcomes scrutiny and criticism.

Biss","California GOP Rep. Devin Nunes filed a major lawsuit seeking $ 250 million in compensatory damages and $ 350,000 in punitive damages against Twitter and a handful of its users on Monday , accusing the social media site of `` shadow-banning conservatives '' to secretly hide their posts , systematically censoring opposing viewpoints , and totally `` ignoring '' lawful complaints of repeated abusive behavior .
In a complaint filed in Virginia state court on Monday , obtained by Fox News , Nunes claimed Twitter wanted to derail his work on the House Intelligence Committee , which he chaired until 2019 , as he looked into alleged and apparent surveillance abuses by the government . Nunes said Twitter was guilty of `` knowingly hosting and monetizing content that is clearly abusive , hateful and defamatory – providing both a voice and financial incentive to the defamers – thereby facilitating defamation on its platform . ''
The lawsuit alleged defamation , conspiracy and negligence , as well as violations of the state 's prohibition against `` insulting words '' -- effectively fighting words that tend towards `` violence and breach of the peace . '' The complaint sought not only damages , but also an injunction compelling Twitter to turn over the identities behind numerous accounts he said harassed and defamed him .
“ Twitter is a machine , '' Nunes ' personal attorney , Steven S. Biss , told Fox News . `` It is a modern-day Tammany Hall . Congressman Nunes intends to hold Twitter fully accountable for its abusive behavior and misconduct . ”
Although federal law ordinarily exempts services like Twitter from defamation liability at all levels , Nunes ' suit said the platform has taken such an active role in curating and banning content -- as opposed to merely hosting it -- that it should face liability like any other organization that defames .
`` Twitter created and developed the content at issue in this case by transforming false accusations of criminal conduct , imputed wrongdoing , dishonesty and lack of integrity into a publicly available commodity used by unscrupulous political operatives and their donor/clients as a weapon , '' Nunes ' legal team wrote . `` Twitter is 'responsible ' for the development of offensive content on its platform because it in some way specifically encourages development of what is offensive about the content . ''
The lawsuit is separate from Nunes ' work on the House Intelligence Committee , where he is now the ranking member . To prove his defamation charge , Nunes , as a public figure , would typically need to meet a higher standard than a private individual -- essentially that the defendants acted intentionally or recklessly with respect to the provable falsity of their posts , rather than than merely negligently .
The complaint also maintains in its action for negligence , however , that Twitter has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid hosting outwardly defamatory content because of its increasingly important role in current affairs .
`` Access to Twitter is essential for meaningful participation in modern-day American Democracy , '' the complaint stated . `` A candidate without Twitter is a losing candidate . The ability to use Twitter is a vital part of modern citizenship . A presence on Twitter is essential for an individual to run for office or engage in any level of political organizing in modern America . That is because Twitter is not merely a website : it is the modern town square . Twitter is equivalent to the private owner of a public forum who has fully opened its property to the general public for purposes of permitting the public ’ s free expression and debate . That is , in fact , what Twitter has always claimed to be . ''
Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has testified previously before Congress that his platform is a kind of `` digital public square , '' although he has insisted that Twitter , as a private company , retains the right to censor speech .
In large part because of Twitter 's actions , Nunes `` endured an orchestrated defamation campaign of stunning breadth and scope , one that no human being should ever have to bear and suffer in their whole life '' in the past year , according to the complaint .
`` Twitter is a machine . It is a modern-day Tammany Hall . '' — Devin Nunes ' personal attorney , Steven S. Biss
The complaint also named specific Twitter accounts that spread allegedly defamatory material about Nunes . One defendant , identified as `` Liz '' Mair , purportedly published tweets that `` implied that Nunes colluded with prostitutes and cocaine addicts , that Nunes does cocaine , and that Nunes was involved in a 'Russian money laundering front , ' '' according to Nunes ' lawyers .
HOWARD KURTZ : IS TWITTER CORRUPTING JOURNALISM , OR EXPOSING ITS UTTER UNFAIRNESS ?
The complaint quoted a June 22 , 2018 tweet from Mair that implied Nunes invested in a winery that `` allegedly used underage hookers to solicit investment . ''
Mair did not respond to Fox News ' request for comment . Fox News has also reached out to Twitter for comment on the lawsuit , and was told only that `` we 're not commenting at this time . '' ( The lawsuit seeks joint and several liability , which permits plaintiffs to recover from one defendant , and then leaves the defendants to sort out what each owes . )
The complaint also named `` Devin Nunes ’ Mom , '' `` a person who , with Twitter ’ s consent , hijacked Nunes ’ name , falsely impersonated Nunes ’ mother , and created and maintained an account on Twitter ( @ DevinNunesMom ) for the sole purpose of attacking , defaming , disparaging and demeaning Nunes . ''
Nunes lawyers ' wrote , `` In her endless barrage of tweets , Devin Nunes ’ Mom maliciously attacked every aspect of Nunes ’ character , honesty , integrity , ethics and fitness to perform his duties as a United States Congressman . ''
One tweet from the account , cited by the complaint , contained a crude drawing of Russian President Vladimir Putin , President Trump , and Nunes in a physically linked , symbiotic arrangement like the characters in the horror film `` The Human Centipede ( First Sequence ) . ''
The complaint goes to allege that the account gave factually false and defamatory information , mixed in with impermissibly `` insulting '' fighting words .
`` Devin Nunes ’ Mom , '' the complaint alleges , `` stated that Nunes had turned out worse than Jacob Wohl ; falsely accused Nunes of being a racist , having 'white supremist friends ' and distributing 'disturbing inflammatory racial propaganda ' ; falsely accused Nunes of putting up a 'Fake News MAGA ' sign outside a Texas Holocaust museum ; falsely stated that Nunes would probably join the 'Proud Boys ' , if it weren ’ t for that unfortunate 'nomasturbating ’ rule ' ; disparagingly called him a 'presidential fluffer and swamp rat ' ; falsely stated that Nunes had brought 'shame ' to his family ; repeatedly accused Nunes of the crime of treason , compared him to Benedict Arnold , and called him a 'traitor . ' ''
As of Monday afternoon , the @ DevinNunesMom account was suspended by Twitter when Fox News tried to access it . The complaint stated that `` Twitter only suspended the account in 2019 after Nunes ’ real mother , Toni Dian Nunes , complained . ... Twitter permitted @ DevinNunesMom , for instance , to tweet and retweet with impunity throughout 2018 . ''
However , according to the complaint , `` Twitter did nothing to investigate or review the defamation that appeared in plain view on its platform . Twitter consciously allowed the defamation of Nunes to continue '' despite reports and purported reviews by Twitter 's content moderators .
TWITTER CEO : PLATFORM WAS PROBABLY 'WAY TOO AGGRESSIVE ' IN BANNING ACCOUNTS
`` As part of its agenda to squelch Nunes ’ voice , cause him extreme pain and suffering , influence the 2018 Congressional election , and distract , intimidate and interfere with Nunes ’ investigation into corruption and Russian involvement in the 2016 Presidential Election , Twitter did absolutely nothing , '' the complaint stated .
Another account named as a defendant was `` Devin Nunes ' Cow , '' or @ DevinCow , which purportedly called Nunes a `` treasonous cowpoke '' and an `` udder-ly worthless '' criminal .
The @ DevinNunesMom account also “ falsely stated that Nunes was unfit to run the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , and “ falsely stated that Nunes was ‘ voted ‘ Most Likely to Commit Treason ’ in high school , ' '' the complaint states .
The timing and substance of the tweets , according to Nunes ' team , suggested that Mair was working jointly with @ DevinCow and @ DevinNunesMom accounts . Mair 's LinkedIn profile , the complaint notes , contains the boast : `` What do I do for [ my ] clients ? Anonymously smear their opposition on the Internet . ''
In response to the lawsuit , the @ DevinCow account -- which was still active as of Monday evening -- posted numerous tweets mocking Nunes . `` I ’ m not quitting my day job , '' one read .
The complaint also charged that Twitter `` shadow-banned '' Nunes in 2018 `` in order to restrict his free speech and to amplify the abusive and hateful content published and republished by Mair , Devin Nunes ’ Mom , '' and other accounts . A `` shadow-banned '' user can see his or her own tweets , but others may not be able to access them easily , or at all -- making it difficult for the shadow-banned user to even realize his account is being censored .
`` The shadow-banning was intentional , '' the complaint continued . `` It was calculated to interfere with and influence the federal election and interfere with Nunes ’ ongoing investigation as a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence . Twitter ’ s actions affected the election results . The combination of the shadow-ban and Twitter ’ s refusal to enforce its Terms and Rules in the face of clear and present abuse and hateful conduct caused Nunes to lose support amongst voters . ''
The lawsuit cited numerous articles , including a Vice News story from last summer , reporting that Twitter had , for a time , downplayed the visibility of prominent conservatives in its search results . In a blog post last year , Twitter denied shadow-banning anyone based on political beliefs , and said all users ' tweets are always accessible from their profiles .
However , the site did acknowledge that tweets from `` bad faith users '' would appear lower in search results , when other users attempt to look for specific terms using Twitter 's search functionality .
On Monday , Sean Davis , the managing editor of The Federalist , wrote that he recently had been an apparent victim of a form of shadow-banning on Twitter -- and said that contrary to Twitter 's claims , other users were unable to see a specific tweet even when they were on his profile page .
`` Twitter gave me no notice or explanation when it shadowbanned one of my Tweets about Russian interference in our elections , '' Davis wrote . `` But what 's worse is how Twitter apparently gives its users the fraudulent impression that their tweets , which Twitter secretly bans , are still public . ''
Davis charged that Twitter `` claimed in its e-mail to me that it 'mistakenly remove [ d ] ' a completely anodyne tweet about public congressional testimony , but did n't explain why it left the tweet -- and metrics showing no engagement -- visible to me when logged in . Is conning users a bug , or a feature ? ''
Dorsey , the Twitter CEO , acknowledged on Joe Rogan 's podcast earlier this month that the platform has been too aggressive in banning certain accounts .
Vijaya Gadde , Twitter 's chief legal officer , said that the company would learn from its mistakes .
`` Where we draw a line is when people use their voice and their platform to use their voice to silence someone else on the platform , '' Gadde said on the podcast . `` It ’ s rare for us to outright ban someone without warning .

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey emailed employees on Tuesday telling them that they’d be allowed to work from home permanently, even after the coronavirus pandemic lockdown passes. Some jobs that require physical presence, such as maintaining servers, will still require employees to come in.

technology,The Verge,0,https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20948547/twitter-topics-launch-sports-gaming-entertainment-test,"Twitter is rolling out Topics, a way to follow subjects automatically in the timeline",2019-11-06,Casey Newton,"Recently , a friend told me he wanted to spend more time using Twitter , but he didn ’ t quite know how . His primary interest is comedy , he told me , and he hoped to find a way to see comedians ’ best jokes on Twitter as they were posted . But when he followed comedians , he mostly saw a lot of self-promotion — tour dates , late-night appearances , and that sort of thing . No matter your personal interests , there are countless good and relevant tweets on Twitter . But where are they ?
Topics , a new feature from Twitter that is starting to roll out this week , represents a significant effort to answer that question . You will be able to follow more than 300 “ topics ” across sports , entertainment , and gaming , just as you are currently able to follow individual accounts . In return , you ’ ll see tweets from accounts that you don ’ t follow that have credibility on these subjects .
Twitter executives hope that Topics will make the platform more approachable for new and intermittent users and make it easier for heavier users to discover new accounts and conversations . The feature , which began testing on Android in August , is set to roll out globally on November 13th .
“ We know that the main reason that people come to Twitter is to keep up on the things that they ’ re interested in , ” said Rob Bishop who leads Topics team . “ The challenge is it ’ s really quite difficult to do that on Twitter day to day . ”
The idea of letting people follow topics in addition to ( or instead of ) individual accounts dates back to the earliest days of the company . But it took the development of machine learning tools and the hiring of a human editorial team , among other things , to make it happen .
As a journalist who spends eight or so hours a day paying at least glancing attention to the Twitter timeline , I ’ m a somewhat poor test case for the value of Topics . I follow people whose work is relevant to my own and very few others . Generally speaking , if it matters to the companies I cover , I don ’ t miss it .
“ The main reason that people come to Twitter is to keep up on the things that they ’ re interested in . ”
But I ’ m also a pro wrestling nerd who recently started an alternate account to keep up with wrestling Twitter . ( I had found that tweets about SummerSlam were underperforming on my main account . If you can imagine ! ) The minute I created my new account , I was in the same spot as my comedy-loving friend : knowing there were lots of good tweets out there for me but not at all clear on where to look .
I did the obvious things : following the big pro wrestling federations , the top stars , and a handful of wrestling journalists and podcasters . But when Twitter enabled Topics for my account , I could also just follow “ WWE. ” Suddenly , a new icon appeared as I scrolled , indicating that the tweet I was reading had come from a topic I was following .
During a recent visit to the Twitter office , Bishop walked me through how tweets in a topic like WWE get selected for the timeline . First , Twitter scans incoming tweets for keywords like “ WWE , ” “ pro wrestling , ” and so on . ( It can ’ t search for those terms in images and videos , at least not yet . ) Second , Twitter searches to see if the tweet is from someone who normally tweets about that topic as a measure of credibility . Finally , Twitter looks at engagement : how many other people who care about this topic liked , retweeted , or replied to a tweet ? The more people are interacting with the tweet , the more likely it is to make the cut .
The first and most obvious challenge here comes in picking the right tweets to include in the timeline . In my experience , Twitter ’ s algorithms tended to be a little obvious . Many of the first tweets I saw came from official WWE accounts and the accounts of their wrestlers . Some of that is fine , of course , but a lot of those high-engagement tweets are just naked self-promotion and aren ’ t particularly valuable to me . ( I already know what time the pay-per-view starts on Sunday , thank you . )
After a few days of testing , though , I started seeing more relevant tweets . I learned that WWE had renewed its morally bankrupt deal with the Saudi Arabian government , thanks to a Topics tweet inserted into my timeline from a journalist I hadn ’ t been following . Another Topics tweet came on the same subject from an ordinary wrestling fan who offered some spicy , relevant commentary . It was everything I hoped Topics would be .
The second challenge in perfecting Topics comes in balance : how many Topics tweets should Twitter show you ? Bishop told me that , as a general rule , the fewer individual accounts you follow , the more Topics tweets you are likely to see . That seems like a reasonable approach . I follow fewer than 100 people on my wrestling alt account , and many of the tweets in my timeline are just tweets that the people I follow have liked . Tweets from Topics have so far been at least as good as those , and they ’ re often better .
Still , a vocal subset of Twitter users is extremely picky about which tweets appear in their timeline . ( When other people ’ s likes started appearing in the feed , seemingly at random , my own timeline filled up with the howls of aggrieved users . ) Twitter executives hope that Topics is widely used , but I wouldn ’ t be surprised if power users decide it isn ’ t for them .
One topic you won ’ t find included in the initial batch : politics . The company tells me it ’ s sensitive to the potential unintended consequences of its algorithms offering additional amplification to tweets about sensitive subjects , and so it ’ s sticking to lighter fare to start .
Tweets about many popular subjects may now travel further than ever before
Bishop says the feature will shine for followers of big fandoms , such as major professional sports teams or the Korean boy band BTS . The group and its members represent one of the most discussed subjects on all of Twitter , he said , and yet , there are few official accounts on which to follow daily developments . ( Get well soon , Jungkook ! ) That left fans searching for fan accounts , even though Twitter has a good idea of what the top accounts are . Now , fans can just follow the BTS topic , and Twitter will surface popular tweets about the band .
If Topics succeeds , Bishop said , the average person won ’ t follow fewer individual accounts . In fact , he said , they will likely follow more . It also means that your tweets about many popular subjects may now travel further than ever before , which can be a mixed blessing , as anyone who has ever seen a tweet go viral and faced harassment as a result can testify .
So what ’ s next ? More topics , including on subjects that are popular internationally , Bishop said . The team is also working on a feature to mute topics , which could be useful for anyone who is trying to avoid spoilers for a popular television show , for example . Eventually , Bishop says , you may be able to “ narrow cast ” your tweet to followers of a particular subject , which is another ancient dream of Twitter users . ( Imagine being able to discuss the city you live in on Twitter but only with people who are following that subject . )
The team is also working on a feature to mute topics
The company also plans to eventually let you browse topics on an explore page and to view topics on a dedicated list . ( This is something that , coupled with narrow casting , could let me do all of my tweeting from a single account . )
Like some other features Twitter has released this year — the ability to search your direct messages comes to mind — Topics is a feature that feels obvious , welcome , overdue , and not quite finished . But it also feels like meaningful progress for a company that has never known what to do with the bounty of incredible tweets flowing through its servers each day .
“ As with any machine learning problem , we learn the most from putting this in customers ’ hands , and seeing what they engage with so we can build better models , ” Bishop said . “ Our goal is to get this out as quickly as possible and get people using it so we can improve our algorithms . ”","Recently, a friend told me he wanted to spend more time using Twitter, but he didn’t quite know how.

No matter your personal interests, there are countless good and relevant tweets on Twitter. But where are they?

Topics, a new feature from Twitter that is starting to roll out this week, represents a significant effort to answer that question. You will be able to follow more than 300 “topics” across sports, entertainment, and gaming, just as you are currently able to follow individual accounts. In return, you’ll see tweets from accounts that you don’t follow that have credibility on these subjects.

Twitter executives hope that Topics will make the platform more approachable for new and intermittent users and make it easier for heavier users to discover new accounts and conversations. The feature, which began testing on Android in August, is set to roll out globally on November 13th.

“We know that the main reason that people come to Twitter is to keep up on the things that they’re interested in,” said Rob Bishop who leads Topics team. “The challenge is it’s really quite difficult to do that on Twitter day to day.”

The idea of letting people follow topics in addition to (or instead of) individual accounts dates back to the earliest days of the company. But it took the development of machine learning tools and the hiring of a human editorial team, among other things, to make it happen.

As a journalist who spends eight or so hours a day paying at least glancing attention to the Twitter timeline, I’m a somewhat poor test case for the value of Topics. I follow people whose work is relevant to my own and very few others. Generally speaking, if it matters to the companies I cover, I don’t miss it.

“The main reason that people come to Twitter is to keep up on the things that they’re interested in.”

But I’m also a pro wrestling nerd who recently started an alternate account to keep up with wrestling Twitter. (I had found that tweets about SummerSlam were underperforming on my main account. If you can imagine!) The minute I created my new account, I was in the same spot as my comedy-loving friend: knowing there were lots of good tweets out there for me but not at all clear on where to look.

I did the obvious things: following the big pro wrestling federations, the top stars, and a handful of wrestling journalists and podcasters. But when Twitter enabled Topics for my account, I could also just follow “WWE.” Suddenly, a new icon appeared as I scrolled, indicating that the tweet I was reading had come from a topic I was following.

During a recent visit to the Twitter office, Bishop walked me through how tweets in a topic like WWE get selected for the timeline. First, Twitter scans incoming tweets for keywords like “WWE,” “pro wrestling,” and so on. (It can’t search for those terms in images and videos, at least not yet.) Second, Twitter searches to see if the tweet is from someone who normally tweets about that topic as a measure of credibility. Finally, Twitter looks at engagement: how many other people who care about this topic liked, retweeted, or replied to a tweet? The more people are interacting with the tweet, the more likely it is to make the cut.

The first and most obvious challenge here comes in picking the right tweets to include in the timeline. In my experience, Twitter’s algorithms tended to be a little obvious. Many of the first tweets I saw came from official WWE accounts and the accounts of their wrestlers. Some of that is fine, of course, but a lot of those high-engagement tweets are just naked self-promotion and aren’t particularly valuable to me. (I already know what time the pay-per-view starts on Sunday, thank you.)

After a few days of testing, though, I started seeing more relevant tweets. I learned that WWE had renewed its morally bankrupt deal with the Saudi Arabian government, thanks to a Topics tweet inserted into my timeline from a journalist I hadn’t been following. Another Topics tweet came on the same subject from an ordinary wrestling fan who offered some spicy, relevant commentary. It was everything I hoped Topics would be.

The second challenge in perfecting Topics comes in balance: how many Topics tweets should Twitter show you? Bishop told me that, as a general rule, the fewer individual accounts you follow, the more Topics tweets you are likely to see. That seems like a reasonable approach. I follow fewer than 100 people on my wrestling alt account, and many of the tweets in my timeline are just tweets that the people I follow have liked. Tweets from Topics have so far been at least as good as those, and they’re often better.

Still, a vocal subset of Twitter users is extremely picky about which tweets appear in their timeline. (When other people’s likes started appearing in the feed, seemingly at random, my own timeline filled up with the howls of aggrieved users.) Twitter executives hope that Topics is widely used, but I wouldn’t be surprised if power users decide it isn’t for them.

One topic you won’t find included in the initial batch: politics. The company tells me it’s sensitive to the potential unintended consequences of its algorithms offering additional amplification to tweets about sensitive subjects, and so it’s sticking to lighter fare to start.

Tweets about many popular subjects may now travel further than ever before

Bishop says the feature will shine for followers of big fandoms, such as major professional sports teams or the Korean boy band BTS. The group and its members represent one of the most discussed subjects on all of Twitter, he said, and yet, there are few official accounts on which to follow daily developments. (Get well soon, Jungkook!) That left fans searching for fan accounts, even though Twitter has a good idea of what the top accounts are. Now, fans can just follow the BTS topic, and Twitter will surface popular tweets about the band.

If Topics succeeds, Bishop said, the average person won’t follow fewer individual accounts. In fact, he said, they will likely follow more. It also means that your tweets about many popular subjects may now travel further than ever before, which can be a mixed blessing, as anyone who has ever seen a tweet go viral and faced harassment as a result can testify.

So what’s next? More topics, including on subjects that are popular internationally, Bishop said. The team is also working on a feature to mute topics, which could be useful for anyone who is trying to avoid spoilers for a popular television show, for example. Eventually, Bishop says, you may be able to “narrow cast” your tweet to followers of a particular subject, which is another ancient dream of Twitter users. (Imagine being able to discuss the city you live in on Twitter but only with people who are following that subject.)

The team is also working on a feature to mute topics

The company also plans to eventually let you browse topics on an explore page and to view topics on a dedicated list. (This is something that, coupled with narrow casting, could let me do all of my tweeting from a single account.)

Like some other features Twitter has released this year — the ability to search your direct messages comes to mind — Topics is a feature that feels obvious, welcome, overdue, and not quite finished. But it also feels like meaningful progress for a company that has never known what to do with the bounty of incredible tweets flowing through its servers each day.

“As with any machine learning problem, we learn the most from putting this in customers’ hands, and seeing what they engage with so we can build better models,” Bishop said. “Our goal is to get this out as quickly as possible and get people using it so we can improve our algorithms.”",www.theverge.com,left,zzkjinLBHepHRGbe

The 2020 election is going to be unlike any other. It was already going to be a heated campaign, and that was before the pandemic — and before the killing of George Floyd and so many others forced us yet again to confront the painful reality of systemic racism in America. People want accountability, and in a democracy the ultimate way we do that is through voting.

With so much of our discourse taking place online, I believe platforms like Facebook can play a positive role in this election by helping Americans use their voice where it matters most — by voting. We're announcing on Wednesday the largest voting information campaign in American history. Our goal is to help 4 million people register to vote.

I believe Facebook has a responsibility not just to prevent voter suppression — which disproportionately targets people of color — but also to actively support well-informed voter engagement, registration and turnout.

Voting details on Facebook, Instagram

To achieve this, we're creating a new Voting Information Center with authoritative information, including how and when to vote, as well as details about voter registration, voting by mail and information about early voting. We'll also include posts from state election officials and verified local election authorities.

Best way to hold leaders accountable

►Finally, we remain committed to giving everyone a voice. This is especially true for those who haven't historically had the ability to make their voices heard. Every election is a conversation about what we care about as a country — and every day millions of Americans participate in that conversation on Facebook. Free expression is part of the messy process of democracy, and we take our responsibility to protect it incredibly seriously.

Everyone wants to see politicians held accountable for what they say — and I know many people want us to moderate and remove more of their content. We have rules against speech that will cause imminent physical harm or suppress voting, and no one is exempt from them. But accountability only works if we can see what those seeking our votes are saying, even if we viscerally dislike what they say.

Ultimately, I believe the best way to hold politicians accountable is through voting, and I believe we should trust voters to make judgments for themselves. That's why I think we should maintain as open a platform as possible, accompanied by ambitious efforts to boost voter participation.

Election protection:Amid the coronavirus, all Americans should vote by mail in fall 2020

By giving people a voice, registering and turning out voters, and preventing interference, I believe Facebook is supporting and strengthening our democracy in 2020 and beyond. And for those of you who've already made up your minds and just want the election to be over, we hear you — so we're also introducing the ability to turn off seeing political ads. We'll still remind you to vote.

███ is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power . Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they ’ re published .
On April 3 , Terrence K. Williams , a politically conservative actor and comedian who ’ s been praised by President Donald Trump , assured his nearly 3 million followers on Facebook that Democrats would light ballots on fire or throw them away . Wearing a red “ Keep America Great ” hat , Williams declared , “ If you mail in your vote , your vote will be in Barack Obama ’ s fireplace. ” The video has been viewed more than 350,000 times .
On May 8 , Peggy Hubbard , a Navy veteran and police officer who this year sought the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat from Illinois , warned on Facebook that the country was heading toward civil war . “ Your democracy , your freedom is being stripped away from you , and if you allow that then everything this country stood for , fought for , bled for is all in vain. ” The cause ? California ’ s recent expansion of voting by mail : “ The only way you will be able to vote in the upcoming election in November is by mail only , ” Hubbard said . The video has attracted more than 209,000 views .
On June 27 , Pamela Geller , an anti-Muslim activist with nearly 1.3 million followers , weighed in . “ Mail-in ballots guarantee that the Democrats will commit voter fraud , ” she said on Facebook .
There ’ s no evidence for any of these statements . While California will mail absentee ballots to all registered voters , polling places will also be available . Voter fraud is exceedingly rare , including with mail-in ballots . A recent Washington Post analysis analyzed three states with all-mail elections — Colorado , Oregon and Washington — and found just 372 potential irregularities among 14.6 million votes , or 0.0025 % .
Facebook ’ s community standards ban “ misrepresentation of who can vote , qualifications for voting , whether a vote will be counted , and what information and/or materials must be provided in order to vote. ” But an analysis by ███ and First Draft , a global nonprofit that researches misinformation , shows that Facebook is rife with false or misleading claims about voting , particularly regarding voting by mail , which is the safest way of casting a ballot during the pandemic . Many of these falsehoods appear to violate Facebook ’ s standards yet have not been taken down or labeled as inaccurate . Some of them , generalizing from one or two cases , portrayed people of color as the face of voter fraud .
The false claims , including conspiracy theories about stolen elections or outright misrepresentations about voting by mail by Trump and prominent conservative outlets , are often among the most popular posts about voting on Facebook , according to a review of engagement data from CrowdTangle , a Facebook-owned analytics tool .

On Facebook , interactions — the number of comments , likes , reactions and shares that a post attracts — are a proxy for popularity . Of the top 50 posts , ranked by total interactions , that mentioned voting by mail since April 1 , 22 contained false or substantially misleading claims about voting , particularly about mail-in ballots .
“ We have a long history in this country of voter suppression that goes all the way back to our founding , ” said Jessica Gonzalez , the co-CEO of Free Press , an advocacy group focused on media and technology . “ This is a new way to suppress the vote , and I don ’ t know why Facebook wants any part of it . ”
In an email , Geller said that “ what I wrote was factual and accurate ” and that the contention that voter fraud is rare “ is ridiculous on its face. ” She added : “ You ’ re trying to deceive your readers into not believing what they see with their own eyes . ”
Hubbard and Williams did not respond to questions . After ███ flagged their posts to Facebook , it deleted them .
A Facebook spokesperson said that the company is “ running the largest voting information campaign in American history , ” including aiming to register 4 million voters . It plans to create a Voting Information Center — a box on top of user feeds — “ to connect people with authoritative information about the elections ” and add labels that link voting-related posts to official election information .
“ Making sure people have accurate information about voting is especially critical during the COVID crisis , ” the spokesperson said .
From March to May 2020 , Facebook removed more than 100,000 pieces of content from Facebook and Instagram for violating its policies against voter suppression , according to the company ’ s website . CEO Mark Zuckerberg said last month that he stands against “ anything that incites violence or suppresses voting . ”
███ and First Draft tracked Facebook posts using voting-related keywords — including the terms “ vote by mail , ” “ mail-in ballots , ” “ voter fraud ” and “ stolen elections ” — since early April , when Trump began attacking voting by mail . Mentions of these voting-related terms nearly tripled on Facebook , with interest in the topic spiking after Twitter attached a fact-checking label to Trump ’ s false tweets and directed users to a fact-check page on May 26 . Twitter ’ s intervention prompted Trump to claim that Twitter is “ interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election ” and “ stifling FREE SPEECH. ” Facebook has refused to take down Trump ’ s false claims about voting by mail .
Facebook ’ s inaction on Trump ’ s posts spurred pushback over misinformation on the site . Gonzalez helped organize an advertising boycott of Facebook that now includes more than 1,000 companies and some of the platform ’ s biggest advertisers . Among other demands , they ’ re calling on Facebook to remove voting misinformation .
In a long-awaited assessment of its civil rights record , Facebook was faulted last week for being “ far too reluctant to adopt strong rules to limit misinformation and voter suppression. ” Also last week , civil rights groups met with Facebook executives , including Zuckerberg , to push their demands and came away disappointed .
“ It was all talk , no action , ” Gonzalez said . “ We hear words like ‘ We know we need to do better ’ and ‘ We ’ re working on this , ’ and yet misinformation still seems to be quite pervasive on the site . ”

Postal delays and mistakes have marred primary voting , and after years of budget cuts and plant closures , mail delivery has slowed so much that ballot deadlines in many states are no longer realistic .
Facebook expects to meet one of the groups ’ demands by hiring a vice president to coordinate civil rights issues internally , according to the company .
The posts identified by ███ and First Draft offer outright false claims about voting , blend opinion and factual errors , or mislead users about the reliability of voting methods . Facebook has said it is committed to both free speech and to providing reliable information about voting , but those goals may sometimes conflict .
Facebook has removed more than 90 % of false posts referred to it by VoteSure , a 2018 initiative by the state of California to educate voters and flag misinformation , Secretary of State Alex Padilla said . In VoteSure ’ s first election , the 2018 midterms , 272 of 276 posts and tweets reported to social media platforms were taken down .
Still , VoteSure only identifies a small portion of misinformation , and Facebook needs to do more , Padilla said . The platform , he said , has made progress but still has “ baseless outright lies , claims about massive voter fraud , and posts that are clearly wrong , or clearly erroneous . ”
Trump ’ s false attacks on voting by mail had a total of 3.8 million interactions on Facebook . Among them , a Trump post that falsely claimed Nevada had illegally sent out ballots had the most interactions of any post that has mentioned vote by mail in the last 12 months in the U.S. Trump ’ s false claim that California is sending ballots to “ anyone living in the state , no matter who they are or how they got there ” drew the third most interactions of any post that mentioned voting over the same period , ranking behind a post from Obama and a pro-Trump meme .
In recent months , Trump has also claimed on Facebook that “ mail-in ballots will lead to a “ RIGGED ELECTION ! ” and falsely said they are “ substantially fraudulent ” ; he made false statements about the legality of actions taken by election officials in Michigan and Nevada ; and he misrepresented his own power to deny funding to states that expand vote by mail . Trump continued those false claims last week , arguing a debunked distinction between mail-in voting and absentee voting .
“ What is frustrating is that Trump can post or tweet whatever he wants without the proper checks and balances , ” Padilla said . “ What keeps me up at night is that he ’ s clearly setting the stage to question election results that he might not like in November . ”
Breitbart , a conservative website that has long championed Trump , has had more engagement on its voting-related stories than any other publisher from April until July 1 , according to our analysis . In fact , voting-related stories on Breitbart have garnered more interactions since April than equivalent articles by The Washington Post , The New York Times and NBC News combined . Many of the Breitbart posts are misleading at best . “ Obama ratchets up Democrats ’ Cheat-by-Mail scheme ! ” read one post , linking to a story that misleadingly framed how often voter fraud occurs . Another post declared : “ Flooding the nation with ballots that can be stolen , sold , discarded , and forged—THAT ’ s the path to Leftist victory in November . ”
In a video by Fox Nation , Fox News ’ streaming service , that has been viewed nearly 500,000 times , host Tomi Lahren said , “ I firmly believe the only way Donald Trump loses in November is because of voter fraud. ” In the video , Lahren falsely claims that voter fraud is rampant in California . “ You think coronavirus is a crisis , wait till you see the voter fraud epidemic we have here in California . And mark my words it ’ s heading to your state like a diseased bat out of hell. ” ( There ’ s no evidence that voter fraud is rampant in California , or in any other state . )
“ This is an editorial video , not a news report , which is very clear to any Fox Nation viewer , ” said John Finley , executive vice president of development for Fox News Media . The White House , the Trump campaign and Breitbart did not respond to requests for comment .
In a Facebook group dedicated to fans of Candace Owens , a conservative commentator , one post circulated a 2016 video that describes a widely debunked conspiracy theory linking billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros to “ rigged ” voting machines . The post has received more than 16,000 shares . Soros ’ Open Society Foundations donate to ███ .
Claims of “ stolen elections ” were common across the political spectrum . A post by the left-leaning page Ridin ’ With Biden contended that Trump and Kanye West were trying to steal the election . A clip of Joe Biden saying that his “ single greatest concern ” is that Trump would try to “ steal the election ” was touted as evidence of a conspiracy by Republicans . Other claims of stolen elections have come from Secure America Now , quoting Newt Gingrich ; Trump ’ s former White House doctor Ronny Jackson , now running for Congress ; and liberal accounts like StandWithMueller and Occupy Democrats .
Facebook is reportedly considering banning political ads in the days before the election . But our review showed that misinformation or false claims about voting by mail on Facebook are rarer in paid political ads than in posts . The vast majority of ads that used voting-related terms were factual and promoted voter participation broadly , including ads from Democratic and Republican groups , nonpartisan voting organizations and state election offices . However , we did find a handful of ads that pushed questionable claims about voting by mail .
A group called Morning in Nevada PAC , created by supporters of Adam Laxalt , the state ’ s former Republican attorney general , has launched a handful of ads attacking voting by mail , spending between $ 14,800 and $ 20,998 this year , according to a search of Facebook ’ s political ad library . Some of these ads make unsubstantiated claims that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is trying to fix the election using mail-in voting .
A similar ad from the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs describes absentee ballots as the “ ‘ tool of choice ’ for those who are engaging in election fraud . ”
Several posts identified by ███ and First Draft seized on isolated incidents to link people of color to voter fraud , a tactic reminiscent of the 1988 George H.W . Bush campaign ad that featured mug shots of Willie Horton , a Black felon who committed a rape while on a weekend furlough , to paint Michael Dukakis as weak on crime . One meme-like post has appeared on at least 136 Facebook pages and groups , including Hubbard ’ s , as well as groups like “ 2nd Amendment Hotties ” and “ Dullards for Trump , ” which have produced 100,838 interactions . The post features a headshot of Sherikia Hawkins , a former Southfield , Michigan , clerk . Text on the image reads :
“ THE DEMOCRAT CLERK OF SOUTHFIELD , MICHIGAN IS FACING TRIAL ON 6 FELONY COUNTS OF VOTER FRAUD FOR EDITING HUNDREDS OF BALLOTS . PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN RIGHT ALL ALONG ABOUT DEMOCRATS ’ ELECTION TAMPERING AND VOTER FRAUD . ”
The post is inaccurate . Hawkins was not charged with editing ballots themselves . She was charged in state court with altering voter records used to track ballots . No voters were disenfranchised . Hawkins , who has not yet entered a plea , is expected to face trial this year .
In June , a Patterson , New Jersey , city councilman and a councilman-elect , along with two other men , were charged with illegally collecting ballots from voters and delivering them to an election office . New Jersey prohibits anyone from delivering more than three ballots on behalf of voters . The case is pending , and the councilman and councilman-elect have said they will plead not guilty . On Facebook , Breitbart and several other conservative pages have displayed mugshots of the defendants , all of whom are people of color , to suggest that voter fraud is rampant .
“ There is already a sense in the Black community that our votes will be lost and that the election won ’ t be fair , ” said Brandi Collins-Dexter , a senior campaign director at Color of Change , a civil rights group organizing the ad boycott . “ What this stuff does is just confuse people and sow distrust . ”
Though vote by mail was less controversial before the pandemic , misinformation about other aspects of voting also plagued Facebook in 2016 . Before Rhode Island ’ s presidential primary that year , Bernie Sanders supporters wrongly accused its secretary of state , Nellie Gorbea , on social media of suppressing turnout , based on a news report that the number of open polling places would be considerably less than in a November general election .
However , it ’ s common for states to have fewer polling locations during a primary , when turnout is lower . Rhode Island actually had 15 more locations available than in the 2012 presidential primary . In any case , the state Board of Elections , not Gorbea , was in charge of polling places .
“ In 24 hours , we received thousands of comments on Facebook and Twitter , ” Gorbea said . “ Nothing would quell it. ” Her office received angry messages from 36 states and three countries , but just one message from a Rhode Island constituent . Her office has since hired a full-time employee to monitor social media .
Exaggerating the prevalence of voting fraud can backfire . In a study released in June , researchers showed respondents a series of tweets . Some were actual 2018 tweets by Trump , Florida Gov . Rick Scott and Republican Sens . Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio that put forth unfounded claims of voter fraud ; others were more generic “ placebo ” tweets . The false claims reduced confidence in elections for everyone , the researchers found , especially Republicans and those who approve of Trump . Those groups “ reported significantly lower confidence in elections after exposure to a low dose of voter fraud allegations even when those claims were countered by fact-checks . ”
As a result , Trump ’ s rhetoric may cause fewer Republicans to vote by mail than Democrats , said Brendan Nyhan , one of the authors of the study and a political scientist at Dartmouth College . Still , Nyhan is worried about broader effects of misinformation . “ The problem has clearly gotten worse in terms of elite rhetoric , ” Nyhan said . “ We ’ ve seen what happens in other countries when there isn ’ t a shared trust in the rules of the game in democracy and it ’ s not good . ”
For now , misinformation may be difficult to stop before it goes viral . On July 13 , conservatives on Facebook pounced on a video in which an unidentified Trump supporter said she was denied the right to vote , apparently in Louisiana . Many of these pages framed it as evidence of voter fraud and a Democratic plot to steal the election . By the time the post was deemed false by PolitiFact , a Facebook fact-checking partner , it had received more than 3.7 million views and been shared more than 170,000 times .","While the social media giant says it opposes voter suppression, the data shows a stark picture: Nearly half of all top-performing posts that mentioned voting by mail were false or misleading.

On April 3, Terrence K. Williams, a politically conservative actor and comedian who’s been praised by President Donald Trump, assured his nearly 3 million followers on Facebook that Democrats would light ballots on fire or throw them away. Wearing a red “Keep America Great” hat, Williams declared, “If you mail in your vote, your vote will be in Barack Obama’s fireplace.” The video has been viewed more than 350,000 times.

On May 8, Peggy Hubbard, a Navy veteran and police officer who this year sought the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat from Illinois, warned on Facebook that the country was heading toward civil war. “Your democracy, your freedom is being stripped away from you, and if you allow that then everything this country stood for, fought for, bled for is all in vain.” The cause? California’s recent expansion of voting by mail: “The only way you will be able to vote in the upcoming election in November is by mail only,” Hubbard said. The video has attracted more than 209,000 views.

On June 27, Pamela Geller, an anti-Muslim activist with nearly 1.3 million followers, weighed in. “Mail-in ballots guarantee that the Democrats will commit voter fraud,” she said on Facebook.

There’s no evidence for any of these statements. While California will mail absentee ballots to all registered voters, polling places will also be available. Voter fraud is exceedingly rare, including with mail-in ballots. A recent Washington Post analysis analyzed three states with all-mail elections — Colorado, Oregon and Washington — and found just 372 potential irregularities among 14.6 million votes, or 0.0025%.

Lee, Alissa Wilkinson, Sigal Samuel, Terry Nguyen, Rebecca Jennings, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz","Google is halting sales of Glass , the groundbreaking computer you wear on your face . Google says it 's not dropping support for the product ; instead , the company is working on transforming Glass from an experimental device into a mainstream consumer product . The Glass team will now report to Tony Fadell . Fadell was a key member of Apple 's iPod team and then co-founded the home automation company Nest , which Google acquired last year for $ 3.2 billion .
Google Glass has been one of the search giant 's highest-profile product announcements in recent years , with co-founder Sergey Brin taking an active role in the project . Glass was formally announced in 2012 , and the device was released to developers in 2013 .
And then ... not much happened . Developers have experimented with the device , but have n't come up with any breakthrough applications for it . Software updates from Google have slowed . The project 's founder was poached by Amazon in July . As Ars Technica put it in December , `` The official forums , once a bustling hive of optimism , now mostly discuss declining usage or low morale among remaining Glass users . ''
The mainstream release of the product , originally slated for 2014 , never happened .
One big reason Glass has n't caught on is the cost . At a price of $ 1,500 , Glass needs some pretty compelling applications to get people to buy one . And with few people buying them , there was little reason for developers to create Glass software .
And Glass has also attracted a lot of public hostility . Many people do n't like the idea of someone walking around with a camera attached to their face , potentially taking a picture at any time . Many people also believe that Glass users look ridiculous .
Most importantly , Google has struggled to make the case that Glass is actually useful . The efficiency gains from having your computer screen attached to your glasses , instead of in your pocket , do n't seem very big . And while Google has done impressive work making Glass user-friendly , the user interface still strikes many people as clumsy compared with a touchscreen phone .
Despite Glass 's poor reception , Google says it 's not giving up . The company is hard at work building the next iteration of the device .
One intriguing possibility is that Google may shift its focus from the mainstream consumer market to more specialized applications in the workplace . Six weeks ago , the Wall Street Journal reported that Google had inked a deal with Intel to supply the chips needed to power the next iteration of Google Glass .
`` Google is working with software developers including Augmedix Inc. and APX Labs LLC to encourage use of Glass in industries such as health care , construction and manufacturing where employees work with their hands but need information , '' the Journal reported .
Marketing Glass at work could address several of the product 's challenges simultaneously . A device that 's worn only at work would raise fewer privacy concerns than one that 's routinely worn at social functions . And while consumers might balk at paying $ 1,500 for a gadget , employers routinely spend much more than that on equipment to make their workers more productive .
Still , in November Google was still insisting that it expected Glass to be a mainstream consumer device . To make that happen , they 'll have to create a device impressive enough to overcome growing public skepticism about the technology .","Google is halting sales of Glass, the groundbreaking computer you wear on your face.

Google Glass has been one of the search giant's highest-profile product announcements in recent years, with co-founder Sergey Brin taking an active role in the project. Glass was formally announced in 2012, and the device was released to developers in 2013.

And then ... not much happened. Developers have experimented with the device, but haven't come up with any breakthrough applications for it. Software updates from Google have slowed. The project's founder was poached by Amazon in July. As Ars Technica put it in December, ""The official forums, once a bustling hive of optimism, now mostly discuss declining usage or low morale among remaining Glass users.""

The mainstream release of the product, originally slated for 2014, never happened.

One big reason Glass hasn't caught on is the cost. At a price of $1,500, Glass needs some pretty compelling applications to get people to buy one. And with few people buying them, there was little reason for developers to create Glass software.

And Glass has also attracted a lot of public hostility. Many people don't like the idea of someone walking around with a camera attached to their face, potentially taking a picture at any time. Many people also believe that Glass users look ridiculous.

Most importantly, Google has struggled to make the case that Glass is actually useful. The efficiency gains from having your computer screen attached to your glasses, instead of in your pocket, don't seem very big. And while Google has done impressive work making Glass user-friendly, the user interface still strikes many people as clumsy compared with a touchscreen phone.

Will Glass shift to the workplace?

Despite Glass's poor reception, Google says it's not giving up. The company is hard at work building the next iteration of the device.

One intriguing possibility is that Google may shift its focus from the mainstream consumer market to more specialized applications in the workplace. Six weeks ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google had inked a deal with Intel to supply the chips needed to power the next iteration of Google Glass.

""Google is working with software developers including Augmedix Inc. and APX Labs LLC to encourage use of Glass in industries such as health care, construction and manufacturing where employees work with their hands but need information,"" the Journal reported.

Marketing Glass at work could address several of the product's challenges simultaneously. A device that's worn only at work would raise fewer privacy concerns than one that's routinely worn at social functions. And while consumers might balk at paying $1,500 for a gadget, employers routinely spend much more than that on equipment to make their workers more productive.

Still, in November Google was still insisting that it expected Glass to be a mainstream consumer device. To make that happen, they'll have to create a device impressive enough to overcome growing public skepticism about the technology.

NEW YORK (AP) — Twitter permanently banned right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his Infowars show for abusive behavior, a day after CEO Jack Dorsey testified before Congress about alleged bias against conservatives on the platform.

The company said Jones won’t be able to create new accounts on Twitter or take over any existing ones. In a tweet, it said it would continue to monitor reports about other accounts potentially associated with Jones or Infowars, and will “take action” if it finds any attempts to circumvent the ban.

Twitter said Jones posted a video on Wednesday that violates the company’s policy against “abusive behavior.” That video showed Jones berating CNN journalist Oliver Darcy for some 10 minutes in between two congressional hearings on social media. Dorsey testified at both hearings, but did not appear to witness the confrontation.

Jones had about 900,000 followers on Twitter. Infowars had about 430,000. Jones did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone praised Twitter’s action in a tweet. “Glad Twitter is taking steps to put an end to the abusive behavior from Alex Jones & Infowars,” the tweet stated. “Tweets designed to threaten, belittle, demean and silence individuals have no place on this platform.”

Twitter had previously suspended Jones for a week. But until now it had resisted muzzling Jones further. Other tech companies have limited Jones by suspending him for longer periods, as Facebook did, and by taking down his pages and radio stations.

Jones heckled Darcy in a Capitol Hill hallway where reporters were waiting to enter the House committee room. He criticized the journalist’s reporting and appearance, referencing his “skinny jeans” and repeatedly saying, “just look at this guy’s eyes” and “look at that smile.”

At one point, he said Darcy was “smiling like a possum that crawled out of the rear end of a dead cow. That’s what you look like. You look like a possum that got caught doing some really nasty stuff — in my view. You’re a public figure too.”

Darcy has aggressively questioned social media companies about the forbearance they showed Jones, asking why they have allowed him to remain on their platforms for as long as they have.

Jones is currently active on Facebook; his personal suspension there recently expired. Apple, YouTube and Spotify also permanently removed material Jones had published. Facebook did not immediately respond to a message asking whether it would also ban Jones.

Dorsey originally defended his company’s decision not to ban Jones, tweeting that Jones “hasn’t violated our rules” but if he does “we’ll enforce.”

“We’re going to hold Jones to the same standard we hold to every account, not taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term, and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories,” Dorsey tweeted on Aug. 7 , after the other companies took action against Jones.

But a week later Twitter joined the other tech companies in muzzling Jones, even if it was only for a week. It was a significant move for a company one of its executives once called the “free speech wing of the free speech party.”

In May 2008 , the hedge fund investor warned that Lehman Brothers was headed for trouble . Five months later , Lehman declared bankruptcy and officially kicked off the worst financial crash since the Great Depression .
So when his current fund , Greenlight Capital , sent a letter to investors on April 22 warning that tech stocks were getting a little frothy , shock waves spread instantly .
`` There is a clear consensus that we are witnessing our second tech bubble in 15 years , '' wrote Einhorn . `` What is uncertain is how much further the bubble can expand and what might pop it . ''
The month of April offered some clear support for Einhorn 's views . Even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average pushed toward record highs , tech stocks embarked on a nerve-rackingly bumpy ride . The NASDAQ index is about 4 percent off its recent peak , and momentum seems to have drained right out of the previously thriving IPO scene . Just this week , Twitter investors hammered the high-profile social media company for a mildly disappointing earnings report .
And yet , even as cracks have started to show , venture capitalists and private equity investors are still funneling vast amounts of money into existing start-ups and early-stage companies . If anything , they 've been opening the spigot up wider than ever . In the first quarter of 2014 , VCs pumped a staggering $ 10 billion into tech . It 's been more than a decade since it was this easy to shake the money tree .
Pessimists are warning , however , that even the easy availability of capital can be seen as another warning sign . Companies are frantically loading up on cash now , because they know -- everybody knows -- that the business cycle will inevitably turn down . With the vast majority of these start-ups a long , long way from turning a profit , it 's only prudent to stash away as much cash as you can while the getting is still good . Because , like it or not , sooner or later , the bubble will pop .
But if times are destined to get tough for even the current front-runners of the tech boom , then what does that mean for the rest of us ? Because there 's a crucial difference between this boom and the last one that is not getting enough attention . Last time around , the average U.S. worker did pretty well : In the 1990s , the median wage rose steadily , while unemployment fell to its lowest point in generations . The economy as a whole added an incredible 21 million jobs . Point being : The prosperity was shared .
Compare that to the current tech boom . Wages have stagnated , and household income has fallen . Unemployment is still historically high and job growth has been tepid , at best . Even as all those billions of dollars of investor capital have poured into tech companies , workers -- outside of a few regional hot spots like northern California -- just are n't reaping the kinds of benefits we would hope for in even a borderline healthy economy .
There 's good reason why everyone wants to know when the bubble is going to pop : It 's not just unlucky investors who keep their money in the stock market who will get burned . If workers are n't doing well during a major stock market boom -- propelled by astonishing tech sector growth -- then how will they cope when the market goes bust ?
The next turn of the business cycle is going to expose some ugly truths about how the current American economy is structured , and it 's going to poke some major holes in Silicon Valley 's pollyanna parade . Right now , it 's easy enough for Silicon Valley 's best and brightest to gab away about how they are changing the world by helping people learn how to trust each other and become more connected . But when push comes to shove , we 're going to discover that Silicon Valley will be far more obsessed with protecting the interests of its shareholders than in ensuring that the actual consumers of their services are treated as well as possible . If the boom already sucks for the average American , the bust is going to be much , much worse .
For a sense of how all this might play out , let 's take a closer look at one specific sector of the tech economy that has been getting more than its fair share of headlines in recent months : the so-called sharing economy . Companies like Airbnb , Lyft , TaskRabbit , Uber and even DogVacay offer a perfect snapshot of the contemporary Silicon Valley zeitgeist .
Their rhetoric is world-changing and socially uplifting -- the current cover story in Wired magazine boasts the headline : `` How Airbnb and Lyft Finally Got Americans to Trust Each Other . '' Their profits are nonexistent , but their ability to raise capital is fantastic : In just the last month , reports Jeremiah Owyang , an analyst who specializes in the sharing economy , a handful of companies in the `` collaborative economy '' raised a remarkable $ 852 million .
In truth , these companies offer the perfect illustration of how current economic trends are not working for the average American . Their business models are explicitly predicated on helping people who are economically struggling . The sharing economy , by and large , provides platforms for people to squeeze a few extra dollars on the side to help pay the bills . The fact that , as a consequence , we are having more meaningful relationships with strangers is an accidental byproduct . The real driver here -- as New York magazine 's Kevin Roose captured perfectly in his reaction to Wired 's cover story -- is desperation , not a craving for more trust . We 're sharing our belongings -- or to be more precise , offering short-term rentals on them -- because we have been forced to do so by our economic circumstances .
There is no question that sharing-economy companies have created effective platforms for more effective distribution and allocation of resources . The Internet makes it insanely easy to share , or sublet , or outsource -- whatever you want to call it . But as Sarah Kessler demonstrated in an article for Fast Company -- aptly titled `` Pixeled and Dimed '' -- this does n't mean that living off the sharing economy is easy . Quite the contrary : It turns out to be quite difficult to stitch together gigs and short-term rentals into a decent living . It 's exhausting and demeaning .
In terms of actual compensation , it 's pretty clear that the `` gig economy '' facilitated by TaskRabbit , and FancyHands , and Amazon 's Mechanical Turk are exerting downward pressure on wages , by widening the pool of potential job applicants for any given task to essentially everyone with Internet access . When we 're all competing for the opportunity to open someone 's mail or mow their lawn or pick up their groceries , the lowest bid tends to win . The sharing economy does n't just efficiently exploit our possessions ; it ruthlessly exploits our labor .
The disjunction between how hard it is to make money as a consumer of the sharing economy , compared to the potential windfall from owning the platforms that facilitate it , is ludicrously massive . Airbnb just raised $ 450 million , giving the company a market valuation of $ 10 billion . Is there any better snapshot of inequality in America then the fact that a platform that enables you to sublet your spare bedroom and help you make your rent is worth $ 10 billion ? Yes , the users are happy to get what assistance they can in making end 's meet . But when IPO day comes along , the owners of the platform will transform into instant card-carrying members of the 1 percent .
And therein lies the rub : Once IPO day does arrive , or some larger publicly traded company comes around to gobble you up , the incentives that guide management behavior change significantly . Maximizing shareholder value becomes paramount . And that 's a very big deal in a downturn .
As my former colleague Scott Rosenberg wrote this week , in a blog post titled `` Lies Our Bubbles Taught Us , '' it is extremely unwise to accept at face value the ubiquitous start-up entrepreneur claim that `` we will always put our users first . ''
Many startup founders are passionate about their dedication to their users , in what is really Silicon Valley ’ s modern twist on the age-old adage that “ the customer always comes first. ” One of the side-effects of a bubble is that small companies can defer the messy business of extracting cash profits from customers and devote their energy to pampering users . Hooray ! That makes life good for everyone for a while . The trouble arises when founders forget that there is a sharp and usually irreconcilable conflict between “ putting the user first ” and delivering profits to investors . The best companies find creative ways to delay this reckoning , but no one escapes it .
As we wait for the current bubble to pop , it is instructive to apply Rosenberg 's insight to the business models of the sharing economy . The great genius of Airbnb and Lyft and all the rest is that they have figured out ways to avoid bearing the huge costs that afflict the industries they are `` disrupting . '' Airbnb owns no hotels , Lyft owns no cars , the people who get temp work through TaskRabbit are n't actually employees of TaskRabbit . There 's also plenty of skimping on the consumer protections that existing industries are required to offer , by law .
Right now , sharing economy companies are scrambling to address consumer protection concerns and other regulatory constraints . ( Uber 's recent institution of a $ 1 `` safety fee '' on its rides explicitly recognized that the task of vetting drivers and accounting for insurance adds expenses to the bottom line . ) But reconciling those accounts -- taking care of users and generating a real profit -- will become much harder , and perhaps even impossible , when the economic tide finally turns .
But maybe the news wo n't be all bad . Because here 's the silver lining underneath the next bust . The sharing economy , like Wal-Mart and McDonald 's , may turn out to be more-or-less recession-proof . A business model based on helping people squeeze extra pennies out of freelance jobs or more efficiently maximize income from one 's existing possessions is well positioned to thrive in a down economy . Come to think of it , Silicon Valley may have solved the business cycle . A business model that works when workers are getting rough treatment in a reasonably functioning economy will really hit its stride when everything goes to hell , again .

Former Cambridge Analytica staffers tell CNN that Bannon 's vision came to fruition through their previous employer , which they described as a weapon of psychological warfare . They say that Cambridge Analytica 's parent company had worked on government and military contracts that aimed to change foreign populations ' behaviors , which aligned with Bannon 's intentions .
Two former employees said that Bannon was personally involved in the company 's early stages and that he played a direct role shaping its strategy and goals .
`` This was Steve Bannon 's baby , '' said former contractor Christopher Wylie , who described Cambridge Analytica as `` Bannon 's arsenal of weaponry to wage a culture war on America using military strategies . ''
Bannon wanted to use the sorts of aggressive messaging tactics usually reserved for geopolitical conflicts to move the US electorate further to the right , Wylie said . He had already directed a series of anti-establishment , conservative documentary films and presided over the far-right website Breitbart News , but Cambridge Analytica would mark another step in his overall ambitions to transform the nation .
With financial backing from hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer , Bannon co-founded Cambridge Analytica in 2013 as the US-branch of Strategic Communication Laboratories ( SCL ) Group , a British company that advertises how it has conducted `` behavioral change '' programs in more than 60 countries .
Wylie described Cambridge Analytica as `` Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer using a foreign , military contractor ... to use some of the same techniques that the military uses ... on the American electorate . ''
Bannon and Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment to this story .
SCL Group has consulted numerous government agencies and organizations on psychological operations and strategic messaging since the 1990s . The company has offered clients `` research and analysis that yields intervention strategies aimed at specific behaviors , '' according to its website
That work has included an examination of ways to reduce recruitment into violent jihadist groups in Pakistan in 2009 , a communication program aimed at decreasing the number of improvised explosive devices built in Iraq , as well as political consulting throughout sub-Saharan Africa , Southeast Asia and South America , according to SCL documents .
SCL was commissioned to train a psychological operations group that supported the British military , according to a 2012 letter by the group 's then-commanding officer .
The US State Department also contracted SCL in 2017 to conduct `` target audience research '' in order to better understand ISIS radicalization and recruitment . A State Department official told CNN the research included about 100 interviews in Europe and the Middle East .
`` SCL 's sales pitch essentially was 'Look , we go into foreign countries . We use our tools , our psychographic profiling , to manipulate public opinion . ' Ultimately that 's what Bannon wanted to do in the United States , '' said CNN political analyst Joshua Green , whose book 'Devil 's Bargain ' chronicles Bannon 's role in Trump 's election .
Cambridge Analytica has come under fire this month for its alleged use of personal data from tens of millions of Facebook users obtained through the company Global Science Research ( GSR ) without Facebook 's permission . The New York Times and The Observer of London first broke the story .
Bannon , a former White House chief strategist and Trump campaign CEO , told CNN last week that he does n't remember purchasing personal information from Facebook while working for the company .
He has said that Democrats have been leveraging social media data for campaign messaging for years but have received little scrutiny . He also said that SCL is separate from Cambridge Analytica and that the company 's `` psychographics , '' referring to personality profiles used to try to predict people 's interest , values , and opinions , were not used during the Trump campaign .
`` Cambridge Analytica is the data scientists and the applied applications here in the United States . It has nothing to do with the international stuff , '' Bannon said at the Financial Times `` Future of News '' event last week .
But four former SCL and Cambridge Analytica employees said the two companies were basically one and the same , sharing resources , holding joint meetings and using similar methodologies .
`` SCL and Cambridge were completely joined at the hip . There is no difference between the two , '' said one former Cambridge Analytica employee who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity citing fear of retribution .
Wylie said that Bannon 's plans began to solidify in 2014 , when Cambridge Analytica consulted various Republican campaigns and PACs ahead of the midterm elections . The company began to test and apply its psychographics by using Facebook data to model individuals ' personality types in order to understand how to influence them .
Documents show the John Bolton Super PAC , which promoted candidates supported by recently appointed White House national security adviser John Bolton , paid Cambridge Analytical $ 454,700 in 2014 for `` behavioral microtargeting with psychographic messaging . '' Those services included strategies that broke individual voters into `` clusters '' based on what messages would resonate with them .
Wylie also said the company used focus groups and messaging trials in 2014 to test some of the concepts that became core themes of the Trump campaign , such as `` drain the swamp '' and imagery of walls .
`` A lot of the narratives of the Trump campaign were what we were testing in 2014 , '' Wylie said .
He added that Bannon directly presided over much of the company 's initial research .
`` Everything that we were doing ultimately had to be passed up to Bannon for approval , '' said Wylie , who left the company in late 2014 .
Wylie said Bannon would fly to London about once a month for company meetings , and during that time he came to understand Bannon 's ideology .
`` He really liked the idea of using a military-style approach to changing people 's perceptions , '' Wylie said .
Although Cambridge Analytica worked to sharpen its psychographic techniques ahead of the presidential election , former Trump campaign staffers have told CNN they did not buy into those methodologies when the company began consulting for the campaign in the summer of 2016 .
Cambridge Analytica said in statement it did not use Facebook data obtained from GSR during the 2016 presidential election but rather relied on voter files from the Republican National Committee , campaign donor information and other consumer data for its operation .
At a post-election event hosted by Google in December 2016 , Cambridge Analytica 's then-head of product Matt Oczkowski said the pace of the Trump campaign led his company to rely less on personality profiling and instead focus on traditional data services .
`` We did n't really use psychographics that much because we had to walk before we could run , '' Oczkowski said .
Some political consultants and researchers say that despite the attraction of being able to sway voters through messaging based on personality data , the actual effectiveness of psychographics remains questionable .
`` Cambridge Analytica 's approach is massively overhyped just because the word 'psych ' is in it . There 's no compelling scientific evidence that the approach they 're taking is in any part effective , '' said David Rand , a Yale professor of psychology and economics , who studies human behavior .
Whether or not Cambridge Analytica played a significant role in influencing voters or sealing Trump 's victory , Wylie says Bannon 's dream became a reality .
`` He sees this as warfare , so he is going to use as aggressive of techniques as he can get away with , '' Wylie said .","(CNN) Long before Donald Trump declared his presidential candidacy, conservative strategist Steve Bannon sought to leverage data-driven technology to push the hearts and minds of voters toward his populist vision for America.

Former Cambridge Analytica staffers tell CNN that Bannon's vision came to fruition through their previous employer, which they described as a weapon of psychological warfare. They say that Cambridge Analytica's parent company had worked on government and military contracts that aimed to change foreign populations' behaviors, which aligned with Bannon's intentions.

Two former employees said that Bannon was personally involved in the company's early stages and that he played a direct role shaping its strategy and goals.

""This was Steve Bannon's baby,"" said former contractor Christopher Wylie, who described Cambridge Analytica as ""Bannon's arsenal of weaponry to wage a culture war on America using military strategies.""

Bannon wanted to use the sorts of aggressive messaging tactics usually reserved for geopolitical conflicts to move the US electorate further to the right, Wylie said. He had already directed a series of anti-establishment, conservative documentary films and presided over the far-right website Breitbart News, but Cambridge Analytica would mark another step in his overall ambitions to transform the nation.

With financial backing from hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, Bannon co-founded Cambridge Analytica in 2013 as the US-branch of Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) Group, a British company that advertises how it has conducted ""behavioral change"" programs in more than 60 countries.

Wylie described Cambridge Analytica as ""Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer using a foreign, military contractor ... to use some of the same techniques that the military uses ... on the American electorate.""

Bannon and Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment to this story.

SCL Group has consulted numerous government agencies and organizations on psychological operations and strategic messaging since the 1990s. The company has offered clients ""research and analysis that yields intervention strategies aimed at specific behaviors,"" according to its website

That work has included an examination of ways to reduce recruitment into violent jihadist groups in Pakistan in 2009, a communication program aimed at decreasing the number of improvised explosive devices built in Iraq, as well as political consulting throughout sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia and South America, according to SCL documents.

SCL was commissioned to train a psychological operations group that supported the British military, according to a 2012 letter by the group's then-commanding officer.

The US State Department also contracted SCL in 2017 to conduct ""target audience research"" in order to better understand ISIS radicalization and recruitment. A State Department official told CNN the research included about 100 interviews in Europe and the Middle East.

""SCL's sales pitch essentially was 'Look, we go into foreign countries. We use our tools, our psychographic profiling, to manipulate public opinion.' Ultimately that's what Bannon wanted to do in the United States,"" said CNN political analyst Joshua Green, whose book 'Devil's Bargain' chronicles Bannon's role in Trump's election.

Cambridge Analytica has come under fire this month for its alleged use of personal data from tens of millions of Facebook users obtained through the company Global Science Research (GSR) without Facebook's permission. The New York Times and The Observer of London first broke the story.

More people and groups would have access to information , and the ability to mobilize from the ground-up would gradually undermine concentrations of power — that was the idea , at least .
But the reality has been quite different : Instead of democratizing the world , the internet has destabilized it , creating new cleavages and reinforcing the power structure at the same time .
This is the story sociologist Jen Schradie tells in her new book The Revolution That Wasn ’ t . Schradie argues that technology is not only failing to level the playing field for activists , it ’ s actually making things worse by “ creating a digital activism gap. ” The differences in power and organization , she says , have undercut working-class movements and bolstered authoritarian groups .
I spoke to Schradie about the implications of all this and why she thinks the internet has become just another political weapon in the arsenals of the most powerful forces in our societies .
I think most people still see the internet and social media as neutral tools that can be exploited by political actors on all sides . Is that wrong ?
The internet is a tool and in that sense it ’ s neutral , but just like other communication tools from the past , people with more power , with more resources , with more organization , have been able to take advantage of it .
So take something like the television . In theory , despite some licensing issues , anyone could , if they had enough money , buy a television station — but that ’ s not really how it works .
The idea of neutrality seems more true of the internet because the costs of distributing information are dramatically lower than with something like television or radio or other communication tools .
However , to make full use of the internet , you still need substantial resources and time and motivation . The people who can afford to do this , who can fund the right digital strategy , create a major imbalance in their favor .
When did it become obvious that the digital revolution was politically dangerous ?
There have been a couple of important shifts . 2006 is a crucial moment . Back then , we still had this utopian view of the internet . That was the year Time magazine named “ You ” their “ Person of the Year. ” The front cover had this mirror of a computer monitor meaning that you , as an individual , can create online content and participate in this new public sphere .
A lot of social media platforms were either launched or became public around that time . Facebook became available to the general public in that year , so that was a really important year for this very utopian view .
2011 was another pendulum swing , because that was the year we saw the Arab Spring unfold and there was all this talk of Twitter revolutions and Facebook revolutions . We also had the Indignados movement in Spain and the burgeoning Occupy Wall Street movement in the US . The internet was a big part of all of this .
But then things started to crumble . There was Gamergate and this explosion of sexism and harassment . There was Edward Snowden and the revelations about the extent of global mass surveillance . And then , of course , 2016 is when we really went over the cliff with Brexit and the election of Donald Trump .
But I was researching digital activism in 2014 and it was already apparent to me , despite what a lot of people thought , that conservatives and authoritarian powers were seizing control of the digital space .
Why is that ? Is there something inherent to conservatism that makes it more effective in the digital sphere ? Or is the gap simply about resource disparities ?
The simple answer is that conservatives are more likely to have more resources and to take advantage of that . The other is that they ’ re more likely to have hierarchical infrastructures that make it easier to engage the digital labor that ’ s needed to promote online activism . In other words , they tend to have more top-down organizations , and that ’ s just a more efficient way to distribute labor and get the message out .
In terms of the actual ideology itself , I do think there ’ s something about the nature of conservatism that makes it easier to promote online . Conservatives tend to focus on simple , clear messages around freedom in particular . The left tends to focus on this general idea of fairness .
Conservatives are generally monolithic in their attacks on , say , Obamacare . The left wants a diverse array of voices . The left tends to want to include a lot of different people and a lot of different issues , and the result is a more muddled message that is just harder to communicate .
Conservatives seem to benefit from a kind of persecution mania . Because they frame themselves as a reaction against the mainstream , because they ’ re the “ truth-tellers ” in an age of political correctness , their content just spreads faster online , which is itself the site of alternative news .

Do the left and right use the internet in fundamentally different ways ? Do they communicate differently ? Do they organize or cross-pollinate differently ?
Conservatives and liberals both have their versions of a filter bubble , but I found that these bubbles are qualitatively very different . The left is interested in organizing and getting a lot of people out in a very participatory way . I often saw more photos of events , more photos of groups of people getting together after , say , a union meeting , or raising their fists in solidarity .
What was much more common on the right was a bigger focus on national issues , on memes and posting articles with comments . There was less emphasis on grassroots mobilizing . This was a drastic difference .
The Tea Party and other far-right groups in North Carolina , for instance , where I did a lot of my research , were much more concerned about national politics rather than what ’ s happening locally . They were involved in organizing locally , but they were much more focused on participating in this broader national conservative media ecosystem .
“ Ultimately , it ’ s not about the tool ; it ’ s about the inequalities in our society that give certain people advantages over others ”
On the one hand , activism in the digital age is easier because you can reach and mobilize audiences , and yet , on the other hand , it ’ s lowered the barrier to entry in a way that seems to trivialize everything .

Whether we ’ re talking about the # MeToo movement or other social movements , if you really look that the tweets that are being retweeted , the ones that capture the imagination of people , they ’ re often from people with some standing or celebrity . And for them to get to that point takes work .
Now , for a political movement that maybe doesn ’ t have a famous actor or actress or have a lot of political power to begin with , what they will need to spread that hashtag is either an army of volunteers , perhaps an army of bots , or the on-the-ground offline organizing that it takes to really have a movement spread online .
And again , it takes a lot of money and resources to do that kind of work .
Do you consider the internet an existential threat to democracy ?
That ’ s a great question . I don ’ t think that the internet is a threat , existential or otherwise , to democracy because I still see it as a tool , which can be used for good or ill .

I think most people still see the internet and social media as neutral tools that can be exploited by political actors on all sides. Is that wrong?

Jen Schradie

The internet is a tool and in that sense it’s neutral, but just like other communication tools from the past, people with more power, with more resources, with more organization, have been able to take advantage of it.

So take something like the television. In theory, despite some licensing issues, anyone could, if they had enough money, buy a television station — but that’s not really how it works.

The idea of neutrality seems more true of the internet because the costs of distributing information are dramatically lower than with something like television or radio or other communication tools.

However, to make full use of the internet, you still need substantial resources and time and motivation. The people who can afford to do this, who can fund the right digital strategy, create a major imbalance in their favor.

That was the year Time magazine named “You” their “Person of the Year.” The front cover had this mirror of a computer monitor meaning that you, as an individual, can create online content and participate in this new public sphere.

A lot of social media platforms were either launched or became public around that time. Facebook became available to the general public in that year, so that was a really important year for this very utopian view.

I hear what you’re asking. I think the tool reflects what’s happening more broadly in our society.

Investigators with the House Foreign Affairs Committee have been pressing Twitter , Facebook , and YouTube to deplatform Chinese Communist Party officials and news outlets for disseminating propaganda , particularly related to the coronavirus , but each of the sites has failed to take adequate action . In most cases , Communist Party propaganda freely circulates on these sites without labels identifying the information as questionable .
While each of these sites has begun aggressively policing conservative provocateurs and even President Donald Trump , they have been lax about applying the same standards to Chinese officials and state-controlled news outlets that regularly traffic in unfounded conspiracy theories , congressional officials with knowledge of the investigation told the ███ . In many cases , these websites allowed communist leaders and outlets to post outright lies about the coronavirus pandemic , including the claim that American military leaders created the coronavirus and planted it in China .
The investigation , run by House Foreign Affairs Committee leader Rep. Michael McCaul ( R. , Texas ) , is part of a broader effort by congressional leaders to crack down on China ’ s influence operations in the United States .
The findings of the investigation were presented in the form of report cards grading each company on whether it has banned communist officials and news outlets , applied warning labels to their content , and fact-checked their claims for accuracy . All of the websites failed these tests : Twitter received a D- , Facebook a C+ , and YouTube a C- , grades that imply each still permits the dissemination of anti-U.S. communist propaganda , often without warning labels for readers .
`` The Chinese Communist Party has weaponized American social media platforms to push their disinformation and promote their propaganda . The solution is simple—deplatform CCP officials and propagandists who consistently spread lies , '' McCaul told the Free Beacon . `` Sadly , while we had some positive conversations and some steps have been taken , these companies have chosen to allow CCP officials to continue to operate on their sites instead of doing what ’ s right . ''
McCaul ’ s team first started investigating these sites in March , when he petitioned them to ban Communist Party officials and state-controlled news outlets for their dissemination of lies about the coronavirus pandemic .
Twitter emerged as the most abused platform and also the one with the least oversight . While the company cooperated with McCaul ’ s probe , it did not remove any of the propaganda posts identified by the congressional investigators .
`` Despite a willingness to discuss HFAC Minority staff concerns , Twitter does not appear to have removed any CCP disinformation from its platform nor made any meaningful policy changes in response to our concerns to prevent the CCP from spreading propaganda on its platform , '' according to the investigation . `` Moreover , Twitter does not label or provide transparency about the nature and operations of CCP propaganda outlets . Rather , it legitimizes them by allowing them to operate as verified users . ''
While average Chinese citizens are blocked from accessing Twitter due to the country ’ s strict censorship policies , Communist Party officials are often verified by the website , providing legitimacy to their claims . McCaul ’ s team maintains this violates Twitter ’ s own policies barring individuals and organizations guilty of gross human rights violations from operating accounts on the site .
Additionally , Twitter does not equally apply its rules . Prominent conservatives , including Trump , have had their content censored or removed in recent months . But Chinese officials and news outlets are not held to a similar standard .
`` Of all the companies we engaged with , Twitter is the platform most heavily abused by the CCP , '' investigators found . `` Twitter only applied a factcheck label to the Tweet about the virus originating with the U.S. military after it had been on the platform for more than a month . They are the most unwilling to do anything to stop the CCP from spreading harmful misinformation or provide transparency through labels that inform users they are viewing content from a state-funded or state-directed media outlet . ''
Twitter has said that it will only fact-check tweets from prominent voices , such as the president . Congressional investigators remain concerned that China does not rank as a top priority for the website .
Facebook also allows several Chinese state-controlled propaganda organs to freely post misinformation , potentially reaching millions of Americans . These outlets include China Daily , Xinhua , and CGTN , all of which are leading purveyors of Chinese government-approved propaganda .
Facebook received the highest grade awarded , a C+ , due to its efforts to specifically inform readers they are consuming state-funded information . It still permits these outlets to freely post content on its site , however .
Facebook does not `` currently plan to take down content flagged by the staff or take sufficient action to prevent the CCP from using Facebook to spread propaganda and lies about COVID-19 , '' according to the report .
YouTube demonstrated similar failures . It does not block communist officials and news outlets or remove their materials . YouTube does , however , attempt to fact-check and police this content for inaccuracies .
`` YouTube does label videos by CCP propaganda outlets , but the labeling is inconsistent , '' according to the report .
In many cases , YouTube failed to label CCP content as propaganda and did not provide viewers with complete information about the biased nature of these videos .","The country’s largest social media companies are allowing the Chinese Communist Party to disseminate propaganda to American audiences with little oversight or warning, according to an ongoing congressional investigation into these companies’ failure to police suspect content.

In many cases, these websites allowed communist leaders and outlets to post outright lies about the coronavirus pandemic, including the claim that American military leaders created the coronavirus and planted it in China.

The investigation, run by House Foreign Affairs Committee leader Rep. Michael McCaul (R., Texas), is part of a broader effort by congressional leaders to crack down on China’s influence operations in the United States.

The findings of the investigation were presented in the form of report cards grading each company on whether it has banned communist officials and news outlets, applied warning labels to their content, and fact-checked their claims for accuracy. All of the websites failed these tests: Twitter received a D-, Facebook a C+, and YouTube a C-, grades that imply each still permits the dissemination of anti-U.S. communist propaganda, often without warning labels for readers.

""The Chinese Communist Party has weaponized American social media platforms to push their disinformation and promote their propaganda. The solution is simple—deplatform CCP officials and propagandists who consistently spread lies,"" McCaul told the Free Beacon. ""Sadly, while we had some positive conversations and some steps have been taken, these companies have chosen to allow CCP officials to continue to operate on their sites instead of doing what’s right.""

McCaul’s team first started investigating these sites in March, when he petitioned them to ban Communist Party officials and state-controlled news outlets for their dissemination of lies about the coronavirus pandemic.

Twitter emerged as the most abused platform and also the one with the least oversight. While the company cooperated with McCaul’s probe, it did not remove any of the propaganda posts identified by the congressional investigators.

""Despite a willingness to discuss HFAC Minority staff concerns, Twitter does not appear to have removed any CCP disinformation from its platform nor made any meaningful policy changes in response to our concerns to prevent the CCP from spreading propaganda on its platform,"" according to the investigation. ""Moreover, Twitter does not label or provide transparency about the nature and operations of CCP propaganda outlets. Rather, it legitimizes them by allowing them to operate as verified users.""

While average Chinese citizens are blocked from accessing Twitter due to the country’s strict censorship policies, Communist Party officials are often verified by the website, providing legitimacy to their claims. McCaul’s team maintains this violates Twitter’s own policies barring individuals and organizations guilty of gross human rights violations from operating accounts on the site.

Additionally, Twitter does not equally apply its rules. Prominent conservatives, including Trump, have had their content censored or removed in recent months. But Chinese officials and news outlets are not held to a similar standard.

""Of all the companies we engaged with, Twitter is the platform most heavily abused by the CCP,"" investigators found. ""Twitter only applied a factcheck label to the Tweet about the virus originating with the U.S. military after it had been on the platform for more than a month. They are the most unwilling to do anything to stop the CCP from spreading harmful misinformation or provide transparency through labels that inform users they are viewing content from a state-funded or state-directed media outlet.""

Twitter has said that it will only fact-check tweets from prominent voices, such as the president. Congressional investigators remain concerned that China does not rank as a top priority for the website.

Facebook also allows several Chinese state-controlled propaganda organs to freely post misinformation, potentially reaching millions of Americans. These outlets include China Daily, Xinhua, and CGTN, all of which are leading purveyors of Chinese government-approved propaganda.

Facebook received the highest grade awarded, a C+, due to its efforts to specifically inform readers they are consuming state-funded information. It still permits these outlets to freely post content on its site, however.

Facebook does not ""currently plan to take down content flagged by the staff or take sufficient action to prevent the CCP from using Facebook to spread propaganda and lies about COVID-19,"" according to the report.

YouTube demonstrated similar failures. It does not block communist officials and news outlets or remove their materials. YouTube does, however, attempt to fact-check and police this content for inaccuracies.

""YouTube does label videos by CCP propaganda outlets, but the labeling is inconsistent,"" according to the report.

In many cases, YouTube failed to label CCP content as propaganda and did not provide viewers with complete information about the biased nature of these videos.",www.freebeacon.com,right,a5iRajx64dPC95tv

Usually , another nerve is taken from elsewhere in the body , and it causes an extra injury and returns only limited movement .
Now researchers at the University of Pittsburgh have found an effective way to bridge such a gap—at least in mice and monkeys—by inserting a biodegradable tube that releases a protein called a growth factor for several months . In a study published Wednesday in Science Translational Medicine , the team showed that the tube works as a guide for the nerve to grow along the proper path , and the naturally occurring protein induces the nerve to grow faster .
Kacey Marra , a professor at the university ’ s departments of plastic surgery and bioengineering , says she ’ s been working for a dozen years on the device , which she particularly hopes will help soldiers injured in combat . More than half of injured soldiers suffer nerve injuries , she says . And as the daughter and granddaughter of military men , she considers it her mission to help their successors . Combat gear does a good job of protecting a soldier ’ s chest and head , but arms and legs are often exposed , which is why peripheral nerve injuries are so common , Marra says . Car crashes and accidents involving machinery such as snowblowers can also damage nerves involved in hand , arm , leg and foot control .
In the U.S. , there are about 600,000 nerve injuries every year , she says , though she is unsure how many are severe enough to require the relocation of a second nerve because that information is not tracked yet . When the injuries are severe , the only current treatment is to take a nerve from somewhere else on the body , Marra says . But patients recover just about 50 to 60 percent of function in the damaged nerve .
“ Longer nerve grafts are always more challenging , ” says Christine Schmidt , a professor and chair of the department of biomedical engineering at the University of Florida , who was not involved with the research . “ It would be great to be able to tackle long-term nerve damage. ” She notes that the nerve the Pittsburgh team tested is relatively small in macaques . “ It will still be a challenge to scale up to larger nerves , ” she says . “ It would be nice to see a little bit larger nerve , ” which would be more relevant to patients .
The new device restored nearly 80 percent of function , the study showed . It uses glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF ) , a protein that promotes nerve cell survival . Marra chose GDNF , she says , because “ if you get a nerve injury like a paper cut , the cells in your nerves are going to express this protein at high levels . And that recruits other cells to come in and repair the nerve. ” The tube is made of the same polymer as dissolvable stitches , which has already been federally approved for surgical use .
Other researchers are exploring the use of stem cells or other cells to help bridge the gap in the nerve , but Marra and her colleagues ’ approach is likely to have an easier time receiving federal approval because it does not involve cells . “ If they were to go adding stem cells or too many complexities , ” it would be harder to win a regulatory green light , Schmidt says . It is better to make advances with small steps , as the Pittsburgh researchers have , she says . “ They ’ re doing it in a very realistic way that can lead to a clinical outcome , and that ’ s really what you want , ” Schmidt adds .
Nerves can regenerate at a rate of about one millimeter per day , and there are three months ’ worth of GDNF in the tube , allowing for closing injuries of about 12 centimeters—or 4.7 inches .
In the eight-year-long study , the researchers trained rhesus macaques to eat with their forefinger and thumb—which they could only do if a repaired nerve was working properly . They used this finger maneuver rather than grabbing food with their fist , as they usually do when they eat . If they pinched the banana pellet , they got a second treat , Marra says . “ We were able to see the recovery , ” she adds . “ At that point , we knew we were ready to test in humans . ”
Marra says she and her colleagues have several pending proposals for the first clinical trials in humans , which are likely to start in 2021 and take at least three years .

Combine those algorithms with men who are disaffected , who may feel that the world owes them more , and you have a recipe for creating extremism of any stripe .
`` They 're picking up an ideology that helps them justify their rage , their disappointment , and it 's something available , '' Jessica Stern , a research professor at Boston University 's Pardee School of Global Studies and the co-author of `` ISIS : The State of Terror , '' told CNN Business Friday . `` Terrorism runs in fads . We noticed that people were picking up the ISIS ideology who were n't even Muslim , they were converting to Islam . The ISIS ideology was an attractive way for some of these men to express their rage and disappointment . This is another ideology that is becoming very popular , it 's another fad . ''
For all the largely much-deserved criticism they 've gotten recently over all the things they 've failed to act upon , the social networks did step up and take real and impressive action when faced with a deluge of ISIS supporters and content . The big tech companies could be taking similar action against white supremacists now .
`` The issue on mainstream sites is for the most part there 's been an aggressive takedown '' of ISIS-related content , Seamus Hughes , the deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University , said . `` That same dynamic has n't happened when it comes to white supremacy . ''
The companies could take action against white supremacists now . Indeed , they could go on forever like that , playing whac-a-mole with different movements that pop up and begin radicalizing their users , moving against them after enough people have been killed . It would be easier for them to do that than to actually deal with the underlying problem of those algorithms designed to keep people around .
`` It makes sense from a marketing perspective ; if you like Pepsi then you 're going to watch more Pepsi videos ... but you take that to the logical extreme with white supremacy videos , '' Hughes said . `` They 're going to have to figure out how to not completely scrap a system that has brought them hundreds of millions of dollars of ad revenue while not also furthering someone 's radicalization or recruitment . ''
Perhaps the most disheartening aspect of this is that the companies have been told , over and over again , that they have a problem . Ben Collins , a reporter with NBC News , tweeted Friday , `` Extremism researchers and journalists ( including me ) warned the company in emails , on the phone , and to employees ' faces after the last terror attack that the next one would show signs of YouTube radicalization again , but the outcome would be worse . I was literally scoffed at . ''
Asked that question , Bill Braniff , the director of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism ( START ) and a professor of the practice at the University of Maryland , said , `` What I believe we should be asking them to do is to continue to minimize the salience or the reach of violent extremist propaganda , that calls for violence ... but not to limit themselves to just content takedowns as the way to do that . What happens when large platform takes down this content or these views is that the content just shifts to smaller platforms . ... Maybe fewer people will be exposed over time , and that 's a good thing , but that 's not the same as a comprehensive solution . ''
Content takedowns alone can both contribute to a persecution narrative and drive people to smaller , more radical sites , Braniff noted . And he thinks that means giving up an opportunity to use the algorithms to redirect , rather than reinforce .
`` We know that people ... can actually be addressed through counseling [ and ] mentorship , '' he said . `` If instead of directing people who might be flirting with extremism to support , if you censor them and remove them from these platforms you lose ... the ability to provide them with an off-ramp . ''
While noting that platforms should still take down content that explicitly calls for violence , which also violates their terms of service , Braniff said , `` There 's some content that does n't violate the terms of use , and so the question is , can you make sure that information is contextualized with videos before and after it on the feed ? ''
The comprehensive solution he sees is a change to the algorithms , so that they could point people to differing views or even in some cases to support such as counseling .
`` Algorithms can either foster groupthink and reinforcement or they can drive discussion , '' he said . `` Right now the tailored content tends to be , ' I think you 're going to like more of the same , ' and unfortunately that 's an ideal scenario for not just violent extremism but polarization ... We 're only sharing subsets of information and removing the middle ground , the place where we come together to discuss different ideas ... [ a ] massive part of violent extremism is polarization , and it 's really dangerous . ''","New York (CNN Business) Among the many tragedies of the massacre at two New Zealand mosques on Friday is a bitter irony: The terrorist who killed at least 50 people in an Islamophobic attack resembled in many ways a member of ISIS.

""They're picking up an ideology that helps them justify their rage, their disappointment, and it's something available,"" Jessica Stern, a research professor at Boston University's Pardee School of Global Studies and the co-author of ""ISIS: The State of Terror,"" told CNN Business Friday. ""Terrorism runs in fads. We noticed that people were picking up the ISIS ideology who weren't even Muslim, they were converting to Islam. The ISIS ideology was an attractive way for some of these men to express their rage and disappointment. This is another ideology that is becoming very popular, it's another fad.""

For all the largely much-deserved criticism they've gotten recently over all the things they've failed to act upon, the social networks did step up and take real and impressive action when faced with a deluge of ISIS supporters and content. The big tech companies could be taking similar action against white supremacists now.

""The issue on mainstream sites is for the most part there's been an aggressive takedown"" of ISIS-related content, Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said. ""That same dynamic hasn't happened when it comes to white supremacy.""

The companies could take action against white supremacists now. Indeed, they could go on forever like that, playing whac-a-mole with different movements that pop up and begin radicalizing their users, moving against them after enough people have been killed. It would be easier for them to do that than to actually deal with the underlying problem of those algorithms designed to keep people around.

""It makes sense from a marketing perspective; if you like Pepsi then you're going to watch more Pepsi videos... but you take that to the logical extreme with white supremacy videos,"" Hughes said. ""They're going to have to figure out how to not completely scrap a system that has brought them hundreds of millions of dollars of ad revenue while not also furthering someone's radicalization or recruitment.""

Perhaps the most disheartening aspect of this is that the companies have been told, over and over again, that they have a problem. Ben Collins, a reporter with NBC News, tweeted Friday , ""Extremism researchers and journalists (including me) warned the company in emails, on the phone, and to employees' faces after the last terror attack that the next one would show signs of YouTube radicalization again, but the outcome would be worse. I was literally scoffed at.""

So what should the platforms do now?

Asked that question, Bill Braniff, the director of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) and a professor of the practice at the University of Maryland, said, ""What I believe we should be asking them to do is to continue to minimize the salience or the reach of violent extremist propaganda, that calls for violence... but not to limit themselves to just content takedowns as the way to do that. What happens when large platform takes down this content or these views is that the content just shifts to smaller platforms. ... Maybe fewer people will be exposed over time, and that's a good thing, but that's not the same as a comprehensive solution.""

Content takedowns alone can both contribute to a persecution narrative and drive people to smaller, more radical sites, Braniff noted. And he thinks that means giving up an opportunity to use the algorithms to redirect, rather than reinforce.

""We know that people... can actually be addressed through counseling [and] mentorship,"" he said. ""If instead of directing people who might be flirting with extremism to support, if you censor them and remove them from these platforms you lose... the ability to provide them with an off-ramp.""

While noting that platforms should still take down content that explicitly calls for violence, which also violates their terms of service, Braniff said, ""There's some content that doesn't violate the terms of use, and so the question is, can you make sure that information is contextualized with videos before and after it on the feed?""

The comprehensive solution he sees is a change to the algorithms, so that they could point people to differing views or even in some cases to support such as counseling.

""Algorithms can either foster groupthink and reinforcement or they can drive discussion,"" he said. ""Right now the tailored content tends to be, 'I think you're going to like more of the same,' and unfortunately that's an ideal scenario for not just violent extremism but polarization ... We're only sharing subsets of information and removing the middle ground, the place where we come together to discuss different ideas... [a] massive part of violent extremism is polarization, and it's really dangerous.""",www.cnn.com,left,0xcOUPRvmYf5mX1H

technology,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/2014/1110/President-Obama-pushes-for-net-neutrality.-What-does-the-FCC-do-now-video,President Obama pushes for net neutrality. What does the FCC do now?,2014-11-10,Jeff Ward-Bailey,"To say the Federal Communications Commission is in a delicate position would be to put it lightly . For months , FCC chairman Tom Wheeler has been considering a “ hybrid ” approach to Internet regulation , one in which the government would regulate the relationships between content companies ( such as Netflix ) and Internet service providers ( such as Verizon ) , but in which the consumer side of things would be essentially left alone . Then on Monday , President Obama came out strongly for full net neutrality on Monday , issuing a statement that calls on the Federal Communications Commission to reclassify wired and wireless broadband Internet as a “ common carrier ” service subject to strict government oversight .

Atkinson, Rich Lowry, Kyle Smith, Kathryn Jean Lopez, Victor Davis Hanson, Kevin D. Williamson, Zachary Evans, David Harsanyi, Jonah Goldberg, Jim Geraghty","Why we should not reject technology in order to ‘ protect ’ workers
There was a time in America , not too long ago , when most people , including journalists , business leaders , politicians , and scholars , were full-throated advocates of technologically powered productivity growth . They understood that through mechanization , automation , and other forms of innovation , we can produce more , better , and cheaper goods and services , and have higher incomes . It was understood that some workers might lose their jobs after we figured out how to do them more efficiently , but most Americans believed , to quote Star Trek ’ s Mr. Spock , that “ the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few . ”
Those days are gone , though . Current opinion now routinely echoes the mythical 19th-century machine destroyer Ned Ludd , warning in a growing avalanche of books , academic theses , market forecasts , and op-eds that technology is leading us to a world of mass unemployment , that it is creating a newly idle lumpenproletariat , and that we had better put in place a universal basic income ( UBI ) , under which the state cuts a check to everyone , regardless of their income or work status , if we are to have any hope of avoiding mass unrest .
This kind of worry , verging on “ robophobia , ” represents a remarkable reversal from a long period in American history — stretching from the 1890s to the early 1970s — when most Americans sang the praises of technology as an engine of progress that not only raised our living standards but also made America great . Exultantly titled books such as Triumphs and Wonders of the 19th Century , The Marvels of Modern Mechanism , Our Wonderful Progress , and Modern Wonder Workers were common . When Henry Adams viewed the huge dynamo for producing electricity at the 1900 Great Exhibition in Paris , he wrote ( in the third person ) of his reaction :
As he grew accustomed to the great gallery of machines , he began to feel the forty-foot dynamos as a moral force , much as the early Christians felt the Cross . The planet itself seemed less impressive , in its old-fashioned , deliberate , annual or daily revolution , than this huge wheel , revolving within arm ’ s length at some vertiginous speed , and barely murmuring .
Harvard economist Benjamin Anderson spoke for many when he wrote 40 years later that “ on no account , must we retard or interfere with the most rapid utilization of new inventions. ” And it wasn ’ t just defenders of capitalism who saw technology as a progressive force . Socialists did too , as when Jack London praised automation , proclaiming , “ Let us not destroy these wonderful machines that produce efficiently and cheaply . Let us control them . Let us profit by their efficiency and cheapness . Let us run them by ourselves . That , gentlemen , is socialism . ”
These days , Harvard economists are as likely as not to worry that automation is hurting too many people . Larry Summers wrote in the Financial Times that “ it is widely feared that half the jobs in the economy might be eliminated by innovations such as self-driving vehicles , automatic checkout machines and expert systems that trade securities more effectively than humans can. ” Summers , a macroeconomist who has in the past expressed faith in the Fed ’ s ability to achieve near-full employment , now believes that one-third of men between the ages of 25 and 54 could be unemployed because of technology by midcentury .
Such voices have been growing louder in recent decades . Artificial-intelligence scientist Nils Nilsson was in the advance guard when he warned in 1984 that “ we must convince our leaders that they should give up the notion of ‘ full employment. ’ . . . The pace of technological change is accelerating. ” But what ’ s different today is that such thinking has become a common , widely repeated narrative , greatly amplified by a supercharged media landscape and a packed calendar of “ thought leader ” events . You can not attend Davos , a G20 summit , or a TED talk without being told that the pace of technological change is accelerating and the days of “ work ” as we know it are numbered .
Klaus Schwab , head of the World Economic Forum , predicts that robotics and artificial intelligence will destroy 5 million jobs by 2020 . Paul Krugman warns that “ highly educated workers are as likely as less educated workers to find themselves displaced. ” The Economist , a publication that once served as a voice of restraint , says “ brain work may be going the way of manual work. ” And if that ’ s not bad enough , Martin Ford , author of the New York Times best-seller The Rise of the Robots , warns of 75 percent unemployment by 2100 . But why settle for 75 percent ? Silicon Valley gadfly Vivek Wadhwa tells us that 80 to 90 percent of jobs will be eliminated in just the next ten to 15 years .
The job-destroying technological leviathan is so unrelenting and all-powerful that even sex workers are being warned that they could find themselves on the UBI dole as robots outperform the most seductive prostitutes . As computer-science professor Moshe Vardi writes , “ Are you going to bet against sex robots ? I ’ m not . ”
Most of these predictions cite one of three studies in particular : one by Oxford researchers Michael A. Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey , who warn that 47 percent of U.S. jobs could be eliminated in 20 years ; another by the McKinsey Global Institute , which contains the often-repeated assertion that 45 percent of jobs will be automated ; and a third by PricewaterhouseCoopers ( PwC ) , which predicts that 38 percent of U.S. jobs could potentially be eliminated by 2030 .
Let ’ s begin by recognizing that much of what sounds scary may actually be quite minor . For instance , Klaus Schwab finds that robots and AI are poised to eliminate 5 million jobs in 15 major developed and emerging economies by 2020 — which amounts to just 1.25 percent of the total jobs in those economies .
And what about the Oxford and McKinsey numbers ? Surely they should put the fear of robots in us , right ? Well , the McKinsey study actually says that less than 5 percent of jobs can be fully automated . The 45 percent figure comes from the share of employee time that technology could save . For example , IBM ’ s Watson cognitive-computing system could help doctors make faster and better medical diagnoses , and 20 percent of a typical CEO ’ s time could be replaced by technology such as artificial intelligence . McKinsey doesn ’ t think doctors and CEOs will be put out of work by technology , only that the nature of their work will change , and they will be able to use their time to do more interesting work and more productive things .
As for the Oxford study ? Well , it is just plain wrong . The authors of this non-peer-reviewed study didn ’ t actually examine all 702 different occupations in their survey and assess in each case how likely technology was to substitute for a human worker . Instead , they took a shortcut : They relied on task measures from the U.S. Department of Labor that assessed occupations based on various factors , such as how much manual dexterity and social perceptiveness an occupation requires . If their calculated risk index was above a certain arbitrary figure , the job was assumed to be headed for elimination .
Many pundits overestimate the impact that technology will have on work .
The only problem is that their methodology produces nonsense . How exactly are robots going to send fashion models , manicurists and pedicurists , carpet installers , and barbers the way of the buggy-whip maker , as they suggest ? Versace is not going dress up a sexy robot in a $ 3,000 dress and parade “ her ” down the runway , nor will we inhabit a Jetsons world where you sit down in the robot chair and get your hair cut automatically . When the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation , of which I am president , analyzed these 702 occupations manually , using a very generous assumption about how technology could eliminate jobs , we estimated that at most about 10 percent of jobs were at risk of automation . Instead of fretting about technology killing jobs , we should be worrying about how we are going to raise productivity-growth rates , which have been at all-time lows over the last decade .
As for the PwC study , it relies in part on the same flawed Oxford methodology , and its prediction is based on the assumption that the price of “ robots ” will fall significantly and their functionality will improve dramatically . Both of these are uncertain bets , to say the least .
One reason why so many pundits overestimate the impact that technology will have on work is probably that few are really familiar with what goes on in many occupations . They think : How hard can it be for a robot to install carpets ? As someone who has actually installed carpets , I can tell you that the movements and subtle adjustments that are involved amount to a prohibitively hard math problem , not a task that even the most expensive advanced robot could be designed to do with any reliability .
This comfortable distance from the work that many other people do informs another aspect of their thinking . For most elites , work is interesting and satisfying , not to mention well paid . But for most Americans , work is hard , tiring , often boring , and sometimes dangerous . Take truck driving , the occupation many pundits are desperate to protect from the menace of self-driving trucks . Sure , some drivers enjoy the work , including being their own boss out on the open road . But being a long-haul trucker is not a great job by any means . According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , truck drivers had a workplace fatal-injury rate seven times as high as the overall workplace average , and a non-fatal-injury rate three times as high . And given their extended periods on the road , most long-haul truckers spend way too much time away from their family and friends .
One study found : “ Truck driving is , without a doubt , one of the most brutal jobs a person can do . Across the board , long-haul truckers have higher rates of obesity , diabetes , anxiety , depression , cardiovascular disease , divorce , and drug use than the average American. ” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , truck driving is among the top five professions in the country for suicide rates . And if the stressful working conditions are not bad enough , the average annual income of $ 40,260 is 17 percent below the national median for all jobs . No wonder there is a truck-driver shortage .
Autonomous vehicles will save more than $ 1 trillion a year , much of that due to significantly reduced traffic accidents , and those savings will go directly into higher living standards for Americans .
Yet many people think that showing sympathy for blue-collar workers who may lose their jobs requires opposing , or at least questioning , the benefits of self-driving trucks . Andy Stern , former head of the Service Employees International Union , warns that “ there will be disruption in different places . You can imagine people ringing state capitals with their trucks. ” Former New York Times technology reporter John Markoff weighed the pros and cons of AI-enabled autonomous vehicles : “ More than 34,000 people died in 2013 in the United States in automobile accidents , and 2.36 million were injured . Balance that against the 3.8 million people who earned a living by driving commercially in the United States in 2012 . ”
Balance ? What ’ s there to balance ? Autonomous vehicles will save more than $ 1 trillion a year , much of that due to significantly reduced traffic accidents , and those savings will go directly into higher living standards for Americans . That , plus the benefits from saving tens of thousands of lives yearly , is simply not comparable to the costs to truck drivers , most of whom would take a few months to find a different and probably equal or better job . This situation is likely to be quite different from the manufacturing-job loss over the last two decades resulting from trade and technology . Manufacturing wages were higher than average , so on average a displaced worker ’ s new job would be worse . Trucking wages are lower than average , so truck drivers could probably get a job that pays at least as much , particularly as the reduction in trucking costs frees up money that will be spent on other activities , creating other jobs . ( For example , truck mechanics make 15 percent more than truckers . )
An additional reason for the focus on truckers and other workers who supposedly face the automation axe is that commentators want to divert blame for job loss away from globalization . For them it is an article of faith that technology , not trade , has decimated blue-collar manufacturing jobs . Never mind that foreign mercantilist trade practices , not computers , were responsible for more than half the manufacturing jobs lost in the 2000s . Likewise , these critics are loath to concede that the big spike in low-skilled immigration over the last two decades could have something to do with the contemporaneous stagnation in business investment in new machines . As Maya Kosoff wrote in Vanity Fair , “ Robots , not foreigners , are the top long-term threat to employment and wages. ” Never mind that when labor is dirt cheap , installing automation , such as machines to harvest crops , makes much less economic sense .
Another reason for growing robophobia is that many believe today ’ s rate of technological progress is unprecedented . With authors tripping over themselves to devise titles conveying the biggest transformation , we have books such as The Singularity Is Near , The Second Machine Age , The Third Wave , The Fourth Industrial Revolution , and The Fifth Technology Revolution . There will even be Infinite Progress — a blissful state of harmony in which “ the Internet and technology will end ignorance , disease , poverty , hunger , and war ” — which , don ’ t get me wrong , sounds great , except that they won ’ t . For these dystopian utopians , it all comes down to exponential progress powered by “ Moore ’ s law , ” which predicts the doubling of computer power every two years . Enthusiasts breathlessly tell us we are only a few more of these doublings away from techno-transformation .
But the truth is that instead of accelerating , progress in computing speed is slowing , and the number of transistors one can buy for a dollar is actually falling . Like Woody Allen turning to Marshall McLuhan in Annie Hall , I can ’ t resist quoting Gordon Moore himself , who says his law “ can ’ t continue forever . The nature of exponentials is that you push them out and eventually disaster happens . ”
But the robophobes are not deterred . Technology marches on , they say , driven by disruptive Silicon Valley nerds and greedy capitalists interested only in maximizing their profits , both insensitive to the pain and hardship they will be sowing along the way . Thankfully , robophobes have a plan to save us from this horrible , more productive and more prosperous future . The United Nations Committee on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) proposes to advance trade and development by calling for “ a major tax on robots , ” as does Bill Gates , who recently argued that “ right now , if a human worker does , say , $ 50,000 worth of work in a factory , that income is taxed . . . . If a robot comes in to do the same thing , you ’ d think that we ’ d tax the robot at a similar level. ” Even economists who should know better , such as Yale professor Robert Shiller , have fallen prey : Shiller argues that robots are like alcohol , something harmful that society should tax so that we will consume less of it . Economists have a term for such fuzzy thinking : they call it “ the lump-of-labor fallacy ” : the view that there is only a fixed amount of work to be done in the economy , and once a job is gone , no others are created .
But when companies started using typewriters on a wide scale at the turn of the 20th century , which made secretaries more efficient , no one called on the feds to impose a typewriter tax to compensate for the lost taxes from unemployed secretaries . That ’ s because there were no unemployed secretaries . The higher productivity from those typewriters meant lower prices for the goods and services sold by companies using them , and consumers used the resulting savings to buy more goods and services , which created more new jobs to replace the secretarial positions that were no longer needed . That is why , over the last century , there has always been a negative , not positive , relationship between productivity growth and unemployment rates . In other words , higher productivity meant lower unemployment as it spurred more spending and more rational exuberance . The future will be no different , unless we smash the machines .
Shiller argues that robots are like alcohol , something harmful that society should tax so that we will consume less of it . Economists have a term for such fuzzy thinking : they call it “ the lump-of-labor fallacy . ”
UNCTAD , Gates , Shiller , and other worry-warts are so concerned with the well-being of workers that they forget the well-being of consumers , who can buy more goods and services when companies use technology to improve productivity . Yet for many people today , the last thing they would ever want is for a worker to lose his job . Saying that this might be in the service of American progress is somehow tantamount to saying you support randomized euthanasia . If we want to “ save ” jobs by stopping innovation , then why not get rid of technology altogether and bring back old jobs , as Washington Post business columnist Allan Sloan would have us do ? Sloan actually urges Trump to pressure companies to scrap self-checkout kiosks in stores so we can bring back cashier jobs . He cites New Jersey as the perfect model , because it is one of two states where it is still illegal for consumers to pump their own gas . We all know what a great job pumping gas is , especially if you don ’ t mind the health hazards from breathing benzene fumes all day .
Sloan writes that if Trump used the bully pulpit to cow retailers into techno-submission , “ we ’ d keep cashiers working instead of having to live in poverty or go on welfare or file for disability. ” ( Never mind that the median wage of cashiers is just 37 percent higher than the poverty level for a family of two , so they are not far from poverty to begin with . ) Sloan goes on to note that this would be great because “ we ’ d all win. ” Really ? Since when do we all win by lowering productivity and slowing GDP growth ? Sloan and his fellow travelers call to mind the government officials Milton Friedman met while visiting a developing Asian country where a canal was being built in the 1960s . Friedman was surprised to see that instead of using tractors and earth movers , the workers had shovels . When he asked why there were so few machines , the government bureaucrat explained : “ You don ’ t understand . This is a jobs program. ” To which Friedman replied : “ Oh , I thought you were trying to build a canal . If it ’ s jobs you want , then you should give these workers spoons , not shovels . ”
To save workers from this modern-day bulldozer fate , many now call for Congress to establish a universal basic income . But this would lead to the very thing the robophobes warn us technology will bring : large-scale unemployment , with people ’ s spending diverted from job-creating consumption to the support of the permanently unemployed .
To be sure , the alternative should not be a call for the Hobbesian , dog-eat-dog world of the 1800s , where , if you lost your job , you were completely on your own . We can and should do a better job of providing temporary income support for workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own ( how about expanding unemployment insurance but having the benefits decline every week , so that workers have stronger incentives to get back into the work force ? ) , and we should establish a better system of lifelong learning and retraining ( how about tax-exempt “ Lifelong Learning ” accounts , akin to IRAs and 401K plans , to which both workers and employers could contribute ? ) .
If the elites really want to help low-wage workers , they can start by once again becoming full-throated advocates of technology-led automation and productivity growth , coupled with stricter limits on low-skilled immigration and better labor-market-adjustment policies for workers displaced by productivity improvements . That , rather than robophobia , will help everyone get ahead .

Why we should not reject technology in order to ‘protect’ workers

There was a time in America, not too long ago, when most people, including journalists, business leaders, politicians, and scholars, were full-throated advocates of technologically powered productivity growth. They understood that through mechanization, automation, and other forms of innovation, we can produce more, better, and cheaper goods and services, and have higher incomes. It was understood that some workers might lose their jobs after we figured out how to do them more efficiently, but most Americans believed, to quote Star Trek’s Mr. Spock, that “the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.”

Those days are gone, though. Current opinion now routinely echoes the mythical 19th-century machine destroyer Ned Ludd, warning in a growing avalanche of books, academic theses, market forecasts, and op-eds that technology is leading us to a world of mass unemployment, that it is creating a newly idle lumpenproletariat, and that we had better put in place a universal basic income (UBI), under which the state cuts a check to everyone, regardless of their income or work status, if we are to have any hope of avoiding mass unrest.

This kind of worry, verging on “robophobia,” represents a remarkable reversal from a long period in American history — stretching from the 1890s to the early 1970s — when most Americans sang the praises of technology as an engine of progress that not only raised our living standards but also made America great. Exultantly titled books such as Triumphs and Wonders of the 19th Century, The Marvels of Modern Mechanism, Our Wonderful Progress, and Modern Wonder Workers were common. When Henry Adams viewed the huge dynamo for producing electricity at the 1900 Great Exhibition in Paris, he wrote (in the third person) of his reaction:

As he grew accustomed to the great gallery of machines, he began to feel the forty-foot dynamos as a moral force, much as the early Christians felt the Cross. The planet itself seemed less impressive, in its old-fashioned, deliberate, annual or daily revolution, than this huge wheel, revolving within arm’s length at some vertiginous speed, and barely murmuring.

Harvard economist Benjamin Anderson spoke for many when he wrote 40 years later that “on no account, must we retard or interfere with the most rapid utilization of new inventions.” And it wasn’t just defenders of capitalism who saw technology as a progressive force. Socialists did too, as when Jack London praised automation, proclaiming, “Let us not destroy these wonderful machines that produce efficiently and cheaply. Let us control them. Let us profit by their efficiency and cheapness. Let us run them by ourselves. That, gentlemen, is socialism.”

These days, Harvard economists are as likely as not to worry that automation is hurting too many people. Larry Summers wrote in the Financial Times that “it is widely feared that half the jobs in the economy might be eliminated by innovations such as self-driving vehicles, automatic checkout machines and expert systems that trade securities more effectively than humans can.” Summers, a macroeconomist who has in the past expressed faith in the Fed’s ability to achieve near-full employment, now believes that one-third of men between the ages of 25 and 54 could be unemployed because of technology by midcentury.

Such voices have been growing louder in recent decades. Artificial-intelligence scientist Nils Nilsson was in the advance guard when he warned in 1984 that “we must convince our leaders that they should give up the notion of ‘full employment.’ . . . The pace of technological change is accelerating.” But what’s different today is that such thinking has become a common, widely repeated narrative, greatly amplified by a supercharged media landscape and a packed calendar of “thought leader” events. You cannot attend Davos, a G20 summit, or a TED talk without being told that the pace of technological change is accelerating and the days of “work” as we know it are numbered.

Klaus Schwab, head of the World Economic Forum, predicts that robotics and artificial intelligence will destroy 5 million jobs by 2020. Paul Krugman warns that “highly educated workers are as likely as less educated workers to find themselves displaced.” The Economist, a publication that once served as a voice of restraint, says “brain work may be going the way of manual work.” And if that’s not bad enough, Martin Ford, author of the New York Times best-seller The Rise of the Robots, warns of 75 percent unemployment by 2100. But why settle for 75 percent? Silicon Valley gadfly Vivek Wadhwa tells us that 80 to 90 percent of jobs will be eliminated in just the next ten to 15 years.

The job-destroying technological leviathan is so unrelenting and all-powerful that even sex workers are being warned that they could find themselves on the UBI dole as robots outperform the most seductive prostitutes. As computer-science professor Moshe Vardi writes, “Are you going to bet against sex robots? I’m not.”

Most of these predictions cite one of three studies in particular: one by Oxford researchers Michael A. Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey, who warn that 47 percent of U.S. jobs could be eliminated in 20 years; another by the McKinsey Global Institute, which contains the often-repeated assertion that 45 percent of jobs will be automated; and a third by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), which predicts that 38 percent of U.S. jobs could potentially be eliminated by 2030.

Let’s begin by recognizing that much of what sounds scary may actually be quite minor. For instance, Klaus Schwab finds that robots and AI are poised to eliminate 5 million jobs in 15 major developed and emerging economies by 2020 — which amounts to just 1.25 percent of the total jobs in those economies.

And what about the Oxford and McKinsey numbers? Surely they should put the fear of robots in us, right? Well, the McKinsey study actually says that less than 5 percent of jobs can be fully automated. The 45 percent figure comes from the share of employee time that technology could save. For example, IBM’s Watson cognitive-computing system could help doctors make faster and better medical diagnoses, and 20 percent of a typical CEO’s time could be replaced by technology such as artificial intelligence. McKinsey doesn’t think doctors and CEOs will be put out of work by technology, only that the nature of their work will change, and they will be able to use their time to do more interesting work and more productive things.

As for the Oxford study? Well, it is just plain wrong. The authors of this non-peer-reviewed study didn’t actually examine all 702 different occupations in their survey and assess in each case how likely technology was to substitute for a human worker. Instead, they took a shortcut: They relied on task measures from the U.S. Department of Labor that assessed occupations based on various factors, such as how much manual dexterity and social perceptiveness an occupation requires. If their calculated risk index was above a certain arbitrary figure, the job was assumed to be headed for elimination.

Many pundits overestimate the impact that technology will have on work.

The only problem is that their methodology produces nonsense. How exactly are robots going to send fashion models, manicurists and pedicurists, carpet installers, and barbers the way of the buggy-whip maker, as they suggest? Versace is not going dress up a sexy robot in a $3,000 dress and parade “her” down the runway, nor will we inhabit a Jetsons world where you sit down in the robot chair and get your hair cut automatically. When the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, of which I am president, analyzed these 702 occupations manually, using a very generous assumption about how technology could eliminate jobs, we estimated that at most about 10 percent of jobs were at risk of automation. Instead of fretting about technology killing jobs, we should be worrying about how we are going to raise productivity-growth rates, which have been at all-time lows over the last decade.

As for the PwC study, it relies in part on the same flawed Oxford methodology, and its prediction is based on the assumption that the price of “robots” will fall significantly and their functionality will improve dramatically. Both of these are uncertain bets, to say the least.

One reason why so many pundits overestimate the impact that technology will have on work is probably that few are really familiar with what goes on in many occupations. They think: How hard can it be for a robot to install carpets? As someone who has actually installed carpets, I can tell you that the movements and subtle adjustments that are involved amount to a prohibitively hard math problem, not a task that even the most expensive advanced robot could be designed to do with any reliability.

This comfortable distance from the work that many other people do informs another aspect of their thinking. For most elites, work is interesting and satisfying, not to mention well paid. But for most Americans, work is hard, tiring, often boring, and sometimes dangerous. Take truck driving, the occupation many pundits are desperate to protect from the menace of self-driving trucks. Sure, some drivers enjoy the work, including being their own boss out on the open road. But being a long-haul trucker is not a great job by any means. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, truck drivers had a workplace fatal-injury rate seven times as high as the overall workplace average, and a non-fatal-injury rate three times as high. And given their extended periods on the road, most long-haul truckers spend way too much time away from their family and friends.

One study found: “Truck driving is, without a doubt, one of the most brutal jobs a person can do. Across the board, long-haul truckers have higher rates of obesity, diabetes, anxiety, depression, cardiovascular disease, divorce, and drug use than the average American.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, truck driving is among the top five professions in the country for suicide rates. And if the stressful working conditions are not bad enough, the average annual income of $40,260 is 17 percent below the national median for all jobs. No wonder there is a truck-driver shortage.

Autonomous vehicles will save more than $1 trillion a year, much of that due to significantly reduced traffic accidents, and those savings will go directly into higher living standards for Americans.

Yet many people think that showing sympathy for blue-collar workers who may lose their jobs requires opposing, or at least questioning, the benefits of self-driving trucks. Andy Stern, former head of the Service Employees International Union, warns that “there will be disruption in different places. You can imagine people ringing state capitals with their trucks.” Former New York Times technology reporter John Markoff weighed the pros and cons of AI-enabled autonomous vehicles: “More than 34,000 people died in 2013 in the United States in automobile accidents, and 2.36 million were injured. Balance that against the 3.8 million people who earned a living by driving commercially in the United States in 2012.”

Balance? What’s there to balance? Autonomous vehicles will save more than $1 trillion a year, much of that due to significantly reduced traffic accidents, and those savings will go directly into higher living standards for Americans. That, plus the benefits from saving tens of thousands of lives yearly, is simply not comparable to the costs to truck drivers, most of whom would take a few months to find a different and probably equal or better job. This situation is likely to be quite different from the manufacturing-job loss over the last two decades resulting from trade and technology. Manufacturing wages were higher than average, so on average a displaced worker’s new job would be worse. Trucking wages are lower than average, so truck drivers could probably get a job that pays at least as much, particularly as the reduction in trucking costs frees up money that will be spent on other activities, creating other jobs. (For example, truck mechanics make 15 percent more than truckers.)

An additional reason for the focus on truckers and other workers who supposedly face the automation axe is that commentators want to divert blame for job loss away from globalization. For them it is an article of faith that technology, not trade, has decimated blue-collar manufacturing jobs. Never mind that foreign mercantilist trade practices, not computers, were responsible for more than half the manufacturing jobs lost in the 2000s. Likewise, these critics are loath to concede that the big spike in low-skilled immigration over the last two decades could have something to do with the contemporaneous stagnation in business investment in new machines. As Maya Kosoff wrote in Vanity Fair, “Robots, not foreigners, are the top long-term threat to employment and wages.” Never mind that when labor is dirt cheap, installing automation, such as machines to harvest crops, makes much less economic sense.

Another reason for growing robophobia is that many believe today’s rate of technological progress is unprecedented. With authors tripping over themselves to devise titles conveying the biggest transformation, we have books such as The Singularity Is Near, The Second Machine Age, The Third Wave, The Fourth Industrial Revolution, and The Fifth Technology Revolution. There will even be Infinite Progress — a blissful state of harmony in which “the Internet and technology will end ignorance, disease, poverty, hunger, and war” — which, don’t get me wrong, sounds great, except that they won’t. For these dystopian utopians, it all comes down to exponential progress powered by “Moore’s law,” which predicts the doubling of computer power every two years. Enthusiasts breathlessly tell us we are only a few more of these doublings away from techno-transformation.

But the truth is that instead of accelerating, progress in computing speed is slowing, and the number of transistors one can buy for a dollar is actually falling. Like Woody Allen turning to Marshall McLuhan in Annie Hall, I can’t resist quoting Gordon Moore himself, who says his law “can’t continue forever. The nature of exponentials is that you push them out and eventually disaster happens.”

But the robophobes are not deterred. Technology marches on, they say, driven by disruptive Silicon Valley nerds and greedy capitalists interested only in maximizing their profits, both insensitive to the pain and hardship they will be sowing along the way. Thankfully, robophobes have a plan to save us from this horrible, more productive and more prosperous future. The United Nations Committee on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) proposes to advance trade and development by calling for “a major tax on robots,” as does Bill Gates, who recently argued that “right now, if a human worker does, say, $50,000 worth of work in a factory, that income is taxed. . . . If a robot comes in to do the same thing, you’d think that we’d tax the robot at a similar level.” Even economists who should know better, such as Yale professor Robert Shiller, have fallen prey: Shiller argues that robots are like alcohol, something harmful that society should tax so that we will consume less of it. Economists have a term for such fuzzy thinking: they call it “the lump-of-labor fallacy”: the view that there is only a fixed amount of work to be done in the economy, and once a job is gone, no others are created.

But when companies started using typewriters on a wide scale at the turn of the 20th century, which made secretaries more efficient, no one called on the feds to impose a typewriter tax to compensate for the lost taxes from unemployed secretaries. That’s because there were no unemployed secretaries. The higher productivity from those typewriters meant lower prices for the goods and services sold by companies using them, and consumers used the resulting savings to buy more goods and services, which created more new jobs to replace the secretarial positions that were no longer needed. That is why, over the last century, there has always been a negative, not positive, relationship between productivity growth and unemployment rates. In other words, higher productivity meant lower unemployment as it spurred more spending and more rational exuberance. The future will be no different, unless we smash the machines.

Shiller argues that robots are like alcohol, something harmful that society should tax so that we will consume less of it. Economists have a term for such fuzzy thinking: they call it “the lump-of-labor fallacy.”

UNCTAD, Gates, Shiller, and other worry-warts are so concerned with the well-being of workers that they forget the well-being of consumers, who can buy more goods and services when companies use technology to improve productivity. Yet for many people today, the last thing they would ever want is for a worker to lose his job. Saying that this might be in the service of American progress is somehow tantamount to saying you support randomized euthanasia. If we want to “save” jobs by stopping innovation, then why not get rid of technology altogether and bring back old jobs, as Washington Post business columnist Allan Sloan would have us do? Sloan actually urges Trump to pressure companies to scrap self-checkout kiosks in stores so we can bring back cashier jobs. He cites New Jersey as the perfect model, because it is one of two states where it is still illegal for consumers to pump their own gas. We all know what a great job pumping gas is, especially if you don’t mind the health hazards from breathing benzene fumes all day.

Sloan writes that if Trump used the bully pulpit to cow retailers into techno-submission, “we’d keep cashiers working instead of having to live in poverty or go on welfare or file for disability.” (Never mind that the median wage of cashiers is just 37 percent higher than the poverty level for a family of two, so they are not far from poverty to begin with.) Sloan goes on to note that this would be great because “we’d all win.” Really? Since when do we all win by lowering productivity and slowing GDP growth? Sloan and his fellow travelers call to mind the government officials Milton Friedman met while visiting a developing Asian country where a canal was being built in the 1960s. Friedman was surprised to see that instead of using tractors and earth movers, the workers had shovels. When he asked why there were so few machines, the government bureaucrat explained: “You don’t understand. This is a jobs program.” To which Friedman replied: “Oh, I thought you were trying to build a canal. If it’s jobs you want, then you should give these workers spoons, not shovels.”

To save workers from this modern-day bulldozer fate, many now call for Congress to establish a universal basic income. But this would lead to the very thing the robophobes warn us technology will bring: large-scale unemployment, with people’s spending diverted from job-creating consumption to the support of the permanently unemployed.

To be sure, the alternative should not be a call for the Hobbesian, dog-eat-dog world of the 1800s, where, if you lost your job, you were completely on your own. We can and should do a better job of providing temporary income support for workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own (how about expanding unemployment insurance but having the benefits decline every week, so that workers have stronger incentives to get back into the work force?), and we should establish a better system of lifelong learning and retraining (how about tax-exempt “Lifelong Learning” accounts, akin to IRAs and 401K plans, to which both workers and employers could contribute?).

If the elites really want to help low-wage workers, they can start by once again becoming full-throated advocates of technology-led automation and productivity growth, coupled with stricter limits on low-skilled immigration and better labor-market-adjustment policies for workers displaced by productivity improvements. That, rather than robophobia, will help everyone get ahead.

technology,Peter Thiel,2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/opinion/peter-thiel-google.html,"Good for Google, Bad for America",2019-08-01,,"A little curiosity about China would have gone a long way , since the Communist Party is not shy about declaring its commitment to domination in general and exploitation of technology in particular . Of course , any American who pays attention and questions the Communist line is accused by the party of having a “ Cold War mentality ” — but this very accusation relies on forgetfulness and incuriosity among its intended audience .
Since 1971 , the American elite ’ s Cold War attitude toward China ’ s leaders has been one of warm indulgence . In the 1970s and 1980s , that meant supporting China against a greater adversary , the Soviet Union . What is extremely strange is that this policy of indulgence continued and even deepened after the Soviet Union ’ s collapse in 1991 .
A few years after the Cold War ended , American leaders started treating China the way they had treated West Germany and Japan . We tolerated punishing trade deficits in the 1970s and 1980s to support those two allies , and we had strategic reasons to do it . As for building up China in the 1990s and 2000s , America ’ s generosity was supposed to somehow lead to China ’ s liberalization . In reality , it led to the transfer of our industrial base to a foreign rival .
In this sense , a zombie “ Cold War mentality ” never went away — though it certainly stopped making sense . Only recently , with help from Mr. Xi ’ s decision last year to , in effect , declare himself potential leader for life , has Donald Trump become the first president since Richard Nixon to pay attention and run a reality check on China .

Of course, any American who pays attention and questions the Communist line is accused by the party of having a “Cold War mentality” — but this very accusation relies on forgetfulness and incuriosity among its intended audience.

Since 1971, the American elite’s Cold War attitude toward China’s leaders has been one of warm indulgence. In the 1970s and 1980s, that meant supporting China against a greater adversary, the Soviet Union. What is extremely strange is that this policy of indulgence continued and even deepened after the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991.

A few years after the Cold War ended, American leaders started treating China the way they had treated West Germany and Japan. We tolerated punishing trade deficits in the 1970s and 1980s to support those two allies, and we had strategic reasons to do it. As for building up China in the 1990s and 2000s, America’s generosity was supposed to somehow lead to China’s liberalization. In reality, it led to the transfer of our industrial base to a foreign rival.

In this sense, a zombie “Cold War mentality” never went away — though it certainly stopped making sense. Only recently, with help from Mr. Xi’s decision last year to, in effect, declare himself potential leader for life, has Donald Trump become the first president since Richard Nixon to pay attention and run a reality check on China.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Facebook is extending its ban on hate speech to prohibit the promotion and support of white nationalism and white separatism.

The company previously allowed such material even though it has long banned white supremacists. The social network said Wednesday that it didn’t apply the ban previously to expressions of white nationalism because it linked such expressions with broader concepts of nationalism and separatism — such as American pride or Basque separatism (which are still allowed).

USA TODAY

Net neutrality's old rules are officially a thing of the past.

A new set of rules at the Federal Communications Commission went into effect Monday, ending the previous consumer protections that prevented Internet service providers from blocking or slowing legal traffic, or charging for faster delivery of some content.

Some consumers and tech companies fear a slower Internet and higher costs for broadband delivery because of the repeal.

The FCC changes were passed last December, shepherded by Trump-appointed FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who says the new lighter-touch rules are more market-friendly than the ""utility-style regulation"" in the Obama-era.

""Monday, we are ending this flawed approach and allowing smaller internet service providers to focus their efforts on deploying more broadband, connecting more Americans with digital opportunity, and offering more competition in the marketplace,"" Pai wrote in a column for CNET published Sunday.

Under the new law, ISPs are required to disclose any blocking, throttling or prioritization of their own content or from their partners on customers' broadband connections.

Providers have said they won't block or throttle legal websites, but have left open the potential for charging more for transport of some data.

Supporters of net neutrality argue that ISPs should deliver access to online content and apps equally, and prefer rules the FCC passed in 2015. Those Obama-era rules prevented ISPs from blocking or slowing legal traffic, or from being paid for prioritized, faster delivery.

Since Pai's passage of the Restoring Internet Freedom order, supporters of net neutrality have taken several approaches to prevent the new rules from going into effect. More than 20 states have sued the FCC, and several governors have passed executive orders requiring ISPs doing business with their states to uphold net neutrality.

Some Congressional Democrats are seeking a repeal of their own, the overturning of the 2017 order that ends the 2015 rules. The Senate last month passed a Congressional Review Act measure 52-47 aiming to overturn the 2017 measure (the CRA is a quick way to overturn newly-passed regulations within 60 legislative days of passage).

But a battle for votes in the House remains. Nearly 50 more House lawmakers must sign a discharge petition introduced by Congressman Mike Doyle in order to force a vote.

Currently, 170 House lawmakers have signed that petition. If the House votes on and passes the bill before the end of this session, the measure would be sent to President Trump. His approval would be highly unlikely since Trump had called the Obama-era rules a ""power grab.""

Still, supporters have hoped to force a public vote on the issue, because with midterm elections looming some lawmakers might be swayed as net neutrality is a resonant issue with voters.

A banner reading `` The Islamic State '' is displayed on the Facebook page of a user identifying himself as Nawan Al-Farancsa . The page was still live Tuesday , May 7 , 2019 , when the screen grab was made . Facebook says it has robust systems in place to remove content from extremist groups , but a sealed whistleblower 's complaint reviewed by the AP says banned content remains on the web and is easy to find . ( Facebook via AP )
WASHINGTON ( AP ) — The animated video begins with a photo of the black flags of jihad . Seconds later , it flashes highlights of a year of social media posts : plaques of anti-Semitic verses , talk of retribution and a photo of two men carrying more jihadi flags while they burn the stars and stripes .
It wasn ’ t produced by extremists ; it was created by Facebook . In a clever bit of self-promotion , the social media giant takes a year of a user ’ s content and auto-generates a celebratory video . In this case , the user called himself “ Abdel-Rahim Moussa , the Caliphate . ”
“ Thanks for being here , from Facebook , ” the video concludes in a cartoon bubble before flashing the company ’ s famous “ thumbs up . ”
Facebook likes to give the impression it ’ s staying ahead of extremists by taking down their posts , often before users even see them . But a confidential whistleblower ’ s complaint to the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained by The ███ alleges the social media company has exaggerated its success . Even worse , it shows that the company is inadvertently making use of propaganda by militant groups to auto-generate videos and pages that could be used for networking by extremists .
According to the complaint , over a five-month period last year , researchers monitored pages by users who affiliated themselves with groups the U.S. State Department has designated as terrorist organizations . In that period , 38 % of the posts with prominent symbols of extremist groups were removed . In its own review , the AP found that as of this month , much of the banned content cited in the study — an execution video , images of severed heads , propaganda honoring martyred militants — slipped through the algorithmic web and remained easy to find on Facebook .
The complaint is landing as Facebook tries to stay ahead of a growing array of criticism over its privacy practices and its ability to keep hate speech , live-streamed murders and suicides off its service . In the face of criticism , CEO Mark Zuckerberg has spoken of his pride in the company ’ s ability to weed out violent posts automatically through artificial intelligence . During an earnings call last month , for instance , he repeated a carefully worded formulation that Facebook has been employing .
“ In areas like terrorism , for al-Qaida and ISIS-related content , now 99 percent of the content that we take down in the category our systems flag proactively before anyone sees it , ” he said . Then he added : “ That ’ s what really good looks like . ”
Zuckerberg did not offer an estimate of how much of total prohibited material is being removed .
The research behind the SEC complaint is aimed at spotlighting glaring flaws in the company ’ s approach . Last year , researchers began monitoring users who explicitly identified themselves as members of extremist groups . It wasn ’ t hard to document . Some of these people even list the extremist groups as their employers . One profile heralded by the black flag of an al-Qaida affiliated group listed his employer , perhaps facetiously , as Facebook . The profile that included the auto-generated video with the flag burning also had a video of al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri urging jihadi groups not to fight among themselves .
While the study is far from comprehensive — in part because Facebook rarely makes much of its data publicly available — researchers involved in the project say the ease of identifying these profiles using a basic keyword search and the fact that so few of them have been removed suggest that Facebook ’ s claims that its systems catch most extremist content are not accurate .
“ I mean , that ’ s just stretching the imagination to beyond incredulity , ” says Amr Al Azm , one of the researchers involved in the project . “ If a small group of researchers can find hundreds of pages of content by simple searches , why can ’ t a giant company with all its resources do it ? ”
Al Azm , a professor of history and anthropology at Shawnee State University in Ohio , has also directed a group in Syria documenting the looting and smuggling of antiquities .
Facebook concedes that its systems are not perfect , but says it ’ s making improvements .
“ After making heavy investments , we are detecting and removing terrorism content at a far higher success rate than even two years ago , ” the company said in a statement . “ We don ’ t claim to find everything and we remain vigilant in our efforts against terrorist groups around the world . ”
Reacting to the AP ’ s reporting , Rep. Bennie Thompson , D-Miss. , the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee expressed frustration that Facebook has made so little progress on blocking content despite reassurances he received from the company .
“ This is yet another deeply worrisome example of Facebook ’ s inability to manage its own platforms — and the extent to which it needs to clean up its act , ” he said . “ Facebook must not only rid its platforms of terrorist and extremist content , but it also needs to be able to prevent it from being amplified . ”
But as a stark indication of how easily users can evade Facebook , one page from a user called “ Nawan al-Farancsa ” has a header whose white lettering against a black background says in English “ The Islamic State. ” The banner is punctuated with a photo of an explosive mushroom cloud rising from a city .
The profile should have caught the attention of Facebook — as well as counter-intelligence agencies . It was created in June 2018 , lists the user as coming from Chechnya , once a militant hotspot . It says he lived in Heidelberg , Germany , and studied at a university in Indonesia . Some of the user ’ s friends also posted militant content .
The page , still up in recent days , apparently escaped Facebook ’ s systems , because of an obvious and long-running evasion of moderation that Facebook should be adept at recognizing : The letters were not searchable text but embedded in a graphic block . But the company says its technology scans audio , video and text — including when it is embedded — for images that reflect violence , weapons or logos of prohibited groups .
The social networking giant has endured a rough two years beginning in 2016 , when Russia ’ s use of social media to meddle with the U.S. presidential elections came into focus . Zuckerberg initially downplayed the role Facebook played in the influence operation by Russian intelligence , but the company later apologized .
Facebook says it now employs 30,000 people who work on its safety and security practices , reviewing potentially harmful material and anything else that might not belong on the site . Still , the company is putting a lot of its faith in artificial intelligence and its systems ’ ability to eventually weed out bad stuff without the help of humans . The new research suggests that goal is a long way away and some critics allege that the company is not making a sincere effort .
When the material isn ’ t removed , it ’ s treated the same as anything else posted by Facebook ’ s 2.4 billion users — celebrated in animated videos , linked and categorized and recommended by algorithms .
But it ’ s not just the algorithms that are to blame . The researchers found that some extremists are using Facebook ’ s “ Frame Studio ” to post militant propaganda . The tool lets people decorate their profile photos within graphic frames — to support causes or celebrate birthdays , for instance . Facebook says that those framed images must be approved by the company before they are posted .
Hany Farid , a digital forensics expert at the University of California , Berkeley , who advises the Counter-Extremism Project , a New York and London-based group focused on combatting extremist messaging , says that Facebook ’ s artificial intelligence system is failing . He says the company is not motivated to tackle the problem because it would be expensive .
“ The whole infrastructure is fundamentally flawed , ” he said . “ And there ’ s very little appetite to fix it because what Facebook and the other social media companies know is that once they start being responsible for material on their platforms it opens up a whole can of worms . ”
Another Facebook auto-generation function gone awry scrapes employment information from user ’ s pages to create business pages . The function is supposed to produce pages meant to help companies network , but in many cases they are serving as a branded landing space for extremist groups . The function allows Facebook users to like pages for extremist organizations , including al-Qaida , the Islamic State group and the Somali-based al-Shabab , effectively providing a list of sympathizers for recruiters .
At the top of an auto-generated page for al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula , the AP found a photo of the damaged hull of the USS Cole , which was bombed by al-Qaida in a 2000 attack off the coast of Yemen that killed 17 U.S. Navy sailors . It ’ s the defining image in AQAP ’ s own propaganda . The page includes the Wikipedia entry for the group and had been liked by 277 people when last viewed this week .
As part of the investigation for the complaint , Al Azm ’ s researchers in Syria looked closely at the profiles of 63 accounts that liked the auto-generated page for Hay ’ at Tahrir al-Sham , a group that merged from militant groups in Syria , including the al-Qaida affiliated al-Nusra Front . The researchers were able to confirm that 31 of the profiles matched real people in Syria . Some of them turned out to be the same individuals Al Azm ’ s team was monitoring in a separate project to document the financing of militant groups through antiquities smuggling .
Facebook also faces a challenge with U.S. hate groups . In March , the company announced that it was expanding its prohibited content to also include white nationalist and white separatist content— previously it only took action with white supremacist content . It says that it has banned more than 200 white supremacist groups . But it ’ s still easy to find symbols of supremacy and racial hatred .
The researchers in the SEC complaint identified over 30 auto-generated pages for white supremacist groups , whose content Facebook prohibits . They include “ The American Nazi Party ” and the “ New Aryan Empire. ” A page created for the “ Aryan Brotherhood Headquarters ” marks the office on a map and asks whether users recommend it . One endorser posted a question : “ How can a brother get in the house . ”
Even supremacists flagged by law enforcement are slipping through the net . Following a sweep of arrests beginning in October , federal prosecutors in Arkansas indicted dozens of members of a drug trafficking ring linked to the New Aryan Empire . A legal document from February paints a brutal picture of the group , alleging murder , kidnapping and intimidation of witnesses that in one instance involved using a searing-hot knife to scar someone ’ s face . It also alleges the group used Facebook to discuss New Aryan Empire business .
But many of the individuals named in the indictment have Facebook pages that were still up in recent days . They leave no doubt of the users ’ white supremacist affiliation , posting images of Hitler , swastikas and a numerical symbol of the New Aryan Empire slogan , “ To The Dirt ” — the members ’ pledge to remain loyal to the end . One of the group ’ s indicted leaders , Jeffrey Knox , listed his job as “ stomp down Honky. ” Facebook then auto-generated a “ stomp down Honky ” business page .
Social media companies have broad protection in U.S. law from liability stemming from the content that users post on their sites . But Facebook ’ s role in generating videos and pages from extremist content raises questions about exposure . Legal analysts contacted by the AP differed on whether the discovery could open the company up to lawsuits .
At a minimum , the research behind the SEC complaint illustrates the company ’ s limited approach to combatting online extremism . The U.S. State Department lists dozens of groups as “ designated foreign terrorist organizations ” but Facebook in its public statements says it focuses its efforts on two , the Islamic State group and al-Qaida . But even with those two targets , Facebook ’ s algorithms often miss the names of affiliated groups . Al Azm says Facebook ’ s method seems to be less effective with Arabic script .

A banner reading ""The Islamic State"" is displayed on the Facebook page of a user identifying himself as Nawan Al-Farancsa. The page was still live Tuesday, May 7, 2019, when the screen grab was made. Facebook says it has robust systems in place to remove content from extremist groups, but a sealed whistleblower's complaint reviewed by the AP says banned content remains on the web and is easy to find. (Facebook via AP)

WASHINGTON (AP) — The animated video begins with a photo of the black flags of jihad. Seconds later, it flashes highlights of a year of social media posts: plaques of anti-Semitic verses, talk of retribution and a photo of two men carrying more jihadi flags while they burn the stars and stripes.

It wasn’t produced by extremists; it was created by Facebook. In a clever bit of self-promotion, the social media giant takes a year of a user’s content and auto-generates a celebratory video. In this case, the user called himself “Abdel-Rahim Moussa, the Caliphate.”

“Thanks for being here, from Facebook,” the video concludes in a cartoon bubble before flashing the company’s famous “thumbs up.”

Facebook likes to give the impression it’s staying ahead of extremists by taking down their posts, often before users even see them. But a confidential whistleblower’s complaint to the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained by The Associated Press alleges the social media company has exaggerated its success. Even worse, it shows that the company is inadvertently making use of propaganda by militant groups to auto-generate videos and pages that could be used for networking by extremists.

According to the complaint, over a five-month period last year, researchers monitored pages by users who affiliated themselves with groups the U.S. State Department has designated as terrorist organizations. In that period, 38% of the posts with prominent symbols of extremist groups were removed. In its own review, the AP found that as of this month, much of the banned content cited in the study — an execution video, images of severed heads, propaganda honoring martyred militants — slipped through the algorithmic web and remained easy to find on Facebook.

The complaint is landing as Facebook tries to stay ahead of a growing array of criticism over its privacy practices and its ability to keep hate speech, live-streamed murders and suicides off its service. In the face of criticism, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has spoken of his pride in the company’s ability to weed out violent posts automatically through artificial intelligence. During an earnings call last month, for instance, he repeated a carefully worded formulation that Facebook has been employing.

“In areas like terrorism, for al-Qaida and ISIS-related content, now 99 percent of the content that we take down in the category our systems flag proactively before anyone sees it,” he said. Then he added: “That’s what really good looks like.”

Zuckerberg did not offer an estimate of how much of total prohibited material is being removed.

The research behind the SEC complaint is aimed at spotlighting glaring flaws in the company’s approach. Last year, researchers began monitoring users who explicitly identified themselves as members of extremist groups. It wasn’t hard to document. Some of these people even list the extremist groups as their employers. One profile heralded by the black flag of an al-Qaida affiliated group listed his employer, perhaps facetiously, as Facebook. The profile that included the auto-generated video with the flag burning also had a video of al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri urging jihadi groups not to fight among themselves.

While the study is far from comprehensive — in part because Facebook rarely makes much of its data publicly available — researchers involved in the project say the ease of identifying these profiles using a basic keyword search and the fact that so few of them have been removed suggest that Facebook’s claims that its systems catch most extremist content are not accurate.

“I mean, that’s just stretching the imagination to beyond incredulity,” says Amr Al Azm, one of the researchers involved in the project. “If a small group of researchers can find hundreds of pages of content by simple searches, why can’t a giant company with all its resources do it?”

Al Azm, a professor of history and anthropology at Shawnee State University in Ohio, has also directed a group in Syria documenting the looting and smuggling of antiquities.

Facebook concedes that its systems are not perfect, but says it’s making improvements.

“After making heavy investments, we are detecting and removing terrorism content at a far higher success rate than even two years ago,” the company said in a statement. “We don’t claim to find everything and we remain vigilant in our efforts against terrorist groups around the world.”

Reacting to the AP’s reporting, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee expressed frustration that Facebook has made so little progress on blocking content despite reassurances he received from the company.

“This is yet another deeply worrisome example of Facebook’s inability to manage its own platforms — and the extent to which it needs to clean up its act,” he said. “Facebook must not only rid its platforms of terrorist and extremist content, but it also needs to be able to prevent it from being amplified.”

But as a stark indication of how easily users can evade Facebook, one page from a user called “Nawan al-Farancsa” has a header whose white lettering against a black background says in English “The Islamic State.” The banner is punctuated with a photo of an explosive mushroom cloud rising from a city.

The profile should have caught the attention of Facebook — as well as counter-intelligence agencies. It was created in June 2018, lists the user as coming from Chechnya, once a militant hotspot. It says he lived in Heidelberg, Germany, and studied at a university in Indonesia. Some of the user’s friends also posted militant content.

The page, still up in recent days, apparently escaped Facebook’s systems, because of an obvious and long-running evasion of moderation that Facebook should be adept at recognizing: The letters were not searchable text but embedded in a graphic block. But the company says its technology scans audio, video and text — including when it is embedded — for images that reflect violence, weapons or logos of prohibited groups.

The social networking giant has endured a rough two years beginning in 2016, when Russia’s use of social media to meddle with the U.S. presidential elections came into focus. Zuckerberg initially downplayed the role Facebook played in the influence operation by Russian intelligence, but the company later apologized.

Facebook says it now employs 30,000 people who work on its safety and security practices, reviewing potentially harmful material and anything else that might not belong on the site. Still, the company is putting a lot of its faith in artificial intelligence and its systems’ ability to eventually weed out bad stuff without the help of humans. The new research suggests that goal is a long way away and some critics allege that the company is not making a sincere effort.

When the material isn’t removed, it’s treated the same as anything else posted by Facebook’s 2.4 billion users — celebrated in animated videos, linked and categorized and recommended by algorithms.

But it’s not just the algorithms that are to blame. The researchers found that some extremists are using Facebook’s “Frame Studio” to post militant propaganda. The tool lets people decorate their profile photos within graphic frames — to support causes or celebrate birthdays, for instance. Facebook says that those framed images must be approved by the company before they are posted.

Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California, Berkeley, who advises the Counter-Extremism Project, a New York and London-based group focused on combatting extremist messaging, says that Facebook’s artificial intelligence system is failing. He says the company is not motivated to tackle the problem because it would be expensive.

“The whole infrastructure is fundamentally flawed,” he said. “And there’s very little appetite to fix it because what Facebook and the other social media companies know is that once they start being responsible for material on their platforms it opens up a whole can of worms.”

Another Facebook auto-generation function gone awry scrapes employment information from user’s pages to create business pages. The function is supposed to produce pages meant to help companies network, but in many cases they are serving as a branded landing space for extremist groups. The function allows Facebook users to like pages for extremist organizations, including al-Qaida, the Islamic State group and the Somali-based al-Shabab, effectively providing a list of sympathizers for recruiters.

At the top of an auto-generated page for al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the AP found a photo of the damaged hull of the USS Cole, which was bombed by al-Qaida in a 2000 attack off the coast of Yemen that killed 17 U.S. Navy sailors. It’s the defining image in AQAP’s own propaganda. The page includes the Wikipedia entry for the group and had been liked by 277 people when last viewed this week.

As part of the investigation for the complaint, Al Azm’s researchers in Syria looked closely at the profiles of 63 accounts that liked the auto-generated page for Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, a group that merged from militant groups in Syria, including the al-Qaida affiliated al-Nusra Front. The researchers were able to confirm that 31 of the profiles matched real people in Syria. Some of them turned out to be the same individuals Al Azm’s team was monitoring in a separate project to document the financing of militant groups through antiquities smuggling.

Facebook also faces a challenge with U.S. hate groups. In March, the company announced that it was expanding its prohibited content to also include white nationalist and white separatist content— previously it only took action with white supremacist content. It says that it has banned more than 200 white supremacist groups. But it’s still easy to find symbols of supremacy and racial hatred.

The researchers in the SEC complaint identified over 30 auto-generated pages for white supremacist groups, whose content Facebook prohibits. They include “The American Nazi Party” and the “New Aryan Empire.” A page created for the “Aryan Brotherhood Headquarters” marks the office on a map and asks whether users recommend it. One endorser posted a question: “How can a brother get in the house.”

Even supremacists flagged by law enforcement are slipping through the net. Following a sweep of arrests beginning in October, federal prosecutors in Arkansas indicted dozens of members of a drug trafficking ring linked to the New Aryan Empire. A legal document from February paints a brutal picture of the group, alleging murder, kidnapping and intimidation of witnesses that in one instance involved using a searing-hot knife to scar someone’s face. It also alleges the group used Facebook to discuss New Aryan Empire business.

But many of the individuals named in the indictment have Facebook pages that were still up in recent days. They leave no doubt of the users’ white supremacist affiliation, posting images of Hitler, swastikas and a numerical symbol of the New Aryan Empire slogan, “To The Dirt” — the members’ pledge to remain loyal to the end. One of the group’s indicted leaders, Jeffrey Knox, listed his job as “stomp down Honky.” Facebook then auto-generated a “stomp down Honky” business page.

Social media companies have broad protection in U.S. law from liability stemming from the content that users post on their sites. But Facebook’s role in generating videos and pages from extremist content raises questions about exposure. Legal analysts contacted by the AP differed on whether the discovery could open the company up to lawsuits.

At a minimum, the research behind the SEC complaint illustrates the company’s limited approach to combatting online extremism. The U.S. State Department lists dozens of groups as “designated foreign terrorist organizations” but Facebook in its public statements says it focuses its efforts on two, the Islamic State group and al-Qaida. But even with those two targets, Facebook’s algorithms often miss the names of affiliated groups. Al Azm says Facebook’s method seems to be less effective with Arabic script.

For instance, a search in Arabic for “Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula” turns up not only posts, but an auto-generated business page. One user listed his occupation as “Former Sniper” at “Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula” written in Arabic. Another user evaded Facebook’s cull by reversing the order of the countries in the Arabic for ISIS or “Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.”

John Kostyack, a lawyer with the National Whistleblower Center in Washington who represents the anonymous plaintiff behind the complaint, said the goal is to make Facebook take a more robust approach to counteracting extremist propaganda.

“Right now we’re hearing stories of what happened in New Zealand and Sri Lanka — just heartbreaking massacres where the groups that came forward were clearly openly recruiting and networking on Facebook and other social media,” he said. “That’s not going to stop unless we develop a public policy to deal with it, unless we create some kind of sense of corporate social responsibility.”

Farid, the digital forensics expert, says that Facebook built its infrastructure without thinking through the dangers stemming from content and is now trying to retrofit solutions.

“The policy of this platform has been: ‘Move fast and break things.’ I actually think that for once their motto was actually accurate,” he says. “The strategy was grow, grow, grow, profit, profit, profit and then go back and try to deal with whatever problems there are.”

Earlier in August , conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was removed from various social media platforms such as Facebook and Youtube . Many critics warned that despite Jones espousing arguably fringe views and outright lies , the censorship of non-leftist thinkers would continue and target conservative thinkers and remove conservatives from various platforms .
CRTV 's Gavin McInnes was recently kicked off Twitter for reasons unknown , other than that he supposedly violated their guidelines . But , conservatives have long argued that even if these social media websites do not explicitly block an individual or organization from using their platform , that the company would in effect place a `` shadow ban '' on their accounts and prevent their followers from seeing their tweets . James O'Keefe 's Project Veritas even recorded Twitter engineers discussing how they planned on preventing certain viewpoints from being aired on their platform .

We ’ re trying to get the sh * tty people to not show up , '' one engineer said on a recorded video . `` It ’ s a product thing we ’ re working on right now. ” As further evidence showed , `` sh * tty '' in this case would mean anybody who was tweeting about guns , God , or the flag or other right-leaning viewpoints .

I get used to it and watch with a grain of salt, or don’t watch at all.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 18, 2018

....Too many voices are being destroyed, some good & some bad, and that cannot be allowed to happen. Who is making the choices, because I can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made. Let everybody participate, good & bad, and we will all just have to figure it out! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 18, 2018

Earlier in August, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was removed from various social media platforms such as Facebook and Youtube. Many critics warned that despite Jones espousing arguably fringe views and outright lies, the censorship of non-leftist thinkers would continue and target conservative thinkers and remove conservatives from various platforms.

CRTV's Gavin McInnes was recently kicked off Twitter for reasons unknown, other than that he supposedly violated their guidelines. But, conservatives have long argued that even if these social media websites do not explicitly block an individual or organization from using their platform, that the company would in effect place a ""shadow ban"" on their accounts and prevent their followers from seeing their tweets. James O'Keefe's Project Veritas even recorded Twitter engineers discussing how they planned on preventing certain viewpoints from being aired on their platform.

""Yeah. That’s something we’re working on. It’s something we’re working on. We’re trying to get the sh*tty people to not show up,"" one engineer said on a recorded video. ""It’s a product thing we’re working on right now.” As further evidence showed, ""sh*tty"" in this case would mean anybody who was tweeting about guns, God, or the flag or other right-leaning viewpoints.

Not only does Twitter shadow ban prominent Republicans, they also consider any Trump supporter who tweets about ""God,"" ""guns,"" or ""the flag"" a Russian bot (as seen in our undercover expose.) https://t.co/lxo0JoN2GP pic.twitter.com/MAPhk8tsvr — James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) July 25, 2018

While that video purports to show what happens behind the scenes at just Twitter, many on the right fear that this sort of shadowbanning occurs on all left-wing platforms that spring out of the liberal Silicon Valley. Just last night, Dennis Prager's ""Prager U"" showed statistics highlighting that despite having nearly 3 million followers on Facebook, their most recent 9 posts were seen by zero of their followers.

BREAKING: We're being heavily censored on @Facebook.



Our last 9 posts are reaching 0 of our 3 million followers. At least two videos were deleted last night for “hate speech” including our recent video with @conservmillen.



SHARE to spread awareness about big tech censorship! pic.twitter.com/k83HqmlMRc — PragerU (@prageru) August 17, 2018

Then, once their followers attempted to share this information on their own feeds, Facebook labeled it as spam and prevented the post from occurring

When supporters share our post on the content @facebook censored, Facebook is marking it as ""spam"". pic.twitter.com/Zc3iiKL1L1 — PragerU (@prageru) August 17, 2018

Likewise, several of their videos were errantly marked as hateful. CRTV's Allie Beth Stuckey recently filmed a video for Prager U discussing toxic masculinity that was taken down, but Facebook apologized and claimed it was a ""mistake.""

Facebook took down my @prageru video on masculinity. They said it was a mistake & apologized. ???? https://t.co/pkWe0xL7lf — Allie Beth Stuckey (@conservmillen) August 18, 2018

Given the relatively new influence of social media in American society, it is not obvious what steps forward the government can, or should, take to prevent censorship in political discourse on privately owned websites. The president's tweets appear to indicate that he wants to address the issue but given that conservatives often argue against market interference the exact remedy to the solution remains unclear.",www.townhall.com,right,8v7GSLSju6Z4LLAJ

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — President Donald Trump escalated his war on Twitter and other social media companies Thursday , signing an executive order challenging the lawsuit protections that have served as a bedrock for unfettered speech on the internet .
Announced with fanfare , the president ’ s action yet appeared to be more about politics than substance . He aims to rally supporters after he lashed out at Twitter for applying fact checks to two of his tweets .
Trump said the fact checks were “ editorial decisions ” by Twitter amounting to political activism and that such actions should cost social media companies their liability protection for what is posted on their platforms .
Trump , who personally relies heavily on Twitter to verbally flog his foes , has long accused the tech giants in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley of targeting conservatives by fact-checking them or removing their posts .
“ We ’ re fed up with it , ” Trump said , claiming his order would uphold freedom of speech .
Technology industry groups disagreed , saying it would stifle innovation and speech on the internet . And the U.S. Chamber of Commerce objected , “ Regardless of the circumstances that led up to this , this is not how public policy is made in the United States . ”
The executive order directs executive branch agencies to ask independent rule-making agencies including the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to study whether they can place new regulations on the companies — though experts express doubts much can be done without an act of Congress .
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement : “ This debate is an important one . The Federal Communications Commission will carefully review any petition for rulemaking filed by the Department of Commerce . ”
Companies like Twitter and Facebook are granted liability protection under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act because they are treated as “ platforms , ” rather than “ publishers , ” which can face lawsuits over content .
A similar executive order was previously considered by the administration but shelved over concerns it couldn ’ t pass legal muster and that it violated conservative principles on deregulation and free speech .
“ They ’ ve had unchecked power to censor , restrict , edit , shape , hide , alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences , ” Trump said of social media companies as he prepared to sign the order . “ There is no precedent in American history for so small a number of corporations to control so large a sphere of human interaction . ”
Trump and his campaign reacted after Twitter added a warning phrase to two Trump tweets that called mail-in ballots “ fraudulent ” and predicted “ mail boxes will be robbed. ” Under the tweets , there ’ s now a link reading “ Get the facts about mail-in ballots ” that guides users to a page with fact checks and news stories about Trump ’ s unsubstantiated claims .
Trump accused Twitter of interfering in the 2020 presidential election ” and declared “ as president , I will not allow this to happen. ” His campaign manager , Brad Parscale , said Twitter ’ s “ clear political bias ” had led the campaign to pull “ all our advertising from Twitter months ago. ” In fact , Twitter has banned political advertising since last November .
Late Wednesday , Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted , “ We ’ ll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally . ”
On the other hand , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Fox News his platform has “ a different policy , I think , than Twitter on this . ”
“ I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn ’ t be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online , ” he said .
The president ’ s critics , meanwhile , scolded the platforms for allowing him to put forth false or misleading information that could confuse voters .
Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden , a Democrat and advocate for internet freedoms , said Trump was “ desperately trying to steal for himself the power of the courts and Congress . ... All for the ability to spread unfiltered lies . ”
Trump ’ s proposal has multiple , serious legal problems and is unlikely to survive a challenge , according to Matt Schruers , president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association , a Washington-based organization that represents computer and internet companies .
It would also seem to be an assault on the same online freedom that enabled social media platforms to flourish in the first place — and made them such an effective microphone for Trump and other politicians .
“ The irony that is lost here is that if these protections were to go away social media services would be far more aggressive in moderating content and terminating accounts , ” Schruers said . “ Our vibrant public sphere of discussion would devolve into nothing more than preapproved soundbites . ”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it was “ outrageous ” that while Twitter had put a fact-check tag on Trump ’ s tweets asserting massive mail-in election fraud , it had not removed his tweets repeating a debunked conspiracy theory that a TV news host had murdered an aide years ago .
The president and fellow conservatives have been claiming , for years , that Silicon Valley tech companies are biased against them . But there is no evidence for this — and while the executives and many employees of Twitter , Facebook and Google may lean liberal , the companies have stressed they have no business interest in favoring one political party over the other .

In August 2018 , Trump accused Google of biased searches and warned the company to “ be careful. ” Google pushed back sharply , saying Trump ’ s claim simply wasn ’ t so , and experts suggested his comments showed a misunderstanding of how search engines work .

technology,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/24/21300631/instagram-black-lives-matter-politics-blackout-tuesday,Instagram used to be where people escaped the news. The Black Lives Matter protests changed that.,2020-06-24,"Emily Stewart, Shirin Ghaffary","Share All sharing options for : It ’ s not just your feed . Political content has taken over Instagram .
For most people , Instagram has long been the social media platform where they escape from the real world — and politics — to share a curated highlight reel of their lives . But recently , that ’ s changed . It ’ s become an increasingly political platform amid Black Lives Matter protests across the country . In fact , Instagram has become the platform for widespread conversations in the United States about racism and how to combat it .
“ I think there is a shift where everyone feels guilty for not posting anything black , ” said Thaddeus Coates , a Black queer illustrator , dancer , model , and animator who uses Instagram to share his art , which in recent weeks has focused on racial justice and supporting Black-owned businesses . “ People aren ’ t just posting pictures of food anymore , because if you ’ re scrolling through and there ’ s a picture of food , and then there ’ s someone who was killed , and then you scroll up and there ’ s a picture of a protest — it ’ s weird . ”
As the US has grappled with a reckoning over systemic racism after the killings of George Floyd , Breonna Taylor , Ahmaud Arbery , and other Black Americans , Coates nearly tripled his follower base , and he ’ s been reposted by celebrities , featured by Instagram , and commissioned to do custom illustrations .
Coates ’ s experience fits into a larger pattern : Established racial justice and civil rights groups are also seeing their Instagram bases swell . The NAACP has seen a record 1 million additional Instagram followers in the past month . Black Lives Matter Los Angeles ’ s account has gone from around 40,000 followers on Instagram to 150,000 in the past few weeks , surpassing the popularity of its Facebook page , which has about 55,000 followers .
As Facebook has seen a stagnation in user activity and an aging user base , Instagram , which Facebook owns , has become the online space where comparatively younger people — many of them white — are getting an education in allyship , activism , and Black solidarity . Compared to Twitter , which has 166 million daily active users , Instagram is huge . Its Stories feature alone has more than 500 million daily active users . And while TikTok is on the rise , it ’ s still maturing .
“ It ’ s not surprising that Instagram is becoming more political if you think about who ’ s using it . It ’ s generational . The past couple of years , the main people who have been protesting and organizing — millennials and Gen Z — they ’ re on Instagram , ” Nicole Carty , an activist and organizer based in New York , told Recode .
Instagram ’ s focus on racial justice feels like a pronounced change in the usual mood on the platform
Of course , political activism on social media platforms , including Instagram , isn ’ t new . The Arab Spring in the early 2010s relied heavily on Twitter . Facebook is full of political content . And since its inception , the Black Lives Matter movement has used all these platforms to organize and spread its message .
But to many organizers , activists , and artists , Instagram ’ s focus on racial justice feels like a pronounced change in the usual mood on the platform . Intersectionality , a theory that explores how race , class , gender , and other identity markers overlap and factor into discrimination , is as much a topic of conversation as the usual funny memes , skin care routines , and fitness videos . It ’ s a shift that users , creators , and Instagram itself are embracing .
There ’ s a performative element to some of this because posting a black box or meme about racial injustice is not the same as making a donation , reading a book , or going to a march . Some argue that the performative wokeness can hurt , rather than help , the cause . But for many activists , it ’ s also a way to meet people where they are .
While activists acknowledge that Instagram ’ s increased engagement with racial justice issues will likely pass , right now they ’ re focused on leveraging the momentum and taking advantage of the unique ways Instagram can help their movement .
Facebook and Twitter have typically been the main platforms for political discussion and organizing in the US , but savvy politicians and activists have sometimes turned to Instagram to connect with voters and constituents . Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-NY ) sometimes educates and answers questions from her followers live on the platform . During the 2020 primary , Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-MA ) connected with voters while sipping a beer on Instagram Live . In 2018 , organizing and activism around the national school walkout to demand action on gun violence took place on the platform . And during his failed 2020 presidential bid , former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg poured money into an awkward meme campaign on Instagram .
But generally , serious issues have been a sideshow on Instagram .
No longer . Scroll through your Instagram in recent weeks and you ’ ve probably seen a lot more political and social justice-related content coming from fitness models and food bloggers who have steered clear of those issues in the past . Same goes for the friends you follow , and perhaps your own account — a lot of people are waking up to the realities of racism in America right now and feeling compelled to speak out .
There are multiple explanations for this shift . A feature Instagram introduced in May 2018 that lets you share other accounts ’ posts to your story makes it easy for people to participate . Before that , and unlike other social media platforms , Instagram had no easy , built-in option for reposting content .
And during a pandemic , as many people are still living under lockdown , many are more likely to have the time and motivation to start posting about topics outside of vacation photos and aspirational lifestyle shots , said Aymar Jean Christian , an associate professor of communication studies at Northwestern University . You can only take so many pictures of the bread you baked . And after months of quarantine , you might not be feeling super selfie-ready . People can ’ t go on vacation ; nobody ’ s going to brunch or the gym . The attitude is , “ all of those things are closed , so I might as well post about politics , ” Christian told Recode .
But this surge in political content on Instagram isn ’ t just coincidental . It ’ s intentional .
Leading civil rights groups working on racial justice and policing issues , such as the NAACP and Black Lives Matter Los Angeles , are seizing on the Instagram shift . They ’ ve been using Instagram as a way to mobilize followers into tangible political action — getting them to attend protests , sign petitions , call their legislators — and to educate them about systemic racism .
“ We ’ re surprised and encouraged by how many non-Black folks are posting and demonstrating support . A lot of the DMs that we ’ re getting are from non-Black people , ” Melina Abdullah , a co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles , told Recode .
“ We ’ re getting overloaded in our DMs and trying to wade through and make sure we don ’ t miss things that are important , ” Abdullah said . “ Stuff we don ’ t want to miss is people volunteering to donate things , like ‘ Can I bring granola bars to the protest ? ’ or ‘ Can I bring a new sound system ? ’ ”
Gene Brown , a social media strategist for the NAACP , told Recode he ’ s seeing a more racially diverse set of followers in the organization ’ s expanding Instagram follower base .
“ This [ racism ] is something the Black community has been dealing with forever , and we ’ re looking for white allies to help facilitate this movement , ” said Brown . “ Now it ’ s , ‘ Wow , this large group of people who aren ’ t necessarily in my wheelhouse are not only paying attention but engaging . ’ ”
The cause has been helped by some celebrities , who have asked Black activists and organizers to take over their Instagram accounts to reach their massive follower bases . Selena Gomez , for example , has handed over her account to professor and author Ibram X. Kendi , former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams , and lawyer and advocate Kimberlé Crenshaw , who developed the theory of intersectionality .
“ To know that [ Gomez ’ s ] massive audience is getting this kind of political education on Instagram is really exciting and definitely not what people associated with Instagram before , ” Christian said .
On June 10 , 54 Black women took over the Instagram accounts of 54 white women for the day as part of Share the Mic Now , a campaign aimed at amplifying Black women ’ s voices . Political analyst Zerlina Maxwell took over Hillary Clinton ’ s account , Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors took over Ellen DeGeneres ’ s , and Endeavor CMO Bozoma Saint John took over Kourtney Kardashian ’ s . The Black participants had a total of 6.5 million followers on their personal accounts , while the white women had 285 million . The campaign vastly expanded their reach .
Nikki Ogunnaike , deputy fashion director at GQ , said yes immediately when she was offered the opportunity to participate . After she was matched with Arianna Huffington , “ She truly handed me the keys in a way that I was actually shocked , ” Ogunnaike told Recode . Huffington “ was honestly like , ‘ Okay , here ’ s my password , let me know when you ’ re done , ’ ” she said .
Ogunnaike used Huffington ’ s account to host an Instagram Live with her sister Lola Ogunnaike about their experiences as Black women in media . “ The campaign is just really smart . Instagram always has so many eyeballs on it , ” she said .
“ As we continue into the 2020 election , we have to go where people are , and Instagram is it ”
Instagram is also a way many people are figuring out where to send donations and how to protest where they live . In New York City , an account called Justice for George NYC has become a go-to source for people to find out about demonstrations . The account is run by a small team of anonymous volunteers and relies on local activists and organizers to stay informed on what ’ s happening and when , and to document images of the protests .
A representative for the account told Recode that compared to Twitter , which is more overtly political , Instagram feels like a better fit for the current moment . “ This movement was about so many more people than that [ Twitter ] . It ’ s about reaching a wider audience , ” she said . “ As we continue into the 2020 election , we have to go where people are , and Instagram is it . ”
With the election on the horizon , the momentum behind the Black Lives Matter movement on Instagram suggests it will continue to be a place for political discussion and engagement in the months to come .
How Instagram is — and isn ’ t — primed for this moment
In many ways , Instagram is poised to meet the moment . Its visual focus is particularly useful for sharing complex ideas more simply , via images rather than blocks of text .
“ Instagram has always been Blacker , more Latinx communities , younger , groups that are on the front lines right now in a number of ways and are more on Instagram than they are on other platforms , like Facebook proper , ” said Brandi Collins-Dexter , senior campaign director at the civil rights organization Color of Change . “ For us , the personal is political , and it ’ s hard to untangle those two . ”
That personal-political has a specific look and feel . Vice ’ s Bettina Makalintal recently described the kind of shared visual language of protest that has developed on the platform , evidenced in bright digital protest flyers , stylized illustrated portraits , and block quotes with activist statements .
“ I ’ m creating a looking glass so people can see and understand visually what Blackness is , ” Coates said . “ Blackness is not a monolith , and it ’ s really cool that I can use colors and patterns and rhythms to invoke that conversation . ”
Popular posts on Instagram recently , like the “ pyramid of white supremacy , ” break down complex topics : intersectionality , the surveillance state , structural versus individual racism , and the nuances of privilege among white and non-Black people of color . It ’ s a deceptively simple way to educate people on complex topics that some academics spend their entire lives studying .
“ We think that this can help to educate folks . Sometimes people aren ’ t willing to read books but can really quickly take a look and learn on Instagram ”
“ We think that this can help to educate folks . Sometimes people aren ’ t willing to read books but can really quickly take a look and learn on Instagram , ” said Abdullah .
But not everything can be explained in a single Instagram story . For more thorough conversations , racial justice advocates are using Instagram ’ s relatively new IGTV tool to post recurring shows , like the NAACP ’ s Hey , Black America .
Instagram has embraced and elevated these types of conversations , placing an Act for Racial Justice notification at the top of millions of people ’ s Instagram feeds in early June , which linked to a resource guide with links to posts from Black creators and Black‑led organizations about racial justice . CEO Adam Mosseri on June 15 committed to reviewing Instagram ’ s algorithmic bias to determine if Black voices are heard equally enough on the platform .
Instagram ’ s parent company , Facebook , launched a new section of its app with a similar goal of uplifting Black voices , pledged to donate $ 10 million to groups working on racial justice , and committed an additional $ 200 million to supporting Black-owned businesses and organizations on June 18 . But it has also faced intense criticism from civil rights organizations and some of its own employees for allowing hateful speech to proliferate on its platform . Many took issue in particular with the company ’ s inaction on President Trump ’ s recent “ shooting … looting ” post , which many viewed as inciting violence against people protesting George Floyd ’ s killing . In response , Facebook has said it is considering changes to some of its policies around moderating political speech .
Instagram ’ s most formidable competitor , TikTok , has also been accused of suppressing Black creators with its algorithms , seemingly restricting results for # BlackLivesMatter . ( It later fixed this , apologized for the mistake , and donated $ 4 million to nonprofits and combating racial inequality ) . Instagram , meanwhile , has been widely viewed as a largely supportive and meaningful space for creators who care about blackness . It ’ s a reason , sources told Recode , why overall , it feels like there ’ s more of a productive conversation about Black Lives Matter happening on Instagram right now than anywhere else .
As much as Instagram may have helped facilitate racial activism , it has real limitations . Namely , Instagram has always been a performative platform , and many of the racial justice posts people are sharing won ’ t translate to action to dismantle systemic racism in the US .
Take , for example , Blackout Tuesday , when throngs of Instagram users posted black boxes in support of Black Lives Matter . Many people started sharing the boxes using the # BlackLivesMatter hashtag , which ultimately overshadowed valuable information activists and organizers needed to share with protesters . And beyond the hashtag confusion , many questioned the value in posting a black box .
“ When I ’ m thinking , what would help me feel safe in this country ? It ’ s not ‘ I wish everyone ’ s Instagram squares were black , ’ ” author Ijeoma Oluo recently told ███ . “ I can ’ t feel that . Especially when coupled with the disengagement — people do this performative gesture and then disengage . People aren ’ t even open to the feedback of why that ’ s not helpful or what they could be doing to be helpful . ”
“ A lot of people share memes and think that ’ s enough , and it ’ s really not ”
The question of performative wokeness is always an issue on social media , but activists say sharing memes about racial justice gives them a way to meet people where they are . If an Instagrammed image breaks down the issue , makes it easier to digest , and helps people feel less alienated from the movement , that ’ s good , said Feminista Jones , an author , speaker , and organizer . But to really be effective , people need to go beyond that .
“ A lot of people share memes and think that ’ s enough , and it ’ s really not , ” Jones said . “ They share it , and it ’ s really performative and them wanting to be a part of something and they see everybody else doing it , and they don ’ t want to be the ones who didn ’ t do it . So that can be problematic , too . But that ’ s every social media platform . ”
Jones ’ s follower count has more than doubled in recent weeks , and she said dealing with that new base has been an adjustment . She ’ s had to remind people she is not a “ fact portal ” but a multifaceted human being who also posts pictures of herself , her plants , and her child , just like everybody else . She has also noticed that some of her posts about her work projects , such as her podcast , aren ’ t getting as much attention as some of the memes or Black Lives Matter-related content .
“ If you ’ re here to engage my work , you need to engage my work . Read my books , buy my books , take them out of the library , listen to my podcast — it ’ s free , ” she said . “ It ’ s about really engaging and supporting the work we do . ”
When asked how they plan to keep their new followers engaged when protests die down , many activists and organizers said they weren ’ t sure , but that they will keep posting about injustices .
“ For groups like ours , Black Lives Matter , we ’ re a bunch of people who don ’ t get paid for this work — so this is work that we do because we believe in it , ” Abdullah said .
And then there ’ s a secondary problem . Even if recently politically engaged Instagram users maintain public solidarity , and Instagram becomes the permanent social media network of choice to discuss racial dynamics in America , will it eventually face the same scale of issues around polarization , harassment , and disinformation that Facebook has ?
For now , activists are taking advantage of the moment and looking at it as an opportunity to enact change .
“ There ’ s a balance between symbolic and instrumental organizing . Just because people are feeling a lot of pressure to do actions other people may feel are symbolic or superficial , that actually is an indication you have power to win instrumental demands , ” Carty said . “ Rather than thinking of it as an either/or , think of it as a both/and . It ’ s really powerful for millions of people to be taking some small action on social media , and there are ways to build off of that power and to transform it into instrumental , real , meaningful change . ”

For most people, Instagram has long been the social media platform where they escape from the real world — and politics — to share a curated highlight reel of their lives. But recently, that’s changed. It’s become an increasingly political platform amid Black Lives Matter protests across the country. In fact, Instagram has become the platform for widespread conversations in the United States about racism and how to combat it.

“I think there is a shift where everyone feels guilty for not posting anything black,” said Thaddeus Coates, a Black queer illustrator, dancer, model, and animator who uses Instagram to share his art, which in recent weeks has focused on racial justice and supporting Black-owned businesses. “People aren’t just posting pictures of food anymore, because if you’re scrolling through and there’s a picture of food, and then there’s someone who was killed, and then you scroll up and there’s a picture of a protest — it’s weird.”

As the US has grappled with a reckoning over systemic racism after the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and other Black Americans, Coates nearly tripled his follower base, and he’s been reposted by celebrities, featured by Instagram, and commissioned to do custom illustrations.

Coates’s experience fits into a larger pattern: Established racial justice and civil rights groups are also seeing their Instagram bases swell. The NAACP has seen a record 1 million additional Instagram followers in the past month. Black Lives Matter Los Angeles’s account has gone from around 40,000 followers on Instagram to 150,000 in the past few weeks, surpassing the popularity of its Facebook page, which has about 55,000 followers.

As Facebook has seen a stagnation in user activity and an aging user base, Instagram, which Facebook owns, has become the online space where comparatively younger people — many of them white — are getting an education in allyship, activism, and Black solidarity. Compared to Twitter, which has 166 million daily active users, Instagram is huge. Its Stories feature alone has more than 500 million daily active users. And while TikTok is on the rise, it’s still maturing.

“It’s not surprising that Instagram is becoming more political if you think about who’s using it. It’s generational. The past couple of years, the main people who have been protesting and organizing — millennials and Gen Z — they’re on Instagram,” Nicole Carty, an activist and organizer based in New York, told Recode.

Instagram’s focus on racial justice feels like a pronounced change in the usual mood on the platform

Of course, political activism on social media platforms, including Instagram, isn’t new. The Arab Spring in the early 2010s relied heavily on Twitter. Facebook is full of political content. And since its inception, the Black Lives Matter movement has used all these platforms to organize and spread its message.

But to many organizers, activists, and artists, Instagram’s focus on racial justice feels like a pronounced change in the usual mood on the platform. Intersectionality, a theory that explores how race, class, gender, and other identity markers overlap and factor into discrimination, is as much a topic of conversation as the usual funny memes, skin care routines, and fitness videos. It’s a shift that users, creators, and Instagram itself are embracing.

There’s a performative element to some of this because posting a black box or meme about racial injustice is not the same as making a donation, reading a book, or going to a march. Some argue that the performative wokeness can hurt, rather than help, the cause. But for many activists, it’s also a way to meet people where they are.

While activists acknowledge that Instagram’s increased engagement with racial justice issues will likely pass, right now they’re focused on leveraging the momentum and taking advantage of the unique ways Instagram can help their movement.

Instagram gets political

Facebook and Twitter have typically been the main platforms for political discussion and organizing in the US, but savvy politicians and activists have sometimes turned to Instagram to connect with voters and constituents. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) sometimes educates and answers questions from her followers live on the platform. During the 2020 primary, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) connected with voters while sipping a beer on Instagram Live. In 2018, organizing and activism around the national school walkout to demand action on gun violence took place on the platform. And during his failed 2020 presidential bid, former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg poured money into an awkward meme campaign on Instagram.

But generally, serious issues have been a sideshow on Instagram.

No longer. Scroll through your Instagram in recent weeks and you’ve probably seen a lot more political and social justice-related content coming from fitness models and food bloggers who have steered clear of those issues in the past. Same goes for the friends you follow, and perhaps your own account — a lot of people are waking up to the realities of racism in America right now and feeling compelled to speak out.

There are multiple explanations for this shift. A feature Instagram introduced in May 2018 that lets you share other accounts’ posts to your story makes it easy for people to participate. Before that, and unlike other social media platforms, Instagram had no easy, built-in option for reposting content.

And during a pandemic, as many people are still living under lockdown, many are more likely to have the time and motivation to start posting about topics outside of vacation photos and aspirational lifestyle shots, said Aymar Jean Christian, an associate professor of communication studies at Northwestern University. You can only take so many pictures of the bread you baked. And after months of quarantine, you might not be feeling super selfie-ready. People can’t go on vacation; nobody’s going to brunch or the gym. The attitude is, “all of those things are closed, so I might as well post about politics,” Christian told Recode.

But this surge in political content on Instagram isn’t just coincidental. It’s intentional.

Leading civil rights groups working on racial justice and policing issues, such as the NAACP and Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, are seizing on the Instagram shift. They’ve been using Instagram as a way to mobilize followers into tangible political action — getting them to attend protests, sign petitions, call their legislators — and to educate them about systemic racism.

“We’re surprised and encouraged by how many non-Black folks are posting and demonstrating support. A lot of the DMs that we’re getting are from non-Black people,” Melina Abdullah, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, told Recode.

“We’re getting overloaded in our DMs and trying to wade through and make sure we don’t miss things that are important,” Abdullah said. “Stuff we don’t want to miss is people volunteering to donate things, like ‘Can I bring granola bars to the protest?’ or ‘Can I bring a new sound system?’”

Gene Brown, a social media strategist for the NAACP, told Recode he’s seeing a more racially diverse set of followers in the organization’s expanding Instagram follower base.

“This [racism] is something the Black community has been dealing with forever, and we’re looking for white allies to help facilitate this movement,” said Brown. “Now it’s, ‘Wow, this large group of people who aren’t necessarily in my wheelhouse are not only paying attention but engaging.’”

Sweat dripped onto the paperwork before him . For months , the tall , bespectacled Wheeler had been consumed by an arcane but important debate over how to regulate the companies that provide access to the Internet .
Wheeler , a former lobbyist for the cable and cellphone industries , had taken over the agency without any burning desire to rewrite the rules already in place , but a federal court decision had thrown the issue in his lap . Now , as he fumbled toward a solution , an array of liberal groups that had long wanted a much stronger federal hand complained that Wheeler might be too cozy with his former bosses to act forcefully on behalf of consumers .
Perspiring on his vacation that wasn ’ t really a vacation , Wheeler was coming — quietly — to the conclusion that he was going to have to turn on the industries that launched his career in Washington .
On Thursday , Wheeler is expected to present to the commission a set of rules that would treat broadband providers like utilities , effectively denying them the right to charge companies a premium for faster access to consumers and holding them accountable for any attempt to secretly impede the flow of data . When the commission finally approves them — a vote is scheduled for late February — it will mark the most significant rewrite of the rules of the road for the Internet in more than a dozen years and affect the competitive playing field for generations to come .
Wheeler did not speak officially for this report . But interviews with FCC officials , industry executives and representatives of public interest groups reveal the origins of his dramatic pivot on this issue : an intense and relatively brief grass-roots lobbying campaign that targeted two people — him and President Barack Obama .
“ We [ knew ] that Tom Wheeler was going to make the decision on this , ” said Craig Aaron , president and CEO of Free Press , a liberal public interest group . “ He was the guy with the most influence over the details , and the question becomes who has the most influence over him , and that is President Obama . ”
When he nominated Wheeler for the FCC job , Obama called him “ the Bo Jackson of telecom. ” Wheeler had earned the nickname for his experience as a veteran lobbyist but also as a venture capitalist in the industry . But Wheeler saw himself as more than just a double-threat . He made it clear to Obama , whom he had campaigned hard for in 2008 , that he wanted a shot at leading an agency that had earned a reputation for inaction .

It was August and the head of the Federal Communications Commission was sitting on the deck of his family’s vacation home on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. Sweat dripped onto the paperwork before him. For months, the tall, bespectacled Wheeler had been consumed by an arcane but important debate over how to regulate the companies that provide access to the Internet.

Story Continued Below

Wheeler, a former lobbyist for the cable and cellphone industries, had taken over the agency without any burning desire to rewrite the rules already in place, but a federal court decision had thrown the issue in his lap. Now, as he fumbled toward a solution, an array of liberal groups that had long wanted a much stronger federal hand complained that Wheeler might be too cozy with his former bosses to act forcefully on behalf of consumers.

Perspiring on his vacation that wasn’t really a vacation, Wheeler was coming — quietly — to the conclusion that he was going to have to turn on the industries that launched his career in Washington.

On Thursday, Wheeler is expected to present to the commission a set of rules that would treat broadband providers like utilities, effectively denying them the right to charge companies a premium for faster access to consumers and holding them accountable for any attempt to secretly impede the flow of data. When the commission finally approves them — a vote is scheduled for late February — it will mark the most significant rewrite of the rules of the road for the Internet in more than a dozen years and affect the competitive playing field for generations to come.

Wheeler did not speak officially for this report. But interviews with FCC officials, industry executives and representatives of public interest groups reveal the origins of his dramatic pivot on this issue: an intense and relatively brief grass-roots lobbying campaign that targeted two people — him and President Barack Obama.

“We [knew] that Tom Wheeler was going to make the decision on this,” said Craig Aaron, president and CEO of Free Press, a liberal public interest group. “He was the guy with the most influence over the details, and the question becomes who has the most influence over him, and that is President Obama.”

When he nominated Wheeler for the FCC job, Obama called him “the Bo Jackson of telecom.” Wheeler had earned the nickname for his experience as a veteran lobbyist but also as a venture capitalist in the industry. But Wheeler saw himself as more than just a double-threat. He made it clear to Obama, whom he had campaigned hard for in 2008, that he wanted a shot at leading an agency that had earned a reputation for inaction.

Wheeler’s tenure was barely two months old, however, when a federal appeals court in D.C. issued a decision in January 2014 that would force the FCC to revisit an issue that had been percolating largely outside the public’s view for more than a decade.

The decision overturned a set of rules written in 2010 that attempted to prevent Internet service providers from blocking or degrading content that flows over the Internet.

Wary of sparking opposition from huge companies like Verizon and Comcast, Wheeler’s original proposal gave broadband providers the right to strike pay-for-play deals for faster access to consumers, as long as such agreements were “commercially reasonable.”

The group, which rose to infamy with heavily edited Planned Parenthood undercover “sting” videos, said that it had been put on Pinterest’s domain “block list” and had its account permanently suspended for spreading “misinformation.” Lila Rose, Live Action’s founder, suggested that the group had been wrongly censored out of partisan bias.“Pinterest Logic: You can freely pin if you’re Planned Parenthood, an abortion provider,” she tweeted. “But if you’re a pro-life group & pin about the beauty & humanity of a baby in the womb, you’re banned bc you’re a threat to ‘Pinner’s health or safety.’”

The truth, though, is that, as Pinterest announced back in February, the platform is in the midst of a broad crackdown on harmful medical misinformation, a category that Live Action’s radical content certainly falls into; and anti-abortion images are still abundant on the site.

Facebook says an overhaul of its privacy tools will make it easier for people to find and edit the personal information the company holds.

Details of the changes were announced in a blog.

They follow intense criticism of the firm after it emerged that data about 50 million users had been harvested and passed on to a political consultancy.

However, Facebook says the revamp was already planned ahead of the scandal in order to comply with new EU rules.

Facebook insists this move - to give people greater visibility of their privacy settings and an easier way to delete data - has been in the works for months, but the company knows how urgent this has become.

""Facebook recognises it's clearly lost people's trust and it needs to get to work on regaining that,"" Stephen Deadman, its global deputy chief privacy officer told me.

Now this sounds like a useful update to what any user will tell you is a very confusing system. Try to find how to stop your phone from uploading its contacts to Facebook, for instance, and you will go on a long and complex journey.

But you will still need to do a lot of clicking before you can find out whether that quiz you filled in last week has told Facebook and your supermarket that you are pregnant.

The question is whether the social network should be more proactive in warning people about the data they are sharing - perhaps sending an alert to all those people who are almost certainly unaware that they are still uploading their phone contacts to the company.

""You're in control of privacy and security on Facebook"" is the message on the new one-stop shop - but maybe busy users just do not have the time to take back control without a lot more nudging.

Since then, Facebook's privacy practices have come under fresh scrutiny.

New Zealand's privacy commissioner is the latest to have voiced criticism, accusing the firm of breaking the law by refusing to provide data about a dispute involving one of its citizens.

The man involved had wanted access to information about what others had written about him.

""The social media company said the Privacy Act did not apply to it and it did not have to comply with the commissioner's request to review the information requested by the complainant,"" the watchdog said in a statement.

'' As part of that tweetstorm , Dorsey cited a paper I wrote earlier this year , published by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University , entitled `` Protocols , Not Platforms : A Technological Approach to Free Speech . ''
Assuming you do n't feel like reading that 7,000-word long academic piece on what this all could mean , I will make the simplified case here for why this could be a very big deal , while also noting that there 's an even greater probability that it will mean very little .
Let 's start with a simple analogy . Compare email , an open standardized set of protocols including SMTP and IMAP , with Facebook Messenger , a proprietary , centralized messaging tool created , owned , and controlled entirely by a single company : Facebook .
With email , anyone could ( with a bit of technical knowhow ) set up their own email server . But since few people want to do that , there are plenty of places to get your own email address and client ( the interface through which you receive and send emails ) . Your internet provider often will give you an account , or you get a Gmail account from Google like basically everyone has . Here 's the interesting bit , though : even though Google has a huge market share of the email business with Gmail , the fact that it 's based on open email protocols means that you do n't have to rely on Google for anything . You can bring your own email address into Gmail if you want . Or you can use Gmail using a third party client , like Mozilla 's Thunderbird .
And , perhaps even more important , it does n't matter which combination of these things you use because you can still communicate with anyone using any other email system . Do n't like what Google is doing with email or worried that the company might spy on you ? No problem , export your emails and contacts and go use something else . Nothing breaks . You do n't lose access to anyone else . Indeed , Google actually has tremendous market-based incentives to `` not be evil '' in this scenario , since it 's so easy for you to go elsewhere .
Compare that to Facebook Messenger . If you want to communicate with someone on Facebook Messenger you need a Facebook account . And you need to use Facebook 's app . And you can only communicate with other people on Facebook using Facebook Messenger . If you do n't trust or like Facebook Messenger , you can certainly move to a different messaging app—but you lose your history , you lose your contacts and you can only communicate with others who use your new choice of apps . And , worse , if Facebook decides it does n't want you on Facebook any more , you 're entirely out of luck . Facebook is , literally , the monopoly provider of Facebook Messenger .
The email/protocol example is the way much of the internet used to be in the early days . The Facebook Messenger example is what much of the internet became during the web 2.0 timeframe . Old-school open protocols were seen as less user-friendly , and less sustainable without a big company backing them .
What Dorsey is proposing , however , is to take Twitter—a proprietary , closed system—and see if it 's possible to move it to the historical , more open protocols of the early internet . This would mean giving up centralized control , pushing more power and control out to the end users , and creating a more competitive market for a better version of Twitter .
While it has resulted in plenty of eye-rolling , Dorsey 's nod to the possibility of cryptocurrency/blockchains is quite interesting here as well : `` Blockchain points to a series of decentralized solutions for open and durable hosting , governance , and even monetization . '' As he notes at the end , this offers up a potential business model that could keep a protocol sustainable ( unlike in the past ) without the need to resort to sucking up all your data and targeting ads .
It has the potential to , at the very least , shift the discussion on three of the biggest complaints concerning the big internet companies today : competition , privacy , and content moderation . By default , it enables more competition . Depending on how it 's structured , you can reduce the privacy questions by ( 1 ) reducing the need for data since you might not need targeted ads to support it ; ( 2 ) handing the data control back to the ends or to more trusted third party data stores ; and ( 3 ) incentivizing better behavior because of the ease of switching . And , it allows for better content moderation options by allowing there to be both competition at the moderation/filter level , but also in allowing end users to opt into their own level of moderation comfort , rather than leaving it all up to a single monolithic entity .
If this works , it would completely upend much of how the internet is looked at today , potentially limiting the internet 's biggest annoyances , while retaining its best features : the ability to freely connect and communicate with people around the globe . But that 's a very big `` if '' at the beginning of this paragraph . There is no history of taking a proprietary , closed platform and turning it into a broad , open protocol . However , Twitter is well-positioned to make it happen—perhaps better than almost anyone else . Other efforts to build a new social media protocol from scratch ( and there are many ) suffer from a failure to attract a large enough audience . Twitter brings scale .
There are many reasons why this could fail . But if it does succeed—and I believe it could—it would represent a big shift in how an internet service at scale can operate , and it would change much of the discussion we 've been having over the past few years concerning the position and power of big internet sites .","On Wednesday morning, Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey surprised many people by tweeting out an ambitious plan to hire an independent team, called ""Bluesky,"" to explore re-architecting Twitter as an open, standards-based ""protocol"" rather than its current state as a ""platform.""

It has the potential to, at the very least, shift the discussion on three of the biggest complaints concerning the big internet companies today: competition, privacy, and content moderation. By default, it enables more competition. Depending on how it's structured, you can reduce the privacy questions by (1) reducing the need for data since you might not need targeted ads to support it; (2) handing the data control back to the ends or to more trusted third party data stores; and (3) incentivizing better behavior because of the ease of switching. And, it allows for better content moderation options by allowing there to be both competition at the moderation/filter level, but also in allowing end users to opt into their own level of moderation comfort, rather than leaving it all up to a single monolithic entity.

If this works, it would completely upend much of how the internet is looked at today, potentially limiting the internet's biggest annoyances, while retaining its best features: the ability to freely connect and communicate with people around the globe. But that's a very big ""if"" at the beginning of this paragraph. There is no history of taking a proprietary, closed platform and turning it into a broad, open protocol. However, Twitter is well-positioned to make it happen—perhaps better than almost anyone else. Other efforts to build a new social media protocol from scratch (and there are many) suffer from a failure to attract a large enough audience. Twitter brings scale.

There are many reasons why this could fail. But if it does succeed—and I believe it could—it would represent a big shift in how an internet service at scale can operate, and it would change much of the discussion we've been having over the past few years concerning the position and power of big internet sites.",www.reason.com,right,tYiD1JE3v7zjWpXM

Lawmakers' tweets are public record

America offers far too much pomp and circumstance to our elected officials (is there really any reason a one-term member of Congress should be addressed with the honorific for the rest of their life?).

We elevate lawmakers as ""leaders"" when they are in fact, public servants. We give those jobs their legitimacy, and the people in those jobs in turn make decisions that affect our lives. That's why they can't shut out the public, however much they'd like to.

Both Trump and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York learned through the courts over the past year that they could not block critics on Twitter without violating the First Amendment. The reason is because as public officials, their Twitter accounts are public forums. Denying the public access to that forum is unconstitutional.

Opinion contributor

The election season is winding up, and my social media is once again awash with political stories. Headlines stream: “Warren and Bernie’s awkward truce...”, “Trump sees his base growing...” and “The Fed’s real message...”. This is the America I see today.

The trouble is, it’s not the America you see or anyone else sees. It is my personally-curated version of reality. A constantly shifting mirage, evolving in real-time, depending on my likes and dislikes, what I click on, and what I share.

A recent Pew Research Center study found black social media users are more likely to see race-related news. The Mueller report suggests Russian efforts against Hillary Clinton targeted Bernie Sanders supporters. In October 2016, Brad Parscale, then President Trump’s 2016 digital director, now 2020 campaign chairman, told Bloomberg News that he targeted Facebook and media posts at possible Clinton supporters so that they would sit the election out.

Parscale — who, as of early August, has spent more ($9.2 million) on Facebook ads for Trump 2020 than the four top Democratic candidates combined — said that in 2016 he typically ran 50,000 ad variations each day, micro-targeting different segments of the electorate.

Algorithms are prejudiced

While political operatives exploiting yellow journalism is nothing new, the coupling of their manipulative techniques to a technologically-driven world is a substantial change. Algorithms are now the most powerful curators of information, whose actions enable such manipulation by creating our fractured informational multiverse.

And those algorithms are prejudiced. That may sound extreme, but let me explain.

In analyses conducted by myself and colleagues at University College London (UCL), we modeled the behavior of social networks, using binary signals (1s and 0s) passed between simplified “agents” that represented people sharing of opinions about a divisive issue (say pro-life versus pro-choice or the merits of building a wall or not).

Most “agents” in this model determine the signals they broadcast based on the signals they receive from those surrounding them (as we do sharing news and stories online). But we added in a small number of agents we called “motivated reasoners,” who, regardless of what they hear, only broadcast their own pre-determined opinion.

Our results showed that in every case, motivated reasoners came to dominate the conversation, driving all other agents to fixed opinions, thus polarizing the network. This suggests that “echo chambers” are an inevitable consequence of social networks that include motivated reasoners.

It goes deeper than you think:Two years after Charlottesville, I'm fighting the conspiracy theory industrial complex

So who are these motivated reasoners? You might assume they are political campaigners, lobbyists or even just your most dogmatic Facebook friend. But, in reality, the most motivated reasoners online are the algorithms that curate our online news.

How technology generalizes

In the online media economy, the artificial intelligence in algorithms are single-minded in achieving their profit-driven agendas by ensuring the maximum frequency of human interaction by getting the user to click on an advertisement. But AIs are not only economically single-minded, they are also statistically simple-minded.

Take, for example, the 2016 story in The Guardian about Google searches for “unprofessional hair” returning images predominantly of black women.

Does this reveal a deep social bias towards racism and sexism? To conclude this, one would have to believe that people are using the term “unprofessional hair” in close correlation with images of black women to such an extent as to suggest most people feel their hairstyles define ""unprofessional."" Regardless of societal bias (which certainly exists), this seems doubtful.

It isn't all bad news for newspapers:I'm a journalism student in an era of closing newsrooms, 'fake news.' But I still want in.

Having worked in AI for 30 years, I know it is probably more statistically reliable for algorithms to recognize black women’s hairstyles than those of black men, white women, etc. This is simply an aspect of how algorithms “see,” by using overall features of color, shape, and size. Just as with real-world racism, resorting to simple features is easier for algorithms than deriving any real understanding of people. AIs codify this effect.

To be prejudiced means to pre-judge on simplified features, and then draw generalizations from those assumptions. This process is precisely what algorithms do technically. It is how they parse the incomprehensible “Big Data” from our online interactions into something digestible. AI engineers like me explicitly program generalization as a goal of the algorithms we design.

Given the simplifying features that algorithms use (gender, race, political persuasion, religion, age, etc.) and the statistical generalizations they draw, the real-life consequence is informational segregation, not unlike previous racial and social segregation.

Dangerous, divisive consequences

Groups striving for economic and political power will inevitably exploit these divisions, using techniques such as targeted marketing and digital gerrymandering to categorize groups. The consequence is not merely the outcome in an election, but the propagation of deep divisions in the real world we inhabit.

Recently, presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris spoke about how federally-mandated desegregation busing transformed her life opportunities. Like her, I benefited from that conscious effort to mix segregated communities, when as a child in 1970s Birmingham, Alabama, black children were bused to my all white elementary school. Those first real interactions I had with children of a different race radically altered my perspective of the world.

It never gets easier:How many more birthdays will our journalist son, Austin Tice, spend captive in Syria?

The busing of the past ought now inspire efforts to overcome the digital segregation we see today. Our studies at UCL indicate that the key to counteracting the natural tendency of algorithmically-mediated social networks to segregate is to technically promote mixing of ideas, through greater informational connectivity between people.

In a 6,100-word story , the Times reports that over a two-year period , the social network 's tactics were to delay , deflect and deny as it faced increasing scrutiny over Russian disinformation and the corrosive spread of hate speech .
In a Thursday blog post , the Menlo Park , Calif.-based social media giant took issue with numerous aspects of the Times piece , which claimed that Facebook was too slow to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and questioned the company 's handling of comments made in 2015 by then-Presidential candidate Donald Trump regarding a Muslim ban . The report also claims that the company 's leadership was not quick enough to combat the growing menace of fake news on its platform .
In its blog post , Facebook said that both Sandberg and Zuckerberg `` have been deeply involved in the fight against false news . ''
The social network also fired back over the company 's response to Russian election meddling . `` The story asserts that we knew about Russian activity as early as the spring of 2016 but were slow to investigate it at every turn . This is not true , '' it said .
With regard to its handling of Trump 's Muslim ban comments , the tech giant said `` to suggest that the internal debate around this particular case was different from other important free speech issues on Facebook is wrong . ''
However , in a statement to Fox News , a spokesperson for the Times did not retract any of the conclusions in the report , saying :

'' Facebook acknowledges that Definers did `` encourage members of the press to look into the funding of Freedom from Facebook , '' an umbrella activist group that has called for the tech firm to be broken up on anti-trust grounds . However , Facebook says that encouragement was to demonstrate that Freedom from Facebook is `` not a spontaneous grassroots campaign , but supported by a well-known critic of our company [ George Soros ] . ''
While it 's true that Soros , who made his fortune in hedge funds , has given money to one of the ten organizations supporting Freedom from Facebook 's efforts and once called the platform a `` menace '' to society , the financier and philanthropist has owned shares of Facebook this year through his investment fund .
Meanwhile , Open Society Foundations President Patrick Gaspard sent an open letter to Facebook 's executive leadership , board members and Congressional leaders denouncing the company 's efforts to `` spread vile propaganda '' about Soros — a frequent target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories who saw a pipe bomb delivered to his home last month — as `` astonishing '' and `` beyond the pale . '' Founded by Soros , Open Society Foundations works in over 100 countries around the world to ensure that governments are accountable to their citizens .
`` These efforts appear to have been part of a deliberate strategy to distract from the very real accountability problems your company continues to grapple with .

Friday ’ s strike will mark the first time white collar Amazon workers have walked out in the company ’ s history . Amazon employees are demanding that the company eliminate its carbon footprint by 2030 , end custom contracts with oil and gas companies , and refuse funding from climate denying lobbyists . The action organized by Amazon Employees for Climate Justice has inspired Google , Microsoft , Facebook and Twitter employees to plan their own walkouts .
Though Bezos ' pledge does not respond directly to the demands of Amazon employees , the billionaire said in Washington on Thursday that Amazon is pledging to hit the Paris agreement 's goal of zero carbon emissions by 2040 , and be powered by 100 % renewable energy by 2030 . According to a statement , companies that sign on pledge to implement decarbonization strategies through “ real business changes and innovations , including efficiency improvements , renewable energy , materials reductions , and other carbon emission elimination strategies . ”
“ If a company with as much physical infrastructure as Amazon—which delivers more than 10 billion items a year—can meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early , then any company can , ” Bezos said . Additionally , Bezos promised $ 100 million to the Nature Conservancy for reforestation projects as well as an order of 100,000 Rivian electric delivery vans in a move away from diesel trucks . ( Amazon led a $ 700 million investment round in Rivan this year . )
According to Amazon workers , the pledge is a positive step but it 's not enough , and the strike will continue as planned .
“ Amazon ’ s newly announced ‘ Climate Pledge ’ proves that collective action and employee pressure works , ” said a press release from Amazon Employees for Climate Justice . “ But we know it ’ s not enough . The Paris Agreement , by itself , won ’ t get us to a livable world . Today , we celebrate . Tomorrow , we ’ ll be in the streets to continue the fight for a livable future . ”
The organizers of the strike say that Bezos ’ climate pledge marks a milestone in the tech industry , but that they will not stop protesting until Amazon begins to think about the parts of its supply chain excluded in their emissions reporting , donations they receive from climate denying lobbyists , and the oppression of climate refugees , including communities impacted directly by Amazon ’ s pollution in California ’ s Inland Empire .
Bezos ’ s pledge to reach the Paris climate goal—which aims to reach net zero emissions by 2050 in order to limit warming to 1.5 degrees celsius—does make clear that Amazon is increasingly looking at itself as a company with power akin to that of a nation state . The Paris agreement benchmarks have challenged many countries , and will require massive , society-wide shifts to achieve . In 2017 , the Trump administration—which has benefited immensely from contributions from the oil and gas industries—announced that the U.S. is abandoning the agreement .
Similarly , as Amazon rapidly expands its fleet of delivery vehicles and moves into new markets , the company ’ s carbon footprint will be difficult to offset without massive shifts in technology and cooperation across the supply chain .
Bezos ' pledge isn ’ t the first time that the billionaire has attempted to satisfy employees ' growing climate concerns . In response to the formation of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice last November , Bezos has announced a number of changes to reduce the company ’ s massive carbon footprint , which includes shipping and cloud computing pollution . In February , the company announced Shipping Zero , a plan to make half of Amazon ’ s shipments with zero carbon emissions by 2030 . Amazon also committed to reporting its total carbon footprint by the end of 2019 .","A day before 1,550 Amazon workers are set to strike over the company’s carbon footprint, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced a new climate pledge with the goal of reaching the Paris climate accord goals 10 years early.

In 2017, the Trump administration—which has benefited immensely from contributions from the oil and gas industries—announced that the U.S. is abandoning the agreement.

Similarly, as Amazon rapidly expands its fleet of delivery vehicles and moves into new markets, the company’s carbon footprint will be difficult to offset without massive shifts in technology and cooperation across the supply chain.

Bezos' pledge isn’t the first time that the billionaire has attempted to satisfy employees' growing climate concerns. In response to the formation of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice last November, Bezos has announced a number of changes to reduce the company’s massive carbon footprint, which includes shipping and cloud computing pollution. In February, the company announced Shipping Zero, a plan to make half of Amazon’s shipments with zero carbon emissions by 2030. Amazon also committed to reporting its total carbon footprint by the end of 2019.",www.vice.com,left,tArgZVeCTT3UqNzX

It's easy to let your emotions take the lead during a tragic situation like the fires in the Amazon rainforest. Social media led the charge to draw attention to the fires that went largely ignored by most of the world for about three weeks. Twitter users started hashtags like #PrayforAmazonas, #AmazonRainforest and #ActForTheAmazon before politicians began to speak out.

French President Emmanuel Macron was one of the first foreign leaders to tweet about the fires. Macron came under criticism for sharing an outdated photo on social media. Celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and Madonna also shared incorrect photos. Some of the images were of past fires in the Amazon and others weren't of the Amazon at all.

Sharing photos is supposed to drive home a point about the gravity of a situation. The photos lose their meaning if they are misleading. Here are a few ways to make sure a photo is accurate.

Google reverse image search



It doesn't take much work. If you spot an image on social media or another website, try to do a reverse image search. In Google Chrome (or a Chrome-compatible browser like Brave) simply right-click on the image and choose Search Google for Image. This works if you install the Chrome Extension or at images.google.com.

For example, a tweet that might pull on the heartstrings is of an emergency responder giving water to a koala amid a charred forest. If you search this image in Google, you'll see that it's actually from the Australian bush fires in 2009.

Tin Eye

Tin Eye's reverse search engine is also useful. The layout is a bit easier to navigate than Google's. It seems to filter out social media pages. Just Google an image, drag it over (or upload it) to the site and check out your results.

Getty Images

Many news organizations and reporters will use pictures from media company Getty Images. While you have to pay to use the photos, you can use the site to monitor how recent images are for free. Open Getty Images and search Amazon rainforest fire, for example. When you click on an image, you can see who took it and when. You can also read a description of the image for extra information, like where the photo was taken.",www.cnet.com,center,8a4UUp0n4cVKeFwj

What?

Schroeder, a self-described progressive and liberal, made her impassioned plea to mothers across the country in a lengthy post pointing out the warning signs that a person's son might be treading in questionable territory.

""[White supremacists] have studied the way that our young men interact online, and they have looked at what these boys need,"" Schroeder told Sidner. ""And they have learned how to fill those needs in order to entice them into propaganda.""

Schroeder said that she was so concerned about the possibility that her son might turn into a raging white supremacist that she sat down with him and went through his social media together.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ : We turn now to look at the fight for the future of the internet . On Wednesday , nearly 70,000 websites and organizations are planning to take part in a massive online protest to save net neutrality . Participating websites will reportedly display messages on their homepages and encourage users to take action to save the internet as we know it . Supporters of the action include internet giants such as Twitter , Amazon , Facebook , Google and Reddit . Supporters of net neutrality say the rules are needed to keep the internet open and prevent corporate service providers from blocking access to websites , slowing down content or providing paid fast lanes for internet service .
AMY GOODMAN : But net neutrality has come under attack by the Trump administration . Earlier this year , Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai has outlined his plan to dismantle net neutrality rules , despite polling that shows most Americans support a free and open internet . The FCC has a ready received a record 5.6 million comments on net neutrality .
For more , we ’ re joined by two guests . In Washington , D.C. , Michael Copps is with us , who served as FCC commissioner from 2001 to 2012 . He ’ s currently special adviser on media and democracy reform at Common Cause . And joining us from Boston , Massachusetts , is Evan Greer , the campaign director of Fight for the Future . She ’ s helping organize Wednesday ’ s Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality .
Evan , let ’ s begin with you . Talk about this nationwide action tomorrow , on Wednesday , what it ’ s all about , what specifically you ’ re targeting .
EVAN GREER : So , this is a moment for everyone , whether you ’ re an ordinary internet user with a few hundred Instagram fans or a major website with hundreds of thousands of daily visitors , to harness the power of the web to defend this profoundly democratizing technology that ’ s given more of us a voice than ever before . We need to stop companies like Comcast and Verizon from being able to control what we can see and do online , and protect this platform for freedom of expression and social change .
JUAN GONZÁLEZ : And , Commissioner Copps , could you go over for our listeners and viewers the importance of this Title II decision that the new chairman of the FCC is seeking to overturn ?
MICHAEL COPPS : Well , first of all , the network is so vital to economic opportunity and innovation , and especially to democracy . I think Evan said it well . This is a tool of unparalleled power that can help us to build democracy . When you look at what has happened to mainstream media—radio , television and cable—how it has been corporatized and commercialized and consolidated , how much journalism we have lost , you really get down to the essential question : Is media providing the news and information that citizens need in order to make intelligent decisions for the future ? There ’ s a lot of evidence that that ’ s really not happening right now .
Net neutrality , however , is a free speech issue . And at its center is the ability of Americans to go where they want on the internet , to access the content that they want and to be treated like everybody else is treated , so you don ’ t have Comcast and AT & T and Verizon acting as gatekeepers and having the power to slow down sites that they don ’ t like or to block or to throttle , or to give fast lanes to a few while the rest of us struggle along on slow lanes . To be a fully participating citizen in 21st century America , you have to have access to high-speed , affordable broadband . And that ’ s what ’ s at issue now .
This issue has been to the federal courts three times now in the last 10 years . And three times the court has said , if you want to protect net neutrality , the only enforceable way to do it is through the rules that were passed in 2015 by the Tom Wheeler-led Federal Communications Commission . There ’ s no other way to do it . So , for Chairman Pai to come now and say , “ Well , I ’ m going to figure out some other way to do this that ’ s not Title II , ” just means that he ’ s trying to get rid of net neutrality , just like they ’ re trying to get rid of privacy , just like they ’ re trying to get rid of subsidized broadband for the poor in America . It ’ s really—it ’ s really full speed in reverse .
AMY GOODMAN : You ’ ve called this FCC commission , Commissioner Copps , the worst you have ever seen . Why ?
MICHAEL COPPS : Well , because , you know , we ’ ve been building for the last five or six years and doing good things on communications , on E-rate , the program for schools and libraries , to expand that , to expand Lifeline so all Americans could enjoy it , no matter what their economic status , to spread broadband around the country in hard-to-reach inner cities and rural America , and now we ’ re doing away with all of that .
And there ’ s no question in my mind that a communications so important as broadband has to have some public interest oversight . It has to be used for the benefit of the people , and it can not be turned over wholesale to a few ISPs . You know , for a long time , people in the early stages of the internet thought , “ Well , you don ’ t have to worry about the internet , because it ’ s so open , it ’ s so dynamic , it ’ s immune from the laws of consolidation and all this stuff . Power is at the edges. ” And it didn ’ t take too many years for us to figure out that that ’ s not the direction it was going . It was going down the same road as radio and television and cable . And we can not let that happen to this most powerful tool , technology tool , in all of history to help us expand democracy , to build a society where democracy is paved with those broadband bricks mentioned at the outset of the show .
JUAN GONZÁLEZ : I want to turn to FCC Chair Ajit Pai speaking earlier this year about the future of internet regulation . This is what he said .
AJIT PAI : The economics are simple here : More heavily you regulate something , the less of it you ’ re going to get . And when you talk about less infrastructure investment , many people ’ s eyes glaze over . But I think it ’ s important to explain in plain terms what the consequences are . Reduced investment means fewer Americans will have high-speed internet access . It means fewer Americans will have jobs . And it means less competition for American consumers . So , what happened after the FCC imposed Title II ? Sure enough , infrastructure investments declined . Among our nation ’ s 12 largest internet service providers , domestic broadband capital expenditures decreased by 5.6 percent , or $ 3.6 billion , between 2014 and 2016 , the first two years of the Title II era .
JUAN GONZÁLEZ : Well , former Commissioner Copps , what about this issue that Ajit Pai raises that infrastructure investment by the private sector has declined rapidly since the Title II net neutrality laws were put into effect ?
MICHAEL COPPS : That ’ s just absolutely nonsensical . I don ’ t know where Ajit got his facts from , but not too many weeks ago I heard Michael Powell , former chairman of the FCC , who now runs the cable association , talk about how phenomenal the investment was in the internet . And open up your papers every day , and you see these companies paying billions and billions of dollars for one another . And the bazaar has really opened at the FCC now , because everybody knows this FCC is going to approve more and more mergers , more and more acquisitions and transactions , leading to further commercialization and consolidation . So , it ’ s a huge threat . And most of the studies are telling us that investment is more than holding its own . I mean , this is one of the most dynamic sectors in the economy . So , I think that ’ s a case of fearmongering tied to ideology and tied to the special interests .
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to turn to comedian John Oliver . Earlier this year , he dedicated nearly 20 minutes of his HBO program to explaining that net neutrality is under threat . He directed much of his criticism to FCC Chair Ajit Pai .
JOHN OLIVER : Pai ’ s main argument is that we don ’ t need Title II to have net neutrality . But some of his ideas for what to have instead are almost laughably lax . For instance , he reportedly floated just having ISPs voluntarily agree not to obstruct or slow consumer access to web content by putting that promise in their terms of service—you know , the things that no human being has ever read , and that can change whenever companies want them to . That idea would basically make net neutrality as binding as a proposal on The Bachelor .
AMY GOODMAN : John Oliver ended his show by calling on his viewers to write to the FCC , just as he did after a similar segment in 2014 . Once again , the enormous response broke the commission ’ s website—which goes to the issue of activism , which is why we go back to Evan Greer . Specifically tomorrow , what are you going to be doing ?
EVAN GREER : So tomorrow is a day , again , where everyone can come together . So , on many of your favorite websites , from Amazon , Netflix , Kickstarter , Etsy , OkCupid , you ’ re going to be seeing prominent messages that will direct people to a place where they can easily take action . We have a site , BattleForTheNet.com , where anyone can easily submit a comment to the FCC and contact their member of Congress at the same time .
That second part is really important , because , as Commissioner Copps said , this FCC commissioner , Ajit Pai , has made it very clear that he ’ s not listening to the public . He ’ s only listening to the cable companies , that he used to work for , and he intends to give them exactly what they want , which is the power to pick and choose what we can all see and do on the internet . But the thing is , the FCC answers to Congress . And our members of Congress are supposed to answer to us . The polling shows that voters from across the political spectrum—Democrats , independents , Republicans , doesn ’ t matter—overwhelmingly agree we don ’ t want our cable companies to be able to censor us , charge us extra fees or essentially be the editors-in-chief of the internet . So , this is why it ’ s so important that people use these tools , speak out , show up at their member of Congress ’ s offices and make this an issue that they know they will be burned by if they burn their constituents . These members of Congress are already reeling from the backlash to their attack on our internet privacy rules just a few months ago , and they ’ re particularly sensitive to this right now . So this is an incredibly important moment for everyone to be speaking out .
There ’ s lots of tools at BattleForTheNet.com , where anyone , whether , again , you ’ re an internet user that ’ s just posting on social media , you run a website , you have a small business , there ’ s lots of ways to get involved . And we can ’ t sit back and expect big companies to save us , because , in the end , this is really about all the weird , interesting , small , alternative things that make up the beautiful fabric of the internet , whether it ’ s Chess.com , the largest chess service online , or online gaming forums or communities where people find alternative news . This is our free speech fight of our generation . Net neutrality is the First Amendment of the internet , and we intend to fight to defend it .
AMY GOODMAN : Evan Greer , we want to thank you for being with us , campaign director of Fight for the Future . And we ’ ll cover what happens tomorrow in the Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality . And , FCC Commissioner Michael Copps , former commissioner , we ’ d like to ask you to stay with us as we address other issues around your former time at the FCC and the current FCC commission . This is ███ ! We ’ ll be back in a minute .

And we can’t sit back and expect big companies to save us, because, in the end, this is really about all the weird, interesting, small, alternative things that make up the beautiful fabric of the internet, whether it’s Chess.com, the largest chess service online, or online gaming forums or communities where people find alternative news. This is our free speech fight of our generation. Net neutrality is the First Amendment of the internet, and we intend to fight to defend it.

AMY GOODMAN: Evan Greer, we want to thank you for being with us, campaign director of Fight for the Future. And we’ll cover what happens tomorrow in the Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality. And, FCC Commissioner Michael Copps, former commissioner, we’d like to ask you to stay with us as we address other issues around your former time at the FCC and the current FCC commission. This is Democracy Now! We’ll be back in a minute.

Updated at 4:22 p.m. ET

The Senate approved a resolution Wednesday to nullify the Federal Communications Commission's net neutrality rollback, dealing a symbolic blow to the FCC's new rule that remains on track to take effect next month.

The final vote was 52-47. As expected, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, joined Democrats in voting to overturn the FCC's controversial decision. But two other Republicans — Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — also voted in favor of the resolution of disapproval.

The outcome is unlikely to derail the FCC's repeal of Obama-era rules that restrict Internet service providers' ability to slow down or speed up users' access to specific websites and apps.

The legislative victory is fleeting because the House does not intend to take similar action, but Democrats are planning to carry the political fight over Internet access into the 2018 midterms.

""Today is a monumental day,"" said Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., during debate over the resolution. ""Today we show the American people who sides with them, and who sides with the powerful special interests and corporate donors who are thriving under this administration.""

Critics of the FCC rollback say they're worried about consumers being forced to pay more for less consistent or slower service. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, part of the Republican majority, has said the Obama rule was ""heavy-handed"" and isn't needed.

Markey described a coalition of Internet voters who bridge the usual philosophical party lines when it comes to government regulation. ""The grandparents, the gamers, the gearheads, the geeks, the GIF-makers, the Generations X, Y, and Z. This movement to save net neutrality is made up of every walk of American life,"" he said.

Republicans overwhelmingly support ending net neutrality because they want to shift regulatory power away from the federal government and toward the private market. Republicans also argue that Democrats are playing on unfounded fears that Internet service providers will jack up costs and anger their consumer base. ""If the Democrats want to run on regulating the Internet, I think that's a losing strategy,"" said Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who runs the Senate GOP's 2018 campaign operation and voted against the resolution.

This issue doesn't cut along clean party lines, said Steven Kull, who runs the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland and has studied public attitudes on net neutrality. The program's research has found that majorities of Americans support government-mandated net neutrality protections.

""People are on the Internet a lot and it's a big part of their daily experience and the prospect that it will be changed in some fundamental way is disturbing to quite a lot of them,"" Kull said.

Fear is a great motivator for voters. Senate Democrats believe their resolution that put every Democrat on record in support of net neutrality — and most Republicans on record against it — can turn what was once considered a wonk issue into a wedge issue this November. ""People underestimate the passion of Internet voters, at their peril. They are mad, and they want to know what they can do, and this vote will make things crystal clear,"" he said.

Republicans like Rep. Scott Taylor of Virginia think Democrats are wrong on the policy of net neutrality and that eliminating FCC rules will expand competition and consumer choice. However, he concedes that Democrats have done a better job of selling their message to voters and says there could be consequences if Republicans don't engage more directly with voters on an issue they care about.

""It's important Republicans have a clear and concise message to tell them why net neutrality, while it sounds good, and maybe it's even well-intended, is not the right answer for them,"" Taylor said.

Net neutrality doesn't make for catchy campaign slogans, but there are indicators that voters are clocking this issue. According to data provided by Google, net neutrality regularly ranks among top political searches in each state.

In Pennsylvania and Nebraska, which held their primary elections on Tuesday, it ranked second in political searches behind health care. ""This is one of those areas where Washington, D.C., sometimes gets in a bubble and doesn't recognize what's going on in the rest of the country,"" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who runs the Senate Democrats' 2018 campaign operation.

Alex Jones of Infowars has been booted from YouTube, Apple, Spotify and Facebook for what the tech giants consider his rampant hate speech.

And with that, Jones has become the face of the censorship fight.

He’s well on his way to becoming a martyr — meaning, many of those who don’t even like his content or appreciate his style are gearing up, nevertheless, to defend his right to speak on these social media stations.

This seems counterproductive to those who would silence him, yes? Google “Jones” and what appears is a page filled with Alex Jones news. It’s not just free advertising for Infowars; it’s turning Jones himself into the cause celebre of the conservatives’ censorship fight.

And nobody knows it better than Jones. Check out his Twitter account. It’s filled with posts that draw attention to his plight — followed by handy-dandy links to his show.

Good for him. That’s not just the capitalistic way. It’s the classic way of getting back at one’s enemies. Rather than going away, Jones is growing larger.

He wrote: “We’ve been banned completely on Facebook, Apple, & Spotify. What conservative news outlet will be next? The one platform that they CAN’T ban and will ALWAYS have [as] live streams is infowars.com/show. Spreak the links to help #Infowars fight #Censorship.”

His feed is filled with similarly-angled messages of angst followed by self-promotion. Truly, Jones has been gifted a goldmine of effective marketing.

“Censoring Alex Jones Is Really About Censoring You!” he tweeted. That post was retweeted 1,500 or so times.

“Understand this,” he tweeted. “The censorship of Infowars just vindicates everything we’ve been saying. Now, who will stand against Tyranny and who will stand for free speech? We’re all Alex Jones now.” That post was retweeted 9,100 or so times.

And his pinned tweet?

“World Exclusive: Alex Jones Responds to Being Banned on the Internet,” he wrote. “Tune in M-F 11am-3pm central at: inforwars.com/show.”

It’s been retweeted 2,600 or so times and loved 4,200 times. More than 2,300 have responded to it directly with tweeted messages of their own.

You just can’t buy advertising like that.

No doubt the tech giants and social media executives meant to silence Jones and make him go away. But what they’ve done instead is made him even more noticeable, more influential, more pertinent in today’s news cycles.

They’ve pretty much made him a martyr of the free speech movement.
