But nobody thought about it that much : Roe v. Wade , the landmark Supreme Court decision that guarantees a legal right to abortion , has superseded the Vermont law for more than four decades now .
But about a year and a half ago , Vermont State Senator Tim Ashe started to worry . He was thinking about the composition of the United States Supreme Court — and about how the court would rule on a challenge to abortion rights .
`` We were increasingly sensing that really at any time the Supreme Court could dramatically alter the landscape of Roe , '' he says .
So Ashe decided to do something about it : in January 2014 , he introduced a bill to repeal Vermont 's abortion ban . And in March , it passed .
Ashe 's bill is among the four laws to expand abortion rights that passed in 2014 — more than any year since 1990 , the year the pro-choice research firm the Guttmacher Institute started keeping track of them . Legislators also introduced 91 other bills that failed to become law .
For much of the late 2000s and early 2010s , states passed barely any pro-choice laws . Nearly all abortion legislation focused on restricting access rather than expanding it . That 's what makes this new crop of four laws in 2014 so interesting . State legislators have pushed forward on pro–abortion rights legislation because , much like Ashe , they worry about the possibility of the Supreme Court revisiting the issue — and using that as an opportunity to overturn Roe .
Pro-choice groups think they also have a chance to capitalize on the many pro-life bills that have passed in the past five years : 231 since 2010 , more than in the three decades prior combined .
`` When [ voters ] see the actual facts of the laws that have been passed , they don ’ t just disagree with it — they are enraged . Incensed . I ’ ve never seen anything like it when people learn what ’ s going on , '' says Tresa Undem , a pollster at PerryUndem , which has done polling for abortion rights groups .
The makeup of the Supreme Court worries some legislators , pushing them to act
Legislators like Ashe say they 've started to focus on expanding abortion access now for one big reason : they worry about the current makeup of the Supreme Court and whether the justices might overturn Roe if they take on another abortion case .
The court 's most recent decision came out against abortion rights . That was Gonzalez v. Carhart , a 2007 case in which the Supreme Court upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act , a law Congress passed five year prior that prohibits a type of late-term abortion . The decision worries some court watchers that this particular court could use another abortion case to revisit Roe and its guaranteed access to abortion .
There could be an opportunity to do that soon : states have passed dozens of abortion restrictions in recent years , many of which could potentially spur a case that makes it up to the Supreme Court .
Arizona legislators trying to bring back an old law that banned most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy attempted to take their case to the Supreme Court , which declined the appeal in early 2014 . ( A series of similar 20-week bans have centered on the idea that fetuses can feel pain after that point in a pregnancy . )
The court has also gotten involved in Texas abortion restrictions without actually hearing any cases and ruling on them . In October 2014 , the Supreme Court issued an emergency ruling staying a law that would have shuttered many Texas abortion clinics .
While that ruling was a positive one for the pro-choice movement , the justices also did n't vote to block other parts of the Texas law when asked to do so just a year earlier .
So the current makeup of the Supreme Court suggests to some observers that a case relating to women 's reproductive health could swing in either direction . And states are gearing up for that by introducing a staggering number of abortion-related measures .
There was a big jump in the number of provisions that aimed to protect or expand access to abortions
In 2014 , legislators introduced 95 different provisions , either bills or parts of bills , that aimed to protect or expand abortion access . It 's the highest number of such measures since 1990 . Of these , four passed .
Ashe 's Vermont bill repealed the state 's pre-Roe abortion ban , and a Utah measure scaled back on mandatory counseling in cases where serious problems have been found in a fetus .
Two measures passed establishing buffer zones around abortion clinics in Massachusetts and New Hampshire to keep protesters from harassing clinic patients , but those laws were quickly overturned by the Supreme Court 's decision in June on McCullen v. Coakley , which ruled that buffer zones were too broad a limit on free speech . Four other states considered buffer zone legislation , but did not move forward on the issue .
Other states have looked for different ways to expand abortion access , like loosening parental consent requirements for minors seeking abortions and eliminating the mandatory counseling some states have for victims of rape and incest who are seeking abortions .
And while many of those bills were n't going to go far — they were , after all , being introduced in the same legislatures that passed restrictions — they sent a message , says Elizabeth Nash of the Guttmacher Institute . `` They put folks on notice that not everyone agrees with them , '' she says .
One reason that abortion legislation might be increasing on both sides of the issue : polls show a growing number of Americans consider it an important issue .
In the mid- to late 2000s , the number of US adults that said they view abortion as a critical issue in society fell significantly , dropping from 28 percent in 2006 to 15 percent in 2009 , according to a poll from Pew . But in the years since , that number has crept slowly upward , reaching 18 percent in 2013 .
Pro-choice groups also say they 're seeing voters be increasingly interested in getting involved in the conversation about reproductive rights .
Voters are getting more engaged , says Boyer , and the NWLC can see this through the reception of several social media campaigns the group ran to rally people to contact their legislators about abortion policy .
`` We have seen social media really reach audiences that have been so far unengaged in these types of issues , '' she says . The activists say they 're reaching more millennials but also more health-care providers who are speaking out against legislative interference in the doctor-patient relationship .
Legislators are escalating their efforts , but there are hurdles to doing so
Laws to expand abortion access still face hurdles , and 91 of the 95 measures introduced in 2014 ultimately did n't get passed .
Assemblyman Tom Abinanti ( D-NY ) worked on one of those 91 bills . He introduced legislation in 2014 that aimed to establish a buffer zone to protect women entering abortion clinics from harassment .
But his law ultimately failed in the assembly , as the debate over a hot-button issue like abortion led to it stalling . `` Somehow this is made out to be an abortion versus anti-abortion issue , but that ’ s not necessarily the case , '' he says . `` The issue here is access to reproductive health-care services . ''
Pro-choice politicians do n't always make abortion their top issue , either . In New York , Gov . Andrew Cuomo introduced the Women 's Equality Act in early 2013 . It would , among other measures , codify Roe v. Wade . But even with the governor 's support , the abortion part of that legislation is still sitting in the state Senate — and , Abinanti argues , taking attention away from other pro-choice bills like his .
`` The big battle at the moment is codifying Roe v. Wade , so I 'm expecting we 're not going to be able to move this [ buffer zone bill ] until we resolve that issue , '' he says .

Approves Strict Anti-Abortion Language in Party Platform,2012-08-21,Michael Cooper,"Even as the Republican establishment continued to call for Representative Todd Akin of Missouri to drop out of his Senate race because of his comments on rape and abortion , Republicans approved platform language on Tuesday calling for a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion with no explicit exceptions for cases of rape or incest .
The anti-abortion plank , approved by the Republican platform committee Tuesday morning in Tampa , Fla. , was similar to the planks Republicans have included in their recent party platforms , which also called for a constitutional ban on abortions . The full convention is set to vote on the party ’ s platform on Monday .
While Republican officials stressed that the plank did not go into granular details , saying that they were better left to the states , the language of the plank seems to leave little room for exceptions to the abortion ban . It states that “ the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which can not be infringed . ”
“ Faithful to the ‘ self-evident ’ truths enshrined in the Declaration of Independence , we assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which can not be infringed , ” said the draft platform language approved Tuesday , which was first reported by CNN . “ We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment ’ s protections apply to unborn children . ”
The timing of the approval of the Republican anti-abortion plank was awkward for Mitt Romney , who has denounced Mr. Akin ’ s comments about rape and abortion and who has said that he supports exceptions to allow abortions in cases of rape . And it comes as his selection of his running mate , Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin , was already drawing scrutiny for his support for a more absolute ban on abortions , even in cases of rape or incest .
But Mr. Romney would hardly be the first Republican nominee at odds with his party ’ s more absolute opposition to abortion . Just four years ago , the Republican Party adopted a platform with a similar plank seeking an unconditional ban on abortion , even though its nominee , Senator John McCain of Arizona , had urged the party in the past to allow certain exceptions . George W. Bush also supported outlawing abortion except in cases of rape , incest , or when the life of the pregnant woman was in danger .
After this year ’ s abortion plank language was approved with little debate , the chairman of the platform committee , Gov . Bob McDonnell of Virginia , praised the committee for “ affirming our respect for human life ” and for doing so expeditiously .
The Republican platform committee waded into the abortion debate again later on Tuesday when it approved language opposing drugs like RU-486 , which can terminate pregnancies . “ We oppose approval of these drugs and similar drugs that terminate innocent human life after conception , ” said Mary Summa , a delegate form North Carolina , who introduced a plank calling on the Food and Drug Administration not to approve such drugs .
A member of the committee from Alabama , Jackie Curtiss , sought clarification that the amendment would not apply to so-called “ morning-after ” pills , which prevent conception . “ In light of the recent comments by Congressman Todd Akin , and in an attempt to reaffirm to the American people the party ’ s sensitivity on the subject of rape , I believe that we should not support an amendment which opposes approval of a method that ’ s been proven effective in preventing the pregnancy of rape victims , ” she said .
Given assurance that it did not refer to such morning-after pills , the amendment passed .
The party also approved a plank supporting abstinence-only education , as it has in the past . ( The current platform , from 2008 , says , “ We renew our call for replacing “ family planning ” programs for teens with increased funding for abstinence education , which teaches abstinence until marriage as the responsible and expected standard of behavior . ” )","Even as the Republican establishment continued to call for Representative Todd Akin of Missouri to drop out of his Senate race because of his comments on rape and abortion, Republicans approved platform language on Tuesday calling for a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion with no explicit exceptions for cases of rape or incest.

abortion,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/17/court-sides-faith-based-groups-obamacare-mandate/,Court sides with faith-based groups on Obamacare birth control mandate,2015-09-17,Tom Howell Jr.,"A federal appeals court Thursday ruled in favor of faith-based nonprofits who fought Obamacare ’ s birth control rules , dealing an elusive victory to religious employers who now have a stronger hand in urging the Supreme Court to shield them from the administration ’ s “ contraception mandate . ”
In a pair of opinions , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit sided with religious universities and ministries that object to insuring contraceptives they equate with abortion and feel that opt-out routes provided by the Department of Health and Human Services keep them complicit in sin .
The rulings upheld a lower court ’ s finding and marked a significant break from other circuit rulings that said HHS ’ s efforts to accommodate the groups were sufficient .
Under HHS rules , religious employers who object to covering birth control must notify an insurer , plan administrator or the government in writing so that a third party can manage and pay for the coverage .
“ If one equates the self-certification process with , say , that of obtaining a parade permit , then indeed the burden might well be considered light . But if one sincerely believes that completing [ the opt-out form ] or HHS Notice will result in conscience-violating consequences , what some might consider an otherwise neutral act is a burden too heavy to bear , ” wrote Judge Roger L. Wollman , an appointee of President Ronald Reagan , joined by judges William D. Benton and Steven M. Colloton , both appointees of President George W. Bush .
The contraception mandate is an outgrowth of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 that requires employers to cover 20 types of FDA-approved drugs and services as part of their health plans or else pay hefty fines . Pitched as a boon for women ’ s health , the rules quickly spawned controversy , with dozens of religious nonprofits and devout business owners filing suit .
Many Catholic employers object to all forms of contraception , while evangelical groups and others say they ’ re only opposed to morning-after pills they equate with abortion .
Family owned for-profits were victorious before the Supreme Court last year , forcing HHS to draft an accommodation for them . The same rules that HHS drafted for religious nonprofits now apply to the closely held companies , although they must meet certain standards .
Plaintiffs on the nonprofit side are not satisfied though . They want the same blanket exemption from the mandate that houses of worship enjoy .
Several faith-based nonprofits have asked the justices to take up their case in the coming term .
With a circuit split in hand , they ’ ve got a much better shot at grabbing the court ’ s attention .
“ The government keeps telling the Supreme Court ‘ Move along , nothing important here ’ in hopes that the court will ignore this crucial issue . But with today ’ s decisions , the court will have great reason to decide this issue in the next term , ” said Lori Windham , senior counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty .
The Eighth Circuit cited the justices ’ holding in the for-profit case , known as “ Hobby Lobby , ” that enforcing the mandate violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act — a bipartisan 1993 law that says the government had to have a compelling interest in carrying out a law that substantially burdens a person ’ s religious beliefs , and must do so in the least restrictive way possible .
Unlike other circuits , Thursday ’ s panel said the HHS accommodation presented a substantial burden on faith-based nonprofits .
Citing the 2014 decision , the panel said “ it is not our role to second-guess [ the plaintiffs ’ ] honest assessment of a ‘ difficult and important question of religion and moral philosophy , namely , the circumstances under which it is wrong for a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but that has the effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an immoral act by another . ’ ”
Brigitte Amiri , a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union ’ s Reproductive Freedom Project , said she disagreed with the decision but acknowledged that it increases the likelihood that the justices will take up one of the faith group ’ s cases .
“ Although we all have the right to our religious beliefs , those beliefs can not be used to harm or discriminate against others , ” she said . “ Today ’ s decision is also an outlier — all of the other seven courts of appeals to consider the issue have found that the accommodation available for nonprofit organizations does not substantially burden the employers ’ religious beliefs . ”
Thursday ’ s ruling addressed lawsuits from Dordt College in Iowa , Heartland Christian College in Missouri and CNS International Ministries , Inc. ( CNS ) , a Missouri nonprofit that helps people with substance abuse and behavioral problems .
The groups said intrauterine devices ( IUDs ) and emergency contraceptives covered by the mandate are the same as “ abortion on demand . ”","A federal appeals court Thursday ruled in favor of faith-based nonprofits who fought Obamacare’s birth control rules, dealing an elusive victory to religious employers who now have a stronger hand in urging the Supreme Court to shield them from the administration’s “contraception mandate.”

In a pair of opinions, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit sided with religious universities and ministries that object to insuring contraceptives they equate with abortion and feel that opt-out routes provided by the Department of Health and Human Services keep them complicit in sin.

The rulings upheld a lower court’s finding and marked a significant break from other circuit rulings that said HHS’s efforts to accommodate the groups were sufficient.

Under HHS rules, religious employers who object to covering birth control must notify an insurer, plan administrator or the government in writing so that a third party can manage and pay for the coverage.

“If one equates the self-certification process with, say, that of obtaining a parade permit, then indeed the burden might well be considered light. But if one sincerely believes that completing [the opt-out form] or HHS Notice will result in conscience-violating consequences, what some might consider an otherwise neutral act is a burden too heavy to bear,” wrote Judge Roger L. Wollman, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, joined by judges William D. Benton and Steven M. Colloton, both appointees of President George W. Bush.

The contraception mandate is an outgrowth of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 that requires employers to cover 20 types of FDA-approved drugs and services as part of their health plans or else pay hefty fines. Pitched as a boon for women’s health, the rules quickly spawned controversy, with dozens of religious nonprofits and devout business owners filing suit.

Many Catholic employers object to all forms of contraception, while evangelical groups and others say they’re only opposed to morning-after pills they equate with abortion.

Family owned for-profits were victorious before the Supreme Court last year, forcing HHS to draft an accommodation for them. The same rules that HHS drafted for religious nonprofits now apply to the closely held companies, although they must meet certain standards.

Plaintiffs on the nonprofit side are not satisfied though. They want the same blanket exemption from the mandate that houses of worship enjoy.

Several faith-based nonprofits have asked the justices to take up their case in the coming term.

With a circuit split in hand, they’ve got a much better shot at grabbing the court’s attention.

“The government keeps telling the Supreme Court ‘Move along, nothing important here’ in hopes that the court will ignore this crucial issue. But with today’s decisions, the court will have great reason to decide this issue in the next term,” said Lori Windham, senior counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty.

The Eighth Circuit cited the justices’ holding in the for-profit case, known as “Hobby Lobby,” that enforcing the mandate violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act — a bipartisan 1993 law that says the government had to have a compelling interest in carrying out a law that substantially burdens a person’s religious beliefs, and must do so in the least restrictive way possible.

Unlike other circuits, Thursday’s panel said the HHS accommodation presented a substantial burden on faith-based nonprofits.

Citing the 2014 decision, the panel said “it is not our role to second-guess [the plaintiffs’] honest assessment of a ‘difficult and important question of religion and moral philosophy, namely, the circumstances under which it is wrong for a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but that has the effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an immoral act by another.’”

Brigitte Amiri, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union’s Reproductive Freedom Project, said she disagreed with the decision but acknowledged that it increases the likelihood that the justices will take up one of the faith group’s cases.

“Although we all have the right to our religious beliefs, those beliefs cannot be used to harm or discriminate against others,” she said. “Today’s decision is also an outlier — all of the other seven courts of appeals to consider the issue have found that the accommodation available for nonprofit organizations does not substantially burden the employers’ religious beliefs.”

Thursday’s ruling addressed lawsuits from Dordt College in Iowa, Heartland Christian College in Missouri and CNS International Ministries, Inc. (CNS), a Missouri nonprofit that helps people with substance abuse and behavioral problems.

The groups said intrauterine devices (IUDs) and emergency contraceptives covered by the mandate are the same as “abortion on demand.”

He then added as an aside , `` I 'm not sure we need half-a-billion dollars for women 's health issues '' — a statement Hillary Clinton and other Democrats pounced on , portraying it as a gaffe that reveals that Bush does n't care about women 's health . He has since said he `` misspoke . ''
But Bush 's comments raise questions about just how much money Planned Parenthood actually gets , what the group does with it , and whether defunding it would actually save taxpayers money .
Planned Parenthood does receive a half-billion dollars a year from the government . But that 's just one data point — here 's what you need to know about where that money comes from and where it goes .
Bush is right that Planned Parenthood receives $ 500 million a year in government funding — or , to be more exact , $ 528 million last year , according to Planned Parenthood 's latest annual report .
That totals more than 40 percent of Planned Parenthood 's total $ 1.3 billion in revenue for the year , which suggests that the organization would be in some heavy financial trouble without that public funding .
Those public funds come from two programs : Medicaid , the health care program targeted at lower-income Americans , and Title X , a federal family planning program that likewise primarily serves lower-income Americans . The overwhelming majority of federal funding to Planned Parenthood comes from Medicaid — 75 percent , according to a Planned Parenthood spokesman .
Not all of the public funds Planned Parenthood receives are federal spending , however . While Title X is a federal program , Medicaid operates using federal and state funds . States receive a 90 percent federal reimbursement on Medicaid family planning spending , for example . So when Washington politicians talk about `` defunding '' Planned Parenthood , they generally mean cutting off federal money . States could continue to spend as they please .
Abortion is driving the defund-Planned-Parenthood discussion in the wake of undercover videos from the anti-abortion-rights Center for Medical Progress . The group says its videos show Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal tissue and have sparked a political firestorm . Planned Parenthood , for its part , says it does not sell fetal tissue and claims these transactions were donations .
However , abortions are actually not a big part of what Planned Parenthood says it does — 3 percent of the services it provided last year were abortion-related , according to the organization 's annual report . ( For a sense of the scope of that , abortions accounted for about 328,000 of the group 's nearly 10.6 million services provided last year . )
However , this 3 percent statistic has many critics , who point out , for example , that it does n't explain how much of Planned Parenthood 's revenue comes from abortion . Others note that the figure counts services provided , not patients served — and some patients receive more than one service from the organization . That means more than 3 percent of patients receive abortions ( Politifact this week estimated the figure at around 12 percent , for example ) .
The overwhelming majority of Planned Parenthood 's services involve screening for and treating sexually transmitted diseases and infections , as well as providing contraception .
Title X and Medicaid are programs that target low- to middle-income Americans , and many of Planned Parenthood 's patients are likewise lower-income . As of 2012 , 79 percent of people receiving services from Planned Parenthood lived at 150 percent of the federal poverty level or lower ( that comes out to around $ 18,500 for a single adult ) , according to a March Government Accountability Office report .
Title X does not allow federal funds to be used for abortions . Medicaid , however , does allow government money to be spent on them — in very restricted cases .
The 1977 Hyde Amendment dictated that federal Medicaid funds could only be used to fund abortions in cases of rape , incest or to protect the life of the mother . However , some states have expanded cases in which they will provide funds . Currently , 17 states allow funds to be used for `` medically necessary '' abortions . In those cases that these states count as medically necessary but that are not permitted by the federal guidelines , states cover the cost alone .
What would it mean to `` defund '' Planned Parenthood and would it save taxpayers money ?
Efforts to strip Planned Parenthood of public dollars go back decades , as Kaiser Health News ' Julie Rovner wrote recently . The most recent attempt , known as S. 1881 , would have stripped Planned Parenthood of federal funding and made it `` available to other eligible entities to provide women 's health care services . '' Senate Democrats , however , successfully blocked that bill this week .
Defunding the group might cut some spending and accomplish one Republican anti-abortion goal , but it could also backfire , as Congressional Budget Office Director Keith Hall wrote this week in a letter addressing S. 1881 .
Though the CBO did n't do a full , formal analysis of the bill , Hall pointed out that while the bill could cut government spending , it could also increase it . While displacing Title X funding from Planned Parenthood to other clinics , the bill could have cut Medicaid spending as some beneficiaries might fail or decide not to seek out family planning services at other clinics . But on the other hand , it could have led to more spending ( not to mention more unplanned pregnancies ) :
`` CBO also expects that some of the services that would not be used if S. 1881 was enacted would include those that help women avert pregnancies and deliveries .

To be clear , the CBO did n't come to a firm conclusion on whether more or less spending is more likely .

How much does the government pay to Planned Parenthood?

Bush is right that Planned Parenthood receives $500 million a year in government funding — or, to be more exact, $528 million last year, according to Planned Parenthood's latest annual report.

That totals more than 40 percent of Planned Parenthood's total $1.3 billion in revenue for the year, which suggests that the organization would be in some heavy financial trouble without that public funding.

What programs are funding that money?

Those public funds come from two programs: Medicaid, the health care program targeted at lower-income Americans, and Title X, a federal family planning program that likewise primarily serves lower-income Americans.

Who goes to Planned Parenthood?

Title X and Medicaid are programs that target low- to middle-income Americans, and many of Planned Parenthood's patients are likewise lower-income. As of 2012, 79 percent of people receiving services from Planned Parenthood lived at 150 percent of the federal poverty level or lower (that comes out to around $18,500 for a single adult), according to a March Government Accountability Office report.

What does the law say on funding abortions?

Title X does not allow federal funds to be used for abortions. Medicaid, however, does allow government money to be spent on them — in very restricted cases.

The 1977 Hyde Amendment dictated that federal Medicaid funds could only be used to fund abortions in cases of rape, incest or to protect the life of the mother. However, some states have expanded cases in which they will provide funds. Currently, 17 states allow funds to be used for ""medically necessary"" abortions. In those cases that these states count as medically necessary but that are not permitted by the federal guidelines, states cover the cost alone.

Since Republican Rep. Todd Akin first said the words ""legitimate rape"" Sunday, just about everyone in the Republican Party has condemned those comments.

The Missouri Senate candidate later apologized, but his remarks continue to drive the political debate. They've also raised questions about the anti-abortion record of the Republican vice presidential candidate, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.

But the effort, led by by Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, could reverberate in the 2016 elections. Republicans are looking to mitigate the hefty advantage in polls that Democrats have had, particularly among young, unmarried women, an important voting bloc in the presidential contest and battleground Senate races.

Gardner made the birth control proposal a centerpiece of his pitch to female voters during his campaign for Senate last year.

“I think Republicans can be on defense, particularly when it comes to the attacks that Democrats throw through the ‘war on women,’” the first-term senator said in an interview, adding that his bill offers Republicans a way to show “how we can actually move forward.”

The GOP bill would provide drugmakers with financial incentives, as well as speedier regulatory approval, to pursue the Food and Drug Administration’s blessing to sell their contraceptive pills over the counter. It would also repeal Obamacare’s ban on using health savings accounts to purchase over-the-counter drugs. Women would then be able to purchase birth control pills without a prescription with money from those accounts.

Ayotte will likely have a competitive reelection battle in New Hampshire, and among the co-sponsors are two other Democratic targets in 2016 — GOP Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Richard Burr of North Carolina. Other senators backing the bill hail from other traditional swing states: Joni Ernst of Iowa, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Dean Heller of Nevada.

“What has happened over time is the left [and] Democrats have been pretty effective at getting young women, particularly, to think Republicans are actually opposed to contraceptives,” said Johnson, who’s considered among the most vulnerable Senate Republicans next fall. “Nothing could be further from the truth.”

Long-shot Republican presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina, the sole woman in the GOP field, endorsed the concept of over-the-counter birth control in a speech at the Competitive Enterprise Institute last week, saying it would “drive down prices and increase availability.”

Democrats agree birth control pills should be more readily available over the counter. But they argue that the GOP plan would actually decrease birth control access for women by allowing insurers to get out of covering contraceptives — which could cost hundreds of dollars per year — sold over the counter. Under the GOP plan, they say, insurers wouldn’t be required to pay for over-the-counter drugs. And that, in turn, could leave many women struggling to pay for birth control.

A group of Democratic senators led by Patty Murray of Washington recently unveiled a bill in response to the GOP legislation that they say would ensure contraceptives purchased without a prescription would still be covered by insurance. But unlike the Republican plan, it would not attempt to encourage drugmakers to get approval to sell over the counter.

Murray rolled out her bill last week with 30 Democratic backers.

“The point of my legislation is very clear: that you can say it’s accessible but if you take away the ability for women to have it covered under insurance, it means nothing,” Murray said. “So access and affordability is the name for a reason. We want to make sure that women have access, that it’s affordable and it’s covered by their insurance. That’s a huge difference.”

Murray’s bill is backed by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, NARAL Pro-Choice America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. ACOG came out against the GOP bill, saying it would take a “giant step in the wrong direction” because it doesn’t ensure insurance coverage.

Republicans say the Democrats’ complaints about their bill are meaningless.

“That’s probably the first time I’ve heard that providing a pharmaceutical product over the counter — which was always the cheaper, more accessible way to do it — is limiting,” Burr said, when asked about the Democrats’ criticism of the bill. “I find that ludicrous.”

The Murray bill, according to Republicans, doesn’t have the financial or fast-track incentives that would encourage drugmakers to go through the complex over-the-counter approval process.

“I’m not sure what they’re trying to accomplish in [their] bill because our bill really does generate more potential for access for women for over the counter,” Ayotte added. “They don’t have that piece in their bill, so I don’t know what they’re trying to accomplish.”

One poll earlier this year suggests voters are split on which party would better handle the issue. The Pew Research Center found in February that 43 percent of Americans say Democrats would do a better job dealing with abortion and contraception, compared with 40 percent who preferred Republicans.

The Senate last took up the contraceptive fight last summer. At the time, the Democratic-controlled chamber tried to advance a bill to reverse last June’s Supreme Court ruling that said certain for-profit companies could opt out of Obamacare’s mandate that insurers cover contraceptives without a co-pay on religious grounds.

The fight over birth control also flared in 2012, when the Senate narrowly defeated a measure backed by Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) that would allow employers with moral objections to refuse coverage of a range of health care services, including contraceptives.

For Republicans in tough reelection races in moderate swing states next year, Gardner could be a model on how to battle charges of being anti-woman.

The Colorado Senate contest, one of the most high-profile races last year, was characterized largely by near-obsessive focus on women’s issues.

Gardner opposes abortion but stressed during his campaign that he supports the women’s ability to purchase contraception coverage without a prescription. Democrats highlighted Gardner’s previous support of so-called personhood, which would confer legal rights to fetuses, but Gardner reversed his stance and said his original position was a “mistake.”

“Democrats’ obnoxious strategy to use women as political pawns was rejected in 2014 and will be again in 2016,” said Andrea Bozek, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

Sadie Weiner, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said of the GOP bill: “It’s just pretty obvious that this is their attempt to distract from their record.”

The focus for Democrats, Weiner said, will be “making sure voters understand what it is that these senators have done to women’s health care and how that’s contrasted with Democratic candidates.”

It’s unclear whether the GOP birth control bill will make it to the Senate floor this session. Gardner and Ayotte said they’ll push to get a floor vote on it as an amendment to a related measure.

“I think this makes tremendous sense,” Burr said. Any reluctance to vote on it, he said, “is to try to keep this in the realm of a political issue, which it’s not. I mean, this is a purely policy issue when you look at the [FDA’s] threshold that has always been there to determine the difference between prescription and over the counter.”",www.politico.com,left,X6boM6148ThUAslO

A new Pew Research Center survey exemplifies the failures with much of public-opinion polling on abortion policy .
new poll from the Pew Research Center purports to show that Americans tend to support the Supreme Court ’ s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling , as well as that a majority agrees more with Democrats than with Republicans on abortion policy .
The results indicate that 70 percent of respondents do not want to see Roe overturned , while 28 percent say they do ; this is little different from the results Pew found in its 2016 survey . The poll also found that 42 percent of respondents agree with the Democratic party ’ s abortion policies , compared to 32 who say they agree with those of the GOP . About a quarter of respondents said they don ’ t agree with either party ’ s policies .
As is often the case with public-opinion polls , especially those dealing with abortion , it ’ s a good idea to examine the survey questions a little more closely before entirely buying into the results .
Consider , for instance , the way the poll describes the ruling in Roe when asking respondents whether they ’ d like to see it overturned : “ In 1973 the Roe versus Wade decision established a woman ’ s constitutional right to an abortion , at least in the first three months of pregnancy . ”
In reality , the decision in Roe permitted women to obtain an abortion well past the first three months of pregnancy , especially when given the Supreme Court ’ s ruling in Roe ’ s companion case Doe v. Bolton , which required states to offer a “ maternal health ” exception to any abortion restriction . The decision in Doe defined the health exception expansively : “ all factors — physical , emotional , psychological , familial , and the woman ’ s age — relevant to the wellbeing of the patient. ” In other words , states must ensure that abortion be available to women essentially on demand .
Most Americans are unaware of these details of how Roe changed abortion policy in the U.S. A Pew poll in 2013 , for instance , found that only 62 percent of Americans even knew Roe had to do with abortion ; among respondents under 30 , that percentage fell to 44 percent . How much less must they understand that Roe and Doe essentially legalized abortion on demand for the entire country ? And how much more unaware must the respondents to Pew ’ s survey be , given that the question itself presents them with inaccurate information ?
What ’ s more , when the new Pew poll asks respondents whether they agree more with the Democratic or the Republican party on abortion policy , it offers no specifics about what those policies are . It ’ s left entirely up to each respondent to define for herself , drawing on her potentially limited knowledge , what abortion policies each party favors , a factor that obviously complicates how we should understand the survey ’ s results .
Especially in light of habitually inaccurate media coverage of legislation that expands abortion rights — as well as the demonstrated tendency of mainstream outlets to focus intensely on pro-life heartbeat bills while offering relatively little information about bills such as those in Illinois and Vermont that define abortion on demand as a “ fundamental right ” — it makes sense to be skeptical of whether the respondents in this survey were operating from an accurate understanding of where each party stands on abortion .
To judge from the information available in popular media about how each party wishes to regulate abortion , it ’ s likely that most people know neither that the Democratic party ’ s platform demands that taxpayers fund abortion procedures nor that every Democratic politician currently running for president has failed to articulate a single restriction that they support on abortion .
Finally , it ’ s worth contrasting the framework used in the Pew survey with other , more useful public-opinion polls about abortion . When asking broadly about views on abortion , the Pew poll asks respondents to say whether they believe abortion ought to be “ legal in all or most cases ” or “ illegal in all or most cases. ” These are fairly broad categories with little room for specific line-drawing or consideration of actual regulations on abortion rights .
Compare this with the annual Marist–Knights of Columbus poll , which asks respondents about abortion within the trimester framework created by Roe . Though the Marist poll most often finds that Americans tend to describe themselves as “ pro-choice ” rather than “ pro-life , ” it has also found consistently that most Americans would limit abortion to the first three months of pregnancy , if they would permit it at all . Marist has found dramatically decreasing levels of public support for legal abortion as pregnancy progresses , and Gallup polls have documented a similar phenomenon .
The Marist poll also asks respondents about specific types of abortion regulations that pro-life lawmakers have proposed , such as the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection act , which would prohibit abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy , as research suggests that unborn children begin to feel pain at that stage . Marist has also polled Americans on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act , bills prohibiting taxpayer funding of abortion and prohibiting abortion for the reason that an unborn child has been diagnosed with Down syndrome .
Because of the complexity of the ethical , legal , and political questions surrounding abortion , imprecise surveys like the one Pew released last week are of limited use in sorting through Americans ’ views on the complicated details of abortion policy .","Pro-choice and pro-life protesters outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis, Mo., May 31, 2019.

How much less must they understand that Roe and Doe essentially legalized abortion on demand for the entire country? And how much more unaware must the respondents to Pew’s survey be, given that the question itself presents them with inaccurate information?

What’s more, when the new Pew poll asks respondents whether they agree more with the Democratic or the Republican party on abortion policy, it offers no specifics about what those policies are. It’s left entirely up to each respondent to define for herself, drawing on her potentially limited knowledge, what abortion policies each party favors, a factor that obviously complicates how we should understand the survey’s results.

Especially in light of habitually inaccurate media coverage of legislation that expands abortion rights — as well as the demonstrated tendency of mainstream outlets to focus intensely on pro-life heartbeat bills while offering relatively little information about bills such as those in Illinois and Vermont that define abortion on demand as a “fundamental right” — it makes sense to be skeptical of whether the respondents in this survey were operating from an accurate understanding of where each party stands on abortion.

To judge from the information available in popular media about how each party wishes to regulate abortion, it’s likely that most people know neither that the Democratic party’s platform demands that taxpayers fund abortion procedures nor that every Democratic politician currently running for president has failed to articulate a single restriction that they support on abortion.

Finally, it’s worth contrasting the framework used in the Pew survey with other, more useful public-opinion polls about abortion. When asking broadly about views on abortion, the Pew poll asks respondents to say whether they believe abortion ought to be “legal in all or most cases” or “illegal in all or most cases.” These are fairly broad categories with little room for specific line-drawing or consideration of actual regulations on abortion rights.

Compare this with the annual Marist–Knights of Columbus poll, which asks respondents about abortion within the trimester framework created by Roe. Though the Marist poll most often finds that Americans tend to describe themselves as “pro-choice” rather than “pro-life,” it has also found consistently that most Americans would limit abortion to the first three months of pregnancy, if they would permit it at all. Marist has found dramatically decreasing levels of public support for legal abortion as pregnancy progresses, and Gallup polls have documented a similar phenomenon.

The Marist poll also asks respondents about specific types of abortion regulations that pro-life lawmakers have proposed, such as the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection act, which would prohibit abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, as research suggests that unborn children begin to feel pain at that stage. Marist has also polled Americans on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, bills prohibiting taxpayer funding of abortion and prohibiting abortion for the reason that an unborn child has been diagnosed with Down syndrome.

Because of the complexity of the ethical, legal, and political questions surrounding abortion, imprecise surveys like the one Pew released last week are of limited use in sorting through Americans’ views on the complicated details of abortion policy.",www.nationalreview.com,right,HnfQFKFhKbZJqygW

But a contentious committee hearing , and some confusing comments by Virginia Gov . Ralph Northam , have turned debate over the bill into a nationwide furor .
Virginia House Bill 2491 would roll back a number of requirements , including a 24-hour waiting period and a mandate that second-trimester abortions take place in a hospital . Always something of a long shot in the Republican-controlled state legislature , the bill may now be doomed by the national firestorm surrounding it .
The controversy has centered on a provision concerning third-trimester abortions . Under current Virginia law , in order for a patient to terminate a pregnancy in the third trimester , three doctors must certify that continuing the pregnancy would likely cause the patient ’ s death or “ substantially and irremediably impair ” her mental or physical health . The new bill would reduce the number of doctors to one , and remove the “ substantially and irremediably ” qualifier — abortions would be allowed in cases where a mother ’ s mental or physical health is threatened , even if the damage might not be irreversible .
The bill began inspiring outcry among abortion opponents nationwide after its sponsor , Virginia Delegate Kathy Tran , said in a committee hearing on Monday that it would technically allow abortion until the point of birth , if a doctor agreed it was necessary .
Gov . Northam , a Democrat , was asked about the bill in a radio interview on Wednesday , and his response only added to the controversy . Appearing to discuss what would happen if a child was born after a failed attempt at abortion , he said , “ the infant would be resuscitated if that ’ s what the mother and the family desired , and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother . ”
Some took Northam ’ s comments as an endorsement of infanticide . “ In just a few years pro-abortion zealots went from ‘ safe , legal , and rare ’ to ‘ keep the newborns comfortable while the doctor debates infanticide , ” said Sen. Ben Sasse ( R-NE ) in a statement on Wednesday .
A spokesperson for Gov . Northam told ███ his comments were “ absolutely not ” a reference to infanticide , and that they “ focused on the tragic and extremely rare case in which a woman with a nonviable pregnancy or severe fetal abnormalities went into labor . ”
But Northam ’ s words helped stir up a nationwide debate around one of several recent efforts to expand abortion access at the state level . Laws restricting abortion access are nothing new , having proliferated nationwide since 2010 .
But now , buoyed by Democratic victories in the 2018 midterms and anxious to shore up access in anticipation of a challenge to Roe v. Wade , abortion rights supporters in state legislatures are backing bills that would roll back some of the earlier restrictions or introduce new protections for abortion rights . And while the particulars of the controversy in Virginia are unique , versions of it are likely to take place across the country as abortion-rights supporters back legislation in purple and even red states .
The controversy centers on the Virginia bill ’ s provisions for third-trimester abortions
Kathy Tran , a Democrat , was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 2017 , one of a record 28 women chosen for the legislative chamber that year . She introduced HB 2491 earlier this year , and in a committee hearing on Monday , she was questioned about the bill by fellow delegate Todd Gilbert , a Republican .
“ How late in the third trimester could a physician perform an abortion if he indicated it would impair the mental health of the woman ? ” Gilbert asked .
“ Through the third trimester , ” Tran responded . “ The third trimester goes all the way up to 40 weeks . ”
“ Where it ’ s obvious that a woman is about to give birth , ” Gilbert then asked , “ would that still be a point at which she could request an abortion if she was so certified ? She ’ s dilating . ”
HB 2491 would not actually change the time limit for receiving an abortion in Virginia , Elizabeth Nash , senior state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute , told ███ . It would change the number of physicians required for approval , and broaden the health circumstances under which an abortion would be allowed .
Situations in which a woman seeks an abortion when she is ready to give birth are incredibly uncommon , Nash said . Ninety-two percent of all abortions in America happen in the first trimester , according to Planned Parenthood . Only 1.4 percent of abortions happen at 21 weeks ’ gestation or beyond , according to the organization — the third trimester begins at around 28 weeks .
Nonetheless , footage of Tran ’ s comments soon spread in conservative circles . “ This literally makes me sick to my stomach , ” former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley tweeted on Tuesday .
What is happening in our country . This literally makes me sick to my stomach .... # AdoptionIsAlwaysAnOption https : //t.co/OdAU4gjMh8 — Nikki Haley ( @ NikkiHaley ) January 30 , 2019
The National Review ran footage of the comments under the headline , “ Virginia Bill Would Legalize Abortion Up To Birth . ”
“ We need to trust women to make their own healthcare decisions , ” Tran said in a statement to Virginia ’ s WSET on Wednesday . “ I regret that these partisan games have taken the focus away from where it should be : on the Virginian women who have asked for this bill to get politicians out of their private medical decisions . ”
On Thursday , Tran told the Washington Post that she “ misspoke ” in her response to Gilbert ’ s question during the hearing : “ I should have said : ‘ Clearly , no , because infanticide is not allowed in Virginia , and what would have happened in that moment would be a live birth . ’ ”
Tran also said she has been receiving death threats since footage of the hearing spread . She has not responded to ███ ’ s request for comment .
Meanwhile , in a Wednesday interview on Virginia radio station WTOP , reporter Julie Carey asked Northam to respond to Tran ’ s comments .
“ Do you support her measure ? ” Carey asked . “ Explain her answer . ”
“ This is why decisions such as this should be made by providers , physicians , and the mothers and fathers that are involved , ” Northam said . “ When we talk about third-trimester abortions , ” he added , “ it ’ s done in cases where there may be severe deformities . There may be a fetus that ’ s non-viable . ”
“ If a mother is in labor , I can tell you exactly what would happen , ” the governor went on . “ The infant would be delivered . The infant would be kept comfortable . The infant would be resuscitated if that ’ s what the mother and the family desired , and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother . ”
Northam ’ s comments quickly sparked outrage , with some interpreting them as an endorsement of infanticide .
“ The inhumanity on display here is hard to fathom , ” tweeted Seth Mandel , executive editor of the conservative Washington Examiner . “ The baby would be delivered and kept comfortable while its parents debated whether or not to execute it . ”
I expected this description to be an exaggeration but no , it 's actually even worse . My god , the inhumanity on display here is hard to fathom . The baby would be delivered and kept comfortable while its parents debated whether or not to execute it .

Daily Wire editor-in-chief Ben Shapiro responded to Northam ’ s comments with a tweet that mentioned “ murdering babies outside the womb . ”

In an interview with the Daily Caller , President Trump said he was surprised to hear about Northam ’ s comments . He said he had watched video of Tran ’ s remarks , calling them “ terrible . ”
“ Do you remember when I said Hillary Clinton was willing to rip the baby out of the womb ? ” Trump asked . “ That ’ s what it is , that ’ s what they ’ re doing , it ’ s terrible . ”
Northam ’ s communications director Ofirah Yheskel attempted to clarify the governor ’ s comments in a statement to media outlets on Wednesday .
“ No woman seeks a third trimester abortion except in the case of tragic or difficult circumstances , such as a nonviable pregnancy or in the event of severe fetal abnormalities , and the governor ’ s comments were limited to the actions physicians would take in the event that a woman in those circumstances went into labor , ” Yheskel said . “ Attempts to extrapolate these comments otherwise is in bad faith and underscores exactly why the governor believes physicians and women , not legislators , should make these difficult and deeply personal medical decisions . ”
A spokesperson for the governor told ███ that the governor had “ absolutely not ” been referring to the euthanasia of infants born after a failed abortion . “ The governor ’ s comments focused on the tragic and extremely rare case in which a woman with a nonviable pregnancy or severe fetal abnormalities went into labor , ” the spokesperson said .
It ’ s still not entirely clear what Northam was trying to say about HB 2491 . The interview was confusing in other ways beyond his comments about infants being born . Northam also said he supported having “ at least two providers ” involved in the decision of whether to perform a third-trimester abortion , although the current law requires three and HB 2491 would require one .
Some have raised the possibility that Northam was not fully familiar with the bill at issue . Whatever the case , his comments added fuel to the fire already blazing around the bill .
Debates like this could become more common with Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court
Northam ’ s comments added to concern that abortion opponents already felt over HB 2491 ’ s broadening of the circumstances under which someone could seek a third-trimester abortion .
“ It seemed like he was really raising the possibility of making a deliberate decision to let an infant , even who had been resuscitated , die because of considerations like the mental health of the mother , ” Matthew Lee Anderson , the founder of Christian politics and culture website Mere Orthodoxy , told ███ of the governor ’ s remarks .
For many abortion opponents , Anderson said , the possibility of allowing third-trimester abortions due to mental health concerns was troubling . A doctor could argue , for instance , that having a child with Down syndrome would negatively impact a mother ’ s mental health , he said .
It ’ s not necessarily reassuring that it ’ s extremely uncommon for a patient to seek abortion when about to give birth , according to Anderson . “ Wildly implausible scenarios become plausible through moments like this , ” he said . “ We talk about these rare instances and the possibility of them in order to bring up deeper concerns about the principles at work in our decision-making , and we make laws not just to handle general categories of people but to address what happens on the margins as well . ”
Meanwhile , some say that bringing up the idea of someone seeking an abortion while in labor , as Gilbert did , was a way of hijacking debate on the bill . “ The idea of raising that means that you ’ re trying just to derail this bill , ” the Guttmacher Institute ’ s Nash said .
The Virginia bill comes as some other states are passing laws to roll back abortion restrictions or otherwise expand access . New York ’ s recently passed Reproductive Health Act , for instance , allows abortions after 24 weeks if the fetus is not viable or if there is a threat to the mother ’ s health . Under previous law , which allowed an abortion at that point only if a mother ’ s life was in danger , reproductive rights advocates say women were forced to travel long distances and pay thousands of dollars in order to get an abortion , sometimes when they were very ill .
The New York Civil Liberties Union , for instance , highlighted the case of Sophia , a woman who became pregnant during treatment for several types of cancer . Doctors said the fetus was unlikely to survive , but because Sophia was past the 24-week limit , she had to travel 2,000 miles for the procedure , a trip made risky because of her illness .
Meanwhile , opponents of the New York law have raised concerns similar to Anderson ’ s , worrying that the health provision in the new law may include mental health issues . “ When you use the term ‘ health of the woman , ’ that ’ s very elastic , ” Bill Donohue , president of the Catholic League , told CBS New York . “ That has been defined as mental health , she ’ s depressed , she doesn ’ t feel good that day . ”
The controversy over the Virginia bill may have ended its already-slim chances for passage — for now , it has been tabled by the House of Delegates . But such controversies will surely arise again as reproductive rights advocates seek to shore up abortion protections where they can — and abortion opponents seek to pass new restrictions — in anticipation that the Supreme Court , with the addition of Justice Brett Kavanaugh , may vote to overturn Roe v. Wade .
If the landmark abortion decision is overturned or substantially weakened , states will be able to enforce abortion restrictions that would have been blocked by courts in the past , including bans on abortion before fetal viability .
“ The change in the Supreme Court has just sent this huge wave across state legislatures , ” Nash said . “ Conservative legislators are looking to ban abortion because they ’ re seeing an opportunity , and progressive legislators are looking to protect abortion rights because they ’ re fearful of what could happen at the Supreme Court . ”
Abortion restrictions at the state level are nothing new : hundreds have been passed since 2010 , when Republicans took over many statehouses . And to some degree , abortion rights advocates have been playing defense , protesting those bills when they come up and challenging them in the courts .
But bills like those in Virginia and New York that seek to expand access have been slowly growing more common since 2014 , Nash said . As they become more common , a new picture will emerge in the abortion debate : one of abortion rights supporters attempting to gain ground and opponents pushing back . The controversy over the Virginia bill — fed though it may have been by confusing comments by Gov . Northam — is likely only the beginning .

The chairman of the RNC says he hopes Akin wo n't be at the national convention
Calls mount for the Republican candidate to drop out of Missouri Senate race
Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin canceled a primetime TV appearance at the last minute Monday night , shying away from the spotlight on a day he was under fire for controversial comments he made about rape .
Akin was scheduled to be on CNN 's `` Piers Morgan Tonight . '' A studio was booked and a chair was set .
But shortly before he was to appear , Akin canceled . He was editing a new ad , an activity that forced him to bow out , two people with ties to his campaign said .
`` Congressman , you have an open invitation to join me in that chair whenever you feel up to it , '' said Morgan .
Pressure from the mainstream Republican Party mounted on the Missouri representative throughout the day to drop his bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in November because of his comments about `` legitimate rape '' and opposing abortion in rape cases .
McCaskill also was booked to be a guest on `` Piers Morgan Tonight . '' She canceled earlier in the day .
Akin 's remarks shifted the political focus Monday to abortion and women 's rights , causing certain GOP nominee Mitt Romney 's team to clarify the campaign 's abortion stance .
Top congressional Republicans , including House Speaker John Boehner , Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. John Cornyn of Texas advised Akin to spend time considering what is best for his family , party and country -- political code for urging him to withdraw .
`` What he said is just flat wrong in addition to being wildly offensive to any victim of sexual abuse , '' McConnell said in a statement . `` Although Representative Akin has apologized , I believe he should take time with his family to consider whether this statement will prevent him from effectively representing our party in this critical election . ''
JUST WATCHED Granderson to women : Wake up Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Granderson to women : Wake up 03:28
The National Republican Senatorial Committee headed by Cornyn has advised Akin that it will not support his campaign if he stays in the race , a source from the group told CNN .
In an interview on Monday with WMUR television in Manchester , New Hampshire , Romney echoed the sentiment of other GOP leaders , according to a tweet from the station 's political director , Josh McElveen :
`` @ MittRomney on if Akin should end senate bid- 'he should spend 24 hours considering what will best help the country at this critical time . ''
Missouri election rules allow a candidate to withdraw with little difficulty through Tuesday , which is 11 weeks prior to the Nov. 6 election .
After Tuesday , the candidate must get a court order and pay for any necessary reprinting of ballots . The state Republican Party would choose another candidate to run against McCaskill , considered one of the most vulnerable senators in the country .
Akin apologized , repeatedly , Monday for what he called a serious error in using the wrong words when he stated in an earlier interview that `` legitimate rape '' rarely resulted in pregnancy .
`` Rape is never legitimate . I used the wrong words , '' Akin said on Sean Hannity 's syndicated radio show .
`` When I was running for this race I never told anybody I was perfect . I make mistakes . But when I do make mistakes , Sean , I admit it and I tell people I 'm sorry and I 've done that from the bottom of my heart , '' he told Hannity .
Akin made it clear he would remain in the race and said he believed the people of Missouri are capable of looking beyond the mistake . `` This campaign is more than just one TV interview . ''
Romney 's camp distanced itself from the Missouri Republican , who is in a race viewed as crucial for determining which party will control the Senate next January .
In addition , the controversy drew attention away from the economic themes of Romney 's campaign in the run-up to the Republican National Convention next week in Tampa , Florida . Romney and his running mate , Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin , held a joint town hall-style campaign event Monday in New Hampshire . Ryan also visited Romney headquarters in Boston .
At the White House , President Barack Obama told reporters that Akin 's remarks were `` offensive '' and did n't make sense . Asked if Akin should withdraw , Obama said that was up to Missouri Republicans .
Earlier , Romney told National Review Online the comments by Akin were `` insulting , inexcusable , and , frankly , wrong . ''
`` What he said is entirely without merit and he should correct it , '' Romney said , according to the website .
When news of Akin 's comments broke Sunday , the Romney campaign responded by declaring a definitive stance on one of the most volatile political issues in the country .
A campaign statement on Sunday night said the former Massachusetts governor and Ryan differed with Akin on the matter and that `` a Romney-Ryan administration would not oppose abortion in instances of rape . ''
The issue is particularly sensitive for Ryan , a devout Catholic and staunch anti-abortion politician who has previously expressed opposition to abortion in all cases except when the life of the mother is endangered .
A Romney-Ryan campaign official , speaking on condition of not being identified , confirmed to CNN that Ryan 's personal view opposes abortion in the case of rape . The campaign official said Ryan 's stance differed with Romney 's view , which was described in the statement on Sunday and is the formal position of the GOP presidential ticket .
`` While Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are working overtime to distance themselves from Rep. Todd Akin 's comments on rape , they are contradicting their own records , '' said an Obama campaign statement Monday . `` Mr. Romney supports the Human Life Amendment , which would ban abortion in all instances , even in the case of rape and incest . In fact , that amendment is a central part of the Republican Party 's platform . ''
It also said that Ryan worked with Akin `` to try to pass laws that would ban abortion in all cases , and even narrow the definition of 'rape . ' ``
Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said he hoped Akin would not come to the national convention in Florida .
`` If it was me and I had an opportunity to let someone else run to actually give ourselves a better chance of winning , I would step aside , '' he told CNN 's Erin Burnett .
`` Congressman Akin 's statement is another manifestation of the total disregard and disrespect of women by Republican leaders , '' House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement , adding that it was `` almost impossible to believe that any political leader would suggest that any case of rape is 'legitimate . ' ``
In Massachusetts , Republican Sen. Scott Brown called on Akin to drop out of the race because of the `` outrageous , inappropriate and wrong '' comments .
The nation 's largest tea party political action committee , the Tea Party Express , similarly called on Akin to step down , describing the candidate 's comments as `` unfortunate and inappropriate . ''
However , one of the nation 's most prominent conservative organizations rallied to Akin 's defense . Top officials from the Family Research Council said Akin is the target of a Democratic smear campaign , and they also chided Republicans calling for him to step down .
Connie Mackey , who heads the group 's political action committee , said the organization `` strongly supports '' Akin .
`` Todd Akin is getting a really bad break here , '' Mackey told reporters . `` I do n't know anything about the science or the legal implications of his statement . I do know politics , and I know 'gotcha ' politics when I see it . ''
Akin 's controversial comments give Obama and Democrats an opportunity to further strengthen their advantage with women voters -- a demographic that already favors them , according to the polls .
The controversial remarks about whether abortion should be legal in the case of rape were made in an interivew with Missouri television station KTVI . A clip of the interview was posted online by the liberal super PAC American Bridge . In it , Akin explained his opposition by citing unnamed bodily responses that he said prevented pregnancy .
`` First of all , from what I understand from doctors , that 's really rare , '' Akin said of rape-induced pregnancy .
`` If it 's a legitimate rape , the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down , '' Akin continued . He did not provide an explanation for what constituted `` legitimate rape . ''
He added : `` But let 's assume that maybe that did n't work or something . You know I think there should be some punishment , but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child . ''
Statistics on pregnancies that result from rape are difficult to produce , since rape is a crime that often goes unreported .
The Rape , Abuse & Incest National Network , along with Planned Parenthood , each estimate that 5 % of rapes lead to pregnancy . A 1996 study from the Medical University of South Carolina found the same percentage , adding that 32,101 pregnancies occurred annually from rape .
`` Rape can make you pregnant . Period , '' Aaron Carroll , associate professor of pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine and the director of the university 's Center for Health Policy and Professionalism Research , wrote in an opinion piece for CNN . `` If you put sperm near egg , women can get pregnant . ''
Akin , a six-term U.S. congressman , touted his socially conservative values on the primary campaign trail .
He opposes abortion in all circumstances and has said he also opposes the morning after pill , which he equates to abortion .
McCaskill responded almost immediately to her opponent 's comments , writing Sunday on Twitter : `` As a woman & former prosecutor who handled 100s of rape cases , I 'm stunned by Rep Akin 's comments about victims this AM . ''
She later released a statement condemning her rival as `` ignorant about the emotional and physical trauma brought on by rape . ''
Republicans consider McCaskill , first elected in 2006 , highly vulnerable in her bid for a second term . Ahead of the GOP primary , a Mason-Dixon poll showed the senator falling behind Akin and the two other main GOP primary competitors in hypothetical match ups among registered Missouri voters .

Akin apologizes: ""I never told anybody I was perfect""

Calls mount for the Republican candidate to drop out of Missouri Senate race

Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin canceled a primetime TV appearance at the last minute Monday night, shying away from the spotlight on a day he was under fire for controversial comments he made about rape.

Akin was scheduled to be on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" A studio was booked and a chair was set.

But shortly before he was to appear, Akin canceled. He was editing a new ad, an activity that forced him to bow out, two people with ties to his campaign said.

""Congressman, you have an open invitation to join me in that chair whenever you feel up to it,"" said Morgan.

Pressure from the mainstream Republican Party mounted on the Missouri representative throughout the day to drop his bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in November because of his comments about ""legitimate rape"" and opposing abortion in rape cases.

McCaskill also was booked to be a guest on ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" She canceled earlier in the day.

Akin's remarks shifted the political focus Monday to abortion and women's rights, causing certain GOP nominee Mitt Romney's team to clarify the campaign's abortion stance.

Top congressional Republicans, including House Speaker John Boehner, Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. John Cornyn of Texas advised Akin to spend time considering what is best for his family, party and country -- political code for urging him to withdraw.

""What he said is just flat wrong in addition to being wildly offensive to any victim of sexual abuse,"" McConnell said in a statement. ""Although Representative Akin has apologized, I believe he should take time with his family to consider whether this statement will prevent him from effectively representing our party in this critical election.""

The National Republican Senatorial Committee headed by Cornyn has advised Akin that it will not support his campaign if he stays in the race, a source from the group told CNN.

In an interview on Monday with WMUR television in Manchester, New Hampshire, Romney echoed the sentiment of other GOP leaders, according to a tweet from the station's political director, Josh McElveen:

""@MittRomney on if Akin should end senate bid- 'he should spend 24 hours considering what will best help the country at this critical time.""

Missouri election rules allow a candidate to withdraw with little difficulty through Tuesday, which is 11 weeks prior to the Nov. 6 election.

After Tuesday, the candidate must get a court order and pay for any necessary reprinting of ballots. The state Republican Party would choose another candidate to run against McCaskill, considered one of the most vulnerable senators in the country.

Akin apologized, repeatedly, Monday for what he called a serious error in using the wrong words when he stated in an earlier interview that ""legitimate rape"" rarely resulted in pregnancy.

""Rape is never legitimate. I used the wrong words,"" Akin said on Sean Hannity's syndicated radio show.

""When I was running for this race I never told anybody I was perfect. I make mistakes. But when I do make mistakes, Sean, I admit it and I tell people I'm sorry and I've done that from the bottom of my heart,"" he told Hannity.

Akin made it clear he would remain in the race and said he believed the people of Missouri are capable of looking beyond the mistake. ""This campaign is more than just one TV interview.""

Romney's camp distanced itself from the Missouri Republican, who is in a race viewed as crucial for determining which party will control the Senate next January.

In addition, the controversy drew attention away from the economic themes of Romney's campaign in the run-up to the Republican National Convention next week in Tampa, Florida. Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, held a joint town hall-style campaign event Monday in New Hampshire. Ryan also visited Romney headquarters in Boston.

Democrats challenged the Romney-Ryan team on the issue.

In fact, that amendment is a central part of the Republican Party's platform.""

It also said that Ryan worked with Akin ""to try to pass laws that would ban abortion in all cases, and even narrow the definition of 'rape.' ""

Other Democrats and some Republicans piled on.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said he hoped Akin would not come to the national convention in Florida.

""If it was me and I had an opportunity to let someone else run to actually give ourselves a better chance of winning, I would step aside,"" he told CNN's Erin Burnett.

And later : `` Our goal , like I said , is to give patients the option without impacting our bottom line . The messaging is this should not be seen as a new revenue stream , because that 's not what it is . ''
On and on it goes , in each of these supposedly `` bombshell '' videos , forming what could be called an inkblot conversation , similar to the Rorschach tests in which the viewer looks at an inkblot and describes what picture they see .
To those already convinced that abortions should be safe , legal and rare , it looks like Planned Parenthood is responsibly doing exactly what a medical provider should . People who already want to ban all abortions everywhere will see the conversations as some nefarious trade in baby parts .

""Really their bottom line is, they want to break even. Every penny they save is just pennies they give to another patient. To provide a service the patient wouldn't get,"" says Dr. Deborah Nucatola, senior director of medical services for Planned Parenthood Federation.

Later in the same conversation she says: ""we're not looking to make money from this. Our goal is to keep access available. And if we do something that makes a target, that just removes access for everybody.""

And later: ""Our goal, like I said, is to give patients the option without impacting our bottom line. The messaging is this should not be seen as a new revenue stream, because that's not what it is.""

On and on it goes, in each of these supposedly ""bombshell"" videos, forming what could be called an inkblot conversation, similar to the Rorschach tests in which the viewer looks at an inkblot and describes what picture they see.

To those already convinced that abortions should be safe, legal and rare, it looks like Planned Parenthood is responsibly doing exactly what a medical provider should. People who already want to ban all abortions everywhere will see the conversations as some nefarious trade in baby parts.

In other words, the videos are less an investigative expose than a mirror in which a divided nation can look at its view on abortion.",www.cnn.com,left,Pt7OaZx0Srrhp0KX

Ever more worried by a challenge from Sen. Bernard Sanders , Mrs. Clinton has placed women ’ s rights at the forefront of her candidacy , rallying with a heightened sense of absolutism : fighting against all restrictions on abortions , including during the ninth month of pregnancy .
She regularly rails against Republican efforts to strip taxpayer funding from Planned Parenthood and was rewarded this month when the group ’ s political arm endorsed her presidential bid — marking the first time the abortion provider has tipped its hand in the presidential primary in its 100-year history .
Just days after the endorsement , Mrs. Clinton called for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment , which prohibits direct federal taxpayer funding for abortions .
Mr. Sanders , speaking to MSNBC ’ s Rachel Maddow , waved off the endorsement as another sign of “ the political establishment ” rallying to Mrs. Clinton . That drew outraged responses from Mrs. Clinton ’ s defenders , including her husband , former President Bill Clinton , who said it was demeaning to Planned Parenthood .
“ Bernie Sanders is exactly right , ” said Chad Pecknold , a theologian at Catholic University of America . “ Hillary Clinton has always been a part of the establishment and one of the most powerful players in politics — of which she ’ s been 100 percent bought and paid for — is Planned Parenthood . She can ’ t do anything but support the vision of the group . ”
Planned Parenthood fights all restrictions on abortions and has been particularly vocal in opposing efforts to ban late-term abortions . Yet those bans are popular with the public , according to a Marist poll released last week . More than 60 percent of respondents said they supported outlawing abortion after 20 weeks , or about five months , into a pregnancy .
In 2000 , when she first ran for the U.S. Senate , Mrs. Clinton seemed to be part of that majority , telling The Associated Press that she “ would support legislation that would ban late-term abortions , including so-called partial-birth abortion , as long as it protects the life and health of the woman and it does not undermine Roe v. Wade . ”
By this year ’ s presidential campaign , though , her stance had hardened .
“ I think that the kind of late-term abortions that take place are because of medical necessity , and therefore I would hate to see the government interfering with that decision , ” she said in a September interview with John Dickerson of CBS . “ This gets back to whether you respect a woman ’ s right to choose or not , and I think that ’ s what this whole argument is about . ”
Several states have enacted 20-week bans in recent years , and the U.S. House passed a similar measure in May , though Senate Democrats successfully filibustered to stop the legislation from reaching President Obama ’ s desk .
Mrs. Clinton tweeted in May regarding the measure , “ When it comes to women ’ s health , there are two kinds of experts : women and doctors . True 40+ years ago , true today . ”
At a campaign event in August , she compared Republican presidential candidates ’ views on women ’ s rights , including the approval of bans on late-term abortions , to that of terrorists .
“ Now , extreme views about women , we expect that from some of the terrorist groups , we expect that from people who don ’ t want to live in the modern world , but it ’ s a little hard to take from Republicans who want to be president of the United States , ” Mrs. Clinton said .
She made the comments after the release of undercover videos in July , shot by a pro-life advocacy group , showing Planned Parenthood executives drinking wine while negotiating prices of aborted baby parts for research purposes . Although the videos were edited , several Republican lawmakers called for the subsequent defunding of Planned Parenthood and a congressional investigation into the organization .
After a protracted fight , the House this month passed a measure that would have gutted federal funding for Planned Parenthood and repealed parts of the Affordable Care Act , which the president vetoed .
When the videos were first released , however , Mrs. Clinton called them “ disturbing. ” But within the span of 48 hours , she started vigorously defending the nation ’ s largest abortion provider .
“ I have seen pictures from them and obviously find them disturbing , ” Mrs. Clinton told the New Hampshire Union Leader the Tuesday after the videos were made public .
Two days later , she took to her Twitter account to defend the organization .
“ Proud to stand [ with ] Planned Parenthood and for access to quality , affordable healthcare for women , men & young people , ” she said .
Those who have studied the long-standing relationship between Mrs. Clinton and Planned Parenthood say the about-face was expected .
“ Both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are as far left on abortion as you can possibly get — they ’ re both right in line with Planned Parenthood ’ s reasoning that abortion should be legal for any reason , at any time and should all be paid for by the taxpayer , ” said Penny Young Nance , president of Concerned Women for America . “ The only difference between Bernie and Hillary is Hillary is part of the political establishment and Planned Parenthood is the abortion political machine . I think it ’ s humorous they would suggest otherwise . ”
Even though Planned Parenthood only recently endorsed Mrs. Clinton for president , the partnership has been building for some time .
As Mrs. Clinton launched her bid for the White House last spring , Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards tweeted : “ there has never been a presidential candidate with as strong a commitment to women ’ s health & rights , ” and called the moment “ # Historic . ”
Mrs. Richards ’ daughter , Lily Adams , is Mrs. Clinton ’ s Iowa press secretary .
Planned Parenthood ’ s political arm has said it will spend at least $ 20 million this election cycle to back its favored candidates .
Planned Parenthood also has taken an active role within the Clinton Foundation as a member of the Clinton Global Initiative . It has teamed with the foundation to train “ youth peer providers ” in Latin American , Africa and the U.S. in ways to promote birth control , according to the Clinton Global Initiative ’ s website .
Planned Parenthood is also sponsoring two global youth fellowship programs and will participate with the Clinton Global Initiative to create a national youth organizing strategy to advocate for more investment and access to reproductive health care .
Mr. Sanders ’ campaign stood by his contention that Planned Parenthood is part of the Clinton political establishment .

Trump headlined the Faith and Freedom Coalition ’ s “ Road to Majority ” summit while Clinton addressed a Planned Parenthood national conference .
Trump , looking to solidify his standing with evangelical Christians , offered assurances Friday that he would “ restore respect for people of faith ” -- and stressed the “ sanctity and dignity of life . ”
If there was any doubt he wanted to throw Clinton 's Planned Parenthood speech into sharp relief , he took on his presumptive rival later in his remarks . Trump warned Clinton would `` appoint radical judges , '' eliminate the Second Amendment , `` restrict religious freedom with government mandates , '' and `` push for federal funding of abortion on demand up until the moment of birth .

Trump, looking to solidify his standing with evangelical Christians, offered assurances Friday that he would “restore respect for people of faith” -- and stressed the “sanctity and dignity of life.”

A leading anti-repeal group , Save the 8th , has conceded defeat , and Irish politicians are already discussing next steps for moving to a legal abortion regime .
The vote , held on Friday , is a historic victory for Irish feminists , who had been campaigning for the amendment ’ s repeal ever since it was passed in 1983 . Pro-repeal sentiment was especially strong among young and urban voters , suggesting that a new left-leaning and secular majority had supplanted the more conservative Catholic older generation .

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar , who campaigned for repeal , has already released a draft bill that would remove all restrictions on abortions for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and permit it afterward only under specific circumstances ( if the woman ’ s health were in danger , for example ) .

In 1973 , Ireland ’ s Supreme Court ruled that the country ’ s ban on contraception was unconstitutional and that it violated citizens ’ right to privacy . In the US , a similar court ruling on contraception ( Griswold v. Connecticut ) laid the groundwork for Roe v. Wade , which coincidentally also came down in 1973 .

Ireland’s journey on abortion, explained

Abortion has been illegal in Ireland since at least 1861, when a ban was imposed by British authorities, and remained illegal after Ireland became independent in the early 20th century. But Ireland only took the extreme step of putting an abortion ban in the constitution in 1983, a reaction to the gains of the feminist movement in both Ireland and the broader Anglophone world.

In 1973, Ireland’s Supreme Court ruled that the country’s ban on contraception was unconstitutional and that it violated citizens’ right to privacy. In the US, a similar court ruling on contraception (Griswold v. Connecticut) laid the groundwork for Roe v. Wade, which coincidentally also came down in 1973. Irish Catholic conservatives, looking at both the American case and the wider successes of the Irish feminist movement on issues like equality in the workplace, got spooked.

“There was a fear that a court case taken to the Irish courts, or then the European courts, would liberalize abortion in the same way access to contraceptives had been [liberalized],” Mary McAuliffe, a professor of gender studies at University College Dublin, told me. “And so a campaign began, called the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign, after the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1979 — when the Catholic right felt emboldened.”

In 1983, this idea was put to a national referendum, and what’s now the Eighth Amendment passed by a resounding 67 percent margin. The text of the amendment was very short and very clear: Fetuses have a right to life “equal” to that of the woman’s:

The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.

The result was that Ireland was locked into a draconian abortion prohibition, one that could not constitutionally allow exceptions for rape or even the health of the woman. The only conceivable exception under the text of the Eighth was if the pregnant woman’s very life were at clear and imminent risk.

This strict regulation had a number of unintended consequences. For one, Irish women began flying to Britain (and, in smaller numbers, other European Union countries) to get abortions. Between 1980 and 2016, roughly 170,000 Irish women traveled abroad to get an abortion (the total population of Ireland today is a little under 5 million).

At the same time, Irish society changed dramatically. The influence of the Catholic Church waned significantly, while women made major gains (Ireland has one of the highest rates of women with college degrees in Europe). In this new Ireland, the Eighth Amendment was on less sure footing.

“Ireland really is, for the most part, a secular state,” McAuliffe says. “There is a new generation of women — and men — who are very much influenced by ideas of equality, of feminism.”

The catalyst for a renewed abortion fight was, by all accounts, the tragic 2012 death of a woman named Savita Halappanavar.

Halappanavar, a patient in Galway Hospital, was 17 weeks pregnant when she began to experience serious back pains. Doctors determined that miscarriage was unavoidable, and that the process of miscarriage could lead to a dangerous infection. When Halappanavar and her husband asked for doctors to medically induce the miscarriage, to get the fetus out without risking infection, they were told that Ireland’s abortion law prohibited such a procedure — that Halappanavar’s life wasn’t so obviously at risk as to allow them to terminate the pregnancy.

There was no abortion, and Halappanavar died from sepsis.

An official investigation into her death, released in 2013, concluded that the strict nature of Ireland’s abortion law had, in fact, played some role in tying the doctors’ hands. It suggested that Ireland’s parliament at least consider changing the legal code and even enact “constitutional change” to prevent this from happening.

“There is immediate and urgent requirement for a clear statement of the legal context in which clinical professional judgement can be exercised in the best medical welfare interests of patients,” the report concluded. “The guidance so urged may require legal change.”

The Halappanavar case made international headlines, and galvanized the pro–abortion rights segment of the Irish public. In January 2018, Prime Minister Varadkar vowed to hold a referendum in May on repealing the Eighth Amendment — and followed through on that promise.

Saturday’s results were the culmination of this long process of social change — of the new Ireland triumphing over the old.

███ News Reporter Abigail Robertson speaks with Concerned Women of America 's Penny Nance , live on Facebook . Watch above .
The court ruled 5-3 against the Texas pro-life law that required physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals . The law also required clinics to meet hospital-like safety standards for outpatient surgery .
But the justices ruled the law was an undue burden on women seeking abortions .
Rep. Diane Black , R-Tenn. , a registered nurse and member of the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives , called the court 's decision a `` sad day for women and their unborn babies . ''
`` With the drop of a gavel , five Supreme Court justices have endangered the safety of women who may seek an abortion , and have ensured that more innocent , unborn lives will be lost in the process , '' she said .
`` As a registered nurse , I know that there is ultimately no such thing as a safe abortion , but these modest standards work to reduce the risks of this already emotionally damaging procedure , '' Black said .
Black says the law may have put more of a burden on the abortion industry , but it did not burden women . She says it actually protected women 's lives .
`` The deep pockets of the big abortion industry may feel 'burdened ' as a result of this compassionate law , but women are not – they are indeed safer as a result , '' she said .
John Seago , legislative director for Texas Right to Life , says the law gives abortion clinics a free pass to disregard women 's safety .
`` This dangerous SCOTUS ruling allows the abortion industry to challenge any safety laws by threatening to close rather than follow law , '' Seago said . `` Abortionists should n't be given a free pass to elude medical requirements that everyone else is required to follow . ''
The ruling brings up even more issues related to the upcoming presidential elections in November . Many believe if the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia had still been on the bench , the law would have never been struck down .
`` Today 's devastating news underscores the incredibly high stakes the Supreme Court vacancy holds for the unborn child , '' Rep. Chris Smith , R-N.J. , co-chairman of the Bipartisan Congressional Pro-Life Caucus , said in a statement .

''","The Supreme Court handed down a devastating blow to pro-life activists Monday by blocking a Texas law they believe could have saved the lives of countless unborn children and their mothers.

CBN News Reporter Abigail Robertson speaks with Concerned Women of America's Penny Nance, live on Facebook. Watch above.

The court ruled 5-3 against the Texas pro-life law that required physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. The law also required clinics to meet hospital-like safety standards for outpatient surgery.

But the justices ruled the law was an undue burden on women seeking abortions.

Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., a registered nurse and member of the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, called the court's decision a ""sad day for women and their unborn babies.""

""With the drop of a gavel, five Supreme Court justices have endangered the safety of women who may seek an abortion, and have ensured that more innocent, unborn lives will be lost in the process,"" she said.

""As a registered nurse, I know that there is ultimately no such thing as a safe abortion, but these modest standards work to reduce the risks of this already emotionally damaging procedure,"" Black said.

Black says the law may have put more of a burden on the abortion industry, but it did not burden women. She says it actually protected women's lives.

""The deep pockets of the big abortion industry may feel 'burdened' as a result of this compassionate law, but women are not – they are indeed safer as a result,"" she said.

John Seago, legislative director for Texas Right to Life, says the law gives abortion clinics a free pass to disregard women's safety.

""This dangerous SCOTUS ruling allows the abortion industry to challenge any safety laws by threatening to close rather than follow law,"" Seago said. ""Abortionists shouldn't be given a free pass to elude medical requirements that everyone else is required to follow.""

The ruling brings up even more issues related to the upcoming presidential elections in November. Many believe if the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia had still been on the bench, the law would have never been struck down.

""Today's devastating news underscores the incredibly high stakes the Supreme Court vacancy holds for the unborn child,"" Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., co-chairman of the Bipartisan Congressional Pro-Life Caucus, said in a statement.

""Forty-three years ago the Supreme Court stripped away protection for unborn children and their mothers. Restoring that protection requires a Court that acknowledges the right of states to protect women's health and the unborn,"" Smith said.

Despite the disappointing ruling, pro-life activists say the fight is not over.

CBN News Reporter Abigail Robertson spoke with the CEO of Concerned Women for American Penny Nance outside the Supreme Court moments after the decision was announced.

Nance said although this is a ""sad day,"" pro-life activists refuse to give up the fight.

""This is a very sad day. But it should be a day in which the pro-life community becomes even more resolute."" Nance said. ""We should be calling on each other to come to the polls in November to vote. We have to elect a pro-life president.""

The drama centered largely around Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis , who staged an hours-long , old-fashioned filibuster on the Senate floor against a bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy .
Republicans initially succeeded in cutting her filibuster off , in part by objecting when another lawmaker helped her with a back brace . But protesters picked up where she left off , jeering at lawmakers as they rushed to meet a midnight deadline for the bill .
Republicans initially insisted they made it , but Lt. Gov . David Dewhurst later acknowledged they did not .
Dewhurst denounced the more than 400 protesters who staged what they called `` a people 's filibuster '' from 11:45 p.m. to well past midnight . He denied mishandling the debate .
`` I did n't lose control ( of the chamber ) . We had an unruly mob , '' Dewhurst said . He then hinted that Gov . Rick Perry may immediately call another special session , adding : `` It 's over . It 's been fun . But see you soon . ''
The chaos capped one of the most unusual stand-offs in any state legislative session this year .
Davis spent most of the day staging her filibuster , attracting wide support , including a mention from President Obama 's campaign Twitter account . Her Twitter following went from 1,200 in the morning to more than 20,000 by Tuesday night .
`` My back hurts . I do n't have a lot of words left , '' Davis said when it was over and she was showered with cheers by activist who stayed at the Capitol to see her . `` It shows the determination and spirit of Texas women . ''
Rules stipulated she remain standing , not lean on her desk or take any breaks -- even for meals or to use the bathroom . But she also was required to stay on topic , and Republicans pointed out a mistake and later protested again when another lawmaker helped her with a back brace .
Republican Sen. Donna Campbell called the third point of order because of her remarks about a previous law concerning sonograms . Under the rules , lawmakers can vote to end a filibuster after three sustained points of order .
After much back and forth , the GOP voted to end the filibuster minutes before midnight , sparking the raucous response from protesters in the final 15 minutes before the deadline .
Initially , Republicans insisted they had started voting before the midnight deadline and passed the bill that Democrats spent much of Tuesday filibustering . But after official computer records and printouts of the voting record showed the vote took place on Wednesday , and then were changed to read Tuesday , senators convened for a private meeting .
An hour later , Dewhurst was still insisting the 19-10 vote was in time , but said , `` with all the ruckus and noise going on , I could n't sign the bill . ''
The measures would have closed almost every abortion clinic in Texas , a state 773 miles wide and 790 miles long with 26 million people . A woman living along the Mexico border or in West Texas would have to drive hundreds of miles to obtain an abortion if the law passes .
In her opening remarks , Davis said she was `` rising on the floor today to humbly give voice to thousands of Texans '' and called Republican efforts to pass the bill a `` raw abuse of power . ''
`` Partisanship and ambition are not unusual in a state capitol but here in Texas right now it has risen to a level of profound irresponsibility , '' Davis was quoted as saying by MyFoxAustin.com .
Democrats chose Davis to lead the effort because of her background as a woman who had her first child as a teenager and went on to graduate from Harvard Law School .
In the hallway outside the Senate chamber , hundreds of women stood in line , waiting for people in the gallery to give up their seats . Women 's rights supporters wore orange T-shirts to show their support for Davis , and Dewhurst reminded those in the gallery that interrupting the proceedings could results in 48 hours in jail .
Davis tried to stay comfortable and sharp by shifting her weight from hip to hip and slowly walking around her desk while reading notes from a large binder on her desk .
MyFoxAustin.com reported that a protester in the Senate gallery , identified as Mike Bradford , was removed by security after causing a disturbance .
He explained his opposition to abortion in an interview with reporters outside the gallery .
`` I see all the supporters mostly I see , firstly white women , who are supporting abortion but yet abortions are effecting a certain demographic that 's not included in the people supporting it , '' Bradford told the station .
Twice in the first six hours , anti-abortion lawmakers questioned Davis about the bill , presenting their arguments that it would protect women or that abortions were wrong . Davis answered their questions but did not give up control of the floor .
`` This is really about women 's health , '' said Sen. Bob Deuell , who introduced a requirement that all abortions take place in surgical centers . `` Sometimes bad things can happen . ''
Davis questioned then why vasectomies and colonoscopies are n't also required to take place in such clinics . `` Because I 've been unable to have a simple question answered to help me understand how this would lead to better care for women , I must question the underlying motive for doing so . ''
Davis read testimony from women and doctors who would be impacted by the changes , but who were denied the opportunity to speak in a Republican-controlled committee . During one heart-wrenching story describing a woman 's difficult pregnancy , Davis choked up several times and wiped tears .
The bill would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy and force many clinics that perform the procedure to upgrade their facilities and be classified as ambulatory surgical centers . Also , doctors would be required to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles -- a tall order in rural communities .","Chaos reigned in the final minutes of the Texas Senate late Tuesday night as opponents of a strict abortion bill succeeded in killing the measure, using a sprawling Democrat-led filibuster, egged on by noisy ""unruly mob"" protests, to blunt last-ditch efforts by Republicans to save the legislation.

abortion,Salon,0,http://www.salon.com/2016/04/07/camille_paglia_feminists_have_abortion_wrong_trump_and_hillary_miscues_highlight_a_frozen_national_debate/,"Camille Paglia: Feminists have abortion wrong, Trump and Hillary miscues highlight a frozen national debate",2016-04-07,Camille Paglia,"Like stumbling twin mastodons , both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton fell into the abortion tar pit this past week . Trump blundered his way through a manic inquisition about abortion by MSNBC ’ s resident woodpecker , Chris Matthews , while Hillary committed an unforced error on NBC ’ s `` Meet the Press , '' where she referred to the fetus as an “ unborn person , ” scandalizing the vast pro-choice lobby , who treat all attempts to “ humanize ” the fetus as a diabolical threat to reproductive rights .
While the Hillary flap was merely a blip , given the consistency of her pro-choice views over time , Trump ’ s clumsy performance was a fiasco , exposing in his fiat that women should face “ some sort of punishment ” for illegal abortions how little he had thought about one of the major issues in American public life over the past 40 years . Following his supercilious mishandling of the controversy over his campaign manager ’ s crude yanking of a woman reporter ’ s arm , Trump ’ s MSNBC flame-out was a big fat gift to Democratic strategists , who love to tub-thump about the Republican “ war on women ” —a tired cliché that is as substance-less as a druggy mirage but that the inept GOP has never been able to counter .
Then this week Hillary raised eyebrows when she was asked by conservative co-host Candace Bure on ABC ’ s `` The View '' if she believes someone can be both a feminist and against abortion . “ Absolutely , ” Hillary replied , possibly not realizing the implications of what she was saying : “ Of course you can be a feminist and be pro-life. ” Was this an election-year pivot toward conservative women , like Hillary ’ s fantastical praise of Nancy Reagan as an AIDS activist ? If it was rooted in genuine conviction , why have we not heard a word about it before ? Hillary is usually wedded cheek-by-jowl with the old-guard feminist establishment .
The real issue is that U.S. politics have been entangled and strangled for far too long by the rote histrionics of the abortion wars , which have raged since Roe v. Wade , the 1973 Supreme Court decision that defined abortion as a woman ’ s constitutional right under the 14th Amendment . While I am firmly pro-choice and support unrestricted access to abortion , I have been disturbed and repelled for decades by the way reproductive rights have become an ideological tool ruthlessly exploited by my own party , the Democrats , to inflame passions , raise money , and drive voting .
This mercenary process began with the Senate confirmation hearings for three Supreme Court candidates nominated by Republican presidents : Robert Bork in 1987 , David Souter in 1990 , and Clarence Thomas in 1991 . ( Bork was rejected , while Souter and Thomas were approved . ) Those hearings became freak shows of feminist fanaticism , culminating in the elevation to martyr status of Anita Hill , whose charges of sexual harassment against Thomas still seem to me flimsy and overblown ( and effectively neutralized by Hill ’ s following Thomas to another job ) . Abortion was the not-so-hidden motivation of the Democratic operatives who pushed a reluctant Hill forward and fanned the flames in the then monochromatically liberal mainstream media . It was that flagrant abuse of the Senate confirmation process that sparked the meteoric rise of conservative talk radio , led by Rush Limbaugh , who provided an alternative voice in what was then ( pre-Web ) a homogenized media universe .
Abortion has been central to the agenda of second-wave feminism since the 1972 issue of Ms. Magazine , which contained a splashy declaration , “ We have had abortions , ” signed by 53 prominent American women . A recurrent rubric of contemporary feminism is Gloria Steinem ’ s snide jibe ( which she claims to have heard from an old Irish woman taxi driver in Boston ) , “ If men could get pregnant , abortion would be a sacrament. ” But Steinem herself can be credited or blamed for having turned abortion into a sacrament , promoted with the same religiosity that she and her colleagues condemn in their devoutly Christian opponents .
First-wave feminism , born in 1848 at the Seneca Falls Convention in upstate New York , was focused on property rights and on winning the vote , achieved by ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920 . Abortion entered the feminist canon with Margaret Sanger ’ s bold campaign for birth control , a violation of the repressive Comstock Act for which she was arrested in 1914 . Her organization , the American Birth Control League , founded in 1921 , later became Planned Parenthood , which remains a lightning-rod for controversy because of its lavish federal funding . Sanger remains a heroine to many feminists , including me , despite her troubling association with eugenics , a program ( also adopted by the Nazis ) of now discredited techniques like sterilization to purify and strengthen the human gene pool . It was partly because of Sanger ’ s pioneering precedent that I joined Planned Parenthood and contributed to it for many years—until I realized , to my disillusion , how it had become a covert arm of the Democratic party .
My position on abortion is contained in my manifesto , “ No Law in the Arena , ” from my second essay collection , `` Vamps & Tramps '' ( 1994 ) : “ Women ’ s modern liberation is inextricably linked to their ability to control reproduction , which has enslaved them from the origin of the species. ” However , I argue that our real oppressor is not men or society but nature—the biological imperative that second-wave feminism and campus gender studies still refuse to acknowledge . Sex is nature ’ s way—coercive , prankish , and pleasurable -- of ensuring survival of the species . But in eras of overpopulation , those pleasures spill into a multitude of directions to slow or halt procreation—which is why I maintain that homosexuality is not a violation of natural law but its fulfillment , when history wills it .
Despite my pro-abortion stance ( I call the term pro-choice “ a cowardly euphemism ” ) , I profoundly respect the pro-life viewpoint , which I think has the moral high ground . I wrote in “ No Law in the Arena ” : “ We career women are arguing from expedience : it is personally and professionally inconvenient or onerous to bear an unwanted child . The pro-life movement , in contrast , is arguing that every conception is sacred and that society has a responsibility to protect the defenseless. ” The silence from second-wave feminists about the ethical ambiguities in their pro-choice belief system has been deafening . The one exception is Naomi Wolf , with whom I have disagreed about many issues . But Wolf showed admirable courage in questioning abortion in her 1995 essay , “ Our Bodies , Our Souls , ” which was reprinted at the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade by the New Statesman in London three years ago .
That a pro-life wing of feminism is possible is proved by this thoughtful letter recently sent to me at ███ by Katherine Carlson in Calgary , Canada :
Many women like myself ( a gay liberal ) are deeply upset over the abortion issue . Ultrasound technology has allowed us to see into the womb like never before , and the obvious face of humanity is clear . I totally respected your take on abortion precisely because you never tried to dehumanize the preborn vulnerable . You were clearly pro-choice but made the harsh reality of the decision very clear .
I was thrilled when they took down Gloria Steinem ’ s interview on Lands ’ End . To me , she is someone who tried to normalize abortion , and I despise her for it . The Democrats have become callous and extreme on the issue , and I feel completely shut out . And obviously , I am no right-winger . I have listened to the testimony of phenomenal women who have survived abortion attempts and were left to die ( were saved only because some took their Hippocratic oath seriously ) .
I am tired of being bullied by women who equate women ’ s equality with abortion on demand . I know some women who use abortion as a method of sex selection and it rattles me to my core .
If you ever decide to write a piece on silenced women like myself , I would be entirely grateful .
I totally agree with Carlson that pro-choice Democrats have become “ callous and extreme ” about abortion . There is a moral hollowness at the core of Western careerist feminism , a bourgeois secular code that sees children as an obstruction to self-realization or as a management problem to be farmed out to working-class nannies .
Liberals routinely delude themselves with shrill propaganda about the motivation of “ anti-woman ” pro-life supporters . Hillary deals in those smears as her stock in trade : for example , while campaigning last week , she said in the context of Trump ’ s comments on abortion , “ Women ’ s health is under assault in America ” —as if difficulty in obtaining an abortion is more of an assault than the grisly intervention required for surgical termination of a pregnancy . Who is the real victim here ?

Trump blundered his way through a manic inquisition about abortion by MSNBC’s resident woodpecker, Chris Matthews, while Hillary committed an unforced error on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" where she referred to the fetus as an “unborn person,” scandalizing the vast pro-choice lobby, who treat all attempts to “humanize” the fetus as a diabolical threat to reproductive rights.

While the Hillary flap was merely a blip, given the consistency of her pro-choice views over time, Trump’s clumsy performance was a fiasco, exposing in his fiat that women should face “some sort of punishment” for illegal abortions how little he had thought about one of the major issues in American public life over the past 40 years. Following his supercilious mishandling of the controversy over his campaign manager’s crude yanking of a woman reporter’s arm, Trump’s MSNBC flame-out was a big fat gift to Democratic strategists, who love to tub-thump about the Republican “war on women”—a tired cliché that is as substance-less as a druggy mirage but that the inept GOP has never been able to counter.

Then this week Hillary raised eyebrows when she was asked by conservative co-host Candace Bure on ABC’s ""The View"" if she believes someone can be both a feminist and against abortion. “Absolutely,” Hillary replied, possibly not realizing the implications of what she was saying: “Of course you can be a feminist and be pro-life.” Was this an election-year pivot toward conservative women, like Hillary’s fantastical praise of Nancy Reagan as an AIDS activist? If it was rooted in genuine conviction, why have we not heard a word about it before? Hillary is usually wedded cheek-by-jowl with the old-guard feminist establishment.

The real issue is that U.S. politics have been entangled and strangled for far too long by the rote histrionics of the abortion wars, which have raged since Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that defined abortion as a woman’s constitutional right under the 14th Amendment. While I am firmly pro-choice and support unrestricted access to abortion, I have been disturbed and repelled for decades by the way reproductive rights have become an ideological tool ruthlessly exploited by my own party, the Democrats, to inflame passions, raise money, and drive voting.

This mercenary process began with the Senate confirmation hearings for three Supreme Court candidates nominated by Republican presidents: Robert Bork in 1987, David Souter in 1990, and Clarence Thomas in 1991. (Bork was rejected, while Souter and Thomas were approved.) Those hearings became freak shows of feminist fanaticism, culminating in the elevation to martyr status of Anita Hill, whose charges of sexual harassment against Thomas still seem to me flimsy and overblown (and effectively neutralized by Hill’s following Thomas to another job). Abortion was the not-so-hidden motivation of the Democratic operatives who pushed a reluctant Hill forward and fanned the flames in the then monochromatically liberal mainstream media. It was that flagrant abuse of the Senate confirmation process that sparked the meteoric rise of conservative talk radio, led by Rush Limbaugh, who provided an alternative voice in what was then (pre-Web) a homogenized media universe.

Abortion has been central to the agenda of second-wave feminism since the 1972 issue of Ms. Magazine, which contained a splashy declaration, “We have had abortions,” signed by 53 prominent American women. A recurrent rubric of contemporary feminism is Gloria Steinem’s snide jibe (which she claims to have heard from an old Irish woman taxi driver in Boston), “If men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament.” But Steinem herself can be credited or blamed for having turned abortion into a sacrament, promoted with the same religiosity that she and her colleagues condemn in their devoutly Christian opponents.

First-wave feminism, born in 1848 at the Seneca Falls Convention in upstate New York, was focused on property rights and on winning the vote, achieved by ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920. Abortion entered the feminist canon with Margaret Sanger’s bold campaign for birth control, a violation of the repressive Comstock Act for which she was arrested in 1914. Her organization, the American Birth Control League, founded in 1921, later became Planned Parenthood, which remains a lightning-rod for controversy because of its lavish federal funding. Sanger remains a heroine to many feminists, including me, despite her troubling association with eugenics, a program (also adopted by the Nazis) of now discredited techniques like sterilization to purify and strengthen the human gene pool. It was partly because of Sanger’s pioneering precedent that I joined Planned Parenthood and contributed to it for many years—until I realized, to my disillusion, how it had become a covert arm of the Democratic party.

My position on abortion is contained in my manifesto, “No Law in the Arena,” from my second essay collection, ""Vamps & Tramps"" (1994): “Women’s modern liberation is inextricably linked to their ability to control reproduction, which has enslaved them from the origin of the species.” However, I argue that our real oppressor is not men or society but nature—the biological imperative that second-wave feminism and campus gender studies still refuse to acknowledge. Sex is nature’s way—coercive, prankish, and pleasurable--of ensuring survival of the species. But in eras of overpopulation, those pleasures spill into a multitude of directions to slow or halt procreation—which is why I maintain that homosexuality is not a violation of natural law but its fulfillment, when history wills it.

Despite my pro-abortion stance (I call the term pro-choice “a cowardly euphemism”), I profoundly respect the pro-life viewpoint, which I think has the moral high ground. I wrote in “No Law in the Arena”: “We career women are arguing from expedience: it is personally and professionally inconvenient or onerous to bear an unwanted child. The pro-life movement, in contrast, is arguing that every conception is sacred and that society has a responsibility to protect the defenseless.” The silence from second-wave feminists about the ethical ambiguities in their pro-choice belief system has been deafening. The one exception is Naomi Wolf, with whom I have disagreed about many issues. But Wolf showed admirable courage in questioning abortion in her 1995 essay, “Our Bodies, Our Souls,” which was reprinted at the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade by the New Statesman in London three years ago.

That a pro-life wing of feminism is possible is proved by this thoughtful letter recently sent to me at Salon by Katherine Carlson in Calgary, Canada:

Many women like myself (a gay liberal) are deeply upset over the abortion issue. Ultrasound technology has allowed us to see into the womb like never before, and the obvious face of humanity is clear. I totally respected your take on abortion precisely because you never tried to dehumanize the preborn vulnerable. You were clearly pro-choice but made the harsh reality of the decision very clear.

I was thrilled when they took down Gloria Steinem’s interview on Lands’ End. To me, she is someone who tried to normalize abortion, and I despise her for it. The Democrats have become callous and extreme on the issue, and I feel completely shut out. And obviously, I am no right-winger. I have listened to the testimony of phenomenal women who have survived abortion attempts and were left to die (were saved only because some took their Hippocratic oath seriously).

I am tired of being bullied by women who equate women’s equality with abortion on demand. I know some women who use abortion as a method of sex selection and it rattles me to my core.

If you ever decide to write a piece on silenced women like myself, I would be entirely grateful.

I totally agree with Carlson that pro-choice Democrats have become “callous and extreme” about abortion. There is a moral hollowness at the core of Western careerist feminism, a bourgeois secular code that sees children as an obstruction to self-realization or as a management problem to be farmed out to working-class nannies.

Liberals routinely delude themselves with shrill propaganda about the motivation of “anti-woman” pro-life supporters. Hillary deals in those smears as her stock in trade: for example, while campaigning last week, she said in the context of Trump’s comments on abortion, “Women’s health is under assault in America”—as if difficulty in obtaining an abortion is more of an assault than the grisly intervention required for surgical termination of a pregnancy. Who is the real victim here?

This is what Title X, and Planned Parenthood, fight for: a universe in which women are the primary decision-makers about their own lives and their own bodies.”

Others note that “[Warren] has provided more detail on Medicare financing than Sanders has. She has also provided more overall policy detail, including on the taxes she would raise, than Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg. And her Medicare plan comes much, much closer to paying for itself than various Republican tax cuts. I wish the conservatives complaining about her plan applied the same rigor to their own ideas… The biggest weakness of Warren’s approach is that it tries to bulldoze through the sizable public anxiety about radical changes to the health care system. Warren would not let people opt into Medicare, a wildly popular idea. She would force them to join… she needs to come up with a reassuring transition plan soon.”

“Trump’s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial. But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence: it’s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed — such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed. Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time. They will also say that there’s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here. But… ‘even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly, the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis. Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange.’… ‍ “In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid, the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation. There is enough here to support impeachment. Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter.”

The fight over abortion in Texas is being played out in federal court, where abortion rights activists are challenging a new state law.

The measure bans abortions at 20 weeks, adds building requirements for clinics and places more rules on doctors who perform abortions. Some clinics have shut down, saying they can't comply with the law set to go into effect Oct. 29.

Abortion rights activists call the new law a dramatic change that will affect all clinics across the state, including a huge Planned Parenthood facility in Fort Worth that opened in June.

It's a $6.5 million center with three surgical suites and 19,000 square feet of space, built specifically to meet the building standards that activists saw coming.

""You know, we did not think the laws would come as quickly as they did,"" says Ken Lambrecht, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas.

He says three nurses are required to be in the clinic when abortions are performed. The law also mandates the size of operating rooms, the type of ventilation systems and the width of the hallways.

""You could fit at least two gurneys in this hallway, and it's the size of many hospital corridors,"" he says. ""And it's certainly not necessary for the procedure.""

Lambrecht says there's no medical basis for the new law. He thinks the law is intended to increase costs and shut down clinics, most of which do not meet the new building codes.

Abortion rights groups are challenging the law. At a hearing this week, the state's attorney argued that Texas has the right to regulate clinics and has an interest in protecting the rights of the unborn.

""If the woman chooses to proceed with the abortion, she should have the best care and best environment possible,"" says state Rep. Jodie Laubenberg, who sponsored the measure.

She says the law is designed to make abortions safer.

""Why would anyone argue against making it a better place and a better environment?"" she asks. ""If a clinic closes, that is their choice. We're not forcing anyone to close.""

Laws like the one in Texas have passed in more than a dozen states. As a result, clinics have closed in states from Virginia to Ohio, and in Texas.

Another provision threatening to close clinics requires doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of a facility.

But hospitals do not have to grant admitting privileges. Some say doctors must live in the local community. Others require them to admit a certain number of patients. Some don't approve of abortion.

The doctor in Fort Worth does have privileges, but the hospital is too far from the clinic. That means the brand new Planned Parenthood center there would also have to stop performing abortions.

Across the vast Texas plains, more than 300 miles from Fort Worth, is the city of Lubbock, in the northwest part of the state. It's just an hour from the New Mexico border, and it's home to a much smaller Planned Parenthood clinic. The facility recently stopped scheduling appointments.

Annie Jones recently had an abortion. She's a single mother working and going to school in Lubbock, and she has a 2-year-old daughter, Molly.

Jones, who is 28, says she decided to have an abortion because it was best for her family.

""I knew that if I decided to have the second child, I would be doing it a disservice,"" she says. ""I'd be doing my daughter a disservice because I wouldn't be able to care for them in the way that they deserved.""

Go ahead , ask them . They only oppose the “ production ” of that demonic product .
Even the ACLU has its limits beyond the usual commonly cited exceptions of crying “ fire ” falsely in a crowded theater or making threats of violence .
The ACLU has long been comfortable with the ultimate violence committed inside the nation ’ s abortion clinics on unborn children , for example . Now , it is comfortable with barring abortion protesters via a 35-foot buffer zone , which it once regarded as a government overreach .
On Wednesday , the U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in McCullen v. Coakley , as to whether a Massachusetts law criminalizing protests near abortion clinics is constitutional . When the law was passed in 2007 , the ACLU of Massachusetts opposed it .
Likewise , in Colorado v. Hill ( 2000 ) , the ACLU ’ s U.S. Supreme Court brief said that a law creating an 8-foot , moving buffer around clients and a 100-foot barrier to clinic entrances and exits was an unconstitutional overreach .
In both instances , the ACLU noted that it has long supported Roe v. Wade and unrestricted abortions , but that the statutes did not properly balance competing rights . The ACLU ’ s brief in Hill concluded :
“ Colorado has identified its interest as access to health care facilities for patients and staff . Unfortunately , the floating buffer is not narrowly tailored to promote that interest . Instead , it focuses directly on expressive activities . It thus burdens substantially more speech than necessary to accomplish the state ’ s goal and can not be sustained , even under intermediate scrutiny . ”
The court disagreed , upholding the Colorado law in a 5 to 3 ruling with the majority opinion written by since-retired Justice John Paul Stevens , and two sharp dissents from Antonin Scalia ( joined by Clarence Thomas ) and Anthony M. Kennedy .
In 2007 , the ACLU of Massachusetts opposed a law creating a 35-foot fixed buffer zone around abortion clinics from which protesters were barred from approaching clients and staff or giving them brochures .
“ If the message is unwelcome , as it often will be outside abortion clinics , the constitutionally appropriate response in a public forum is for the listener to walk away , ” the ACLU argued in a report submitted to the legislature .
This time around , however , the ACLU ’ s Supreme Court brief in McCullen calls for the court to uphold the Massachusetts law “ as constitutional on its face , given a record of past harassment , intimidation , obstruction and violence . ”
The law , however , would not deter a violent assailant , such as John Salvi , who fatally shot two people at two Massachusetts clinics in 1994 . It is instead aimed at peaceful demonstrators who pray , recite the rosary and hand out literature . For perspective , consider that no similar law protects churches from harassment by homosexual militants , who have invaded services , used bullhorns on church property and committed other thuggish acts in the name of free speech .
Writing in The Wall Street Journal about the case , constitutional lawyer Floyd Abrams observed that “ the First Amendment has not changed in the 14 years between the filing of the ACLU briefs in Hill and McCullen ; the ACLU has . The old ACLU got it right . Looking back on Hill v. Colorado , Harvard [ professor ] Laurence Tribe observed that the case was ‘ slam-dunk simple ’ and the decision ‘ slam-dunk wrong . ’ ”
Mr. Abrams , who reminded readers that he supports Roe v. Wade and subsequent decisions securing “ a woman ’ s right to choose , ” concluded by writing about the Hill case that , “ It is time for the Supreme Court to right that wrong . ”
In his Hill dissent , Justice Scalia scathingly wrote of the majority ruling : “ What is before us , after all , is a speech regulation directed against the opponents of abortion and it therefore enjoys the benefit of the ‘ ad hoc nullification machine ’ that the Court has set in motion to push aside whatever doctrines of constitutional law stand in the way of that highly favored practice . ”
Dismissing the ruling ’ s claim that the restriction was not “ content-based , ” Justice Scalia noted : “ Whether a speaker must obtain permission before approaching within eight feet — and whether he will be sent to prison for failing to do so — depends entirely on what he intends to say when he gets there . I have no doubt that this regulation would be deemed content-based in an instant if the case before us involved antiwar protesters , or union members seeking to “ educate ” the public about the reasons for their strike . ”
Just as George Orwell ’ s “ Animal Farm ” taught us that “ all animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others , ” it will be instructive to see if the Supreme Court , like the ACLU , continues to regard certain views as “ less equal than others ” and thus , beyond First Amendment protection .

In his Hill dissent, Justice Scalia scathingly wrote of the majority ruling: “What is before us, after all, is a speech regulation directed against the opponents of abortion and it therefore enjoys the benefit of the ‘ad hoc nullification machine’ that the Court has set in motion to push aside whatever doctrines of constitutional law stand in the way of that highly favored practice.”

Dismissing the ruling’s claim that the restriction was not “content-based,” Justice Scalia noted: “Whether a speaker must obtain permission before approaching within eight feet — and whether he will be sent to prison for failing to do so — depends entirely on what he intends to say when he gets there. I have no doubt that this regulation would be deemed content-based in an instant if the case before us involved antiwar protesters, or union members seeking to “educate” the public about the reasons for their strike.”

Just as George Orwell’s “Animal Farm” taught us that “all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others,” it will be instructive to see if the Supreme Court, like the ACLU, continues to regard certain views as “less equal than others” and thus, beyond First Amendment protection.

Akin 'rape' comment draws widespread GOP criticism, call to exit Senate race ",2012-08-20,,"Missouri Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin resisted calls to withdraw from the race Monday over his controversial comments on rape , despite mounting pressure from GOP leaders who roundly condemned his remarks and threatened to cut off funding .
`` I am in this race to win . We need a conservative Senate , '' Akin tweeted Monday afternoon , as he solicited new donations . He also told Fox News ' Sean Hannity on his radio show that `` we 're going to stay in . ''
The tweet followed scattered and unconfirmed reports that Akin was moving to withdraw from the race . Akin , though , rejected those claims publicly even as Republican leaders leaned on him hard to reconsider his bid for Senate .
A source within the National Republican Senatorial Committee told Fox News that Sen. John Cornyn , head of the Senate GOP campaign arm , already has told Akin that if he stays in the race , the $ 5 million set aside for the Missouri race will be withdrawn . Cornyn , according to the source , told him the party is concerned his presence in the race could imperil Republicans ' chances of winning the Senate majority .
Akin , a six-term GOP congressman , is challenging Democratic Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill for her seat . His chances looked fairly sunny -- up until he told an interviewer with Fox affiliate KTVI that a woman 's body can typically prevent pregnancy during a `` legitimate rape , '' as he argued against allowing abortions in cases of rape , claiming such pregnancies are uncommon in the first place .
`` It seems to me first of all , from what I understand from doctors , that 's really rare , '' Akin told KTVI . `` If it 's a legitimate rape , the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down . ''
Akin has since backed off the comment , saying he `` misspoke . '' Akin apologized for the remark Monday .
Adding to the wave of condemnation , Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell called his comments `` totally inexcusable . ''
`` What he said is just flat wrong in addition to being wildly offensive to any victim of sexual abuse , '' McConnell said . `` Although Representative Akin has apologized , I believe he should take time with his family to consider whether this statement will prevent him from effectively representing our party in this critical election . ''
Several other GOP Senate candidates were also putting serious distance between their campaigns and his , as they tried to head off Democratic efforts to link Akin 's comments to other members of the party .
GOP Sen. Scott Brown , who 's in a tough race against President Obama ally Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts , tweeted that he found Akin 's remarks to be `` outrageous . ''
He followed up with a written statement calling on Akin to bow out .
`` As a husband and father of two young women , I found Todd Akin 's comments about women and rape outrageous , inappropriate and wrong , '' Brown said . `` There is no place in our public discourse for this type of offensive thinking . Not only should he apologize , but I believe Rep. Akin 's statement was so far out of bounds that he should resign the nomination for U.S. Senate in Missouri . ''
Further , NRSC Chairman Cornyn used a brief written statement to nudge Akin to reconsider his bid for Senate .
`` Congressman Akin 's statements were wrong , offensive , and indefensible , '' Cornyn , R-Texas , said . `` I recognize that this is a difficult time for him , but over the next 24 hours , Congressman Akin should carefully consider what is best for him , his family , the Republican Party and the values that he cares about and has fought for throughout his career in public service . ''
Obama , speaking in the White House briefing room , also called the comments `` offensive . '' `` Rape is rape , '' Obama said , and the idea of distinguishing among types of rape `` does n't make sense to the American people and certainly does n't make sense to me . ''
Aside from Brown , other Republicans in tough Senate races were similarly critical , without calling on Akin to step aside .
Rep. Jeff Flake , who is running for Senate in Arizona , tweeted that Akin 's comment was `` wrong . ''
`` I oppose abortion , but exceptions must be made for rape , incest and to protect the life of the mother , '' he said .
Virginia Senate candidate George Allen and Montana Senate candidate Rep. Denny Rehberg reportedly have joined in the rebuke -- as has Akin 's former primary opponent Sarah Steelman , who tweeted that she found the comments `` inexcusable , insulting and embarrassing to the GOP . ''
Mitt Romney gave a similar verdict in an interview with The National Review .
`` Congressman Akin 's comments on rape are insulting , inexcusable , and , frankly , wrong , '' Romney said .
Nevertheless , the Akin remarks became fast fodder for the Democratic National Committee , as Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz tried to link Akin 's stance to the Romney campaign .
`` Now , Akin 's choice of words is n't the real issue here . The real issue is a Republican Party -- led by Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan -- whose policies on women and their health are dangerously wrong , '' she said in an email directing supporters to sign an anti-Romney petition on the DNC website .
She cited Romney 's past comments on wanting to `` get rid '' of federal funding for Planned Parenthood .
The DNC email follows a pattern of trying to characterize the Romney ticket as `` dangerous '' to women , fueled in this case by comments from a congressman not tied to the presidential campaign .
McCaskill , who is seeking a second term , said in an emailed statement Sunday that she found the comments `` offensive . ''
`` It is beyond comprehension that someone can be so ignorant about the emotional and physical trauma brought on by rape , '' McCaskill said . `` The ideas that Todd Akin has expressed about the serious crime of rape and the impact on its victims are offensive . ''
`` In reviewing my off-the-cuff remarks , it 's clear that I misspoke in this interview and it does not reflect the deep empathy I hold for the thousands of women who are raped and abused every year , '' Akin 's statement said . `` Those who perpetrate these crimes are the lowest of the low in our society and their victims will have no stronger advocate in the Senate to help ensure they have the justice they deserve .

abortion,Fox Online News,2,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-abortion-nurse-lawsuit,Trump administration backs nurse who says employer forced her to perform abortion,,Caleb Parke,"The Trump administration is pursuing action against the University of Vermont Medical Center ( UVMC ) , which receives federal funds , after a nurse says her supervisors forced her to participate in an abortion against her will .
Jordan Sekulow , the American Center for Law & Justice ( ACLJ ) attorney representing the nurse , told `` Fox & Friends '' that President Trump , through the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , is the first president to enforce the federal law , the Church Amendment , passed by Congress in 1973 .
FRANKLIN GRAHAM SLAMS TAYLOR SWIFT 'S EQUALITY ACT SUPPORT AS ‘ CRUSHING THREAT TO RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ’
`` The Trump administration , President Trump , and Secretary Azar at HHS , is the first administration to actually enforce it against these hospitals , to actually enforce conscience protections so that nurses and doctors and medical professionals are n't forced to perform abortions against their religious or deeply held beliefs , '' Sekulow said .
On May 9 , 2018 , the Catholic nurse , who has asked to remain anonymous , filed a conscience and religious discrimination complaint against UVMC , contending they broke the law by forcing her to assist in an elective abortion despite making known her conscience-based objection .
The nurse allegedly thought she was assisting a miscarriage , but was later informed it was an abortion .
PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE 'S POLICY BANNING ATHEISTS FROM OPENING PRAYER DOES NOT VIOLATE CONSTITUTION , COURT SAYS
On Wednesday , HHS said its Office of Civil Rights ( OCR ) is giving UVMC , located in Burlington , Vt. , 30 days to change its policies .
Sekulow said UVMC 's policy dates back to 2017 , when it started to perform elective abortions , or `` abortions for abortion 's sake , '' after the former CEO of Planned Parenthood New England came in as a new chairman of the Board of Trustees .
Sekulow says the former Planned Parenthood chairman `` definitely has an animus to pro-life nurses , medical professionals , even doctors . ''
UVMC responded Wednesday saying it has `` robust , formal protections that safeguard both our employees ' religious , ethical and cultural beliefs , and our patients ' rights to access safe and legal abortion . ''
The medical center adds they `` do not discriminate against any employees for exercising their rights to opt out of procedures to which they object , '' including `` termination of pregnancy . ''

You must accommodate the objector . ''","The Trump administration is pursuing action against the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVMC), which receives federal funds, after a nurse says her supervisors forced her to participate in an abortion against her will.

Jordan Sekulow, the American Center for Law & Justice (ACLJ) attorney representing the nurse, told ""Fox & Friends"" that President Trump, through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is the first president to enforce the federal law, the Church Amendment, passed by Congress in 1973.

FRANKLIN GRAHAM SLAMS TAYLOR SWIFT'S EQUALITY ACT SUPPORT AS ‘CRUSHING THREAT TO RELIGIOUS LIBERTY’

""The Trump administration, President Trump, and Secretary Azar at HHS, is the first administration to actually enforce it against these hospitals, to actually enforce conscience protections so that nurses and doctors and medical professionals aren't forced to perform abortions against their religious or deeply held beliefs,"" Sekulow said.

On May 9, 2018, the Catholic nurse, who has asked to remain anonymous, filed a conscience and religious discrimination complaint against UVMC, contending they broke the law by forcing her to assist in an elective abortion despite making known her conscience-based objection.

The nurse allegedly thought she was assisting a miscarriage, but was later informed it was an abortion.

PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE'S POLICY BANNING ATHEISTS FROM OPENING PRAYER DOES NOT VIOLATE CONSTITUTION, COURT SAYS

On Wednesday, HHS said its Office of Civil Rights (OCR) is giving UVMC, located in Burlington, Vt., 30 days to change its policies.

Sekulow said UVMC's policy dates back to 2017, when it started to perform elective abortions, or ""abortions for abortion's sake,"" after the former CEO of Planned Parenthood New England came in as a new chairman of the Board of Trustees.

Sekulow says the former Planned Parenthood chairman ""definitely has an animus to pro-life nurses, medical professionals, even doctors.""

UVMC responded Wednesday saying it has ""robust, formal protections that safeguard both our employees' religious, ethical and cultural beliefs, and our patients' rights to access safe and legal abortion.""

The medical center adds they ""do not discriminate against any employees for exercising their rights to opt out of procedures to which they object,"" including ""termination of pregnancy.""

Sekulow says UVMC is ignoring the nurse's rights by saying, ""'If we can accommodate you, we will.' That's not the federal law that was passed by Congress. That's not what HHS enforces...You must accommodate the objector.""",www.foxnews.com,right,cXRJxDEWI9ju6ojk

CHICAGO — In 1990 , Patti Ernst was 35 years old and 16 weeks pregnant and found herself in a devastating medical situation . Her water had broken five months early , during a prenatal procedure testing for abnormalities that went horribly wrong .
Her doctors , at a Catholic hospital in southwestern Chicago , said there was nothing they could do . Ernst said they essentially told her “ the baby is going to be terribly deformed and probably won ’ t come to term , but you are just going to have to wait and be pregnant and give birth to a child that is either terribly deformed or ... ”
“ I have a big issue with anybody that feels they get to legislate what I get to do with my body , ” she said . She ultimately went to a different hospital to have an abortion .
Her congressman is Rep. Dan Lipinski , one of the last remaining anti-abortion Democrats in the House . He has voted to defund health clinics that offer abortion services , and to ban abortions at 20 weeks . He opposed the Affordable Care Act and its mandate that employers cover birth control . He speaks at the annual March for Life and attends fundraisers for anti-abortion groups .
Ernst supports Marie Newman , a progressive who supports abortion rights and is mounting a primary challenge to Lipinski . “ It just never felt [ Lipinski ] was a Democrat , ” Ernst , now 63 , said , sitting in a Chicago Ridge , Illinois , home where Newman was holding a meet-and-greet .
This will be one of the most competitive Democratic primaries in 2020 . And already , Newman is encountering some roadblocks . Though the district leans heavily Democratic , the national party has erected rules to protect incumbents like Lipinski . Newman says she can ’ t find a pollster who will work for her . Four political consultants have left her campaign because of a policy , made public in April , that the official campaign arm for House Democrats won ’ t do business with political vendors — like direct mail companies or political consultants — that also work for candidates challenging incumbent Democrats . Party superstars like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez oppose the rule ; she also managed to topple an incumbent in a primary challenge . But the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee isn ’ t budging .
The DCCC says it ’ s committed to incumbents , a loyalty to dues-paying members , that it believes represent the party ’ s best chance of keeping control in the House . And the DCCC ’ s chair , Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos , is a big proponent of “ big tent ” politics . Progressive lawmakers in Congress are still railing against what they see as a “ divisive ” policy that effectively “ blacklists ” groups and candidates .
The Democratic Party may need ideological diversity to regain national power , but already , Lipinski ’ s side of the “ big tent ” is looking sparse . Newman came within 2,200 votes of beating Lipinski in 2018 . She ’ s running again , already picking up endorsements from progressive groups like Emily ’ s List and NARAL , as well as from 2020 presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders and Gov . Jay Inslee . In a year when Democrats are newly energized around abortion rights , the Democratic apparatus protecting an anti-abortion candidate in friendly territory is raising eyebrows .
Lipinski is one of the last anti-abortion Democrats in a liberal district
Democrats have tolerated some anti-abortion lawmakers in their coalition , but the numbers are dwindling in a party that ’ s adopted a pro-woman mantle . Only three sitting House Democrats regularly vote against abortion rights ; Lipinski ; Rep. Collin Peterson , who represents a conservative Minnesota district ; and Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar . Everyone else has moved on the issue or left . Even Joe Biden , the current frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination , recently revised his position , saying the ban on using federal funds for abortions , which he used to support , should be overturned .
The issue has taken on new urgency in the 2020 primaries as Republican state legislatures pass stricter abortion laws explicitly designed to be brought before an increasingly conservative Supreme Court and unravel Roe v. Wade . Bustos was pressured into canceling her fundraiser for Lipinski in light of the Alabama state law banning abortions at six weeks , without exceptions for rape and incest .
But in the liberal stronghold of Illinois ’ s Third Congressional District , the anti-abortion Lipinski family has been in power for nearly 40 years — first Lipinski ’ s father , William , held the seat before passing it on to Dan — and they ’ re fighting against the current .
Once known for its conservative pockets , the area — surrounding Midway Airport , which spans parts of Cook and Will counties — is more diverse both socioeconomically and politically than it once was . It ’ s younger and middle class ; the median age is 37 , with a $ 65,000 household income , according to the most recent census estimates . There ’ s a growing Latinx population . Sanders beat Hillary Clinton here in 2016 by 8 points . Clinton went on to beat Donald Trump by an even bigger margin . Interestingly , Lipinski , who was a superdelegate in the 2016 elections , pledged his vote to Sanders .
But between Newman and Lipinski , only one has adopted Sanders ’ s worldview .
“ I ’ m a real Democrat , ” Newman likes to tell voters . “ To be a real Democrat , you have to believe in the platform , ” she said to ███ . She , like Sanders , identifies income inequality as the root cause of American suffering . At a Saturday morning Pet Parade in Chicago ’ s Garfield Ridge neighborhood , Newman led a procession of staffers and volunteers — and their dogs — with signs supporting Medicare-for-all , a $ 15 minimum wage , and a Green New Deal . Newman supports abortion rights , the Equality Act , and free college and thinks Immigration and Customs Enforcement should be “ repealed and replaced . ”
Steps behind , Lipinski ’ s team , in T-shirts reading “ Commonsense Leadership for the 3rd District ” on the backs , represented a different world of Democratic politics . In Washington , Lipinski ’ s commonsense leadership has translated to a vote against the Affordable Care Act and a past opposition to raising the minimum wage to $ 15 hour ( he supported raising it to $ 12 but has since shifted on the issue ) . Lipinski voted for the Dream Act and the Equality Act for the first time this year , but with a caveat — he believes the bill conflicts with his positions on religious liberties . In the past , his immigration views have been more focused on border security than on a path to citizenship . ICE has continued to conduct raids in his district .
When describing the area , Lipinski ’ s staff focuses on the district ’ s history of conservatism . Lipinski himself cites the influx of Latinx residents as the biggest change in his district .
But Newman and her supporters say he ’ s espousing policies from a bygone era .
“ He is stuck back in 1991 and he just couldn ’ t ever catch up , ” Newman told ███ , praising Lipinski ’ s father for working on infrastructure . “ It ’ s a misnomer to say [ the district ] is changing dramatically in 10 years . No , it ’ s just made great progress over time . ”
“ He just blocks out representing the district and turns to his personal beliefs to lead his vote , ” Abby McEntee , a progressive activist with Indivisible and a local preschool teacher , said . “ Personal beliefs are totally fine , but his job is to represent the district . ”
Even Lipinski ’ s most loyal supporters are beginning to see him as an outsider .
“ He had a really close election last time , so what he has to do is find out what the constituents want and sort of modify those positions , ” Albert Reiff , a 71-year-old Vietnam War veteran , said . “ Like with the women and stuff like that . You ’ ve got to understand society is more [ supportive of ] equal wages for equal work , more open-minded with who you can love and stuff like that . He could do it , though . He ’ s not like Lindsey Graham . He is a moderate . ”
At a senior fair in Summit , Illinois , Lipinski was in his element . A group of older constituents , mostly white , many veterans , lined up to share their gripes : Their grandkids were having trouble covering health care bills , the music festival at the local park was too damn loud , the DMV was too confusing . In this community , Lipinski is known for this kind of affair ; he regularly holds events for seniors and veterans . His district office is known for getting their concerns taken care of . Reiff said Lipinski ’ s staff organized his paperwork for the Veterans Affairs hospital and got his Vietnam War medals mailed to his home .
As far as Reiff was concerned , Newman ’ s insurgency is a “ reflection of the millenniums ” — referring to the progressive millennial energy that has boosted candidates like Sanders . Lipinski operates in a different world .
Talking Trump , Lipinski chose his words carefully . According to exit polling , 18 percent of his primary support in 2018 came from Trump supporters . He treaded lightly on impeachment , saying the election was the better way to oust the president , but was undecided in the 2020 presidential primary . He wouldn ’ t say whether he sees the national outrage around abortion rights playing inside his district .
“ There are people who are pro-life and there are people who are pro-choice , ” Lipinski told ███ . That was the extent to which he would acknowledge the overwhelming support for abortion rights within his party — at least in that space . He said his focus was on the “ kitchen table issues . ”
There ’ s probably a reason for that . To most in that room , his anti-abortion position was either irrelevant or unknown . There are longtime constituents , like Kathy Voigt , a 72-year-old OB-GYN nurse who voted for Lipinski in 2018 , only to learn about his record on abortion after the fact . She thought , “ Criminy , what have I done , ” she said , noting that she plans to look into Newman ’ s campaign now .
Lipinski has acknowledged the pressure to conform to a progressive viewpoint in the past , telling an anti-abortion media outlet that it “ greatly concerns me what the Democratic Party has done in many ways it is difficult to be a practicing Catholic . ”
Lori Walsh , 75 , said when walking out the door at the senior fair : “ Give him good publicity . He needs it . They ’ re pushing him out . ”
Newman came close to defeating Lipinski in 2018 . She thinks she can do it in 2020 .
Lipinski barely hung on last time , winning the Democratic primary by just over 2,000 votes . Already , Newman is outpacing Lipinski in fundraising , with nearly quadruple the individual contributions . She spent the end of last year working on local campaigns to learn even more about the district . Walking through a local farmers market , introducing herself and passing out stickers , she said roughly half the people she comes across at community events know who she is .
But House Democrats , facing a tough year to hold on to their current majority , have made incumbents a priority . And it ’ s hard to find a greater beneficiary than Lipinski . Newman says her campaign has been forced to create a new way to poll the district : gathering data from outside groups , and relying more on door-to-door events . The DCCC said they made a longstanding policy around vendors public as a matter of transparency ; “ The DCCC has worked to change how Washington works , increase transparency in politics , and be perfectly clear with all its partners about the standards it expects of them , ” Cole Leiter , a DCCC spokesperson , said in a statement .
Last cycle , Newman ’ s fight against a party apparatus was with the “ Chicago Machine , ” infamous for its dirty tricks . While Newman can ’ t definitively blame the party for her loss in 2018 , she has a long list of fishy happenings she ’ s happy to share .
She says her office internet would go out without any explanation from the service providers . Her staff ’ s cars would get keyed outside the office . And most shocking of all , Newman said her name didn ’ t show up on the ballot at all in more than a dozen precincts ( ███ couldn ’ t find a news story reporting this , but did talk to one woman who said Newman ’ s name wasn ’ t on her ballot in 2018 ) . This time , they will have election watchers on the ground at every polling station . Above all , she says , fighting against the machine is fighting against a negative playbook , which she expects again in full force .
But her supporters see the DCCC ’ s now public policy around vendors in the same vein .
“ It ’ s disappointing the DCCC is learning from the Chicago old-style machine tactics , ” José Torrez , an immigration activist and educator in the district , said . “ We are watching what the Democratic Party is doing . We are not Republicans ; we don ’ t block incumbents from challenges . ”
The DCCC playing in her district like the Chicago political machine was a frightening thought for Newman .
Laughing , she said only , “ I hope not . The machine is pretty darn good , so I ’ m scared to hear that . ”","Share All sharing options for: The Democratic Party is protecting one of its last anti-abortion members in a safe blue district

At a senior fair in Summit, Illinois, Lipinski was in his element. A group of older constituents, mostly white, many veterans, lined up to share their gripes: Their grandkids were having trouble covering health care bills, the music festival at the local park was too damn loud, the DMV was too confusing. In this community, Lipinski is known for this kind of affair; he regularly holds events for seniors and veterans. His district office is known for getting their concerns taken care of. Reiff said Lipinski’s staff organized his paperwork for the Veterans Affairs hospital and got his Vietnam War medals mailed to his home.

As far as Reiff was concerned, Newman’s insurgency is a “reflection of the millenniums” — referring to the progressive millennial energy that has boosted candidates like Sanders. Lipinski operates in a different world.

Talking Trump, Lipinski chose his words carefully. According to exit polling, 18 percent of his primary support in 2018 came from Trump supporters. He treaded lightly on impeachment, saying the election was the better way to oust the president, but was undecided in the 2020 presidential primary. He wouldn’t say whether he sees the national outrage around abortion rights playing inside his district.

“There are people who are pro-life and there are people who are pro-choice,” Lipinski told Vox. That was the extent to which he would acknowledge the overwhelming support for abortion rights within his party — at least in that space. He said his focus was on the “kitchen table issues.”

There’s probably a reason for that. To most in that room, his anti-abortion position was either irrelevant or unknown. There are longtime constituents, like Kathy Voigt, a 72-year-old OB-GYN nurse who voted for Lipinski in 2018, only to learn about his record on abortion after the fact. She thought, “Criminy, what have I done,” she said, noting that she plans to look into Newman’s campaign now.

Lipinski has acknowledged the pressure to conform to a progressive viewpoint in the past, telling an anti-abortion media outlet that it “greatly concerns me what the Democratic Party has done in many ways it is difficult to be a practicing Catholic.”

Lori Walsh, 75, said when walking out the door at the senior fair: “Give him good publicity. He needs it. They’re pushing him out.”

Newman came close to defeating Lipinski in 2018. She thinks she can do it in 2020.

Lipinski barely hung on last time, winning the Democratic primary by just over 2,000 votes. Already, Newman is outpacing Lipinski in fundraising, with nearly quadruple the individual contributions. She spent the end of last year working on local campaigns to learn even more about the district. Walking through a local farmers market, introducing herself and passing out stickers, she said roughly half the people she comes across at community events know who she is.

But House Democrats, facing a tough year to hold on to their current majority, have made incumbents a priority. And it’s hard to find a greater beneficiary than Lipinski. Newman says her campaign has been forced to create a new way to poll the district: gathering data from outside groups, and relying more on door-to-door events. The DCCC said they made a longstanding policy around vendors public as a matter of transparency; “The DCCC has worked to change how Washington works, increase transparency in politics, and be perfectly clear with all its partners about the standards it expects of them,” Cole Leiter, a DCCC spokesperson, said in a statement.

Last cycle, Newman’s fight against a party apparatus was with the “Chicago Machine,” infamous for its dirty tricks. While Newman can’t definitively blame the party for her loss in 2018, she has a long list of fishy happenings she’s happy to share.

She says her office internet would go out without any explanation from the service providers. Her staff’s cars would get keyed outside the office. And most shocking of all, Newman said her name didn’t show up on the ballot at all in more than a dozen precincts (Vox couldn’t find a news story reporting this, but did talk to one woman who said Newman’s name wasn’t on her ballot in 2018). This time, they will have election watchers on the ground at every polling station. Above all, she says, fighting against the machine is fighting against a negative playbook, which she expects again in full force.

But her supporters see the DCCC’s now public policy around vendors in the same vein.

“It’s disappointing the DCCC is learning from the Chicago old-style machine tactics,” José Torrez, an immigration activist and educator in the district, said. “We are watching what the Democratic Party is doing. We are not Republicans; we don’t block incumbents from challenges.”

The DCCC playing in her district like the Chicago political machine was a frightening thought for Newman.

Laughing, she said only, “I hope not. The machine is pretty darn good, so I’m scared to hear that.”",www.vox.com,left,V8EziayDukwrS5T0

Public opinion on abortion rights is often framed as a binary choice between two political positions, but a closer look at new polling data from Gallup reveals more nuance.

While a majority of Americans support legalized abortion in early pregnancy, most oppose it in the later stages, according to the survey.

Gallup finds that 60 percent of Americans believe abortion generally should be legal during the first three months of pregnancy, known as the first trimester. That support drops by more than half, to 28 percent, once a pregnancy reaches the second trimester; it falls to 13 percent in the third trimester, at which point the fetus is often viable with medical support.

The reason for the procedure also shapes public opinion on abortion. For the first time in 15 years, Gallup asked Americans about their views on abortion in a range of particular cases, including rape and incest or when the life of the mother is in danger.

A majority of respondents, 83 percent, said abortion should be legal in the first three months to protect the woman's life; that number fell to 75 percent in the third trimester. More than three-quarters (77 percent) support legal abortion in the first trimester in cases of rape and incest, though that fell to just over half (52 percent) by the third.

abortion,National Review,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/11/the-2020-democrats-extremism-on-abortion/,The 2020 Democrats’ Extremism on Abortion,2019-11-26,"John Mccormack, Kyle Smith, Jonah Goldberg, Sarah Schutte, Matthew Continetti, Nicholas Frankovich, Jim Geraghty, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Victor Davis Hanson","Candidates in a Democratic presidential debate , Atlanta , Ga. , November 20 , 2019 ( Brendan McDermid/Reuters )
Only one candidate says he supports any restrictions after fetal viability .
The New York Times has surveyed all 2020 Democratic presidential candidates on the issue of abortion and come to the conclusion that the field “ has coalesced around an abortion rights agenda more far-reaching than anything past nominees have proposed. ” “ The positions reflect a hugely consequential shift on one of the country ’ s most politically divisive issues , ” Maggie Astor writes .
Among the top-tier candidates , Elizabeth Warren , Pete Buttigieg , and Bernie Sanders want to force all private insurers to cover elective abortions , and they all want to make the abortion drugs misoprostol and mifepristone available over the counter . Joe Biden did not provide an answer to either of these questions .
All of the candidates favor repealing the Hyde amendment in order to provide unlimited taxpayer funding of elective abortions for Medicaid recipients . Only South Bend , Ind. , mayor Pete Buttigieg says that , as a practical matter , he ’ d be willing to sign a budget that includes the Hyde amendment , while the other candidates dodge the question . ( The Hyde amendment is attached to legislation that can be filibustered , and refusing to sign an appropriations bill that includes it would force a government shutdown . )
Among the entire field , “ only Tulsi Gabbard , Joe Sestak and Marianne Williamson now say abortion should be ‘ safe , legal and rare ’ — a phrase , popularized by President Bill Clinton and repeated by Hillary Clinton , that reflected a search for common ground with people not fully supportive of abortion rights. ” Other candidates prefer to call for abortion to be “ affordable ” or “ accessible ” rather than “ rare . ”
Perhaps most striking of all , the Times reports : “ Asked if they supported restrictions after 24 weeks — roughly when a healthy fetus can survive outside the womb , though viability varies from pregnancy to pregnancy — only Mr. Sestak said yes . ( Ms. Gabbard , who did not complete the survey , has also said she supports restrictions in the third trimester . ) ”
Compare the 2020 Democrats with the last Democratic presidential candidate who won the White House . Here ’ s what Barack Obama told a Christian magazine in 2008 after he had effectively wrapped up the nomination :
I have repeatedly said that I think it ’ s entirely appropriate for states to restrict or even prohibit late-term abortions as long as there is a strict , well-defined exception for the health of the mother . Now , I don ’ t think that “ mental distress ” qualifies as the health of the mother . I think it has to be a serious physical issue that arises in pregnancy , where there are real , significant problems to the mother carrying that child to term . Otherwise , as long as there is such a medical exception in place , I think we can prohibit late-term abortions .
The only thing Joe Biden has going for him is his association with Barack Obama , but he is apparently unwilling to now associate himself with Obama ’ s position abortion in 2008 . In the 1990s , Biden said he would like to “ ban all post-viability abortions , ” but now his campaign is dodging the question on whether he supports any restrictions on aborting viable babies . The rest of the top-tier candidates — Buttigieg , Warren , and Sanders — forthrightly oppose any restrictions after 24 weeks of pregnancy .
It ’ s quite odd that Tulsi Gabbard thinks abortion should sometimes be restricted after 28 weeks ( the start of the third trimester ) , but she will not say if she supports restrictions after 24 weeks .

Only one candidate says he supports any restrictions after fetal viability.

The New York Times has surveyed all 2020 Democratic presidential candidates on the issue of abortion and come to the conclusion that the field “has coalesced around an abortion rights agenda more far-reaching than anything past nominees have proposed.” “The positions reflect a hugely consequential shift on one of the country’s most politically divisive issues,” Maggie Astor writes.

Among the top-tier candidates, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, and Bernie Sanders want to force all private insurers to cover elective abortions, and they all want to make the abortion drugs misoprostol and mifepristone available over the counter. Joe Biden did not provide an answer to either of these questions.

All of the candidates favor repealing the Hyde amendment in order to provide unlimited taxpayer funding of elective abortions for Medicaid recipients. Only South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg says that, as a practical matter, he’d be willing to sign a budget that includes the Hyde amendment, while the other candidates dodge the question. (The Hyde amendment is attached to legislation that can be filibustered, and refusing to sign an appropriations bill that includes it would force a government shutdown.)

Among the entire field, “only Tulsi Gabbard, Joe Sestak and Marianne Williamson now say abortion should be ‘safe, legal and rare’— a phrase, popularized by President Bill Clinton and repeated by Hillary Clinton, that reflected a search for common ground with people not fully supportive of abortion rights.” Other candidates prefer to call for abortion to be “affordable” or “accessible” rather than “rare.”

Perhaps most striking of all, the Times reports: “Asked if they supported restrictions after 24 weeks — roughly when a healthy fetus can survive outside the womb, though viability varies from pregnancy to pregnancy — only Mr. Sestak said yes. (Ms. Gabbard, who did not complete the survey, has also said she supports restrictions in the third trimester.)”

Compare the 2020 Democrats with the last Democratic presidential candidate who won the White House. Here’s what Barack Obama told a Christian magazine in 2008 after he had effectively wrapped up the nomination:

I have repeatedly said that I think it’s entirely appropriate for states to restrict or even prohibit late-term abortions as long as there is a strict, well-defined exception for the health of the mother. Now, I don’t think that “mental distress” qualifies as the health of the mother. I think it has to be a serious physical issue that arises in pregnancy, where there are real, significant problems to the mother carrying that child to term. Otherwise, as long as there is such a medical exception in place, I think we can prohibit late-term abortions.

The only thing Joe Biden has going for him is his association with Barack Obama, but he is apparently unwilling to now associate himself with Obama’s position abortion in 2008. In the 1990s, Biden said he would like to “ban all post-viability abortions,” but now his campaign is dodging the question on whether he supports any restrictions on aborting viable babies. The rest of the top-tier candidates — Buttigieg, Warren, and Sanders — forthrightly oppose any restrictions after 24 weeks of pregnancy.

It’s quite odd that Tulsi Gabbard thinks abortion should sometimes be restricted after 28 weeks (the start of the third trimester), but she will not say if she supports restrictions after 24 weeks. The third-trimester distinction is a relic of the medical capabilities of the 1970s. When a plurality of Supreme Court justices declared in the (constitutionally and morally unsound) Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision in 1992 that there is a right to abortion after viability, they wrote that the “soundness or unsoundness of that constitutional judgment in no sense turns on whether viability occurs at approximately 28 weeks, as was usual at the time of Roe, at 23 to 24 weeks, as it sometimes does today, or at some moment even slightly earlier in pregnancy, as it may if fetal respiratory capacity can somehow be enhanced in the future.” (As the Times has acknowledged in earlier articles, viability has now moved up to 22 weeks into pregnancy.)

Bills have so far passed one chamber in Louisiana , Missouri , South Carolina and Tennessee . Others have been introduced to statehouses in Maryland , Minnesota , New York , Texas and West Virginia without yet facing votes .
These 25 white men – all Republicans – just voted to ban abortion in Alabama Read more
Georgia ’ s Republican governor , Brian Kemp , signed legislation earlier this month to ban abortion once cardiac activity can be detected in an embryo – which can be as early as six weeks , before many women even realize they are pregnant . The law sparked outrage among women ’ s rights groups across the US .
All these laws and bills are patterned on “ model legislation ” promoted by the hardline anti-abortion group Faith2Action led by the high-profile conservative campaigner Janet Porter .
Porter has been pushing the idea of what pro-choice campaigners call “ six-week bills ” for almost a decade , but until recently she has had limited success .
According to abortion rights supporters and opponents alike , the reasons for the sudden rash of six week anti-abortion bills making headway in state legislatures are as much to do with timing and opportunity as they are with Porter and her group ’ s determined lobbying .
Separate to this push by Faith2Action , Alabama ’ s senate passed a different sort of abortion law that would ban all abortions at any stage of pregnancy , going further than any other state in the US .
Porter ’ s advocacy for six-week bans was originally seen as too hardline even by other anti-abortion conservatives . Porter ’ s first attempt to push such a law dates back to 2011 in Ohio , with conservative politicians initially refusing to take it up , and the state governor , John Kasich , vetoing versions of the bill that passed in 2016 and 2018 . However , it passed in Ohio on another attempt earlier this year .
'It goes after Roe directly ' : Alabama 's abortion bill set to go before state senate Read more
Now , model legislation like Porter ’ s has become an increasingly important part of the toolkit of those seeking to effect national change from the bottom up , inspiring politicians in numerous states to take up similar legislation .
Lobbyists and interest groups have promoted “ cut-and-paste ” laws to state legislators in the hope of gradually changing the national legal and political climate on particular issues .
The recent push on abortion bills has not always met with success . In 2018 , a similar bill passed in Iowa but was struck down by the state court , and another died in committee in Pennsylvania . This year , however , aside from Georgia , bills have also passed into law in Kentucky , Mississippi and Ohio – though in all cases they are subject to challenge , and yet to be enacted .
Observers believe that the big push on abortion laws is prompted by a desire by anti-abortion activists and social conservatives to bring the issue back to the supreme court , which has swung decisively conservative with Donald Trump ’ s appointment of two new judges , especially Brett Kavanaugh who is widely seen as a hardliner on the issue .

Bills have so far passed one chamber in Louisiana, Missouri, South Carolina and Tennessee. Others have been introduced to statehouses in Maryland, Minnesota, New York, Texas and West Virginia without yet facing votes.

Georgia’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, signed legislation earlier this month to ban abortion once cardiac activity can be detected in an embryo – which can be as early as six weeks, before many women even realize they are pregnant. The law sparked outrage among women’s rights groups across the US.

All these laws and bills are patterned on “model legislation” promoted by the hardline anti-abortion group Faith2Action led by the high-profile conservative campaigner Janet Porter.

Porter has been pushing the idea of what pro-choice campaigners call “six-week bills” for almost a decade, but until recently she has had limited success.

According to abortion rights supporters and opponents alike, the reasons for the sudden rash of six week anti-abortion bills making headway in state legislatures are as much to do with timing and opportunity as they are with Porter and her group’s determined lobbying.

Separate to this push by Faith2Action, Alabama’s senate passed a different sort of abortion law that would ban all abortions at any stage of pregnancy, going further than any other state in the US.

Porter’s advocacy for six-week bans was originally seen as too hardline even by other anti-abortion conservatives. Porter’s first attempt to push such a law dates back to 2011 in Ohio, with conservative politicians initially refusing to take it up, and the state governor, John Kasich, vetoing versions of the bill that passed in 2016 and 2018. However, it passed in Ohio on another attempt earlier this year.

Now, model legislation like Porter’s has become an increasingly important part of the toolkit of those seeking to effect national change from the bottom up, inspiring politicians in numerous states to take up similar legislation.

Lobbyists and interest groups have promoted “cut-and-paste” laws to state legislators in the hope of gradually changing the national legal and political climate on particular issues.

The recent push on abortion bills has not always met with success. In 2018, a similar bill passed in Iowa but was struck down by the state court, and another died in committee in Pennsylvania. This year, however, aside from Georgia, bills have also passed into law in Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio – though in all cases they are subject to challenge, and yet to be enacted.

Observers believe that the big push on abortion laws is prompted by a desire by anti-abortion activists and social conservatives to bring the issue back to the supreme court, which has swung decisively conservative with Donald Trump’s appointment of two new judges, especially Brett Kavanaugh who is widely seen as a hardliner on the issue.

Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute, said many anti-abortion groups share Porter’s sense that “with the confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh… [they] now have the votes to uphold the ‘heartbeat’ bill on the United States supreme court” and challenge the landmark Roe v Wade decision that guaranteed abortion rights in the US.

Quick guide What is Roe v Wade? Show Hide Norma McCorvey, pictured, was the real name of the woman known as “Jane Roe” in the landmark 1973 US supreme court case Roe v Wade, which established the right of American women to have abortions. McCorvey became the plaintiff in 1970 after she met with two lawyers looking for a test case to challenge the abortion ban in Texas, where it was a crime unless a woman's life was at risk. Similar statutes were in place in nearly every other state at the time. At the time, McCorvey was pregnant, unmarried, unemployed and unable to obtain an abortion legally or otherwise. The case went to the supreme court, which handed down the watershed ruling that a woman's right to make her own medical decisions, including the choice to have an abortion, is protected under the 14th amendment. McCorvey never had an abortion. Her case, which proceeded largely without her involvement, took too long to resolve, and she gave birth to a child that she placed for adoption. Several years after the ruling, she publicly revealed her identity and became involved in the pro-abortion rights movement. But after a conversion to Christianity, she became an anti-abortion rights activist. Before she died in 2017, McCorvey had said it was her wish to see Roe v Wade overturned in her lifetime.

The most recent abortion case strengthened abortion rights , and there has been no groundwork laid for a decision reversing Roe tomorrow . Roberts and Alito have never written an opinion saying Roe should go .
So I think that it is more likely that we will see a more subtle or gradual attack on Roe — a series of cases chipping away at legal abortion .

Since 1992 , there have been literally hundreds of proposed and passed state laws intended to make getting an abortion increasingly difficult , if not wholly impossible . Many state legislators will eagerly offer bills to make abortion illegal in their states the second that Roe falls .

All eyes are on Chief Justice Roberts — and the Senate

Sam Brownback said in his 2015 State of the State address. “Whether at the beginning of life or the end of life, Kansas is the most pro-life state in America. And we are not going back.” On April 7, he kept his word, signing into law the Unborn Child Protection From Dismemberment Abortion Act, which states that, starting July 1, a person who, “with the purpose of causing the death of a living unborn child,” knowingly dismembers and extracts such an unborn “child, one piece at a time from the uterus,” may be charged with a Class A misdemeanor if it is his or her first violation of the law. Subsequent violations render a person liable for a felony conviction and carry a jail sentence of up to nine months. The Kansas act is the first state law since Roe v.

Selective morality

They’re Also Incredibly Effective—and Dangerous—Anti-Abortion Activists.,2020-06-04,"Marisa Endicott, Becca Andrews, Jessica Washington, Stephanie Mencimer, Tim Murphy, Fernanda Echavarri, Nathalie Baptiste, Dan Friedman, Inae Oh, Molly Olmstead","For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis and more , subscribe to ███ ' newsletters
In April 2019 , when meetings like this still took place , Diane Foley took the stage in Indianapolis , looking out into the faces of anti-choice advocates and doctors who were gathered for their annual conference . The Health and Human Services official began her presentation : “ Opportunities for Collaborative Engagement in Policy Development. ” The bland , policy-wonkish title belied its almost-revolutionary substance : nothing less than a major shift in American health care—and a threat to the more than 4 million primarily low-income people who rely on a key government program for family planning and other care .
Title X , which Foley oversees as the head of the Office of Population Affairs—and which also includes the government ’ s teen pregnancy program—offers health care providers more than $ 286 million in funding each year . Just a month before her presentation , a new rule passed that would , for the first time , prohibit Title X recipients from performing abortions on-site or even providing abortion referrals . This effectively shut out a quarter of all clinics that were getting funding—including Planned Parenthood , which has traditionally received some $ 60 million a year from the program and provides more than 2.4 million patients with a slew of services , from birth control to cancer screenings to wellness exams .
The rule also opened the door for money to flow to anti-abortion health providers—just like those gathered for Foley ’ s presentation . Her panel was part of the three-day summit hosted by the American Association of Pro-life Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( AAPLOG ) , a nonprofit that brings together reproductive health care professionals who oppose abortion . A pediatrician by training , Foley has been a prominent anti-abortion advocate and has in the past been affiliated with the partner organization that puts on the conference , the American College of Pediatricians , which the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated an extremist hate group for pushing anti-LGBTQ views , like linking homosexuality to pedophilia .
Foley has said , “ It could be considered ‘ sexually harassing ’ to demonstrate condom use to a class with , say , a banana. ” She has even reportedly compared abortion to the Holocaust .
In fact , Foley has spent her career supporting and amplifying the kind of fringe science that was front and center at the gathering . ( Other presentations focused on so-called fetal pain and “ how secular biotechnology will impact…the Catholic healthcare system ” ; another was titled “ Jewish & Pro-life ? Oy Vey ! ! ” ) Before joining HHS , Foley headed Life Network , a Christian anti-abortion group that offers abstinence-only sex education and runs two Colorado crisis pregnancy centers , which are pro-life facilities that counsel women against getting abortions . Foley herself has said , “ It could be considered ‘ sexually harassing ’ to demonstrate condom use to a class with , say , a banana , ” according to a 2010 Colorado Springs Independent report . She has even reportedly compared abortion to the Holocaust and slavery , and she has claimed it causes mental illness .
For the past couple of years , she ’ s brought those views to bear on official policymaking and has become a partner for AAPLOG within the Trump administration . Public records shared with ███ by the pro-choice watchdog group Equity Forward reveal frequent emails and phone calls between Foley and the head of AAPLOG , Donna Harrison . Harrison has written to Foley to share scientifically suspect anti-abortion research , as well as her concerns that health clinics might be able to get around the new Title X rule by dispensing medication abortion to be taken at home rather than on site . “ The hair splitting becomes important in defending the Title X regs , ” Harrison wrote Foley in April 2019 ; in response , Foley reassured Harrison that both medical and surgical abortion would be barred . In another conversation from August 2018 , Foley asked Harrison to recommend AAPLOG experts on fertility awareness-based pregnancy prevention—the widely debunked “ rhythm method , ” for example .
This work with Foley is just one way the organization has wielded its influence in recent years . The nearly 50-year-old group may be still relatively unknown to the broader public , flying under the radar as an innocuous-sounding medical association , but the Trump era has opened the door for it to exert significant new powers : intermingling with key Trump personnel in charge of health policy , influencing administration staffing , and playing a major role in shaping the recent explosion of state-level anti-abortion legislation . AAPLOG doctors act as expert witnesses in state and federal legislative hearings and provide lawmakers with scientifically questionable claims to support abortion bans , mandatory ultrasounds , and abortion waiting periods . And then , when those laws are challenged in court , AAPLOG officials and doctors testify and submit amicus briefs on behalf of their cause . “ We ’ re seeing [ abortion opponents ] take advantage of this moment , ” explains Mary Alice Carter , a senior adviser at Equity Forward .
And this moment might be the culmination of much of their hard work . Just as abortion bans that capitalized on the coronavirus pandemic wind down—which AAPLOG worked to institute in at least one state—the Supreme Court is poised to rule imminently on June Medical Services v. Russo , a case that pro-choice advocates fear , and anti-abortion activists hope , has the power to gut Roe v. Wade . AAPLOG has been vocal in rallying behind the defendants in the case ; in December , it filed an amicus brief on behalf of the Louisiana law that requires abortion providers have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals , and in March , AAPLOG board chair Dr. Christina Francis wrote in the Wall Street Journal that “ every second counts in an obstetric emergency….That ’ s why it ’ s essential that anyone performing an abortion have the ability to admit a patient to a nearby hospital—preferably one closer than 30 miles away. ” Despite cloaking her argument in medical expertise , she declined to mention that complications from abortion are rare , few women need hospital care , and women can be seen in an emergency even if their doctor lacks such privileges .
While AAPLOG ’ s positions have been dismissed by many in medical and scientific circles , its arguments , like those from Francis , illustrate the organization ’ s unique role in anti-abortion advocacy , distinct from anti-choice groups who stake their opposition on moral grounds . This war is being waged over the science . “ It does feel different when you are calling into question long-standing understandings about how health care works , ” Carter adds . “ [ AAPLOG ] poses a different threat because they have that medical stamp behind them. ” ( ███ requested comment from AAPLOG on a list of questions on three occasions ; AAPLOG did not return comment on the third list of questions about its scientific research , its congressional testimony , and its relationship with the Trump administration , among other issues . )
“ We ’ re in a research or science vacuum where this is concerned . ”
“ Abortion has been legal in the United States since 1973 , and we know that it ’ s very safe , and very , very few women have significant complications related to abortion , ” says Alina Salganicoff , director of women ’ s health policy at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation . “ It ’ s certainly within [ doctors ’ ] rights to have objections to abortions , but to say that is unsafe and there are risks , when research finds that there are none , really raises a lot of questions . ”
Even before the coronavirus pandemic , with its accompanying allegations of inflated death tolls and the suggestion of bleach as treatment , we ’ ve been living in an era of “ alternative facts ” —and , pandemic or no , this fight will continue to play out in the abortion debate with increasingly high stakes . “ We ’ re in a research or science vacuum where this is concerned , ” Salganicoff observes . “ Abortion has some parallels to climate science . Everybody is like , ‘ Based on my conclusions , these are the facts . ’ ”
The impact is not simply theoretical . When AAPLOG and its ideological peers argue emergency contraception and IUDs are abortifacients , that life begins at the moment of fertilization , and that there is a “ symbiotic relationship among pornography , sex-trafficking and abortion ” —and lawmakers , federal officials , and judges believe it , or at least hide behind it—it ’ s ultimately patients and their families who will suffer .
The ways in which AAPLOG twists medical science to restrict a woman ’ s freedom are part of a long history of women ’ s health being used as a justification for women ’ s oppression . Periods were once an illness necessitating seclusion ; working outside the home increased women ’ s risk of coronary heart disease ; a woman ’ s raging hormones made her unfit to be president . “ The man on the street might have said the same thing , but the experts said it with the solemn and intimidating authority of science to back them up , ” Barbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre English wrote in the 2005 re-release of their book For Her Own Good : Two Centuries of the Experts ’ Advice to Women . ( Both Ehrenreich and English have connections to ███ , the former as a prior board member and contributing editor , the latter as a previous editor-in-chief . )
“ The role of doctor was monopolized by men at a time before women had any rights at all , ” English says in an interview . The medical profession “ acted to control women ’ s choices and to force women to conform to patriarchal structures that were in place at that time . It had nothing to do with science. ” Midwives , in fact , oversaw most births until the rise of gynecology in the 1600s—which , English notes , coincided with the invention of forceps . The now-common gynecological tool was kept as a closely guarded secret by the male inventors and eventually other men assisting in childbirth to control the process and dominate the profession .
Even as women ’ s rights and the medical field have evolved , the negative repercussions of decades of discrimination still linger , and the regulation of abortion is undeniably connected to this history . “ Controlling childbirth , controlling women ’ s reproductive activity is one of the important foundations of patriarchy , ” English says . “ Sexuality and reproduction : If you can control those two things you have women under control . ”
“ Sexuality and reproduction : If you can control those two things you have women under control . ”
Over time , anti-abortion groups similarly recognized the power of the scientific argument .
AAPLOG has its roots in the preeminent association for women ’ s health workers , the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( ACOG ) , which has advocated for women ’ s health and its providers since 1951 . Around the time Roe was decided in 1973 , ACOG changed its policy to be more supportive of abortion access and a woman ’ s right to choose . In protest , a small subset of doctors formed a special interest group within the larger organization , meeting annually for four decades and advocating against abortions in statehouses , federal hearings , and court rooms . But in 2013 , ACOG ended all such internal special interest groups , and AAPLOG spun into an independent organization that now includes some 5,700 health care professionals as members . ( While AAPLOG claims to have doubled its membership over the past several years , it is still small compared to ACOG , which has more than 60,000 members . )
A 2018 report by NARAL calls out AAPLOG as part of an “ anti-choice movement [ that ] has recognized that research plays a critical role in framing the national conversation about abortion and has thus invested heavily in giving pseudoscience and other intentionally misleading content the veneer of respectability. ” It specifically cites the work of AAPLOG in “ pushing false claims that Plan B emergency contraception causes abortion ( though the medical community has overwhelmingly disproven that myth ) . ” ( “ AAPLOG unashamedly supports the right of unborn children to have a chance at life and the rights of women to be informed about the harms that abortion causes , ” Francis , the organization ’ s board chair , tells ███ in an email in regard to AAPLOG ’ s scientific objectivity . “ We exist to educate our members and the public on these issues . We are not a PAC and do not have political interests that guide how our organization is run . ” )
The organization has been led since 2013 by an unassuming executive director , Dr. Donna Harrison , a board-certified but nonpracticing OB-GYN who offers up anti-abortion vitriol with an earnest expression and gentle voice . Harrison is perhaps best known publicly for railing against the abortion-inducing pill mifepristone . She ’ s long lobbied the FDA to pull its approval for the drug by touting data about its dangers ; she even wrote an op-ed about it in the New York Times . But Daniel Grossman , director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health ( ANSIRH ) , a leading reproductive health research center , notes that such analysis is often based on incomplete information—for example , pointing to the thousands of women who ’ ve suffered complications from the pill without mentioning the millions who use it . “ Their arguments may sound scientific to a layperson , but they ’ re relying on either poorly done studies or outdated data , ” Grossman says . ( “ Not every research project on the same issue will have the exact same results , ” Francis wrote in an email about varying conclusions in abortion research . )
AAPLOG mobilizes its doctors through what ’ s called the “ Expert Witness Project. ” “ Dozens of AAPLOG members invest tens of thousands of volunteer hours every year to provide policy makers and state and federal judges the medical information they need , ” reads AAPLOG ’ s self-reported profile on the nonprofit database GuideStar , as an “ extension of our concern about the profound , adverse effects of elective abortion. ” AAPLOG also has a mentorship program that connects member doctors to pre-meds and residents to offer a “ critical opportunity for students to hear a medical professional pro-life perspective , reinforcing and informing their personal beliefs and perspectives . ”
“ Their arguments may sound scientific to a layperson , but they ’ re relying on either poorly done studies or outdated data . ”
AAPLOG further pushes its science-backed campaign through research and publishing , notably in the peer-reviewed medical journal Issues in Law & Medicine and by the Watson Bowes Research Institute , which co-publishes the journal . Yet Watson Bowes , Issues in Law & Medicine , and AAPLOG operate in a complicated and sometimes-obscured web of co-dependence . The institute , which advocates anti-abortion ( and anti-vaccine ) science based on questionable data and provides grants for research into “ life issues , ” publishes studies , legal reviews , and think pieces in Issues in Law & Medicine without disclosing they are essentially the same entity . The Watson Bowes website doesn ’ t mention it , but tax filings indicate it is “ located within AAPLOG. ” The business is registered to Harrison , who is also the associate editor of the journal , and half the listed directors and officers of Watson Bowes are AAPLOG board members . Christina Francis , AAPLOG ’ s board chair , is Watson Bowes ’ president .
Issues in Law & Medicine is not a mainstream journal , but it has been cited in more than 1,100 law review articles and in at least 14 state and federal courts of appeal opinions , including two US Supreme Court and seven state supreme court rulings , according to its website . Justice Clarence Thomas cited Issues in Law & Medicine in his dissent when the Supreme Court ruled in 2000 that a Nebraska statute banning “ partial birth abortion ” without medical exception was unconstitutional . And in 2018 , according to a report in Newsweek , Idaho used research published in Issues in Law & Medicine as a basis for passing laws requiring doctors to tell patients an abortion could be reversed . ( Abortion reversal , a widely criticized idea , is the brainchild of Dr. George Delgado , an AAPLOG board member . )
In a revealing example of how pseudoscience bounces around this opaque AAPLOG bubble , and how it gains outside legitimacy , in May 2019 AAPLOG touted new research that supported the “ benefits of carrying a pregnancy to full-term ” and bolstered the organization ’ s claim that abortion causes mental health problems . The study ’ s results , based solely on experiments done in rats , was published in the peer-reviewed journal Frontiers in Neuroscience . The end of the study disclosed that the research was funded by the Watson Bowes Research Institute ( though it noted the “ funders had no role ” in conducting the study ) . AAPLOG did not disclose its connection when it touted the results in a press release .
This is the very kind of research that helps keep abortion restrictions in place ; at least eight states require health care providers to warn women considering abortion about potential psychological effects , even though the American Psychological Association has determined that “ abortion does not increase a woman ’ s risk for depression , anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder . ”
Similar arguments from AAPLOG popped up again last summer , in an ongoing legal battle over a 24-hour abortion waiting period law in Florida . Studies show that waiting periods can increase medical risks and prevent women from obtaining abortions , and a judge eventually deemed the law unconstitutional . But , in August , an appeals court decided the judge had erred , citing an amicus brief submitted by AAPLOG , which offered research to show that the waiting period is valid and in keeping with other procedures . As a result , the appeals judge wrote in his decision , “ The State produced conflicting evidence from medical experts that the absence of such a decision-period after receiving information about the nature and risks of an abortion procedure and the procedure itself falls below the accepted medical standard of care. ” Though the 24-hour waiting period is still currently on hold , the case will now return to court for a full trial and its implementation will be reconsidered .
“ Science is one of the main things that people trust and that people base decisions on , ” English says . “ If you wrongly convince women that they ’ re risking depression or cancer or putting their future children they may want to have at risk , you ’ re adding that on top of the amount of cultural and religious blaming that also exists . ”
“ Almost every pro-life endeavor I ’ ve ever had , AAPLOG probably had some type of involvement because of their professional materials , because of the reliability of their data , ” says former Rep. Trent Franks ( R-Ariz. ) , who resigned from Congress in 2017 amid a sexual harassment investigation , in a promotional video for AAPLOG . “ It gives us the ammunition that we need . ”
Of course , this deep connection to policymakers is by design—and AAPLOG ’ s opportunities to shape the law have only expanded since Trump took office . Just one day after Trump ’ s election , for instance , AAPLOG notified its members that it was “ submitting a list of qualified pro-life physicians willing and able to serve the new administration , ” according to Rewire.News . ( “ Our work , and its impact , flourish regardless of who holds elected office , ” Francis wrote in an email . “ This is nonpartisan . ” )
AAPLOG ’ s power is clear in the “ conscience ” rule from the Department of Health and Human Services , which would make it easier for health care providers to refuse care for religious reasons but has been blocked by the courts . Back in 2009 , AAPLOG wrote to Obama ’ s HHS , objecting to the administration ’ s proposal to rescind a sweeping Bush-era rule that allowed health care workers to refuse patients ’ treatment they found morally or religiously unacceptable . “ Like pro‐life physicians generally , ” it wrote , “ AAPLOG members overwhelmingly would leave the medical profession – or relocate to a more conscience‐friendly jurisdiction – before they would accept coercion to participate or assist in procedures that violate their consciences. ” Its requests were ignored . Ten years later , when the Trump administration considered the issue , this statement ended up verbatim in the final text of the HHS rule allowing such carveouts .
“ Almost every pro-life endeavor I ’ ve ever had , AAPLOG probably had some type of involvement . ”
Harrison , AAPLOG ’ s executive director , has herself become a resource for key policymakers and their allies in the past few years . In early 2018 , she was asked to help staff a key HHS position , according to the public records shared with ███ by Equity Forward . In January that year , the policy director for the anti-abortion organization Susan B. Anthony List , Autumn Christensen , asked Harrison for “ confidential help ” finding a deputy assistant secretary for the Office of Population Affairs—the role Diane Foley would fill four months later . Christensen was looking for a “ female candidate ” that could “ strike the careful balance of being strongly pro-life but also willing to carry out the requirements of a family planning program required by law to distribute a ‘ broad range ’ of contraceptive drugs and devices . ”
“ With the right person in place , ” Christensen wrote to Harrison , “ we see strong opportunities to redirect the program away from funding Planned Parenthood and instead toward funding comprehensive women ’ s health centers like Community Health Centers. ” Christensen then forwarded Harrison ’ s “ ideal candidate ” to an HHS official .
( While Foley seems to fit the requirements discussed by Harrison and Christensen , the candidate ’ s name is blacked out in the released records and AAPLOG declined to share with ███ the name of the person it recommended . For its part , an HHS spokesperson denied Foley was the recommended candidate , saying , “ In this case we did not choose the suggested candidate however welcome input from groups in this process . ” )
On Capitol Hill , Harrison has testified in front of several congressional committees—including at an April 2019 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the “ Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act , ” which aims to ban abortions at 20 weeks based on the recently renewed hysteria around infanticide . Harrison was the only medical professional to offer testimony , and it was both extremely graphic and full of falsehoods about so-called fetal pain :
There are small human beings in the womb who are being pulled apart in pieces or having their skin burned off or partially delivered through their mothers ’ vagina and having their brains pierced and sucked out through a suction catheter . The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act will protect unborn children in the United states from being killed in these brutal ways .
Afterward , Republican senators voiced support for the bill , repeatedly referencing Harrison ’ s medical credentials and deferring to her descriptions of procedures .
Trump ’ s tenure has also coincided with a slew of high-profile legislative opportunities for Harrison and AAPLOG outside DC . Just weeks into the administration , AAPLOG sent an email to members encouraging them to volunteer as experts in state litigation , according to Rewire.News , claiming it had “ received requests from over 10 different states to identify physician experts capable of testifying in favor of or in defense of bills and laws protecting unborn human life . ”
Around the same time , the records shared with ███ reveal a Florida state legislator ’ s staff reached out to Harrison to request AAPLOG ’ s help in moving a law forward that would allow patients to sue doctors over an abortion up to a decade after the fact . Harrison called the bill “ brilliant ” and told the lawmaker that AAPLOG members could “ testify regarding the long-term effects of abortion : Preterm Birth , Breast Cancer , Adverse Psychological outcomes of suicide , substance abuse and hospitalizable major depression. ” ( The bill ultimately died three months later . )
Harrison focused again on fetal pain , even taking out a small model of a fetus and a medical clamp to mimic pulling its limbs off one by one .
Two years later , in April 2019 , a Michigan state Senate committee invited both Harrison and a practicing gynecologist representing ACOG to testify at a hearing on legislation that would ban “ dismemberment abortion ” —a politicized term for a specific type of abortion procedure , known commonly as dilation and evacuation , that is typical after the first trimester—and would punish doctors with up to two years in prison . At the hearing , Harrison focused again on fetal pain , even taking out a small model of a fetus and a medical clamp to mimic pulling its limbs off one by one as she gave a play by play of the procedure .
The ACOG doctor responded that much of Harrison ’ s testimony was “ patently false ” and did “ not follow the medical consensus of the board that she is certified by. ” As the ACOG doctor explained , Harrison ’ s testimony was in fact dangerous :
The evidence…says [ dilation and evacuation ] is safer than giving birth , that it is safer than other methods of abortion . It is the safest way to have a second trimester abortion . I also learned about the evidence that is widely accepted by the entire biologic , embryologic , and medical community that fetuses at this gestational age can not feel pain…This is critical health care for women .
Still , at the end of the hearing , the committee chair , a Republican , seemed to give the doctors ’ testimonies equal weight . “ I ’ d like to hear from the American Medical Association , because apparently they ’ re guiding both the doctors that testified today , ” he said .
“ We ’ re seeing state after state put into legislation things with dubious medical reasoning , and that impact will continue to affect patient care going forward , ” Carter from Equity Forward says . “ The more we get away from the idea that there are basic scientific facts and start thinking that anyone can present medical information or scientific information as truth when it is unproven , it is incredibly scary—not only when it comes to reproductive health care , but when it comes to a range of medical procedures going forward . ”
Doctors and women—particularly low-income women and women of color—are already feeling the effects of increasingly restrictive abortion laws that reach well beyond the procedure itself . Grossman from ANSIRH warns that while regulations have long pushed medically unnecessary provisions—like requiring mandatory ultrasounds or forced waiting periods , both of which AAPLOG supports—there has been a recent shift in how far anti-abortion activists are willing to go .
As an example , Grossman points to a spate of legislation from the past few years that mandates women be told they have the option of an “ abortion pill reversal. ” This is another medically dubious procedure that is advocated by AAPLOG ; late last year , researchers attempting to determine whether abortion pill reversal is safe had to halt their work when women in the study were hospitalized because of dangerous hemorrhaging . Still , a Michigan lawmaker introduced legislation in January that would force doctors to present abortion pill reversal as a legitimate option for patients . In an even more extreme example , this year Ohio lawmakers considered a bill that goes as far as mandating physicians attempt to re-implant ectopic pregnancies or face “ abortion murder ” charges . An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg becomes stuck in a woman ’ s fallopian tube . If unaddressed surgically , the tube could potentially rupture , leading to massive infection and possibly death . Re-implanting the embryo is currently impossible . This is a procedure that even AAPLOG deems unfeasible , though one presentation on its 2020 conference lineup said it would discuss research to study the possibility using animals .
And that is perhaps what is most troublesome about the growing power of AAPLOG : Patients trust their doctors to give unbiased medical advice , but that may not be the reality .
While ACOG declined to comment on the record about AAPLOG , Vanessa Wellbery , a senior state legislation manager for ACOG , reflected darkly on the broader landscape . “ In the past decade alone , states have used medically inaccurate claims to implement hundreds of statutes and regulations that undermine evidence-based practice , impose barriers to care on women , and compromise the patient-provider relationship , ” she says . “ I have seen a dramatic increase in restrictions that would impose professional , civil and even criminal penalties on physicians for providing safe , high-quality abortion care to their patients . ”
And that is perhaps what is most troublesome about the growing power of AAPLOG : Patients trust their doctors to give unbiased medical advice , but that may not be the reality . Nothing requires doctors to disclose their membership in an organization like AAPLOG . This could result in women getting incomplete or false information and potentially resorting to unsafe abortion methods . Without access to abortions and unbiased medical care , a woman ’ s literal freedom could be at risk .
Consider the case of Purvi Patel , who was sentenced in 2015 to 20 years in prison for what she says was a miscarriage . Patel was a thirtysomething woman living with her conservative Indian immigrant family in Indiana when she became pregnant . She kept it a secret . When Patel showed up at a hospital bleeding , doctors found a protruding umbilical cord . While Patel initially said the baby had been stillborn , the on-call doctor suspected a live birth and abandoned child , and he called the police . Patel eventually admitted to leaving the fetus in a shopping mall dumpster , and the doctor left his patient at the hospital to join the police search and examine the recovered fetus . He turned out to be a member of AAPLOG . At Patel ’ s trial , the doctor would estimate the fetus was about 30 weeks—the highest gestational age estimate from witnesses in the trial and a key factor in the case . ( One other doctor agreed with that assessment . ) The jury found Patel guilty of feticide and child neglect .
Though Patel was released in 2016 after an appeals court ruled the feticide law wasn ’ t meant to be applied to self-induced abortions , states like Georgia have passed increasingly punitive abortion bans for doctors and patients .
“ Women have been criminalized in the United States , so there ’ s every reason that this could happen , ” says Jen Gunter , a prominent gynecologist and women ’ s health writer . “ There are a zillion situations that could conspire to make you be ambivalent about your pregnancy . What if you had confided in your doctor ? And what if four weeks later you show up with a miscarriage and he decides to report you and the district attorney wants to make a name for himself ? I don ’ t know . I don ’ t want to be an alarmist , but it ’ s happened . ”
It ’ s no exaggeration to say the future of women ’ s reproductive freedom will come down to November . No matter how the Supreme Court rules in the June Medical case , the current reach of AAPLOG drives home just how much who is in power ultimately matters .
“ What if you had confided in your doctor ? And what if four weeks later you show up with a miscarriage and he decides to report you and the district attorney wants to make a name for himself ? ”
“ Anti-choice politicians , from state legislatures to Congress to the White House , are working to take away people ’ s reproductive freedom and push access to reproductive health care out of reach , ” says Amanda Thayer , deputy national communications director for NARAL Pro-Choice America , “ and they ’ re joined by anti-choice extremists masquerading as objective medical providers to drive this ideological and harmful crusade . ”
In 2019 alone , an unprecedented 25 abortion bans were signed into law across the country , not to mention the wave of other restrictions on the procedure . The president has appointed more than 185 federal judges , many with anti-abortion records . And Foley , for her part , has in just two years made significant headway in helping to reshape the face of reproductive care in America . After the Title X rule change that shut out Planned Parenthood , HHS awarded Obria , a chain of crisis pregnancy centers , a $ 5.1 million grant through the program . As ███ reported in an investigation earlier this year , the clinic got another $ 500,000 through Foley ’ s teen pregnancy prevention program to provide “ sexual risk avoidance ” classes . Meanwhile , HHS has been promoting so-called natural family planning as a pregnancy prevention method , and it rewrote the criteria for Title X grants to prioritize clinics that push fertility awareness-based methods and abstinence .
“ Misusing science does harm to women and does harm to science and does harm to the truth , ” English says . “ Women will listen to authorities , and if there ’ s something that is presented to them as scientific and it isn ’ t , they may make an extremely important life decision based on a false understanding . ”","For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis and more, subscribe to Mother Jones' newsletters

In April 2019, when meetings like this still took place, Diane Foley took the stage in Indianapolis, looking out into the faces of anti-choice advocates and doctors who were gathered for their annual conference. The Health and Human Services official began her presentation: “Opportunities for Collaborative Engagement in Policy Development.” The bland, policy-wonkish title belied its almost-revolutionary substance: nothing less than a major shift in American health care—and a threat to the more than 4 million primarily low-income people who rely on a key government program for family planning and other care.

Title X, which Foley oversees as the head of the Office of Population Affairs—and which also includes the government’s teen pregnancy program—offers health care providers more than $286 million in funding each year. Just a month before her presentation, a new rule passed that would, for the first time, prohibit Title X recipients from performing abortions on-site or even providing abortion referrals. This effectively shut out a quarter of all clinics that were getting funding—including Planned Parenthood, which has traditionally received some $60 million a year from the program and provides more than 2.4 million patients with a slew of services, from birth control to cancer screenings to wellness exams.

The rule also opened the door for money to flow to anti-abortion health providers—just like those gathered for Foley’s presentation. Her panel was part of the three-day summit hosted by the American Association of Pro-life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), a nonprofit that brings together reproductive health care professionals who oppose abortion. A pediatrician by training, Foley has been a prominent anti-abortion advocate and has in the past been affiliated with the partner organization that puts on the conference, the American College of Pediatricians, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated an extremist hate group for pushing anti-LGBTQ views, like linking homosexuality to pedophilia.

Foley has said, “It could be considered ‘sexually harassing’ to demonstrate condom use to a class with, say, a banana.” She has even reportedly compared abortion to the Holocaust.

In fact, Foley has spent her career supporting and amplifying the kind of fringe science that was front and center at the gathering. (Other presentations focused on so-called fetal pain and “how secular biotechnology will impact…the Catholic healthcare system”; another was titled “Jewish & Pro-life? Oy Vey!!”) Before joining HHS, Foley headed Life Network, a Christian anti-abortion group that offers abstinence-only sex education and runs two Colorado crisis pregnancy centers, which are pro-life facilities that counsel women against getting abortions. Foley herself has said, “It could be considered ‘sexually harassing’ to demonstrate condom use to a class with, say, a banana,” according to a 2010 Colorado Springs Independent report. She has even reportedly compared abortion to the Holocaust and slavery, and she has claimed it causes mental illness.

For the past couple of years, she’s brought those views to bear on official policymaking and has become a partner for AAPLOG within the Trump administration. Public records shared with Mother Jones by the pro-choice watchdog group Equity Forward reveal frequent emails and phone calls between Foley and the head of AAPLOG, Donna Harrison. Harrison has written to Foley to share scientifically suspect anti-abortion research, as well as her concerns that health clinics might be able to get around the new Title X rule by dispensing medication abortion to be taken at home rather than on site. “The hair splitting becomes important in defending the Title X regs,” Harrison wrote Foley in April 2019; in response, Foley reassured Harrison that both medical and surgical abortion would be barred. In another conversation from August 2018, Foley asked Harrison to recommend AAPLOG experts on fertility awareness-based pregnancy prevention—the widely debunked “rhythm method,” for example.

This work with Foley is just one way the organization has wielded its influence in recent years. The nearly 50-year-old group may be still relatively unknown to the broader public, flying under the radar as an innocuous-sounding medical association, but the Trump era has opened the door for it to exert significant new powers: intermingling with key Trump personnel in charge of health policy, influencing administration staffing, and playing a major role in shaping the recent explosion of state-level anti-abortion legislation. AAPLOG doctors act as expert witnesses in state and federal legislative hearings and provide lawmakers with scientifically questionable claims to support abortion bans, mandatory ultrasounds, and abortion waiting periods. And then, when those laws are challenged in court, AAPLOG officials and doctors testify and submit amicus briefs on behalf of their cause. “We’re seeing [abortion opponents] take advantage of this moment,” explains Mary Alice Carter, a senior adviser at Equity Forward.

And this moment might be the culmination of much of their hard work. Just as abortion bans that capitalized on the coronavirus pandemic wind down—which AAPLOG worked to institute in at least one state—the Supreme Court is poised to rule imminently on June Medical Services v. Russo, a case that pro-choice advocates fear, and anti-abortion activists hope, has the power to gut Roe v. Wade. AAPLOG has been vocal in rallying behind the defendants in the case; in December, it filed an amicus brief on behalf of the Louisiana law that requires abortion providers have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, and in March, AAPLOG board chair Dr. Christina Francis wrote in the Wall Street Journal that “every second counts in an obstetric emergency….That’s why it’s essential that anyone performing an abortion have the ability to admit a patient to a nearby hospital—preferably one closer than 30 miles away.” Despite cloaking her argument in medical expertise, she declined to mention that complications from abortion are rare, few women need hospital care, and women can be seen in an emergency even if their doctor lacks such privileges.

While AAPLOG’s positions have been dismissed by many in medical and scientific circles, its arguments, like those from Francis, illustrate the organization’s unique role in anti-abortion advocacy, distinct from anti-choice groups who stake their opposition on moral grounds. This war is being waged over the science. “It does feel different when you are calling into question long-standing understandings about how health care works,” Carter adds. “[AAPLOG] poses a different threat because they have that medical stamp behind them.” (Mother Jones requested comment from AAPLOG on a list of questions on three occasions; AAPLOG did not return comment on the third list of questions about its scientific research, its congressional testimony, and its relationship with the Trump administration, among other issues.)

“We’re in a research or science vacuum where this is concerned.”

“Abortion has been legal in the United States since 1973, and we know that it’s very safe, and very, very few women have significant complications related to abortion,” says Alina Salganicoff, director of women’s health policy at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. “It’s certainly within [doctors’] rights to have objections to abortions, but to say that is unsafe and there are risks, when research finds that there are none, really raises a lot of questions.”

Even before the coronavirus pandemic, with its accompanying allegations of inflated death tolls and the suggestion of bleach as treatment, we’ve been living in an era of “alternative facts”—and, pandemic or no, this fight will continue to play out in the abortion debate with increasingly high stakes. “We’re in a research or science vacuum where this is concerned,” Salganicoff observes. “Abortion has some parallels to climate science. Everybody is like, ‘Based on my conclusions, these are the facts.’”

The impact is not simply theoretical. When AAPLOG and its ideological peers argue emergency contraception and IUDs are abortifacients, that life begins at the moment of fertilization, and that there is a “symbiotic relationship among pornography, sex-trafficking and abortion”—and lawmakers, federal officials, and judges believe it, or at least hide behind it—it’s ultimately patients and their families who will suffer.

The ways in which AAPLOG twists medical science to restrict a woman’s freedom are part of a long history of women’s health being used as a justification for women’s oppression. Periods were once an illness necessitating seclusion; working outside the home increased women’s risk of coronary heart disease; a woman’s raging hormones made her unfit to be president. “The man on the street might have said the same thing, but the experts said it with the solemn and intimidating authority of science to back them up,” Barbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre English wrote in the 2005 re-release of their book For Her Own Good: Two Centuries of the Experts’ Advice to Women. (Both Ehrenreich and English have connections to Mother Jones, the former as a prior board member and contributing editor, the latter as a previous editor-in-chief.)

“The role of doctor was monopolized by men at a time before women had any rights at all,” English says in an interview. The medical profession “acted to control women’s choices and to force women to conform to patriarchal structures that were in place at that time. It had nothing to do with science.” Midwives, in fact, oversaw most births until the rise of gynecology in the 1600s—which, English notes, coincided with the invention of forceps. The now-common gynecological tool was kept as a closely guarded secret by the male inventors and eventually other men assisting in childbirth to control the process and dominate the profession.

Even as women’s rights and the medical field have evolved, the negative repercussions of decades of discrimination still linger, and the regulation of abortion is undeniably connected to this history. “Controlling childbirth, controlling women’s reproductive activity is one of the important foundations of patriarchy,” English says. “Sexuality and reproduction: If you can control those two things you have women under control.”

“Sexuality and reproduction: If you can control those two things you have women under control.”

Over time, anti-abortion groups similarly recognized the power of the scientific argument.

AAPLOG has its roots in the preeminent association for women’s health workers, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), which has advocated for women’s health and its providers since 1951. Around the time Roe was decided in 1973, ACOG changed its policy to be more supportive of abortion access and a woman’s right to choose. In protest, a small subset of doctors formed a special interest group within the larger organization, meeting annually for four decades and advocating against abortions in statehouses, federal hearings, and court rooms. But in 2013, ACOG ended all such internal special interest groups, and AAPLOG spun into an independent organization that now includes some 5,700 health care professionals as members. (While AAPLOG claims to have doubled its membership over the past several years, it is still small compared to ACOG, which has more than 60,000 members.)

A 2018 report by NARAL calls out AAPLOG as part of an “anti-choice movement [that] has recognized that research plays a critical role in framing the national conversation about abortion and has thus invested heavily in giving pseudoscience and other intentionally misleading content the veneer of respectability.” It specifically cites the work of AAPLOG in “pushing false claims that Plan B emergency contraception causes abortion (though the medical community has overwhelmingly disproven that myth).” (“AAPLOG unashamedly supports the right of unborn children to have a chance at life and the rights of women to be informed about the harms that abortion causes,” Francis, the organization’s board chair, tells Mother Jones in an email in regard to AAPLOG’s scientific objectivity. “We exist to educate our members and the public on these issues. We are not a PAC and do not have political interests that guide how our organization is run.”)

The organization has been led since 2013 by an unassuming executive director, Dr. Donna Harrison, a board-certified but nonpracticing OB-GYN who offers up anti-abortion vitriol with an earnest expression and gentle voice. Harrison is perhaps best known publicly for railing against the abortion-inducing pill mifepristone. She’s long lobbied the FDA to pull its approval for the drug by touting data about its dangers; she even wrote an op-ed about it in the New York Times. But Daniel Grossman, director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH), a leading reproductive health research center, notes that such analysis is often based on incomplete information—for example, pointing to the thousands of women who’ve suffered complications from the pill without mentioning the millions who use it. “Their arguments may sound scientific to a layperson, but they’re relying on either poorly done studies or outdated data,” Grossman says. (“Not every research project on the same issue will have the exact same results,” Francis wrote in an email about varying conclusions in abortion research.)

AAPLOG mobilizes its doctors through what’s called the “Expert Witness Project.” “Dozens of AAPLOG members invest tens of thousands of volunteer hours every year to provide policy makers and state and federal judges the medical information they need,” reads AAPLOG’s self-reported profile on the nonprofit database GuideStar, as an “extension of our concern about the profound, adverse effects of elective abortion.” AAPLOG also has a mentorship program that connects member doctors to pre-meds and residents to offer a “critical opportunity for students to hear a medical professional pro-life perspective, reinforcing and informing their personal beliefs and perspectives.”

“Their arguments may sound scientific to a layperson, but they’re relying on either poorly done studies or outdated data.”

AAPLOG further pushes its science-backed campaign through research and publishing, notably in the peer-reviewed medical journal Issues in Law & Medicine and by the Watson Bowes Research Institute, which co-publishes the journal. Yet Watson Bowes, Issues in Law & Medicine, and AAPLOG operate in a complicated and sometimes-obscured web of co-dependence. The institute, which advocates anti-abortion (and anti-vaccine) science based on questionable data and provides grants for research into “life issues,” publishes studies, legal reviews, and think pieces in Issues in Law & Medicine without disclosing they are essentially the same entity. The Watson Bowes website doesn’t mention it, but tax filings indicate it is “located within AAPLOG.” The business is registered to Harrison, who is also the associate editor of the journal, and half the listed directors and officers of Watson Bowes are AAPLOG board members. Christina Francis, AAPLOG’s board chair, is Watson Bowes’ president.

Issues in Law & Medicine is not a mainstream journal, but it has been cited in more than 1,100 law review articles and in at least 14 state and federal courts of appeal opinions, including two US Supreme Court and seven state supreme court rulings, according to its website. Justice Clarence Thomas cited Issues in Law & Medicine in his dissent when the Supreme Court ruled in 2000 that a Nebraska statute banning “partial birth abortion” without medical exception was unconstitutional. And in 2018, according to a report in Newsweek, Idaho used research published in Issues in Law & Medicine as a basis for passing laws requiring doctors to tell patients an abortion could be reversed. (Abortion reversal, a widely criticized idea, is the brainchild of Dr. George Delgado, an AAPLOG board member.)

In a revealing example of how pseudoscience bounces around this opaque AAPLOG bubble, and how it gains outside legitimacy, in May 2019 AAPLOG touted new research that supported the “benefits of carrying a pregnancy to full-term” and bolstered the organization’s claim that abortion causes mental health problems. The study’s results, based solely on experiments done in rats, was published in the peer-reviewed journal Frontiers in Neuroscience. The end of the study disclosed that the research was funded by the Watson Bowes Research Institute (though it noted the “funders had no role” in conducting the study). AAPLOG did not disclose its connection when it touted the results in a press release.

This is the very kind of research that helps keep abortion restrictions in place; at least eight states require health care providers to warn women considering abortion about potential psychological effects, even though the American Psychological Association has determined that “abortion does not increase a woman’s risk for depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder.”

Similar arguments from AAPLOG popped up again last summer, in an ongoing legal battle over a 24-hour abortion waiting period law in Florida. Studies show that waiting periods can increase medical risks and prevent women from obtaining abortions, and a judge eventually deemed the law unconstitutional. But, in August, an appeals court decided the judge had erred, citing an amicus brief submitted by AAPLOG, which offered research to show that the waiting period is valid and in keeping with other procedures. As a result, the appeals judge wrote in his decision, “The State produced conflicting evidence from medical experts that the absence of such a decision-period after receiving information about the nature and risks of an abortion procedure and the procedure itself falls below the accepted medical standard of care.” Though the 24-hour waiting period is still currently on hold, the case will now return to court for a full trial and its implementation will be reconsidered.

“Science is one of the main things that people trust and that people base decisions on,” English says. “If you wrongly convince women that they’re risking depression or cancer or putting their future children they may want to have at risk, you’re adding that on top of the amount of cultural and religious blaming that also exists.”

“Almost every pro-life endeavor I’ve ever had, AAPLOG probably had some type of involvement because of their professional materials, because of the reliability of their data,” says former Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), who resigned from Congress in 2017 amid a sexual harassment investigation, in a promotional video for AAPLOG. “It gives us the ammunition that we need.”

Of course, this deep connection to policymakers is by design—and AAPLOG’s opportunities to shape the law have only expanded since Trump took office. Just one day after Trump’s election, for instance, AAPLOG notified its members that it was “submitting a list of qualified pro-life physicians willing and able to serve the new administration,” according to Rewire.News. (“Our work, and its impact, flourish regardless of who holds elected office,” Francis wrote in an email. “This is nonpartisan.”)

AAPLOG’s power is clear in the “conscience” rule from the Department of Health and Human Services, which would make it easier for health care providers to refuse care for religious reasons but has been blocked by the courts. Back in 2009, AAPLOG wrote to Obama’s HHS, objecting to the administration’s proposal to rescind a sweeping Bush-era rule that allowed health care workers to refuse patients’ treatment they found morally or religiously unacceptable. “Like pro‐life physicians generally,” it wrote, “AAPLOG members overwhelmingly would leave the medical profession – or relocate to a more conscience‐friendly jurisdiction – before they would accept coercion to participate or assist in procedures that violate their consciences.” Its requests were ignored. Ten years later, when the Trump administration considered the issue, this statement ended up verbatim in the final text of the HHS rule allowing such carveouts.

“Almost every pro-life endeavor I’ve ever had, AAPLOG probably had some type of involvement.”

Harrison, AAPLOG’s executive director, has herself become a resource for key policymakers and their allies in the past few years. In early 2018, she was asked to help staff a key HHS position, according to the public records shared with Mother Jones by Equity Forward. In January that year, the policy director for the anti-abortion organization Susan B. Anthony List, Autumn Christensen, asked Harrison for “confidential help” finding a deputy assistant secretary for the Office of Population Affairs—the role Diane Foley would fill four months later. Christensen was looking for a “female candidate” that could “strike the careful balance of being strongly pro-life but also willing to carry out the requirements of a family planning program required by law to distribute a ‘broad range’ of contraceptive drugs and devices.”

“With the right person in place,” Christensen wrote to Harrison, “we see strong opportunities to redirect the program away from funding Planned Parenthood and instead toward funding comprehensive women’s health centers like Community Health Centers.” Christensen then forwarded Harrison’s “ideal candidate” to an HHS official.

(While Foley seems to fit the requirements discussed by Harrison and Christensen, the candidate’s name is blacked out in the released records and AAPLOG declined to share with Mother Jones the name of the person it recommended. For its part, an HHS spokesperson denied Foley was the recommended candidate, saying, “In this case we did not choose the suggested candidate however welcome input from groups in this process.”)

On Capitol Hill, Harrison has testified in front of several congressional committees—including at an April 2019 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the “Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,” which aims to ban abortions at 20 weeks based on the recently renewed hysteria around infanticide. Harrison was the only medical professional to offer testimony, and it was both extremely graphic and full of falsehoods about so-called fetal pain:

There are small human beings in the womb who are being pulled apart in pieces or having their skin burned off or partially delivered through their mothers’ vagina and having their brains pierced and sucked out through a suction catheter. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act will protect unborn children in the United states from being killed in these brutal ways.

Afterward, Republican senators voiced support for the bill, repeatedly referencing Harrison’s medical credentials and deferring to her descriptions of procedures.

Trump’s tenure has also coincided with a slew of high-profile legislative opportunities for Harrison and AAPLOG outside DC. Just weeks into the administration, AAPLOG sent an email to members encouraging them to volunteer as experts in state litigation, according to Rewire.News, claiming it had “received requests from over 10 different states to identify physician experts capable of testifying in favor of or in defense of bills and laws protecting unborn human life.”

Around the same time, the records shared with Mother Jones reveal a Florida state legislator’s staff reached out to Harrison to request AAPLOG’s help in moving a law forward that would allow patients to sue doctors over an abortion up to a decade after the fact. Harrison called the bill “brilliant” and told the lawmaker that AAPLOG members could “testify regarding the long-term effects of abortion: Preterm Birth, Breast Cancer, Adverse Psychological outcomes of suicide, substance abuse and hospitalizable major depression.” (The bill ultimately died three months later.)

Harrison focused again on fetal pain, even taking out a small model of a fetus and a medical clamp to mimic pulling its limbs off one by one.

Two years later, in April 2019, a Michigan state Senate committee invited both Harrison and a practicing gynecologist representing ACOG to testify at a hearing on legislation that would ban “dismemberment abortion”—a politicized term for a specific type of abortion procedure, known commonly as dilation and evacuation, that is typical after the first trimester—and would punish doctors with up to two years in prison. At the hearing, Harrison focused again on fetal pain, even taking out a small model of a fetus and a medical clamp to mimic pulling its limbs off one by one as she gave a play by play of the procedure.

The ACOG doctor responded that much of Harrison’s testimony was “patently false” and did “not follow the medical consensus of the board that she is certified by.” As the ACOG doctor explained, Harrison’s testimony was in fact dangerous:

The evidence…says [dilation and evacuation] is safer than giving birth, that it is safer than other methods of abortion. It is the safest way to have a second trimester abortion. I also learned about the evidence that is widely accepted by the entire biologic, embryologic, and medical community that fetuses at this gestational age cannot feel pain…This is critical health care for women.

Still, at the end of the hearing, the committee chair, a Republican, seemed to give the doctors’ testimonies equal weight. “I’d like to hear from the American Medical Association, because apparently they’re guiding both the doctors that testified today,” he said.

“We’re seeing state after state put into legislation things with dubious medical reasoning, and that impact will continue to affect patient care going forward,” Carter from Equity Forward says. “The more we get away from the idea that there are basic scientific facts and start thinking that anyone can present medical information or scientific information as truth when it is unproven, it is incredibly scary—not only when it comes to reproductive health care, but when it comes to a range of medical procedures going forward.”

Doctors and women—particularly low-income women and women of color—are already feeling the effects of increasingly restrictive abortion laws that reach well beyond the procedure itself. Grossman from ANSIRH warns that while regulations have long pushed medically unnecessary provisions—like requiring mandatory ultrasounds or forced waiting periods, both of which AAPLOG supports—there has been a recent shift in how far anti-abortion activists are willing to go.

As an example, Grossman points to a spate of legislation from the past few years that mandates women be told they have the option of an “abortion pill reversal.” This is another medically dubious procedure that is advocated by AAPLOG; late last year, researchers attempting to determine whether abortion pill reversal is safe had to halt their work when women in the study were hospitalized because of dangerous hemorrhaging. Still, a Michigan lawmaker introduced legislation in January that would force doctors to present abortion pill reversal as a legitimate option for patients. In an even more extreme example, this year Ohio lawmakers considered a bill that goes as far as mandating physicians attempt to re-implant ectopic pregnancies or face “abortion murder” charges. An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg becomes stuck in a woman’s fallopian tube. If unaddressed surgically, the tube could potentially rupture, leading to massive infection and possibly death. Re-implanting the embryo is currently impossible. This is a procedure that even AAPLOG deems unfeasible, though one presentation on its 2020 conference lineup said it would discuss research to study the possibility using animals.

And that is perhaps what is most troublesome about the growing power of AAPLOG: Patients trust their doctors to give unbiased medical advice, but that may not be the reality.

While ACOG declined to comment on the record about AAPLOG, Vanessa Wellbery, a senior state legislation manager for ACOG, reflected darkly on the broader landscape. “In the past decade alone, states have used medically inaccurate claims to implement hundreds of statutes and regulations that undermine evidence-based practice, impose barriers to care on women, and compromise the patient-provider relationship,” she says. “I have seen a dramatic increase in restrictions that would impose professional, civil and even criminal penalties on physicians for providing safe, high-quality abortion care to their patients.”

And that is perhaps what is most troublesome about the growing power of AAPLOG: Patients trust their doctors to give unbiased medical advice, but that may not be the reality. Nothing requires doctors to disclose their membership in an organization like AAPLOG. This could result in women getting incomplete or false information and potentially resorting to unsafe abortion methods. Without access to abortions and unbiased medical care, a woman’s literal freedom could be at risk.

Consider the case of Purvi Patel, who was sentenced in 2015 to 20 years in prison for what she says was a miscarriage. Patel was a thirtysomething woman living with her conservative Indian immigrant family in Indiana when she became pregnant. She kept it a secret. When Patel showed up at a hospital bleeding, doctors found a protruding umbilical cord. While Patel initially said the baby had been stillborn, the on-call doctor suspected a live birth and abandoned child, and he called the police. Patel eventually admitted to leaving the fetus in a shopping mall dumpster, and the doctor left his patient at the hospital to join the police search and examine the recovered fetus. He turned out to be a member of AAPLOG. At Patel’s trial, the doctor would estimate the fetus was about 30 weeks—the highest gestational age estimate from witnesses in the trial and a key factor in the case. (One other doctor agreed with that assessment.) The jury found Patel guilty of feticide and child neglect.

Though Patel was released in 2016 after an appeals court ruled the feticide law wasn’t meant to be applied to self-induced abortions, states like Georgia have passed increasingly punitive abortion bans for doctors and patients.

“Women have been criminalized in the United States, so there’s every reason that this could happen,” says Jen Gunter, a prominent gynecologist and women’s health writer. “There are a zillion situations that could conspire to make you be ambivalent about your pregnancy. What if you had confided in your doctor? And what if four weeks later you show up with a miscarriage and he decides to report you and the district attorney wants to make a name for himself? I don’t know. I don’t want to be an alarmist, but it’s happened.”

It’s no exaggeration to say the future of women’s reproductive freedom will come down to November. No matter how the Supreme Court rules in the June Medical case, the current reach of AAPLOG drives home just how much who is in power ultimately matters.

“What if you had confided in your doctor? And what if four weeks later you show up with a miscarriage and he decides to report you and the district attorney wants to make a name for himself?”

“Anti-choice politicians, from state legislatures to Congress to the White House, are working to take away people’s reproductive freedom and push access to reproductive health care out of reach,” says Amanda Thayer, deputy national communications director for NARAL Pro-Choice America, “and they’re joined by anti-choice extremists masquerading as objective medical providers to drive this ideological and harmful crusade.”

In 2019 alone, an unprecedented 25 abortion bans were signed into law across the country, not to mention the wave of other restrictions on the procedure. The president has appointed more than 185 federal judges, many with anti-abortion records. And Foley, for her part, has in just two years made significant headway in helping to reshape the face of reproductive care in America. After the Title X rule change that shut out Planned Parenthood, HHS awarded Obria, a chain of crisis pregnancy centers, a $5.1 million grant through the program. As Mother Jones reported in an investigation earlier this year, the clinic got another $500,000 through Foley’s teen pregnancy prevention program to provide “sexual risk avoidance” classes. Meanwhile, HHS has been promoting so-called natural family planning as a pregnancy prevention method, and it rewrote the criteria for Title X grants to prioritize clinics that push fertility awareness-based methods and abstinence.

“Misusing science does harm to women and does harm to science and does harm to the truth,” English says. “Women will listen to authorities, and if there’s something that is presented to them as scientific and it isn’t, they may make an extremely important life decision based on a false understanding.”",www.motherjones.com,left,QYF6oiTv8oZhLdr9

Alabama has become the latest US state to move to restrict abortions by passing a bill to outlaw the procedure in almost all cases.

The law includes a ban on abortion in cases of rape or incest.

Supporters say they expect the law to be blocked in court but hope that the appeals process will bring it before the Supreme Court.

They want the court, which now has a conservative majority, to overturn the 1973 ruling legalising abortion.

Alabama's 35-seat Senate is dominated by men, and none of its four female senators backed the ban. It was then signed by Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey.

Sixteen other states are seeking to impose new restrictions on abortion.

Earlier this year the Supreme Court blocked implementation of new abortion restrictions in Louisiana. However the ruling was made by a narrow margin and the case is due to be reviewed later this year.

Why is this happening now?

The bill's architects expect that it will be defeated in the lower courts, but hope that it will therefore eventually come before the Supreme Court.

They have been emboldened by the addition of two conservative justices nominated by President Donald Trump, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who give the nine-member court a conservative majority.

Their aim, they say, is for the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade ruling to be undermined or overturned completely.

Alabama's Lieutenant Governor Will Ainsworth said: ""Roe must be challenged, and I am proud that Alabama is leading the way.""

""The judges have changed, a lot of changes over that time, and so I think we're at the point where we need to take a bigger and a bolder step.""

What is in the Alabama bill?

Under the bill, doctors face 10 years in prison for attempting to terminate a pregnancy and 99 years for carrying out the procedure.

A woman who has an abortion would not be held criminally liable, and abortion in cases where the mother's life is at serious risk are allowed.

The state Senate approved the law by 25 votes to six, rejecting exemptions for cases of rape or incest, with some noting all those voting for the bill were men.

Democrats here in Alabama knew they had no chance of stopping this controversial bill, but that only seemed to make the debate on the senate floor even more heated. Activists packed the senate gallery to watch the drama play out - reacting with laughter and gasps in turn.

The few women who spoke on the floor were quick to highlight a key fact: this decision about women's bodies was being made almost entirely by men.

As one female lawmaker introduced a sure-to-fail amendment to the bill to make it illegal for men to get vasectomies, the gallery and overflow watch room upstairs burst into laughter.

On the senate floor, when the amendment failed, the lawmaker made her point, saying: We have never policed men's bodies the way we do women's.

Just outside the stark white walls of the state legislature were still more pro-choice advocates, raising signs that called for women's equality, for protecting Planned Parenthood, for men to stay out of women's rights issues.

One exasperated young woman told me: ""We've already had this vote about women before. In the 70s. Why are we here again now?""

What restrictions are other states enacting?

Earlier this year the governors of four states - Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio - signed bills banning abortion if an embryonic heartbeat can be detected.

Opponents say this amounts to a ban on abortion because cardiac activity in an embryo can be detected as early as the sixth week, before a woman may be aware that she is pregnant.

The former vice president 's campaign had said he backed the law , known as the Hyde Amendment , as recently as Wednesday . His decision to throw out his long-held support of the measure came amid mounting backlash from within the Democratic Party and highlights the challenges the old-school liberal faces as the presumed frontrunner for his party 's presidential nomination in 2020 in a primary field , which features a host of progressive candidates .
His reversal was abrupt , particularly since Biden has wrestled for decades with his views on abortion , ascribing his reluctance to his Roman Catholic faith . In a speech at a gala hosted by the Democratic National Committee in Atlanta , the former vice president did not mention the mounting pressure or criticism he has received in recent days , instead crediting the change as part of developing an upcoming comprehensive healthcare proposal .
Biden began his speech by affirming his support for Roe v. Wade , the 1973 Supreme Court decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion , and noted that he , `` like many '' in Congress , supported the Hyde Amendment for years , because he believed women would still have access to the procedure without Medicaid and other federal health grants . Now , he said , the ability to obtain an abortion through other means — Planned Parenthood clinics , for example — is being whittled by Republicans .
`` I ca n't justify leaving millions of women without access to the care they need and the ability to . . . exercise their constitutionally-protected right , '' Biden continued . `` If I believe healthcare is a right , as I do , I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone 's ZIP code .

Biden , who is looking to pitch a centrist approach in an increasingly progressive primary field , explained that the Hyde Amendment is another barrier to abortion access , which disproportionately affects poor women and women of color .
`` I 've been working through the finer details of my health care plan like others in this race , and I 've been struggling with the problems that Hyde now presents , '' he said .
Biden noted that `` circumstances have changed '' and reasoned that the measure stands in the way of his goals `` universal coverage '' and providing `` the full range of services women need . '' He said he made `` no apologies '' for his decades-old support of the policy .
Biden has come under renewed scrutiny for other details of his decades-long political record in the months he announced his presidential campaign . As a senator from Delaware , he led the Judiciary Committee that subjected Anita Hill to aggressive questioning from an all-male , all-white panel when she accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment in 1991 . He has also faced criticism for his efforts to pass the 1994 crime bill , which many Democrats and President Donald Trump say helped contribute to mass incarceration , and supported the Iraq War .
The Hyde Amendment , named for former GOP Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois , was first passed in 1976 and is renewed annually by Congress . It bans federal funding of abortion , allowing exceptions only in cases of rape , incest or when a pregnant person 's life is at serious risk . Reproductive rights advocates have argued the law disproportionately affects women of color and poor women who seek abortions , because it prevents government health programs , such as Medicaid , from paying for abortions in most circumstances .
Biden had been one of only a few Democratic politicians who backed the Hyde Amendment — and his support for the measure marked a sharp split form most of his 2020 competitors , as well as from the Democratic Party 's platform . 2016 marked the first year in which the party amended its presidential platform to explicitly call to repeal the Hyde Amendment , describing it as among the `` federal and state laws and policies that impede a woman 's access to abortion . ''
`` The Democratic Party platform is crystal clear in supporting the right to safe , legal abortion and repealing the Hyde Amendment , a position held by the majority of voters , '' Kelley Robinson , executive director of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund , said in a statement Wednesday in response to Biden 's support for the position . `` Supporting Hyde is n't good policy or politics .

abortion,Daily Beast,0,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/01/pope-tells-priests-forgive-abortion.html,Pope Tells Priests to Forgive Abortion,2015-09-01,Barbie Latza Nadeau,"VATICAN CITY — Just when you think Pope Francis has nothing left up the sleeve of his cassock , he does it again . This time , the popular pontiff has announced that during the Holy Jubilee year beginning this December 8 , priests will have the discretion to forgive penitent Catholic women for having abortions—one of the biggest sins of the Catholic Church .
In what has become classic Francis style , he apparently doesn ’ t care about the political ramifications of offering limited forgiveness for an act on which entire political campaigns are made and unraveled . Instead , he wrote in a letter to the president of the Pontifical Council of New Evangelization that priests ought to look deep to understand what leads a woman to abort her unborn child .
“ The tragedy of abortion is experienced by some with a superficial awareness , as if not realizing the extreme harm that such an act entails , ” said the pope ’ s letter . “ Many others , on the other hand , although experiencing this moment as a defeat , believe that they have no other option . ”
“ I think in particular of all the women who have resorted to abortion , ” Francis said . “ I am well aware of the pressure that has led them to this decision . I know that it is an existential and moral ordeal . I have met so many women who bear in their heart the scar of this agonizing and painful decision . ”
By no means , of course , is the pope or the Catholic Church actually endorsing , condoning or somehow approving the ending of a pregnancy at any point after conception . That will never happen . On the contrary , by allowing Catholic women to be absolved from the sin , rather than automatically excommunicating them , as has been the practice , he ensures that they retain their faith . Or , more to the point , return to the pews .
At a time when more Catholics are leaving the Church than joining , keeping the faithful on the roster is vital . As we have seen time and time again , on issues like divorced and remarried Catholics , unwed parents , those who use birth control , those living in same-sex unions , Francis seems to be sending the same message that Catholics are welcome no matter how flawed they are or , it would seem , what sins they have committed .

While there is no statute of limitations on when the forgiven abortion took place , there is a catch . The offer of forgiveness is for a limited time only , starting when the Holy Jubilee kicks off on December 8 , 2015 and ending November 20 , 2016 .","VATICAN CITY — Just when you think Pope Francis has nothing left up the sleeve of his cassock, he does it again. This time, the popular pontiff has announced that during the Holy Jubilee year beginning this December 8, priests will have the discretion to forgive penitent Catholic women for having abortions—one of the biggest sins of the Catholic Church.

In what has become classic Francis style, he apparently doesn’t care about the political ramifications of offering limited forgiveness for an act on which entire political campaigns are made and unraveled. Instead, he wrote in a letter to the president of the Pontifical Council of New Evangelization that priests ought to look deep to understand what leads a woman to abort her unborn child.

“The tragedy of abortion is experienced by some with a superficial awareness, as if not realizing the extreme harm that such an act entails,” said the pope’s letter. “Many others, on the other hand, although experiencing this moment as a defeat, believe that they have no other option.”

“I think in particular of all the women who have resorted to abortion,” Francis said. “I am well aware of the pressure that has led them to this decision. I know that it is an existential and moral ordeal. I have met so many women who bear in their heart the scar of this agonizing and painful decision.”

By no means, of course, is the pope or the Catholic Church actually endorsing, condoning or somehow approving the ending of a pregnancy at any point after conception. That will never happen. On the contrary, by allowing Catholic women to be absolved from the sin, rather than automatically excommunicating them, as has been the practice, he ensures that they retain their faith. Or, more to the point, return to the pews.

At a time when more Catholics are leaving the Church than joining, keeping the faithful on the roster is vital. As we have seen time and time again, on issues like divorced and remarried Catholics, unwed parents, those who use birth control, those living in same-sex unions, Francis seems to be sending the same message that Catholics are welcome no matter how flawed they are or, it would seem, what sins they have committed. That mercy, above all, has been the key to the pope’s popularity.

Prior to this decree, the only way a woman could be forgiven for having an abortion was to go directly to the chief confessor in her diocese or the equivalent in certain situations. Now, instead of petitioning a higher prelate, any priest anywhere in the world can do this.

“The forgiveness of God cannot be denied to one who has repented, especially when that person approaches the Sacrament of Confession with a sincere heart in order to obtain reconciliation with the Father,” Francis wrote. “For this reason too, I have decided, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to concede to all priests for the Jubilee Year the discretion to absolve of the sin of abortion those who have procured it and who, with contrite heart, seek forgiveness for it.”

Wen attributed her departure to “ philosophical differences over the direction and future of Planned Parenthood , ” she said in a tweet on Tuesday .
She was in the position for less than a year .
“ I believe that the best way to protect abortion care is to be clear that it is not a political issue but a health care one , ” Wen wrote in a statement about her sudden termination .
Shortly after the New York Times broke the news , Wen tweeted she had only just learned of her dismissal and that she and the board had been in the process of “ good faith negotiations about my departure . ”
Planned Parenthood confirmed the news in a press release , announcing that Alexis McGill Johnson , cofounder of the anti-bias research group Perception Institute and Planned Parenthood board member , will temporarily replace Wen until a new president is installed .
Wen and Planned Parenthood were involved in weeks of negotiations around her departure , and the board announced the meeting internally a week ago , according to a source familiar with the matter . Wen was told she could resign , the source said , but she would not .
███ spoke to six sources familiar with Wen ’ s firing , all of whom named significant management issues as part of the board ’ s decision to oust Wen . ███ is granting their requests for anonymity so they could speak openly about the matter . At one point , Planned Parenthood ’ s board hired an executive management coach to improve Wen ’ s relationship with staff , two of the people said .
Wen ’ s departure comes in the midst of an intense uptick in the fight over abortion rights , as states have passed restrictive anti-abortion laws in recent months , including one in Alabama that outlaws abortion almost entirely . One source familiar with the board ’ s thinking said her removal was accelerated by the intensifying battle over abortion rights , saying that she was not the right leader in this climate .
Wen was first appointed as president last September , coming from her job as Baltimore ’ s health commissioner with a high-profile lawsuit against the Trump administration under her belt . She was first and foremost a doctor and her team put an emphasis on her medical credentials , kicking off her presidency with a campaign called “ This Is Healthcare , ” emphasizing Planned Parenthood ’ s role outside of politics , drawing a contrast with her predecessor , former Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards , who had turned the organization into a political powerhouse during her tenure .
As senior political staffers began to depart the organization early this year , Planned Parenthood employees , board members , and supporters were quick to express concern that Wen planned to emphasize the group ’ s status as a health care provider , shifting away from the political focus Richards instilled during her 10 years as president .
Wen `` demonstrated a complete lack of leadership capability at a time when this organization requires an extraordinary leader , ” a former senior staffer at Planned Parenthood said on Tuesday . “ These are the times when people have to look out for what is best for the organization , and this was the best thing for the organization . ”
`` She walked in and hired people in very senior leadership roles who knew nothing about Planned Parenthood , '' the former senior staffer added .
Two other sources familiar with the situation told ███ that the management issues began on Wen ’ s first day as president . One of the sources said Wen was first warned about her behavior about six months ago and that the board had given her specific directives for improvement but that she had seemingly disregarded them entirely .
As Wen began reorganizing Planned Parenthood , staff grew more and more concerned . By the time the group announced its split with Wen on Tuesday , the list of top political staff departures neared the double digits .
A source familiar with the situation told ███ that eventually the board looked up and realized nearly all the staff they knew and trusted were gone .
Deirdre Schifeling , executive director of the organization ’ s political arm , and Wendi Wallace , Planned Parenthood ’ s director of political outreach , both told staff early this year that they would be leaving the organization . Schifeling and Wallace ’ s departures , as described by three operatives familiar with the organization ’ s inner workings who declined to speak on the record , came as a hit to the political infrastructure that Richards had helped build in her decadelong tenure as president .
Under Wen ’ s short tenure , Planned Parenthood ’ s fundraising saw a significant decline without Richards at the helm .
Planned Parenthood repeatedly asserted that it was not changing direction under Wen , and Schifeling and Wallace both said their departures were unrelated to any shift at the organization under her leadership . In response to ███ ’ reporting , Wen insisted in a series of tweets that Planned Parenthood ’ s “ core mission is providing , protecting and expanding access to abortion and reproductive health care '' and that the organization would `` never back down from that fight . ”
During the beginning of Wen ’ s tenure at Planned Parenthood , the staff she brought with her distributed a 182-page handbook on rules and tips for staffing Wen . The “ Special Assistant Guide ” from the Baltimore City Health Department , according to a copy obtained by ███ , details guidelines on timeliness ( “ Nothing can fall through the cracks ” ) , office demeanor ( “ Make sure to frequently look up [ from Twitter ] and make eye contact with Dr. Wen to see if she is trying to communicate urgent information ” ) , language use ( “ Dr . Wen ‘ learns ’ not ‘ hears ’ ” ) . and correspondence ( “ Try not to look at emails more than once . Take care of it then ” ) .
“ The handbook was honestly just the beginning of her management issues , ” the source familiar with the situation said . “ Shit has been crazy , there was a whole system of insanity : a deep mistrust of staff , giving directives that made no sense , saying things that were factually inaccurate , saying one thing then saying something else completely , micromanaging control over what people were allowed to say and not say . ”
When Wen first came on she had no interest in “ the long-term future of abortion access work that had already been going on , saying there was no budget for it , ” the source said , adding that they witnessed staff crying in meetings with her , feeling as if their decades-long expertise was being ignored .
Two sources told ███ that Wen also refused to use “ trans-inclusive ” language , for example saying “ people ” instead of “ women ” and telling staff that she believed talking about transgender issues would “ isolate people in the Midwest. ” For a period of a few months , Wen sometimes went through Planned Parenthood ’ s press releases and documents , deleting the word “ sexual ” from the phrase “ sexual and reproductive health , ” the source said . She also resisted using the word “ abortion ” as a stand-alone term , preferring “ abortion care ” or other phrases entirely .
Wen did not immediately respond to ███ ’ request for comment .
Wen brought in a tight-knit group of people from the Baltimore Department of Health with whom she would constantly have “ secret meetings ” without other staff , two sources said , not seeming to trust anyone else .

Only this time , pro-life groups trod along narrow common ground with the Democratic president they have sparred with for years because of a mandate in his signature health care law that requires most employers to insure a broad spectrum of contraceptive drugs .
U.S. District Court Judge Edward Korman on Friday said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius made an “ obviously political ” decision in 2011 — one year before President Obama ’ s re-election — to prohibit the sale of Plan B One-Step and its generic forms to girls younger than 17 unless they had a prescription .
In a blunt 59-page decision , he ordered the Food and Drug Administration to lift the age restriction within 30 days .
Pro-life groups have railed against the Obama administration for requiring faith-based nonprofits and corporations with religiously devout owners to insure contraception — including morning-after pills — under the Affordable Care Act . Dozens of lawsuits have been filed to contest the mandate , which may be headed for the Supreme Court .
Yet news of Judge Korman ’ s decision to broaden teen girls ’ access to emergency contraception found pro-life groups aligned with the White House — at least for a moment . The Susan B. Anthony List condemned the ruling , noting Mr. Obama and Mrs. Sebelius had “ agreed that requiring a prescription for potentially dangerous drugs is common sense . ”
“ Teen girls need parents , not unfettered access to abortion-inducing drugs , ” SBA President Marjorie Dannenfelser said .
Judge Korman ’ s unfavorable reading of Mrs. Sebelius ‘ actions focused on a 2011 memo to FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg that described “ significant cognitive and behavioral differences ” between older adolescents and girls just entering their reproductive years .
The directive from HHS amounted to an unprecedented override of the FDA , which had supported expanded access to Plan B and its associated drugs . Yet the judge also accused the latter agency of dragging its feet .
“ The FDA has engaged in intolerable delays in processing the petition , ” he wrote . “ Indeed , it could accurately be described as an administrative agency filibuster . ”
HHS referred requests for comment on the ruling to the Department of Justice , although an official said the agency ’ s “ concern always has been and remains the health of young women nationwide . ”
“ The Department of Justice is reviewing the appellate options and expects to act promptly , ” spokeswoman Allison Price said .
The drug ’ s manufacturer , Teva Pharmaceuticals , also said it is reviewing the decision and has no immediate comment .
Yet Judge Korman ’ s decision for the Eastern District of New York reopens debate around a genre of drugs that has been in the political spotlight for years , particularly with the passage of Mr. Obama ’ s health care reforms . Last month , a bloc of House conservatives gathered with religious figures to unveil a bill that would exempt employers from the contraception mandate within “ Obamacare ” if it violates their religious freedoms or conscience .
Opponents of Mr. Obama ’ s mandate take particular exception to emergency drugs such as Plan B and Ella , which they refer to as “ abortifacients ” because of their reported capacity to distort the lining of the uterus .
Judge Korman said controversy around the case was exacerbated by the “ scientifically unsupported speculation that the drug could interfere with implantation of fertilized eggs , ” and because it dealt with access to emergency contraception for “ adolescents who should not be engaging in conduct that necessitates the use of such drugs . ”

But its authors say the recent surge of state laws intended to restrict the procedure is likely not the reason .
Both the abortion rate and the number of abortions ( just under 1.1 million ) fell 13 percent , according to the Guttmacher Institute , the reproductive health think tank that 's been doing the periodic survey of abortion providers since the 1970s . The 2011 abortion rate of 16.9 per 1,000 women ages 15-44 is the lowest since 1973 , the year the Supreme Court legalized abortion nationwide .
The survey also found a continuing increase in the use of medication abortions , as opposed to surgical ones . An estimated 23 percent of all abortions performed outside of hospitals were nonsurgical , the study found — up from 17 percent in 2008 .
But the authors said they found no evidence that the passage of hundreds of state abortion restrictions had any impact on the latest decline . `` While most of the new laws were enacted in states in the Midwest and the South , abortion incidence declined in all regions , '' the study noted .
And some states that are generally supportive of abortion rights , including those allowing Medicaid payment for abortions for poor women , `` experienced declines in their abortion rates comparable to , and sometimes greater than , the national decline , '' the study said . It cited California , New Jersey and New York as examples .
One was the economy , which was in recession or slow recovery during the survey period . Evidence for that comes from the fact that the birthrate also fell — by 9 percent — between 2008 and 2011 , meaning fewer women got pregnant overall .
`` Presumably then , more women and couples were making conscious decisions to avoid pregnancy and so resumed or continued using contraceptives , '' the authors noted . `` This strategy would be expected to have a bigger impact on the rate of intended pregnancies than on the abortion rate , but could also have averted the 5 percent of abortions that followed intended pregnancies . ''
The other likely reason for the abortion decline is the increase in the use of long-acting contraceptives like the IUD , which are much more effective in preventing pregnancy than condoms or other nonprescription methods . Long-acting-method use in publicly funded clinics increased from 4 percent to 11 percent during the study period .
One wild card in the study is a possible increase in the use of the ulcer drug misoprostol to terminate pregnancy . While not approved for use alone ( it is normally used in combination with the approved medication abortion drug Mifepristone ) , an unknown number of women are using it by itself , and it can terminate an early pregnancy .
The study suggests that if more women are turning to off-label misoprostol use to terminate their pregnancies `` outside clinical settings , '' then `` our estimate of the number of abortions is artificially low . ''
Meanwhile , anti-abortion groups are taking exception to the study 's conclusions .
Charmaine Yoest , president and CEO of Americans United for Life , called the report `` an abortion industry propaganda piece short on data and long on strained conclusions , '' noting that all of the reporting of data is voluntary .","Abortions Reportedly Drop To Lowest Rate Since 1970s

Abortions in the U.S. resumed their downward trend between 2008 and 2011, according to a new study. But its authors say the recent surge of state laws intended to restrict the procedure is likely not the reason.

Both the abortion rate and the number of abortions (just under 1.1 million) fell 13 percent, according to the Guttmacher Institute, the reproductive health think tank that's been doing the periodic survey of abortion providers since the 1970s. The 2011 abortion rate of 16.9 per 1,000 women ages 15-44 is the lowest since 1973, the year the Supreme Court legalized abortion nationwide.

It cited California, New Jersey and New York as examples.

The authors suggest two more likely possibilities.

One was the economy, which was in recession or slow recovery during the survey period. Evidence for that comes from the fact that the birthrate also fell — by 9 percent — between 2008 and 2011, meaning fewer women got pregnant overall.

""Presumably then, more women and couples were making conscious decisions to avoid pregnancy and so resumed or continued using contraceptives,"" the authors noted.

The other likely reason for the abortion decline is the increase in the use of long-acting contraceptives like the IUD, which are much more effective in preventing pregnancy than condoms or other nonprescription methods. Long-acting-method use in publicly funded clinics increased from 4 percent to 11 percent during the study period.

One wild card in the study is a possible increase in the use of the ulcer drug misoprostol to terminate pregnancy. While not approved for use alone (it is normally used in combination with the approved medication abortion drug Mifepristone), an unknown number of women are using it by itself, and it can terminate an early pregnancy.

The study suggests that if more women are turning to off-label misoprostol use to terminate their pregnancies ""outside clinical settings,"" then ""our estimate of the number of abortions is artificially low.""

Meanwhile, anti-abortion groups are taking exception to the study's conclusions.

Charmaine Yoest, president and CEO of Americans United for Life, called the report ""an abortion industry propaganda piece short on data and long on strained conclusions,"" noting that all of the reporting of data is voluntary.",www.npr.org,center,1XdnWbztw69z4y6U

One Alabama Doctor reflects on a recent case : “ She was 22 weeks pregnant and had a condition called preeclampsia , which is when high blood pressure puts the health of the mother and baby at risk and can result in death . The only option in that situation was to immediately deliver . The patient understood the high stakes and instead decided to end her pregnancy . But it took time ( which we did not have ) to convince the hospital and other physicians that this was the correct course of action because of the already hostile climate for abortion… “ I fear what could happen to women in this situation if the [ new ] law and its criminal penalties go into effect . Physicians will hesitate in how to care for complex health situations … doctors like me will leave Alabama rather than stay and practice substandard medicine… Alabamans deserve better . We all do. ” Yashica Robinson , CNN
“ Many recent bills ban abortion after 6 weeks - before most women are even aware they are pregnant — and Alabama ’ s law constitutes an outright ban at any stage . But women will always seek out a way to end an unwanted pregnancy — the question is whether they can do so safely . In countries with extreme laws like those passed in Georgia , Ohio and now Alabama , women suffer and die . Georgia , for example , has the highest maternal mortality rate in the nation and you can expect those numbers to increase under a law that creates criminal suspicion around every miscarriage. ” Jon O ’ Brien , The Hill
“ Showing just how far to the right the anti-abortion movement has pushed the ‘ center ’ of the abortion debate , it was the bill ’ s rape and incest exceptions , since removed , that dominated the conversation in the Alabama Senate . It seemed forgone that the state would ban abortions for a vast majority of the women there . Lawmakers supporting abortion rights were left arguing to preserve the rape and incest exceptions. ” Editorial Board , New York Times
The right supports the goals behind the law , but worries that it may be counterproductive .
The right supports the goals behind the law , but worries that it may be counterproductive .
“ Federal courts , following existing Supreme Court precedent , will certainly strike down the laws in Georgia and Alabama . But the Supreme Court should not continue to hold that state laws regulating abortion are unconstitutional , for the two simple reasons identified by Justice Scalia in his Casey dissent : ( 1 ) the Constitution says nothing about protecting a right to abortion and ( 2 ) American society had long permitted states to ban or otherwise regulate it…
“ [ However ] the abolitionist zeal on display in Alabama in particular runs the risk of making the ultimate extinction of abortion less likely… Nationwide , more than 75 percent of Americans think abortion should be legal early in pregnancy when the pregnancy was the result of rape . Public opinion can not be ignored in a democratic republic , and it would be a grave error to insist that no lives should be saved until all lives can be saved . ”
“ The Alabama bill creates a situation that allows pro-abortion advocates to concentrate their pushback on the approximately 0.5 percent of procedures [ involving rape and incest ] rather than the 99.5 percent . In turn , pro-lifers , now accused of protecting slack-jawed incestuous child rapists , are impelled to make the most challenging arguments about the rarest cases rather than make the most convincing arguments about the most common [ elective ] ones… While incrementalism might not come naturally to conservatives , especially in this era , it ’ s worth remembering that , in the end , the way to win the fight is to convince Americans that abortion is morally repugnant . ”
“ Why would a red state pass a maximalist abortion bill , knowing how leery John Roberts has proved himself to be of overturning paradigm-shifting liberal initiatives ? He had the votes to blow up ObamaCare in 2012 and he switched sides , seemingly fearing that a party-line vote in the Supreme Court would wreck what ’ s left of the Court ’ s institutional legitimacy as a neutral arbiter that stands above politics . Overturning Roe would be several orders of magnitude more earthshaking than overturning ObamaCare would have been… John Roberts is not going to risk the legacy of ‘ The Roberts Court ’ to save a bill like that . It ’ s ludicrous that any legislator in Alabama thinks he might . ”
“ Grandstanding , such as the Alabama bill that would forbid rape victims from obtaining abortions at any point but its own authors admit will never go into effect , greatly harms the pro-life movement 's chances of succeeding . Instead pro-life proponents ought to make two good faith concessions to demonstrate that the pro-life cause is n't about the control of women 's bodies , but rather solely about the protection of the unborn…
“ First is contraception deregulation . This includes making hormonal birth control available over the counter or directly from a pharmacist… Next , pro-life proponents should… divert [ federal funding ] from facilities providing abortions and double it to other Title X non-abortion-providing Title X facilities . Enacted under President Nixon , Title X is a family planning program . It provides services such as Pap smears and HPV vaccines that can prevent cancer , plus STI testing that can prevent infertility , HIV testing that can prevent death , and birth control that can , obviously , prevent pregnancy . ”
“ A healthy pro-life community will step up and move beyond restrictions on abortion towards greater social and community support for mothers with nowhere to turn… Pro-lifers must be willing to fight for adoption reform across the states… We must also work to improve the social safety net to help women… We need to make it easier for mothers to get care they need . We need to make it easier for them to collect from deadbeat dads . Frankly , we also need to make it easier for deadbeat dads to find jobs to help pay for support . ”
“ Alabamans believe by a 58 % to 37 % margin that abortion should be illegal in most or all cases , according to a 2014 Pew poll . That obviously isn ’ t just men . The most recent nationwide poll found majority support among both men and women for bills barring abortion after the baby ’ s heartbeat is detectable , with no statistically significant difference between the sexes ’ views . The bill was drafted and introduced by Rep. Terri Collins , a female lawmaker . It was signed into law by Gov . Kay Ivey , a woman . It mirrors the policy preferences of most Alabama women . ”
Others note , “ I ’ d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump ’ s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be… ‍ “ I think Joe Sixpack ’ s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama ’ s approval at the same point in his presidency . To get Mr. Sixpack ’ s attention you are going to have to do better than this . ”","Others point out that “the supreme court has taken a relatively lax attitude toward respecting long-standing precedents, including overturning a 40-year-old precedent just this week.

Physicians will hesitate in how to care for complex health situations … doctors like me will leave Alabama rather than stay and practice substandard medicine… Alabamans deserve better. We all do.” Yashica Robinson, CNN

“Many recent bills ban abortion after 6 weeks - before most women are even aware they are pregnant — and Alabama’s law constitutes an outright ban at any stage. But women will always seek out a way to end an unwanted pregnancy — the question is whether they can do so safely. In countries with extreme laws like those passed in Georgia, Ohio and now Alabama, women suffer and die. Georgia, for example, has the highest maternal mortality rate in the nation and you can expect those numbers to increase under a law that creates criminal suspicion around every miscarriage.” Jon O’Brien, The Hill

“ Showing just how far to the right the anti-abortion movement has pushed the ‘center’ of the abortion debate, it was the bill’s rape and incest exceptions, since removed, that dominated the conversation in the Alabama Senate. It seemed forgone that the state would ban abortions for a vast majority of the women there. Lawmakers supporting abortion rights were left arguing to preserve the rape and incest exceptions.” Editorial Board, New York Times

From the Right

The right supports the goals behind the law, but worries that it may be counterproductive.

From the Right

The right supports the goals behind the law, but worries that it may be counterproductive.

“Federal courts, following existing Supreme Court precedent, will certainly strike down the laws in Georgia and Alabama. But the Supreme Court should not continue to hold that state laws regulating abortion are unconstitutional, for the two simple reasons identified by Justice Scalia in his Casey dissent: (1) the Constitution says nothing about protecting a right to abortion and (2) American society had long permitted states to ban or otherwise regulate it…



“[However] the abolitionist zeal on display in Alabama in particular runs the risk of making the ultimate extinction of abortion less likely… Nationwide, more than 75 percent of Americans think abortion should be legal early in pregnancy when the pregnancy was the result of rape. Public opinion cannot be ignored in a democratic republic, and it would be a grave error to insist that no lives should be saved until all lives can be saved.”

The Editors, National Review

“The Alabama bill creates a situation that allows pro-abortion advocates to concentrate their pushback on the approximately 0.5 percent of procedures [involving rape and incest] rather than the 99.5 percent. In turn, pro-lifers, now accused of protecting slack-jawed incestuous child rapists, are impelled to make the most challenging arguments about the rarest cases rather than make the most convincing arguments about the most common [elective] ones… While incrementalism might not come naturally to conservatives, especially in this era, it’s worth remembering that, in the end, the way to win the fight is to convince Americans that abortion is morally repugnant.”

David Harsanyi, The Federalist

“Why would a red state pass a maximalist abortion bill, knowing how leery John Roberts has proved himself to be of overturning paradigm-shifting liberal initiatives? He had the votes to blow up ObamaCare in 2012 and he switched sides, seemingly fearing that a party-line vote in the Supreme Court would wreck what’s left of the Court’s institutional legitimacy as a neutral arbiter that stands above politics. Overturning Roe would be several orders of magnitude more earthshaking than overturning ObamaCare would have been… John Roberts is not going to risk the legacy of ‘The Roberts Court’ to save a bill like that. It’s ludicrous that any legislator in Alabama thinks he might.”

Allahpundit, Hot Air

“Grandstanding, such as the Alabama bill that would forbid rape victims from obtaining abortions at any point but its own authors admit will never go into effect, greatly harms the pro-life movement's chances of succeeding. Instead pro-life proponents ought to make two good faith concessions to demonstrate that the pro-life cause isn't about the control of women's bodies, but rather solely about the protection of the unborn…



“First is contraception deregulation. This includes making hormonal birth control available over the counter or directly from a pharmacist… Next, pro-life proponents should… divert [federal funding] from facilities providing abortions and double it to other Title X non-abortion-providing Title X facilities. Enacted under President Nixon, Title X is a family planning program. It provides services such as Pap smears and HPV vaccines that can prevent cancer, plus STI testing that can prevent infertility, HIV testing that can prevent death, and birth control that can, obviously, prevent pregnancy.”

Tiana Lowe, Washington Examiner

“A healthy pro-life community will step up and move beyond restrictions on abortion towards greater social and community support for mothers with nowhere to turn… Pro-lifers must be willing to fight for adoption reform across the states… We must also work to improve the social safety net to help women… We need to make it easier for mothers to get care they need. We need to make it easier for them to collect from deadbeat dads. Frankly, we also need to make it easier for deadbeat dads to find jobs to help pay for support.”

Erick Erickson, The Resurgent

“Alabamans believe by a 58% to 37% margin that abortion should be illegal in most or all cases, according to a 2014 Pew poll. That obviously isn’t just men. The most recent nationwide poll found majority support among both men and women for bills barring abortion after the baby’s heartbeat is detectable, with no statistically significant difference between the sexes’ views. The bill was drafted and introduced by Rep. Terri Collins, a female lawmaker. It was signed into law by Gov. Kay Ivey, a woman. It mirrors the policy preferences of most Alabama women.”

Editorial Board, Washington Examiner

Others note, “I’d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame. The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by, for instance, mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels. Trump’s conversation is typically scattershot, wandering all over the field, leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be… ‍ “I think Joe Sixpack’s response is going to be a hearty shrug. After all that has emerged about Trump so far, his approval rating is closely tracking Obama’s approval at the same point in his presidency. To get Mr. Sixpack’s attention you are going to have to do better than this.”

Rand Paul ( R-KY ) —a GOP presidential candidate—as well , not just from Paul ’ s 2016 rival Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) .
Paul tried to get the floor to stand up and offer an amendment to defund Planned Parenthood and another one to arm servicemen and women on military bases . He intended to offer these measures as amendments to the highway bill that is currently on the Senate floor . Whoever was presiding over the floor refused to recognize Paul to offer his amendments .
Paul has been speaking out on both of these subjects for quite some time , and since the Senate is now taking up what is considered a “ must pass ” piece of legislation , funding the country ’ s highway and mass transit systems—a massive bill that spends hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years—it ’ s an opportunity for senators to get things onto it that can further whatever their agenda might be . Of course , as Cruz has exposed all day Friday , McConnell has used the bill to reauthorize the crony capitalist Export Import Bank . But McConnell is blocking using it to defund Planned Parenthood or to block sanctuary cities or to arm military officers on base .
Senate leaders instead of using that as a vehicle to fight for the unborn and for gun rights to protect our soldiers , instead used a maneuver now Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid made common called “ filling the tree ” wherein they blocked all other amendments including Paul ’ s planned amendments .
Sources in the U.S. Senate tell ███ , however , that Paul isn ’ t taking this lying down .
He is , they say , currently circulating a petition to go around the Senate leaders and force a vote on defunding Planned Parenthood anyway . Paul is calling pro life leaders to join him in this crusade , and some pro life leaders are already whispering that this may be the perfect time to strike at Planned Parenthood . If he succeeds , it would of course be a massive rebuke of McConnell ’ s leadership of the GOP majority in the Senate—and that it ’ s even come to this is extraordinary considering that McConnell and all Republicans nationwide just last year campaigned on the promise that giving Republicans the GOP majority in the Senate would mean the place would run differently from the way it ran under Reid ’ s leadership and Democratic control .
Planned Parenthood gets over $ 500 million a year in taxpayer funding .
Senate sources also say that in addition to Paul ’ s effort to go around McConnell for a vote to defund Planned Parenthood , more damning videos—like the ones showing the organization ’ s executives sought to sell baby body parts for cash or for a Lamborghini sports car—may be coming , though it ’ s unclear when the videos will come out .
Some news outlets , like The Hill , are erroneously reporting that McConnell began action on a bill to defund Planned Parenthood on Friday via what ’ s called the “ Senate Rule 14 ” process . That allows the Senate to bypass the committee process and take a bill straight to the floor . While a standalone bill to defund Planned Parenthood is snaking its way through the Senate Rule 14 process , it ’ s not because McConnell put it there—Senate sources tell ███ it ’ s because Sen. Paul put it there and McConnell had nothing to do with it .
What actually happened is Paul filed a new bill to defund Planned Parenthood under Senate Rule 14 which places a bill immediately on the calendar . Senate rules require McConnell to then read Senator Paul ’ s maneuver on the bill into the record before adjourning for the day—it ’ s not as if McConnell did so by choice . If Paul can get the necessary support from his colleagues for these measures , a vote could come this week on this bill to defund Planned Parenthood either as an amendment to the highway bill or as a stand alone piece of legislation .","Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is coming under fire from his home state colleague, Sen.

Paul is calling pro life leaders to join him in this crusade, and some pro life leaders are already whispering that this may be the perfect time to strike at Planned Parenthood. If he succeeds, it would of course be a massive rebuke of McConnell’s leadership of the GOP majority in the Senate—and that it’s even come to this is extraordinary considering that McConnell and all Republicans nationwide just last year campaigned on the promise that giving Republicans the GOP majority in the Senate would mean the place would run differently from the way it ran under Reid’s leadership and Democratic control.

Planned Parenthood gets over $500 million a year in taxpayer funding.

Senate sources also say that in addition to Paul’s effort to go around McConnell for a vote to defund Planned Parenthood, more damning videos—like the ones showing the organization’s executives sought to sell baby body parts for cash or for a Lamborghini sports car—may be coming, though it’s unclear when the videos will come out.

Some news outlets, like The Hill, are erroneously reporting that McConnell began action on a bill to defund Planned Parenthood on Friday via what’s called the “Senate Rule 14” process. That allows the Senate to bypass the committee process and take a bill straight to the floor. While a standalone bill to defund Planned Parenthood is snaking its way through the Senate Rule 14 process, it’s not because McConnell put it there—Senate sources tell Breitbart News it’s because Sen. Paul put it there and McConnell had nothing to do with it.

What actually happened is Paul filed a new bill to defund Planned Parenthood under Senate Rule 14 which places a bill immediately on the calendar. Senate rules require McConnell to then read Senator Paul’s maneuver on the bill into the record before adjourning for the day—it’s not as if McConnell did so by choice. If Paul can get the necessary support from his colleagues for these measures, a vote could come this week on this bill to defund Planned Parenthood either as an amendment to the highway bill or as a stand alone piece of legislation.",www.breitbart.com,right,Ejd437WBjzy80fZK

The ACLU wants Catholic hospitals to practice medicine without morals.

The American Civil Liberties Union is so upset that a Michigan baby died just after being born that the group is suing the Catholic Church for not deliberately killing the child earlier.

In a lawsuit filed on Nov. 29 against the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in U.S. District Court in Michigan, the ACLU contends that the church’s medical directives reflecting a pro-life stance against abortion resulted in negligent care for a woman with a troubled pregnancy who eventually lost the child.

“It’s not just about one woman,” said Kary Moss, executive director of the Michigan ACLU, in a Newsmax report quoted in The Washington Times. “It’s about a nationwide policy created by nonmedical professionals putting patients in harm’s way.”

Translation: Either the Catholic Church directs Catholic hospitals to perform abortions or it will be bankrupted, courtesy of the ACLU, which fights for the “right” to abort even full-term, healthy babies.

For good measure, the ACLU named as defendants the current and past two directors of Catholic Health Ministries, the group that issues national ethical directives for Catholic health institutions.

In the case at hand, plaintiff Tamesha Means, was 18 weeks pregnant in December 2010 when her water broke and she went to Mercy Health Partners in Muskegon. The ACLU suit contends that during three emergency-room treatments, she was never told that “the safest treatment option was to induce labor and terminate the pregnancy.” Catholic doctors are bound by their faith to try to save both mother and baby.

On her third trip to the emergency room, as she was being checked out to go home, Ms. Means began giving birth to a baby, which the doctors delivered but which died 2 hours later, according to the ACLU’s complaint. Because the odds were against the baby’s survival, and Ms. Means had a potentially life-threatening infection, the ACLU contends that doctors should have either aborted the baby or told Ms. Means where to have it done. Hard cases make bad law, and the ACLU is hoping that a jury will find for Ms. Means and dish out a crippling monetary award.

This is about far more than Ms. Means‘ tragic situation or one hospital’s alleged negligence. It’s about forcing Catholic doctors everywhere to violate their faith by facilitating abortions. It strikes at the very heart of religious freedom and freedom of conscience. It’s a corollary to the Department of Health and Human Services’ mandate under Obamacare that faith-based institutions or businesses run by devoutly religious owners provide contraceptives regarded as abortifacients or face ruinous fines.

Since only the Catholic Church bothered to build a hospital within 30 minutes of Ms. Means‘ home, the ACLU contends that the facility should operate without religious principles guiding it or simply switch to the ACLU’s brand of moral relativism, where unborn children are merely options.

It’s like building the only power plant and providing electricity where there was none and then getting sued for not electrocuting the people that the ACLU thinks are expendable.

“A pregnant woman who goes to the hospital seeking medical care has the right to expect that the hospital’s first priority will be to provide her appropriate care,” said Louise Melling, deputy legal director of the ACLU, in an ACLU press release. “Medical decisions should not be hamstrung by religious directives.”

Indeed, the lawsuit accuses the bishops’ directives of preventing Catholic hospitals from “providing information about treatment options that are not considered morally legitimate.” Well, duh.

It will take more research, but I doubt that you could uncover instances in which the ACLU has sued abortion clinics for not informing their clients of the option of keeping their babies and getting aid from, say, faith-based crisis-pregnancy centers.

The “pro-choice” movement is a one-way street, with the ACLU serving as traffic cop, ensuring that abortion clinics won’t have to meet typical clinical medical standards and that women are not given accurate information about all their “choices.” The “choice” they are given is whether to have the abortion or not.

In the ACLU’s brave new world, “religious directives” must be subordinated to an all-powerful state. That’s why the ACLU has no problem with Obamacare.

Without “religious directives,” all sorts of procedures, up to and including euthanasia, can become requirements if a hospital wants to stay in business.

Once the government gets total control of our health care, we can dispense with those nettlesome matters of conscience that characterize a free country.

C ’ mon : You should know him better than that by now . He didn ’ t cancel , he just postponed it until this morning so that he could visit West , Texas , yesterday to speak about the disaster there . The most pro-abortion president in American history wasn ’ t about to pass on the chance to become the first sitting president to address Planned Parenthood . Although , true to form , he waited until he was safely reelected to do it .
Does this sound like a man cowed by news of a late-term abortionist , who received referrals from “ respectable ” clinics and who operated with impunity for years due to political opposition to clinic oversight , cutting babies ’ spinal cords ?
President Obama told Planned Parenthood on Friday he will fight various efforts to restrict women ’ s access to abortion , contraceptives and other services… “ Planned Parenthood is not going anywhere , ” Obama said . “ It ’ s not going anywhere today , it ’ s not going anywhere tomorrow. ” … Obama did not use the word “ abortion ” during his remarks , but said the “ right to choose ” has long been upheld by courts… Citing efforts in some states to restrict access to certain services , including abortion , Obama said it looks like some lawmakers want to turn back the clock to the 1950s .
Even a guy who looks the other way at infanticide , provided it ’ s done “ soon enough ” after birth , feels obliged to avoid the A-word despite the fact that he ’ s addressing the biggest abortion provider in America . Maybe there ’ s an ounce of shame left in him yet .
After week of pro choicers saying Gosnell proves why we need less abortion regulation , Obama weirdly doesn ’ t mention the “ proof ” in speech — Kirsten Powers ( @ kirstenpowers10 ) April 26 , 2013
Yeah , I thought the big liberal spin on Gosnell was that the horrendous conditions at his clinic prove that we need more clinics with less regulation so that poor women can have access to more reputable neck-severing services . Let a thousand clinics bloom and no one would need to visit Gosnell ’ s dump . How come O didn ’ t think to make that point today ? He spent weeks on the trail pounding the table for more gun regulations after Newtown . When does he hit the trail to explain that the solution to the Gosnell problem is more chop shops ?
Via the Standard , here ’ s his closing “ God bless you ” to the faithful assembled . Normally I ’ d dismiss this as rote presidential blather when concluding a speech , but from a guy who once famously said that he didn ’ t want his teen daughters “ punished ” with a baby , it ’ s safe to assume that he really does think they ’ re doing the lord ’ s work .","Some righties took it as a sign that he was running scared from the Gosnell trial when he “canceled” his speech to PP scheduled for last night.

President Obama told Planned Parenthood on Friday he will fight various efforts to restrict women’s access to abortion, contraceptives and other services… “Planned Parenthood is not going anywhere,” Obama said. “It’s not going anywhere today, it’s not going anywhere tomorrow.”… Obama did not use the word “abortion” during his remarks, but said the “right to choose” has long been upheld by courts… Citing efforts in some states to restrict access to certain services, including abortion, Obama said it looks like some lawmakers want to turn back the clock to the 1950s.

Even a guy who looks the other way at infanticide, provided it’s done “soon enough” after birth, feels obliged to avoid the A-word despite the fact that he’s addressing the biggest abortion provider in America. Maybe there’s an ounce of shame left in him yet.

KP makes an excellent point, incidentally:

After week of pro choicers saying Gosnell proves why we need less abortion regulation, Obama weirdly doesn’t mention the “proof” in speech — Kirsten Powers (@kirstenpowers10) April 26, 2013

Yeah, I thought the big liberal spin on Gosnell was that the horrendous conditions at his clinic prove that we need more clinics with less regulation so that poor women can have access to more reputable neck-severing services. Let a thousand clinics bloom and no one would need to visit Gosnell’s dump. How come O didn’t think to make that point today? He spent weeks on the trail pounding the table for more gun regulations after Newtown. When does he hit the trail to explain that the solution to the Gosnell problem is more chop shops?

Via the Standard, here’s his closing “God bless you” to the faithful assembled. Normally I’d dismiss this as rote presidential blather when concluding a speech, but from a guy who once famously said that he didn’t want his teen daughters “punished” with a baby, it’s safe to assume that he really does think they’re doing the lord’s work.",www.hotair.com,right,5SEvRUY5npLGFAVT

When I hear people say that they don ’ t like dogma , what I hear is that they don ’ t like the dogma of people who disagree with them .
Dear Reader ( Including those of you not cursed to endure the sweatpant-fog climate of Washington , D.C. ) ,
Sometimes we use certain words only to describe the forms of that word we do not like .
Let me explain : Let ’ s imagine that my daughter says , “ French food is awful . ”
To which I retort , “ Oh , I agree . We never should have let them talk us out of those toasted cheese sandwiches , that time . But you love duck confit and croissants . That ’ s French food , too . ”
The same dynamic plays itself out in many political and policy debates .
My go-to example of this is the word “ censorship. ” Over my many years of debating with intense libertarians of the left and the right , I ’ ve heard many times that “ all censorship is wrong ” or “ I am 100 percent against censorship . ”
“ Oh really ? ” I ask . “ So riddle me this : The FCC prohibits hardcore child pornography on Saturday-morning TV . Are you against that ? ”
The answers tend to vary , but one very common retort is something like , “ Oh come on . That ’ s not censorship ; that just reasonable regulation . Besides , no one is proposing doing that . ”
To which I reply — and I ’ m going to stop using quotation marks because this is getting silly — of course it ’ s censorship . You just approve of it , so you don ’ t call it censorship . As for the fact that nobody is proposing running kiddie porn in the cartoon hour doesn ’ t mean much . If someone did propose it , you ’ ve conceded that it would be reasonable to proscribe it . Ergo ( an incredibly douchey word to use in debate over beers , by the way ) you ’ ve conceded that you ’ re not 100 percent against censorship . Censorship , in other words , is the word we use for censorship we don ’ t like .
Now , I ’ m being unfair to people who have better or more interesting responses to my case , but that ’ s okay because a ) that ’ s very rare and b ) I ’ m not here to discuss censorship .
There are all sorts of words that work this way in our politics . Every day I hear people say that one shouldn ’ t be “ dogmatic , ” or that their political opponents are dogmatists , or some such . But as I have written many times , everyone subscribes to all manner of dogmatic convictions — and they should . People not dogmatically opposed to genocide , premeditated murder , rape , etc . aren ’ t brave and pragmatic free-thinkers . They ’ re sociopaths .
The accumulation of dogma — good dogma , duck-confit dogma , not-snail dogma — is the process by which civilizations advance . In a state of nature , man is open to all possibilities if he can be convinced he will gain an advantage in a bid to survive . With no controlling moral authority beyond the basic programming of our genes , we were free to take the shortest route between any two points , so long as we believed it would work out well for us . Even after the Agricultural Revolution , civilizations defined morality largely according to what benefitted the rulers . Child sacrifice — common around the globe for millennia — seemed like a plausible way to get better crop yields , so why not go for it ?
Over time , through the process of trial and error informed by reason and faith , we accumulated some conclusions about how society should operate . These conclusions became dogmas . Dogma is simply the word we use for settled questions we no longer want to reopen . Not all dogmas are good . Some are evil , to be sure : child sacrifice , slavery , etc . But the process of refining our dogmas is what makes us , if not human , then certainly humane . Conversely , the process by which we unthinkingly smash dogmas without understanding their function is the fastest route to barbarism . The Bolsheviks rejected the dogma of universal human dignity and slaughtered people with an abandon more closely resembling the Aztecs than anything resembling secular humanism .
When [ man ] drops one doctrine after another in a refined skepticism , when he declines to tie himself to a system , when he says that he has outgrown definitions , when he says that he disbelieves in finality , when , in his own imagination , he sits as God , holding no form of creed but contemplating all , then he is by that very process sinking slowly backwards into the vagueness of the vagrant animals and the unconsciousness of the grass . Trees have no dogmas . Turnips are singularly broad-minded .
When I was flying over the North Slope of Alaska with a bush pilot nearly 20 years ago , the pilot told me how he once discovered a field of dead moose , almost entirely intact , save for the fact that they had their bellies ripped open . He explained that a grizzly bear or bears had killed all the females just to eat the unborn calves out of their bellies — because that was the tastiest part . Rather than eat just one whole moose , the bear was simply guided by the turnip-like dogma of its instincts . The history of humanity is full of stories where people , likewise , lived with such undogmatic cruelty . Of course , it ’ s unfair to describe the bears as cruel , because they have no concept of cruelty . They think it is good to eat your face , because that is their nature . We do have a concept of cruelty , and we have dogma to thank for it .
So when I hear people say that they don ’ t like dogma , what I hear is that they don ’ t like the dogma of people who disagree with them .
In the last 48 hours , amidst the flop-sweat panic over Anthony Kennedy ’ s retirement , I ’ ve heard one abortion activist after another — including many who play objective journalists on TV — insist that abortion opponents are crazed ideologues who want to impose their ideology on others . I have no doubt that these talking points test very well in focus groups . I also have no doubt that these talking points are sincerely held .
Last night , I saw a tweet from the president of NARAL and responded to it :
All positions on abortion are ideological . https : //t.co/geE1H0Z12V — Jonah Goldberg ( @ JonahNRO ) June 29 , 2018
Ideology is the first draft of dogma . The good kind is merely a set of preferences , grounded in conviction , evidence , experience , or reason , that helps guide us when we think through an idea or when we encounter new problems or facts . Progressives have an ideology . Conservatives have an ideology . Libertarians , socialists , and , yes , pragmatists have ideologies , too .
Part of my ideology is the idea that we should err on the side of protecting individual liberty . I am not categorically opposed to restrictions on individual liberty , however . I favor a military draft when it ’ s necessary ( and I am ideologically opposed to one when it is unnecessary ) . I believe in putting rapists in jail and executing the most heinous murderers . But part of my ideology holds that we should only do so after providing due process . My concern isn ’ t that we might be unfair to a rapist or murderer , however . My concern is that without such systems in place , there ’ s too much potential to be unfair to someone falsely accused of murder or rape . The mob hates due process .
The debate over abortion revolves around a question of fact — or interpretation of fact — that then determines the ideological course of action like the first choice in a “ choose your own adventure ” book . If you conclude that the unborn , either at conception or at some later point of the pregnancy , acquires moral status and rights , you go down one path of thought . If you believe , like Barbara Boxer does , that it ’ s not really a baby until you bring it home from the hospital , that sets you down another path .
Both sides in this dispute share some dogmatic and ideological convictions . They just apply them differently . The hardcore pro-abortion crowd uses the language of individual liberty about the mother : How dare the state tell me what to do with my body ! ? In order to make this argument , however , they must define away that other life as nothing more than uterine contents , a glob of cells , or some other euphemism . The hardcore anti-abortion crowd starts from the premise that the fetus is an individual human being and as such deserves protection from harm . And it is the state ’ s first obligation to police or regulate violence .
Both of these positions are ideological . One common response to this claim , peppering the replies to my tweet , is that abortion isn ’ t ideological for the pregnant woman . There ’ s some truth to this , in the sense that we often shed our abstract commitments when pressed with real-life choices or difficult circumstances . That ’ s why we have the saying , “ There are no atheists in fox holes . ”
The progressive who pounds the table in defense of public schools but sends his own kids to a private school is one example . The conservative CEO who talks a great game about the free market and the evils of crony capitalism but barely hesitates to accept a subsidy is another . This hypocrisy is entirely human , and our capacity to rationalize such things is often infinite .
And one of the most common ways we grease the skids for our retreat is by simply switching one ready-made ideology for another .
Bad ideology , like bad dogma , is a very real thing as well . Bad ideologies confuse is and ought . They hitch themselves to an unproven or unfalsifiable conviction about the way things should be . The worst ideologies assume humans are clay , dispensable when insufficiently pliable . They heap scorn on the hard-learned lessons of civilization in favor of glorious castles built in the air . Opposition to their agenda is seen as an evil desire to deprive people of happiness not attainable in this life .
Other ideologies are just silly — not in the desirability of their aims necessarily , but in the belief that they would work . Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won her congressional primary contest in New York this week by championing one such ideology . It basically boils down to what someone called “ open-borders socialism. ” It is grounded in an ancient romantic notion that economics — the science of competing choices amidst finite resources — is a con . We can do all the good things simultaneously . Everyone can become an American , and every American is entitled to free housing , free school , guaranteed work , and every other good thing . It is the ideology of the child or the aristocrat — often the same thing — that holds we can of course have our cakes and eat them too . And as with the more evil forms of ideology , its advocates assume that those opposed are motivated by a desire to deprive the deserving of something they could easily give them .
In a world of infinite resources , it would indeed be a crime to deprive others of their fair share of the infinite . But we don ’ t live in that world . Part of the job of parents is to explain to children that “ We are not made of money ” and even if we were , we could not or would not satisfy our children ’ s every whim .
But we live in a time of epidemic childishness , working on the assumptions that we can borrow money forever and that the government is made of money . “ Example is the school of mankind , and he will learn at no other , ” says Edmund Burke . What he meant by that is people must learn from actual events : They must be shown , not told . This doesn ’ t mean that every generation must relearn first-hand the mistakes of the past . It means they must be taught about the mistakes of the past . That ’ s what parents do with their kids . And it ’ s what grown-ups do in politics .
But there ’ s a marked shortage of grown-ups these days , which is a real calamity when childishness runs free .
I know the G-File has been lacking of late in the jocularity some folks look for in this “ news ” letter . My apologies . Between the grueling travel , the death of Charles Krauthammer ( so fast on the heels of my father-in-law ’ s passing ) , and a slew of hopefully minor health issues , I ’ ve been in a remarkably dyspeptic mindset of late . I ’ m going to the beach next week , so hopefully I will come back refreshed with a full tank of pull-my-finger jokes .
Canine Update : A few months ago , Megan McArdle and I briefly discussed dog economics on the Remnant podcast . I don ’ t mean the canine-care or dog-food industry . I mean the actual economic calculations of dogs themselves . Without consulting Thorstein Veblen ’ s work on conspicuous consumption or Fred Hirsch ’ s concept of positional goods , dogs nonetheless model it very well . Here ’ s a good explainer from Big Bang Theory .
If you ’ ve ever spent time in a dog park , you know that there are enough sticks for everybody . But the dogs tend to focus on a single stick — the one possessed by one of the dogs . That stick is a positional good . And all the dogs chase the one who has it . Our dogwalker Kirsten ( back from vacation , thank God ) has several fetching-machines in her pack . She used to ban balls from the hikes on the grounds that once the fetching protocol was activated it couldn ’ t be stopped and the dogs wouldn ’ t play with each other . But recently she has surrendered to populist demand . One day this week she brought enough tennis balls for all three fetching machines ( Zoë is famously uninterested in such things ) . But very quickly , the dogs concentrated on a single tennis ball , which Samson possessed , filling Obi and Pippa with a fierce determination to get it back .
They want the ball . pic.twitter.com/9F9snRedOR — Jonah Goldberg ( @ JonahNRO ) June 28 , 2018
Anyway , everything else is good with the doggers . The vengeful in-house pooping has stopped . Pippa is spanieling with spanielly abandon ( though she does make time to chill ) . And Zoë is giving full flower to her sense of entitlement .

Various & Sundry

I know the G-File has been lacking of late in the jocularity some folks look for in this “news”letter. My apologies. Between the grueling travel, the death of Charles Krauthammer (so fast on the heels of my father-in-law’s passing), and a slew of hopefully minor health issues, I’ve been in a remarkably dyspeptic mindset of late.

abortion,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/gao-report-obamacare-abortion-rules-ignored-110990.html?ml=tb,GAO: Obamacare abortion rules widely ignored,2014-09-15,"Burgess Everett, Jennifer Haberkorn","The report ’ s release is likely to elicit new election-year attacks on congressional Democrats . Report : ACA abortion rules ignored
There are widespread instances of Obamacare insurance plans violating the rigid rules surrounding whether customers can use federal health care subsidies on insurance policies that cover abortion procedures , according to a Government Accountability Office investigation .
The report , commissioned by House Republican leadership and obtained by ███ on Monday night , found that 15 insurers in a sample of 18 are selling Obamacare plans that do not segregate funds to cover abortion ( except in cases of rape , incest or the mother ’ s life ) from their Obamacare subsidies .
The Affordable Care Act requires that insurers collect separate payments from customers for abortion coverage so that taxpayer money in the form of subsidies do not cover abortions . Adoption of the complex payment scheme — which essentially requires customers to send two separate payments to their insurers — was pivotal to getting the health law through Congress . Anti-abortion Democrats brokered the arrangement shortly before the law passed , threatening to vote against it without the restrictive language .
The report ’ s release is likely to elicit new election-year attacks on congressional Democrats from anti-abortion groups and Republicans who warned that Obamacare would allow for taxpayer subsidized abortions .
Among a sample of 18 insurers , “ all but three issuers indicated that the [ abortion coverage ] benefit is not subject to any restrictions , limitations , or exclusions , ” the GAO wrote in its report .
The vast majority of people who bought coverage on the exchanges did so with subsidies . According to government figures , 87 percent of the 5.4 million people who bought a plan on HealthCare.gov in the last enrollment period did so with at least some subsidy .
There is no data provided on how many plans have paid for abortions so far .
The GAO report found that in Connecticut , Hawaii , New Jersey , Rhode Island and Vermont , all insurance plans offered on the exchanges cover abortions above and beyond the exceptions for rape , incest and the mother ’ s life . The health law required the Office of Personnel Management to ensure there was at least one insurance policy in each state that did not cover abortion except in the restricted circumstances .

Report: ACA abortion rules ignored

There are widespread instances of Obamacare insurance plans violating the rigid rules surrounding whether customers can use federal health care subsidies on insurance policies that cover abortion procedures, according to a Government Accountability Office investigation.

The report, commissioned by House Republican leadership and obtained by POLITICO on Monday night, found that 15 insurers in a sample of 18 are selling Obamacare plans that do not segregate funds to cover abortion (except in cases of rape, incest or the mother’s life) from their Obamacare subsidies.

The Affordable Care Act requires that insurers collect separate payments from customers for abortion coverage so that taxpayer money in the form of subsidies do not cover abortions. Adoption of the complex payment scheme — which essentially requires customers to send two separate payments to their insurers — was pivotal to getting the health law through Congress. Anti-abortion Democrats brokered the arrangement shortly before the law passed, threatening to vote against it without the restrictive language.

( Also on POLITICO: 115K to lose health coverage)

The report’s release is likely to elicit new election-year attacks on congressional Democrats from anti-abortion groups and Republicans who warned that Obamacare would allow for taxpayer subsidized abortions.

Among a sample of 18 insurers, “all but three issuers indicated that the [abortion coverage] benefit is not subject to any restrictions, limitations, or exclusions,” the GAO wrote in its report.

The vast majority of people who bought coverage on the exchanges did so with subsidies. According to government figures, 87 percent of the 5.4 million people who bought a plan on HealthCare.gov in the last enrollment period did so with at least some subsidy .

There is no data provided on how many plans have paid for abortions so far.

( Also on POLITICO: GOP could chip away at Obamacare)

The GAO report found that in Connecticut, Hawaii, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Vermont, all insurance plans offered on the exchanges cover abortions above and beyond the exceptions for rape, incest and the mother’s life. The health law required the Office of Personnel Management to ensure there was at least one insurance policy in each state that did not cover abortion except in the restricted circumstances.

The Obama administration, in a response to a draft copy of the report, defended its actions.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said Tuesday that it regularly communicated the technical details of abortion coverage to health insurance companies. The agency said that it would provide additional clarifying information in the coming days.

“CMS will work with stakeholders, including states and issuers, so they fully understand and comply with the federal law prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortions,” spokesman Ben Wakana said.

USA TODAY

Alabama's passage of the nation's strictest abortion bill is touching off almost a contest among lawmakers in the South and Midwest to join the anti-abortion ranks, helping propel the highly emotional issue into the national debate and put it before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Missouri lawmakers now seek to wrest Alabama's anti-abortion torch and move to the front of the line.

“It’s time to make Missouri the most Pro-Life state in the country!” Republican Gov. Mike Parson tweeted Wednesday as debate in his state's Senate began over a ""heartbeat"" abortion ban. Lawmakers pushed it through and hope to get it past the House Friday on the last day for passing bills.

Missouri's conservative state senators even put aside squabbles on other, more parochial issues, this week to end a filibuster in order to take up the legislation that would prohibit nearly all abortions as early as eight weeks into a pregnancy, except in cases of medical emergency. There are no exceptions for rape or incest.

The latest developments are also firing up the opposition. “This is not just about Alabama. We are seeing these extreme bills being introduced across the country,” said Planned Parenthood President Leana Wen. “These extreme bans banning abortions at six weeks or earlier, before women even know we’re pregnant, is happening in 16 states.”

Here's a look at where key states stand on abortion:

Kentucky

In Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin's administration on Wednesday started its appeal of a federal judge's ruling that struck down the state's abortion law that would halt a common second-trimester procedure to end pregnancies.

U.S. District Judge Joseph H. McKinley Jr. ruled last week that the 2018 law would create a ""substantial obstacle"" to a woman's right to an abortion, violating constitutionally protected privacy rights.

More:Where is abortion legal? Everywhere. But ...

The laws emanating from anti-abortion states not only limit, if not eliminate, the options for abortion in individual states, they essentially invite a more conservative U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in and possibly reverse on the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion.

While some states have long been active in their anti-abortion efforts, many now find the political atmosphere under the Trump administration more supportive, particularly after the addition of two conservative justices on the high court.

Missouri

Missouri's Republican-led Senate passed its bill to ban abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy. Senators approved the legislation 24-10 early Thursday.

In addition, it would include a ban on abortions based on race, sex or a ""prenatal diagnosis, test, or screening indicating Down Syndrome or the potential of Down Syndrome in an unborn child.""

Alabama

Alabama's law makes performing virtually all abortions a crime, punishable as Class A felony, punishable by life or 10 to 99 years in prison. It passed the legislature on Tuesday and was signed by Republican Gov. Kay Ivey on Wednesday.

More:How does Alabama's abortion bill compare to Georgia's 'fetal heartbeat' law?

In April, Ohio became the third state this year to pass a ""heartbeat"" bill banning abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. The ban takes effect after the detection of a fetal heartbeat at a point before many women are even aware they are pregnant.

Georgia

Gov. Brian Kemp touched of a firestorm of protest last week after signing his state's anti-abortion ""heartbeat bill."" Kemp even delayed an annual trip to Los Angeles to promote Georgia’s burgeoning film industry as movie executives, producers and actors criticized the state’s new abortion ban.

His spokesman Cody Hall says the event is now set for this fall and that the governor will soon tour Georgia film production firms and meet with industry workers to show his support.

Mississippi

The state's ""heartbeat bill,"" which does not allow exceptions for rape or incest, was signed in March by Gov. Phil Bryant, but is already being challenged in court. The state's 2018 law banning abortions after 15 weeks was struck down in federal court in November. The state attorney general filed papers in April to appeal the ruling.

Meanwhile, ""heartbeat"" bills have passed one chamber of the legislature in Missouri, Ohio and Tennessee and have been introduced in Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, South Carolina and West Virginia.

The bills hit at the nexus of the abortion debate, and frame the act in stark, emotional terms, with proponents arguing that preserving life outweighs arguments against government interference in personal, medical decisions.

The Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit group on sexual and reproductive health issues, finds the abortion debate ranges from seven states deemed ""very hostile"" to abortion rights (Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, South Dakota) to one state (California) considered ""very supportive.""

North Dakota

In April, North Dakota's Republican governor signed a bill outlawing a second-trimester abortion procedure known as dilation and evacuation.

The law, which includes the non-medical term “human dismemberment abortion,"" makes it a crime for doctors to use instruments such as clamps, scissors and forceps to remove the fetus from the womb during the second trimester.

Women getting the procedure would not be charged, but doctors performing it would face a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. An exception exists for medical emergencies.

Legal roadblocks and opportunities

Kentucky's bill has been stymied by a federal court order blocking enforcement and the first-in-the-nation bill passed by North Dakota in 2013 was ruled unconstitutional, as was one passed last year in Iowa.

To many anti-abortion voices, legal challenges are the point.

“The heartbeat bill is the next incremental step in our strategy to overturn Roe v. Wade,” Ohio Right to Life President Mike Gonidakis told the Associated Press last month.

“While other states embrace radical legislation to legalize abortion on demand through the ninth month of pregnancy, Ohio has drawn a line and continues to advance protections for unborn babies,"" he said.

Likewise, pro-abortion forces see the courts as an avenue to create precedents to fortify their position.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the passage of the Alabama bill a ""heartbreaking and unconstitutional assault on basic reproductive freedoms.""

""I don’t want to be a fearmonger but I do believe they’re trying to go on a path that will totally dismantle Roe v. Wade and we have to be vigilant and express our concerns on this,” Pelsoi, a Democrat, told reporters Thursday.

Dalven also notes that the Supreme Court already has a number of abortion-related cases it could take up immediately it if wanted to and does not have to wait for a ""heartbeat"" abortion challenge to work its way up the appeals track.

Divide over abortion in America

Laws against abortion are by no means a slam-dunk, even in Red states. Proposed heartbeat bans failed to pass this year in Texas and fell short in Florida, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia.

In addition, 13 states have introduced legislation that would establish legal protections for abortion or repeal what they view as outdated abortion laws.

In January, New York adopted the ""Reproductive Health Act"" that affirms the right to abortion until the fetus is viable and when the patient’s life or health is at risk.

It joins nine other states in establishing legal protections for abortion. Similar bills have passed the first legislative chamber in New Mexico, Rhode Island and Vermont, according to the Guttmacher Institute.

Not only is this sickening , it is a federal offense .
While many are calling for the investigation and defunding of Planned Parenthood , I believe this is just a drop in the bucket in regards to how the pro-life right should combat the abortion industry .
A bad product or practice will not become extinct until a better product or practice comes along to replace it .
For example , horse drawn carriages are now extinct , with the exception of nostalgia . They were replaced by steam engines , then the combustion engine ; thank God for automobiles ! Washboards and clotheslines have been replaced with in-home washers and driers . Beepers are now considered “ retro ” as we use our iPhones . And candles ? A sweet smelling , decor accessory , not a heat and light necessity .
In the same way , if we want to end abortion , a newer , better option will have to replace it . Like any other good or service , abortion is subject to the laws of supply and demand .
While I personally believe that abortion is never a “ good ” option and many would argue adoption is a “ better ” option , we must acknowledge that many find abortion to be the most convenient , cheap , and quick fix .
Abortion is one of the cruelest , most gruesome and primitive practices of today ’ s modern man ; participation in the free market , on the other hand , is one of the key defining traits of civilized human interaction .
Viewing any industry from a free-market lense , government regulation and condemnation won ’ t bring about a new service . It will only regulate - and therefore muck up - the current practice .
While putting a damper on the abortion industry through government regulation might be a step in the right direction , it is unrealistic at best . Our own government has taken the reverse role and has subsidized groups like Planned Parenthood to the tune of $ 46 million in federal grants , just this year alone . In fact , since 2012 , Planned Parenthood has received more than $ 207 million in federal funds .
One must also consider the effects of the black market - if you outlaw abortions , some women will seek them illegally - in dirty , dark alleyways . Planned Parenthood is already dabbling in the black market , as displayed by the undercover videos exposing the federal offense of selling fetal body parts .
So while defunding , regulation , and even criminalization may be a hinderance , it is not a solution .
Compassionate , pro-life , free-market capitalists need to focus on the product or procedure that will make abortion an irrelevant , outdated practice . Just as the invention of the thumb drive has saved more trees than any government regulation , a for-profit invention would save more lives than the government ever could .
We must rid ourselves of the government-is-the-solution mentality and start fighting for life via the free market . We must practice the approaches that we preach !
So , what is this new product or procedure that could make abortion a thing of the past ?
Different scientists and doctors will give you different answers . One that has peeked my interest is the concept of ectogenesis or eviction incubators .
Ectogenesis , simply put , is the development of an embryo or fetus in artificial conditions outside the uterus . This requires an artificial uterus - something medical technology has yet to perfect . But as technology progresses , so will the range of fetal viability .
In non-scientific terms , women , who do not wish to be pregnant , give up their child during the stage of fetal viability .

Not only is this sickening, it is a federal offense.

While many are calling for the investigation and defunding of Planned Parenthood, I believe this is just a drop in the bucket in regards to how the pro-life right should combat the abortion industry.

A bad product or practice will not become extinct until a better product or practice comes along to replace it.

For example, horse drawn carriages are now extinct, with the exception of nostalgia. They were replaced by steam engines, then the combustion engine; thank God for automobiles! Washboards and clotheslines have been replaced with in-home washers and driers. Beepers are now considered “retro” as we use our iPhones. And candles? A sweet smelling, decor accessory, not a heat and light necessity.

In the same way, if we want to end abortion, a newer, better option will have to replace it. Like any other good or service, abortion is subject to the laws of supply and demand.

While I personally believe that abortion is never a “good” option and many would argue adoption is a “better” option, we must acknowledge that many find abortion to be the most convenient, cheap, and quick fix.

Abortion is one of the cruelest, most gruesome and primitive practices of today’s modern man; participation in the free market, on the other hand, is one of the key defining traits of civilized human interaction.

Viewing any industry from a free-market lense, government regulation and condemnation won’t bring about a new service. It will only regulate - and therefore muck up - the current practice.

While putting a damper on the abortion industry through government regulation might be a step in the right direction, it is unrealistic at best. Our own government has taken the reverse role and has subsidized groups like Planned Parenthood to the tune of $46 million in federal grants, just this year alone. In fact, since 2012, Planned Parenthood has received more than $207 million in federal funds.

One must also consider the effects of the black market - if you outlaw abortions, some women will seek them illegally - in dirty, dark alleyways. Planned Parenthood is already dabbling in the black market, as displayed by the undercover videos exposing the federal offense of selling fetal body parts.

So while defunding, regulation, and even criminalization may be a hinderance, it is not a solution.

Compassionate, pro-life, free-market capitalists need to focus on the product or procedure that will make abortion an irrelevant, outdated practice. Just as the invention of the thumb drive has saved more trees than any government regulation, a for-profit invention would save more lives than the government ever could.

We must rid ourselves of the government-is-the-solution mentality and start fighting for life via the free market. We must practice the approaches that we preach!

So, what is this new product or procedure that could make abortion a thing of the past?

Different scientists and doctors will give you different answers. One that has peeked my interest is the concept of ectogenesis or eviction incubators.

Ectogenesis, simply put, is the development of an embryo or fetus in artificial conditions outside the uterus. This requires an artificial uterus - something medical technology has yet to perfect. But as technology progresses, so will the range of fetal viability.

In non-scientific terms, women, who do not wish to be pregnant, give up their child during the stage of fetal viability. The young fetus is then transferred to an artificial, replacement uterus. From there, the fetus grows to full-term and is birthed artificially. Adoption agencies, who have a high market demand for more children, can then care for the child and place it into a loving home.

Now I’m the first to admit, growing fetuses in medical boxes and giving them to the highest bidder sounds uncomfortably similar to the plot of a new-agey, sci-fi flick. But research in this area is proceeding apace and once perfected, would bring happiness to families who so wish to adopt. Most importantly, it would save millions of lives.

Ectogenesis is just one example solution. Time and time again, the free market has created products and solutions that just years before no one would have ever imagined. If we do not invest in free markets as the solution, we will never stamp out the genocide of the unborn.

The alternative is the backwards, primitive, and barbaric option of killing the unwanted unborn. When you must choose between the two, those who align themselves with free-market and pro-life values should be wholeheartedly on the side of progress.

After taking a deep breath, a few points.

(1) The Left and pro-choicers have been making the argument for years that men have no place in the abortion debate. This video proves it's not that they don't want men involved, they simply want men to regurgiate talking points and celebrate abortion when it's convenient.

(2) This video sends the message that men can ditch their responsibility of fatherhood at the door. Why? Because abortion is available to ""take care of the problem,"" baby. It's no wonder men in our culture today don't respect women as they should, because they aren't required to.

WASHINGTON — The Renaissance Hotel — the official hotel for March for Life participants to gather in Washington, D.C. — was buzzing with excitement Thursday.

Thousands of people were meeting for events ahead of Friday’s anti-abortion March for Life. It’s the 44th year of the march, but this time, many attendees said, is the first in nearly a decade they feel their voices will be heard — and that's because of President Trump and Vice President Pence.

“With the administration that has promised pro-life policies being enacted there’s just a lot of hope and a lot of enthusiasm,” Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, told USA TODAY.

“It sure does,” feel different under Trump than previous marches when Barack Obama was president, Mancini said. Obama was a supporter of abortion rights and threatened to veto any legislation that would curb them.

“We’ve seen one executive order after the other really not protecting the inherent dignity of the human person from conception to natural death. It’s a breath of relief, a breath fresh air, for us to now have people who are wanting to forward pro-life policies,” Mancini continued.

The new administration has made clear that they are anti-abortion. One of the first executive orders Trump signed was to prohibit U.S. aid from going to international organizations that promote abortion. Trump has also repeatedly vowed that whomever he chooses to fill the vacant position on the Supreme Court will be pro-life.

And or the first time in the march's history, the vice president will speak. Pence announced Thursday he'd be speaking; senior adviser Kellyanne Conway is set to address the crowd as well.

“I think Trump’s made it very clear that he’s somebody who considers himself pro-life, even if he didn’t always,” Ashley McGuire, a senior fellow with the Catholic Association, told USA TODAY.

“By signing the Mexico City executive order, you know having that be one of the first things his administration did, was another very strong signal to the pro-life community that he intends to make good on what he said to us on those issues,” she said.

“I think that pro-lifers feel like maybe we have a voice at the federal level — there’s that hope that we will have that voice. Before, there was no hope,” said Abby Johnson, founder of And Then There Were None, which is an organization that works to get workers out of abortion-related jobs. Before she became an anti-abortion activist, Johnson was a Planned Parenthood clinic director.

Pence to speak at March for Life rally

Trump wields his presidential pen, signing memos on trade, hiring, abortion

The march will begin with an hourlong rally at the Washington Monument, with several Republican lawmakers on the schedule.

Following the rally, marchers will walk the roughly two miles between the monument to the Supreme Court and U.S. Capitol. Then marchers will move to the House and Senate buildings to visit their lawmakers.

Trump said in an interview with ABC that aired Wednesday he “was told you will have a very large crowd of people"" at the March for Life. ""I don’t know as large or larger, some people said it’s gonna be larger” than last week’s Women’s March, Trump said.

Last weekend, huge crowds gathered in cities around the world for the first-ever Women’s March, which was organized in response to Trump’s election. While people marched for a whole slew of reasons — equal pay, climate change, racial equality, LGBT equality, among them — many attendees were there to support Planned Parenthood and abortion rights.

In Washington alone, there were an estimated 500,000 marchers. One anti-abortion group told USA TODAY that he was rejected from cosponsoring the event after the Women’s March announced it supported abortion rights. The march organizers could not be reached to confirm the account.",www.usatoday.com,center,pvSJRKAzeU6SCraN

abortion,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48440094,Abortion in US: What surprise Supreme Court ruling means,,"Anthony Zurcher, North America Reporter","In a surprise move , the Supreme Court has issued a pair of decisions on an Indiana law restricting abortions , offering clues on how the nine-member court - with two new justices appointed by Donald Trump - could view the contentious issue in the days and years ahead .
The court 's actions were a mixed bag for those on both sides of the abortion debate .
In an unsigned opinion , the justices upheld a state requirement that all foetal remains - whether the product of a miscarriage or an abortion - be either buried or cremated .
Anti-abortion activists viewed the provision as a step toward recognising foetal tissue not as medical waste but as human remains deserving dignified treatment .
Abortion rights groups countered that the Supreme Court precedent does not consider a foetus to be human . The purpose of the Indiana law , Planned Parenthood wrote in a statement , is to `` shame and stigmatise '' women seeking abortions .
A majority of the justices sided with Indiana , holding that the burial provision advanced a legitimate interest of the state , even if the law was n't `` perfectly tailored '' to address foetal remains in all circumstances .
The second portion of the Indiana law at issue was where the real fireworks could have erupted - but did n't . The justices declined to reverse , or even review , a lower court 's ruling invalidating the portion of the Indiana law that prohibited elective abortions performed because of the race , gender or `` disability '' of the foetus .
While there is little evidence of abortions performed because of race or gender in the US , physicians regularly test for foetal abnormalities , presenting parents with the decision of whether to terminate the pregnancy .
If the court had chosen to consider the case - with full legal briefings , oral arguments and a ruling sometime next year - it could have served as the vehicle to reverse the 1973 Roe v Wade precedent upholding a woman 's unfettered right to abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy .
Instead , the court sidestepped the matter , prompting a rebuke from Jeanne Mancini , president of March for Life .
`` No one deserves to lose her life just because she was born with Down syndrome or because of the colour of her skin , '' she said .
Justice Clarence Thomas , a conservative member of the court , agreed with the decision - but said his colleagues would eventually have to act .
`` Given the potential for abortion to become a tool of eugenic manipulation , the Court will soon need to confront the constitutionality of laws like Indiana 's , '' he wrote in a concurring opinion .
With nearly a dozen states enacting new abortion regulations and outright prohibitions in 2019 , this wo n't be the only opportunity for the Supreme Court to reconsider whether there is a constitutional right to abortion .
Anti-abortion activists , and state legislatures with anti-abortion majorities , may believe that with the addition of Mr Trump 's appointments , there is a majority on the court willing to finally put a stake through the heart of Roe .
Tuesday 's decisions , however - made with little fanfare and no advanced notice - could be an indication that a majority of the justices on the court are in no hurry to reverse 46 years of precedent .
That wo n't stop the issue from being pulled into the vortex of America presidential politics , however .
Several Democratic candidates are calling for congressional legislation protecting abortion rights across the US - including states that have recently tried to curtail the procedure .
Meanwhile , Mr Trump has reiterated his opposition to abortion except in the cases of rape , incest and to protect the life of the mother .
Skip Twitter post by @ realDonaldTrump As most people know , and for those who would like to know , I am strongly Pro-Life , with the three exceptions - Rape , Incest and protecting the Life of the mother - the same position taken by Ronald Reagan . We have come very far in the last two years with 105 wonderful new ..... — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) May 19 , 2019 Report
Also on Tuesday an abortion clinic in St Louis announced that it may be forced to stop performing the procedure on Friday because the state had yet to renew its licence . If that happens , Missouri would become the first state since Roe was decided to have no abortion clinics within its borders . Five other states have only one .
The Indiana ruling could indicate the Supreme Court does not want to wade into abortion politics in the middle of a presidential campaign season . The justices may avoid the issue for now , but they can do little to stop the increasingly heated battle over Roe and the legality of the procedure .","Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The abortion battle explained in three minutes

In an unsigned opinion, the justices upheld a state requirement that all foetal remains - whether the product of a miscarriage or an abortion - be either buried or cremated.

Anti-abortion activists viewed the provision as a step toward recognising foetal tissue not as medical waste but as human remains deserving dignified treatment.

Abortion rights groups countered that the Supreme Court precedent does not consider a foetus to be human. The purpose of the Indiana law, Planned Parenthood wrote in a statement, is to ""shame and stigmatise"" women seeking abortions.

A majority of the justices sided with Indiana, holding that the burial provision advanced a legitimate interest of the state, even if the law wasn't ""perfectly tailored"" to address foetal remains in all circumstances.

The second portion of the Indiana law at issue was where the real fireworks could have erupted - but didn't. The justices declined to reverse, or even review, a lower court's ruling invalidating the portion of the Indiana law that prohibited elective abortions performed because of the race, gender or ""disability"" of the foetus.

While there is little evidence of abortions performed because of race or gender in the US, physicians regularly test for foetal abnormalities, presenting parents with the decision of whether to terminate the pregnancy.

If the court had chosen to consider the case - with full legal briefings, oral arguments and a ruling sometime next year - it could have served as the vehicle to reverse the 1973 Roe v Wade precedent upholding a woman's unfettered right to abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy.

Instead, the court sidestepped the matter, prompting a rebuke from Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life.

""No one deserves to lose her life just because she was born with Down syndrome or because of the colour of her skin,"" she said.

Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative member of the court, agreed with the decision - but said his colleagues would eventually have to act.

""Given the potential for abortion to become a tool of eugenic manipulation, the Court will soon need to confront the constitutionality of laws like Indiana's,"" he wrote in a concurring opinion.

With nearly a dozen states enacting new abortion regulations and outright prohibitions in 2019, this won't be the only opportunity for the Supreme Court to reconsider whether there is a constitutional right to abortion.

Anti-abortion activists, and state legislatures with anti-abortion majorities, may believe that with the addition of Mr Trump's appointments, there is a majority on the court willing to finally put a stake through the heart of Roe.

Tuesday's decisions, however - made with little fanfare and no advanced notice - could be an indication that a majority of the justices on the court are in no hurry to reverse 46 years of precedent.

That won't stop the issue from being pulled into the vortex of America presidential politics, however.

Several Democratic candidates are calling for congressional legislation protecting abortion rights across the US - including states that have recently tried to curtail the procedure.

Meanwhile, Mr Trump has reiterated his opposition to abortion except in the cases of rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother.

Skip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump As most people know, and for those who would like to know, I am strongly Pro-Life, with the three exceptions - Rape, Incest and protecting the Life of the mother - the same position taken by Ronald Reagan. We have come very far in the last two years with 105 wonderful new..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 19, 2019 Report

Also on Tuesday an abortion clinic in St Louis announced that it may be forced to stop performing the procedure on Friday because the state had yet to renew its licence. If that happens, Missouri would become the first state since Roe was decided to have no abortion clinics within its borders. Five other states have only one.

The Indiana ruling could indicate the Supreme Court does not want to wade into abortion politics in the middle of a presidential campaign season. The justices may avoid the issue for now, but they can do little to stop the increasingly heated battle over Roe and the legality of the procedure.",www.bbc.com,center,LSPBam1aMzoOBW5u

Republicans have been taking ground in the war on abortion for years , putting Democrats on the defensive on specifics like “ partial-birth ” abortion and parental rights .
But suddenly the GOP has fallen into a similar trap , bedeviled by details : rape , invasive ultrasounds and the merits of contraception .
Todd Akin ’ s “ legitimate rape ” remark forced fellow Republicans to publicly explore the details of how they think about abortion — details that don ’ t serve their broader argument and that give Democrats a chance to reframe the debate , conservatives say . That ’ s not going away any time soon : Akin reaffirmed in a Friday press conference that he won ’ t be dropping out of the Missouri Senate race .

Curtiss was turned back in an attempt to strike a plank from the anti-abortion portion of the party ’ s platform that opposes FDA approval of drugs that would terminate pregnancies after the point of conception . She said she also was disappointed that the party didn ’ t respond to Akin ’ s remarks by approving exceptions to the anti-abortion policy in rape and other extreme cases .
It ’ s unusual for Republicans to find themselves on the defensive on abortion , as public opinion polling has shown a sharp increase in the percentage of Americans who consider themselves “ pro-life ” — from 33 percent in 1995 to 50 percent this year , according to Gallup — and a concomitant drop-off in the percentage who view themselves as “ pro-choice . ”
But this isn ’ t the first time this year that an effort to limit abortion — or contraception — has become a liability for the GOP .
In May , Virginia Gov . Bob McDonnell retreated from a state plan to require women seeking abortions to first have invasive ultrasounds .

Republicans have been taking ground in the war on abortion for years, putting Democrats on the defensive on specifics like “partial-birth” abortion and parental rights.

But suddenly the GOP has fallen into a similar trap, bedeviled by details: rape, invasive ultrasounds and the merits of contraception.

Story Continued Below

That’s not going away any time soon: Akin reaffirmed in a Friday press conference that he won’t be dropping out of the Missouri Senate race.

He has proved that it only takes a moment — a word — for a single player to hijack the cause. Republican officials say there’s a lesson to be learned: The message and the messenger matter.

“When we get into the details, I don’t think it’s ever more inclusive of people,” Jackie Curtiss, a 22-year-old Republican National Committee member from Alabama told POLITICO in a telephone interview from Tampa. “I’m a Republican.

She said she also was disappointed that the party didn’t respond to Akin’s remarks by approving exceptions to the anti-abortion policy in rape and other extreme cases.

It’s unusual for Republicans to find themselves on the defensive on abortion, as public opinion polling has shown a sharp increase in the percentage of Americans who consider themselves “pro-life” — from 33 percent in 1995 to 50 percent this year, according to Gallup — and a concomitant drop-off in the percentage who view themselves as “pro-choice.”

A sitting Governor describes a baby being born alive, intact and whole and then describes a death panel’s decision over whether that born child should live or die.

That was the moment I saw it happen.

Oh because he was a physician and had at some point(s) in his history delivered a child or two whose life hasn’t ended in a “post-birth abortion” we were supposed to trust that he cared about all kids.

In his multiple back-to-back days’ worth of press conferences reading prepared statements we were told that we weren’t supposed to question his thoughts on the care of children. After all, even in the original incident, he said that the baby would be offered “comfort” before the death panel decided if that same “comforted” child would be given vital life-saving care or simply allowed to perish.

But here’s a rather obvious question, “If it’s not a living child, capable of feeling pain, why is comfort necessary?”

See the Left in America is so drunk on their newfound power they’ve lost any sense of sober articulation of their beliefs.

Rush Limbaugh has well said for many years “If the Left (Democrats) ever told America what they actually believed they’d never win another election.”

He has been correct, he may still well be.

The recoil over the Virginia governor’s grotesque peeks behind the curtain over “born alive” babies were but one in the latest string of abortion-mania that Democrats have been feeding on.

New York State codifying the actions described by the Virginia Governor aside, decided to go so far as to grant protections into law most of the horrifying criminal actions Kermit Gosnell got sent to prison for.

Now Virginia, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, California, Oregon & Washington state all hope to follow suit.

The average voter doesn’t realize that these bills do all of this. He or she are simply told by the dishonest Democrats in their states that these measures simply reinforce Roe v. Wade on the state level.

Democrats are lying.

Roe only guaranteed a “right” to an abortion until the viability of the child. Casey seems to affirm that 24 weeks is the commonly recognized timeframe.

Democrats lie, they conceal their true intent, and the media gives them cover.

As of the writing of this piece, none of the mainstream networks have done any stories discussing the Virginia Governor’s comments!

More of them covered the controversy of his yearbook photo, his apology for appearing as a Klansman or in blackface, his staunch denial the following day, his previously unmentioned use of blackface in 1984 imitating Michael Jackson, and his racist refusal to shake a black opponent candidate’s hand at a debate.

Somehow that *issue* seems to trump a death panel deciding whether a born baby has the right to live.

America is repulsed by all of this.

Gallup’s work on this matter shows that 60+% of Americans think abortion should only be legal through the first trimester. 87% believe it should be banned in the third trimester. Less than 3% believe “abortion” should be used on a child already born.

(I also literally wonder if that 3% mirrors the child sacrifice practitioners of those who worship Satan, but I digress.)

It was ghoulish enough when the New York State Senate decided to give a standing ovation for the bloodthirst codified in the bill they passed and Governor Cuomo bragged about before signing into law.

But the mask is off. Democrats are as Gov. Mike Huckabee said on my show on Friday, “The party that’s all for ‘piles’ of dead babies.”

They are lying about it.

The media is ignoring it.

And America hates it!",www.townhall.com,right,tB6S7wciNLLihuic

The March for Life, as it’s known, has kicked off on the National Mall every year since 1974 to mark the Jan. 22 anniversary of the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision establishing abortion rights.

Oklahoma County District Judge Cindy Truong declined to strike down the 2015 ban on dilation and evacuation abortions , a method considered to be the `` standard of care '' for women seeking an abortion in the second trimester , according to Julie Rikelman , Litigation Director at the Center for Reproductive Rights , the group that challenged the state law .
Once a final order is issued by the courts , the law will take effect immediately , though Rikelman said her group plans to immediately appeal the decision to the state 's Supreme Court .
`` There really is no other standard method of care for women at that point in their pregnancy , '' Rikelman said in a telephone interview with ███ on Friday . `` It really puts doctors and women in an impossible situation . ''
Prior to Friday 's ruling , Oklahoma already had substantial regulations and restrictions in place impacting a woman 's ability to receive an abortion , according to data provided by the Guttmacher Institute , a pro-abortion access research organization . Women are required to undergo a 72-hour waiting period before receiving an abortion and private insurances are generally only allowed to cover the procedure in cases of life endangerment , according to the group .
Missouri abortion ban could go on the ballot in 2020
A handful of other states — including Arkansas , Kansas , Kentucky and Texas — have passed similar bans on the specific procedure method , but all have been struck down by judges , according to the Center for Reproductive Rights . In June , the Supreme Court decided not to review a lower court 's ruling that struck down an identical ban in Alabama that prohibited dilation and evacuation abortions .

Hunter 's office did not immediately return a call requesting further comment .
At Trust Women , a network of women 's healthcare clinics and one of Oklahoma 's three abortion providers , the dilation and evacuation abortion method is `` absolutely the most common '' protocol for women seeking the procedure in their second trimester , said Julie Burkhart , the co-founder and chief executive officer of the clinic network .
The method is the default choice for doctors at Trust Women because it 's the least invasive , safest , most efficient choice , Burkhart told ███ on Friday .
`` This ruling substantially interferes with our doctors ' relationship with their patients and allowing our physicians to determine what 's the best , safest form of treatment , '' Burkhart said . `` It 's so frustrating to have that decision making power taken away from these physicians who have gone through medical school and become highly trained in their fields . ''
Once the final decision is signed , Burkhart said her clinic will be forced to stop providing the procedure .
`` It 's frustrating because I know , and all of us who work in abortion care know , that is not some sort of abstract exercise , '' Burkhart said . `` This is reproductive healthcare , service delivery , and medicine that everyday people need , request and come to our clinic in hopes of receiving . ''","In a ruling that pro-abortion rights advocates called ""rogue,"" an Oklahoma judge upheld a state law on Friday that banned the most common abortion method for women at least 14 weeks into a pregnancy.

Oklahoma County District Judge Cindy Truong declined to strike down the 2015 ban on dilation and evacuation abortions, a method considered to be the ""standard of care"" for women seeking an abortion in the second trimester, according to Julie Rikelman, Litigation Director at the Center for Reproductive Rights, the group that challenged the state law.

Once a final order is issued by the courts, the law will take effect immediately, though Rikelman said her group plans to immediately appeal the decision to the state's Supreme Court.

""There really is no other standard method of care for women at that point in their pregnancy,"" Rikelman said in a telephone interview with CBS News on Friday. ""It really puts doctors and women in an impossible situation.""

Prior to Friday's ruling, Oklahoma already had substantial regulations and restrictions in place impacting a woman's ability to receive an abortion, according to data provided by the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion access research organization. Women are required to undergo a 72-hour waiting period before receiving an abortion and private insurances are generally only allowed to cover the procedure in cases of life endangerment, according to the group.

abortion,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/nov/26/supreme-court-decide-obamacare-birth-control-manda/,Supreme Court to decide Obamacare birth control mandate,2013-11-26,Tom Howell Jr.,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday set up another showdown over President Obama ’ s health care law , agreeing to decide whether the government may force for-profit companies to insure birth control as part of their health plans , even if it violates the owners ’ religious beliefs .
The justices said they will hear appeals of two related cases — one in which the lower court ruled in favor of an employer , and one in which the lower court upheld the Obama administration ’ s contraception mandate . The conflicting rulings made it an easy decision for the justices to accept the cases .
“ I really don ’ t think they had any alternative than to take this up , ” said Holly Lynch , a health policy and bioethics specialist at Harvard Law School .
The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments and release its opinion before the end of its term in June . That decision would come just two years after the court , in a divided 5-4 ruling , upheld the law ’ s individual mandate as constitutional under Congress ’ taxing authority .
In all , nearly 40 companies filed suit over the mandate , with particular objections to insuring so-called morning-after contraception pills that they equate with abortion . The company owners say they face the impossible choice of violating their beliefs by complying with the rule or dropping health coverage for their employees .
Fines for flouting the mandate would cripple their businesses , owners said in court filings .
“ This legal challenge has always remained about one thing and one thing only : the right of our family businesses to live out our sincere and deeply held religious convictions as guaranteed by the law and the Constitution , ” said David Green , founder and CEO of the Oklahoma City-based Hobby Lobby crafts chain , which won its lower court challenge . “ Business owners should not have to choose between violating their faith and violating the law . ”
The 41-year-old company describes itself as a “ biblically founded business ” and is closed on Sundays . The Green family , Hobby Lobby ’ s owners , also owns the Mardel Christian bookstore chain .
The company in the other case before the Supreme Court is Conestoga Wood Specialties , a Pennsylvania company whose owners are Mennonites . The furniture company lost its appeal of the contraception mandate in a separate lower court ruling .
Supporters of the mandate say contraception use is widespread , but at times unaffordable , for many women . They argue that corporations are not “ persons ” under the law who can claim religious freedoms and that owners of for-profit companies are not entitled to impose their personal moral beliefs on the diverse array of people they employ .
“ As a general matter , our policy is designed to ensure that health care decisions are made between a woman and her doctor , ” the White House said in a written statement . “ The president believes that no one , including the government or for-profit corporations , should be able to dictate those decisions to women . ”
In court filings , the plaintiffs frequently cited their First Amendment rights and the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) , which is supposed to prohibit laws that unduly burden an individual ’ s exercise of religion , in support of their clams . Federal appeals judges on the Hobby Lobby case referred to the Supreme Court ’ s campaign-finance decision in Citizens United to suggest that if companies can exercise free speech , they can claim religious freedoms and prerogatives as well
Ms. Lynch said the outcome is a particularly hard one to predict . But she thinks the court will dispense with the constitutional claims and focus more heavily on religious-freedom protection in RFRA .
While the mandate is certainly a burden , she said it may be a tough sell for the plaintiffs to prove it is a “ substantial burden , ” because of the distinction between what an employer must do — ensure that an insurer covers the services — and the employees ’ role in acquiring and using them .
And yet , she said , the Obama administration ’ s decision to exempt certain faith-based employers could work against them .
Dozens of religiously-affiliated nonprofits — including hospitals , charities and religious schools such as Washington ’ s Catholic University — sued over the mandate , too , and the Obama administration tried to accommodate them by allowing some employers to divorce themselves from managing or paying for the coverage . Instead , an insurer or third-party administrator would offer a separate policy to the employee that covers birth control .
Some institutions accepted the administration ’ s terms , while others decried it as an unacceptable “ accounting trick . ”
Reproductive rights groups and the American Civil Liberties Union have lined up in support of the administration , saying a decision in favor of employers would mark a major shift in the role of secular companies .
“ The right to religious freedom belongs to individuals , not for-profit institutions , ” said Nancy Northup , president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights , adding , “ The U.S. Supreme Court should use this opportunity to strongly reinforce the bedrock principles of individual liberty on which this nation was founded , and to establish clear limits on the assertion of corporate rights in defiance of federal law and individual rights . ”
Meanwhile , Republican critics of Mr. Obama ’ s health reforms hailed the Supreme Court ’ s decision to take up the case , rallying around business owners to promote religious liberty and condemn what they view as a green light for abortion-causing drugs .
By taking up two of the challenges , the Supreme Court leaves many companies waiting in the wings to see how it could affect their claims .
“ Although we will not get a chance to argue our specific case before the Supreme Court , we are hopeful that the Court will decide in favor of Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp , thus supporting the religious liberty of business owners who oppose the HHS mandate , including our family , ” said John Kennedy , president and CEO of the Autocam company in Michigan .","The Supreme Court on Tuesday set up another showdown over President Obama’s health care law, agreeing to decide whether the government may force for-profit companies to insure birth control as part of their health plans, even if it violates the owners’ religious beliefs.

“This legal challenge has always remained about one thing and one thing only: the right of our family businesses to live out our sincere and deeply held religious convictions as guaranteed by the law and the Constitution,” said David Green, founder and CEO of the Oklahoma City-based Hobby Lobby crafts chain, which won its lower court challenge. “Business owners should not have to choose between violating their faith and violating the law.”

Texas ’ s new abortion law – one of the toughest in the country – is only the latest in a string of efforts to limit abortions in numerous states across the US .
Members of the pro-life movement spend countless dollars and hours on rallies and lobbying without providing adequate financial and emotional support for women to actually maintain pregnancies . And the majority of women who have abortions cite not being able to afford a child as one of the main reasons for their decision .
Let ’ s look at , for example , the resources spent on one of the biggest spectacles of the pro-life movement , the March for Life in Washington , D.C . Supporters spend millions on the annual rally that draws hundreds of thousands to the American capital in January , around the anniversary of Roe v. Wade .
As a college junior at a private Catholic school in Arlington , Va. , I ’ ve witnessed the March for Life three times . Each year students who wish to attend are excused from classes to travel as a group to nearby Washington , D.C. , to attend the march and a mass that precedes it . I have witnessed firsthand how significant the event can be to the people who attend it , but I was still surprised when I found out some Catholic dioceses are already recruiting for the March for Life in 2014 . People are willing to plan and fundraise for months to attend a political event that lasts a few hours .
The Diocese of Kansas City , for example , is currently charging $ 320 for adults and youth ( the cost is much less for members of the clergy or religious life ) to attend the march . Last year an estimated 650,000 people attended . For the sake of simple estimation , let ’ s say that even just a tenth of those attendees – 65,000 people – pay $ 320 to attend . That comes out to an estimated $ 20.8 million spent by individuals passionate enough to travel to Washington and protest the legality of abortion in the United States . All of this is , supposedly , to protect the life of the unborn .
According to figures on the websites ehow.com , webmd.com , and vitaminshoppe.com , the average cost of prenatal care alone for an uninsured woman in a healthy pregnancy is around $ 3,146 . That ’ s $ 1,862 for regular visits to the doctor , $ 1,000 for routine tests , $ 200 for an ultrasound , and $ 84 dollars for nine months of prenatal vitamins .
That ’ s just the cost of pre-natal care . That doesn ’ t include the cost of delivering the child , or the cost of raising that child for 18 years afterward . Nor does it include the cost to the government – and taxpayers – of managing children in foster care when their parents are unwilling or unable to care for them .
It ’ s no surprise that , according to a study by the Guttmacher Institute in 2005 , 73 percent of women terminating their pregnancies cited not being able to afford a baby as a reason for their decision .
So while pro-life Americans spend millions of dollars on events geared toward making abortion illegal , there were 1.16 million women who came to the conclusion in 2009 ( a figure that has steadily decreased since the 1990s ) that they could not carry their child to term – many of them because of money . The money spent on the March for Life alone could pay for prenatal care for around 6,600 women , or prenatal vitamins for nearly 250,000 .
Even if those who participate in the March for Life were able to successfully revoke the legality of abortion in the US , or substantially limit the time in which women can obtain an abortion , statistics indicate that it wouldn ’ t necessarily protect the unborn . The Guttmacher Institute ’ s statistics show that abortion rates are higher in countries where it is illegal and procedures are often unsafe .
Even more disheartening are statistics from the Turnaway Study done by The University of California , San Francisco , which showed that women who sought abortions and were turned away ( because they had passed their state 's gestational limits ) were three times more likely to fall into poverty than women who obtained an abortion .

A woman ’ s decision to have an abortion often stems from a very real and legitimate fear that she will not be able to care for a child . Pro-life supporters and activists spend incredibly large sums to take away that decision , but do not provide the equivalent practical support women need to have a baby . Is that really a fight for life ? Or just a fight for a long sought-after political goal ? It ’ s time the pro-life movement focuses its resources more on helping women and babies , not gaining legislative power that ultimately will do little to protect the unborn .

The money spent on the March for Life alone could pay for prenatal care for around 6,600 women, or prenatal vitamins for nearly 250,000.



Even if those who participate in the March for Life were able to successfully revoke the legality of abortion in the US, or substantially limit the time in which women can obtain an abortion, statistics indicate that it wouldn’t necessarily protect the unborn. The Guttmacher Institute’s statistics show that abortion rates are higher in countries where it is illegal and procedures are often unsafe.

Even more disheartening are statistics from the Turnaway Study done by The University of California, San Francisco, which showed that women who sought abortions and were turned away (because they had passed their state's gestational limits) were three times more likely to fall into poverty than women who obtained an abortion.

A woman’s decision to have an abortion often stems from a very real and legitimate fear that she will not be able to care for a child. Pro-life supporters and activists spend incredibly large sums to take away that decision, but do not provide the equivalent practical support women need to have a baby. Is that really a fight for life? Or just a fight for a long sought-after political goal? It’s time the pro-life movement focuses its resources more on helping women and babies, not gaining legislative power that ultimately will do little to protect the unborn.

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — The University of Alabama gave back a philanthropist’s $26.5 million donation and took his name off the law school Friday, a week after he called on students to boycott the institution over the state’s new abortion ban.

Hugh F. Culverhouse Jr., a 70-year-old Florida real estate investor, said he has no doubt the board of trustees acted in response to his remarks, and he complained that the state of Alabama is only reinforcing its reputation as “the land of the backward,” full of “hicks.”

abortion,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2019/5/15/18623073/roe-wade-abortion-georgia-alabama-supreme-court,"Yes, Roe really is in trouble",2019-05-15,"Scott Lemieux, Constance Grady, Sean Collins, Sigal Samuel, Aja Romano, David Roberts, Umair Irfan","It ’ s been a bad few weeks for supporters of reproductive freedom .
On Tuesday , the Alabama legislature passed one of the most restrictive abortion bills in the country , banning the procedure with no exception for rape or incest . Last week , Georgia passed a so-called “ heartbeat ” bill that would prohibit an abortion once a fetal heartbeat can be picked up — the fourth such bill to be passed in 2019 .
These laws will surely be challenged and make their way to the Supreme Court . Once there , reproductive rights advocates worry that the newly empowered conservative majority , entrenched by President Trump in the wake of Justice Anthony Kennedy ’ s retirement , will use the opportunity to finally strike down Roe v. Wade .
But not everyone thinks that ’ s necessarily what lies ahead . The thinking goes that these bills are so extreme that they seem almost designed to be struck down by the high court — and that is of a piece with how the Republican establishment views abortion , which it basically sees as more effective at ginning up the base when it remains a live issue .
The Niskanen Institute ’ s Will Wilkinson , a generally astute writer , said of the Georgia bill , “ it seems pretty clear to me [ the authors the bill ] want it to be overturned. ” And why would Republicans want that ? “ They want to keep their base mad and run on it forever , but never catch the car. ” Following Kennedy ’ s retirement in 2018 , Slate ’ s William Saletan explained “ Why Republicans don ’ t actually want to repeal Roe. ” Kathleen Parker of the Washington Post , immediately before Trump ’ s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh , asserted that no Court majority would want to overrule Roe and “ be credited with upending settled law and causing massive societal upheaval . ”
It ’ s not an outlandish claim . After all , five Republican nominees were part of the original Roe majority , and the decision has now survived more than two decades with a Supreme Court median vote nominated by anti-abortion presidents . It seems plausible that Republican elites would rather have Roe on the books to rally the rank and file than pay the political price of overruling it .
But this argument fails to withstand serious historical scrutiny . The survival of Roe was not the inevitable product of some master Republican plan , but a contingent series of flukes and historical accidents . And just this week , the Court ’ s conservative majority showed its willingness to overturn decades-old precedent . Roe still being law in 2019 represents remarkable good luck for supporters of reproductive freedom . With Republicans capturing the Senate in 2014 and winning the presidency in 2016 , and Trump replacing Kennedy in 2018 , this luck has almost certainly run out .
The idea that the Republican Party doesn ’ t really want to repeal Roe v. Wade — that the landmark abortion case is more useful to it as a mobilizing issue — rests on Supreme Court decisions that were the product less of political scheming and more of happenstance and luck .
Roe was in serious jeopardy as early as the late ’ 80s , as the Reagan administration took the position that Roe should be overruled and states passed envelope-pushing statutes to generate test cases . In 1989 , the Court issued a ruling in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services , which considered a Missouri law that defined life as beginning at conception and declared that “ unborn children have protectable interests in life , health , and well-being . ”
But Roe survived the first major attempt to dismantle it . Chief Justice William Rehnquist ( who dissented in Roe ) tried to assemble a coalition for effectively ending Roe but fell one vote short . The result was an opinion that expressed hostility to Roe without changing the legal status quo .
The roadblock was Justice Sandra Day O ’ Connor , who in a concurrence insisted that the Missouri statute did not require the Court to consider whether Roe was correctly decided because the “ fetal personhood ” language did not have concrete legal meaning .
Roe survived , but the threat was clear . “ For today , the women of this nation still retain the liberty to control their destinies , ” Justice Harry Blackmun , Roe ’ s author , famously wrote in his dissent . “ But the signs are evident and very ominous , and a chill wind blows . ”
By 1991 , the Court ’ s two liberal lions , William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall , were gone , replaced by nominees of President George H.W . Bush . Combined with the four apparent anti-Roe votes in Webster , this seemed to make overturning Roe a question of “ when , ” not “ if . ”
The apparent vehicle was the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey . The case involved a Pennsylvania statute that imposed several restrictions on abortion that the Court ’ s previous applications of Roe had deemed unconstitutional . The American Civil Liberties Union ’ s Kathryn Kolbert , who argued the challenge to the Pennsylvania ’ s statute in front of the Court , essentially assumed that Roe was doomed and largely dedicated her argument to urging the Court to directly face the question of whether Roe was still good law , rather than continuing to dodge the question as it had in Webster .
But the expected ruling didn ’ t happen . After initially voting in conference to overrule Roe , Justice Anthony Kennedy ended up collaborating with fellow Republican nominees Sandra Day O ’ Connor and David Souter to craft a compromise upholding Roe .
The essential holding of Roe — that the 14th Amendment protects the right to choose to have an abortion prior to fetal viability — was explicitly reaffirmed . But Roe ’ s “ trimester framework , ” which forbade virtually any regulation of first-trimester abortions , would be replaced with the “ undue burden ” test O ’ Connor had long advocated .
Under the undue burden test , which basically held that a law could not place an undue burden on someone seeking an abortion , the Court struck down Pennsylvania ’ s requirement that a married woman inform her husband before obtaining an abortion . But it upheld the statute ’ s other regulations , including a mandatory 24-hour waiting period and a requirement that minors obtain the consent of at least one parent .
Casey provided substantially less protection for reproductive freedom than Roe but was still greatly preferable to overruling it altogether . It is this Casey compromise , crafted by the moderate appointees of Republican presidents , on which the idea that the GOP doesn ’ t really want to repeal Roe largely rests .
Was this what Republican elites wanted all along ? There is not , in fact , any reason to believe so . If one looks at the circumstances that brought each of the Casey three to the Court , it ’ s clear that Casey wasn ’ t the product of clever scheming by Republicans .
O ’ Connor was Ronald Reagan ’ s first Supreme Court nominee because Reagan had promised to nominate the first female Supreme Court justice . While O ’ Connor had displayed some moderation on abortion as a state legislator in Arizona , she was the most conservative woman who was considered a viable nominee . She wasn ’ t chosen because of her relative moderation on abortion . ( Indeed , had Gerald Ford nominated a woman instead of John Paul Stevens in 1975 , it is highly likely that Reagan would have chosen an anti-Roe conservative as his first nominee . )
Kennedy was confirmed to the Court only because a Democratic Senate rejected Reagan ’ s first choice , Robert Bork , an icon in conservative legal circles whom Republican elites certainly wanted to be confirmed . Bork , who labeled Roe an “ unconstitutional decision ” in congressional testimony in 1981 , unquestionably would have voted to overrule it . Had Reagan nominated another orthodox conservative without Bork ’ s extensive history of inflammatory public comments in 1987 , it is overwhelmingly likely Roe would have been dead in 1990 . ( His next pick after Bork dropped out , Douglas Ginsburg , was also forced to withdraw amid controversy over his personal conduct , including his admission that he had smoked marijuana several times . )
As for Souter — long the bane of conservatives for being a moderate who got on the Court under a Republican — he was hardly the product of a conscious plan to preserve Roe . As Jan Crawford reported in her book about the Roberts Court , the Souter choice emerged out of odd intra-administration conflicts ; most notably , some conservatives in the Department of Justice torpedoed the potential nomination of orthodox conservative Ken Starr because he disagreed with them on an obscure federalism issue . Bush then went to Souter in large measure because two New Hampshirites in his inner circle — Chief of Staff John Sununu and Sen. Warren Rudman — assured him that Souter was a reliable , solid conservative . They were wrong , but Bush certainly wasn ’ t trying to select a liberal .
It ’ s worth noting that if Bush had had a secret plan to preserve Roe , he likely would not have nominated Clarence Thomas in 1991 , a staunch conservative widely and correctly perceived to be anti-Roe . It ’ s also worth noting that in 1991 , there was nothing in the record of Anthony Kennedy — who joined Rehnquist ’ s opinion in Webster , not O ’ Connor ’ s more moderate concurrence — to suggest he supported upholding Roe . That means that irrespective of Souter ’ s position on the question , Kennedy voting against Roe , as his Webster vote suggested , would have made Thomas the fifth and decisive vote .
Now , it ’ s fair to say that during this period , Republican presidents were not single-minded about Roe . But in the years since , abortion has become nothing less than a litmus test . The rise of the Federalist Society , which was founded in 1982 and became steadily more influential over time , was in large measure to ensure that another accident like Souter didn ’ t happen .
The fact remains , however , that none of the post-1980 Republican justices were selected for the purpose of preserving Roe . And had Reagan simply gotten his first choice in 1987 , Roe would have been dead .
Since 1992 , Casey has been the controlling precedent on abortion . Especially after O ’ Connor left the Court in 2006 , the case has allowed states more and more leeway to regulate abortion , although in 2016 , a Texas law that would have caused more than half of Texas ’ s abortion clinics to close finally went too far for Kennedy .
With Kennedy no longer on the Court , the situation for reproductive rights is about to get worse ; the only question is how much worse .
It is true that ending Roe would be unpopular , which is an argument pundits like Saletan and Parker have made about why Republicans won ’ t let the law fall in the end . But it would be odd indeed to use this fact to conclude that therefore Republican elites don ’ t want it to happen . Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and enact Trump ’ s tax cuts were enormously unpopular , but they did the latter and were one vote away from the former anyway .
To see what Republicans really think about abortion , just look at the two-track strategy of doing as much as possible to limit access to abortion under existing law while teeing up vehicles to get Roe overruled . Ohio is an example of a state that has pursued both approaches . In addition to the “ fetal heartbeat ” bill that directly challenges Roe , it has also targeted abortion clinics with onerous legal restrictions , with the result that the number of abortion clinics in the state has been reduced from 45 in 1992 to 10 today .
In addition , the idea that Roe being overturned will mean that evangelicals will no longer have the issue to rally around is puzzling . If Roe is overruled , the result would be conflicts over abortion laws in most states as well as Congress . And preserving the movement ’ s legislative victories would still require maintaining control of the Supreme Court .
The only hope for Roe , then , lies with Chief Justice Roberts , now the Court ’ s median vote on the issue . Could Roberts , who disappointed conservatives by casting the deciding vote to uphold most of the Affordable Care Act , cross them again by saving Roe ?
This is highly unlikely . NFIB v. Sebelius , the vote that saved Obamacare , was a rare exception in Roberts ’ s track record , and even in that case , he inflicted significant damage on the statute ’ s expansion of Medicaid . From eviscerating the Voting Rights Act to gutting campaign finance law , Roberts has generally sided with longstanding movement conservative priorities even when the results are unpopular . On abortion , he voted with the minority in the 2016 case to uphold the Texas anti-abortion law , which , if left in place , would in itself effectively render Roe a nullity by allowing states to stop abortion clinics from operating .
It is true that Roberts has often tried to slowly dismantle precedents he dislikes rather than overruling them immediately . The Court may well take the judicial obfuscation route in dismantling Roe , starting with cases that give states more leeway to restrict abortions instead of explicitly announcing that it is overruling Roe immediately , giving conservative policy victories without the political costs . The Court is likely to try to put off consideration of the laws ( like Georgia ’ s and Alabama ’ s ) that most directly threaten Roe until after the 2020 elections .
But the willingness to overturn decades-old precedent is there . Just this week , the Court ’ s conservative majority ruled , in Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt , to throw stare decisis out the window and overrule a 1979 decision on whether a state could be sued in another state ’ s courts — not because the decision had proven unworkable or any relevant facts had changed but because a bare majority of the Court would have ruled differently had they heard the case in the first instance .
The decision had nothing to do with abortion — and everything to do with it . In a dissenting opinion , Justice Stephen Breyer sent up a warning flare : “ Today ’ s decision can only cause one to wonder which cases the court will overrule next . ”
However the Court describes what it ’ s doing to Roe , in short order , states will have the tools necessary to make abortion almost or entirely inaccessible for tens of millions of Americans . Eventually , the Court will have to face Roe head on , and it ’ s overwhelmingly likely that it will overrule Roe if Roberts is the median vote — and a near certainty if a Republican president can replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Stephen Breyer .","It’s been a bad few weeks for supporters of reproductive freedom.

By 1991, the Court’s two liberal lions, William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, were gone, replaced by nominees of President George H.W. Bush. Combined with the four apparent anti-Roe votes in Webster, this seemed to make overturning Roe a question of “when,” not “if.”

The apparent vehicle was the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The case involved a Pennsylvania statute that imposed several restrictions on abortion that the Court’s previous applications of Roe had deemed unconstitutional. The American Civil Liberties Union’s Kathryn Kolbert, who argued the challenge to the Pennsylvania’s statute in front of the Court, essentially assumed that Roe was doomed and largely dedicated her argument to urging the Court to directly face the question of whether Roe was still good law, rather than continuing to dodge the question as it had in Webster.

But the expected ruling didn’t happen. After initially voting in conference to overrule Roe, Justice Anthony Kennedy ended up collaborating with fellow Republican nominees Sandra Day O’Connor and David Souter to craft a compromise upholding Roe.

The essential holding of Roe — that the 14th Amendment protects the right to choose to have an abortion prior to fetal viability — was explicitly reaffirmed. But Roe’s “trimester framework,” which forbade virtually any regulation of first-trimester abortions, would be replaced with the “undue burden” test O’Connor had long advocated.

Under the undue burden test, which basically held that a law could not place an undue burden on someone seeking an abortion, the Court struck down Pennsylvania’s requirement that a married woman inform her husband before obtaining an abortion. But it upheld the statute’s other regulations, including a mandatory 24-hour waiting period and a requirement that minors obtain the consent of at least one parent.

Casey provided substantially less protection for reproductive freedom than Roe but was still greatly preferable to overruling it altogether. It is this Casey compromise, crafted by the moderate appointees of Republican presidents, on which the idea that the GOP doesn’t really want to repeal Roe largely rests.

The center-right compromise on Roe

Was this what Republican elites wanted all along? There is not, in fact, any reason to believe so. If one looks at the circumstances that brought each of the Casey three to the Court, it’s clear that Casey wasn’t the product of clever scheming by Republicans.

O’Connor was Ronald Reagan’s first Supreme Court nominee because Reagan had promised to nominate the first female Supreme Court justice. While O’Connor had displayed some moderation on abortion as a state legislator in Arizona, she was the most conservative woman who was considered a viable nominee. She wasn’t chosen because of her relative moderation on abortion. (Indeed, had Gerald Ford nominated a woman instead of John Paul Stevens in 1975, it is highly likely that Reagan would have chosen an anti-Roe conservative as his first nominee.)

Kennedy was confirmed to the Court only because a Democratic Senate rejected Reagan’s first choice, Robert Bork, an icon in conservative legal circles whom Republican elites certainly wanted to be confirmed. Bork, who labeled Roe an “unconstitutional decision” in congressional testimony in 1981, unquestionably would have voted to overrule it. Had Reagan nominated another orthodox conservative without Bork’s extensive history of inflammatory public comments in 1987, it is overwhelmingly likely Roe would have been dead in 1990. (His next pick after Bork dropped out, Douglas Ginsburg, was also forced to withdraw amid controversy over his personal conduct, including his admission that he had smoked marijuana several times.)

As for Souter — long the bane of conservatives for being a moderate who got on the Court under a Republican — he was hardly the product of a conscious plan to preserve Roe. As Jan Crawford reported in her book about the Roberts Court, the Souter choice emerged out of odd intra-administration conflicts; most notably, some conservatives in the Department of Justice torpedoed the potential nomination of orthodox conservative Ken Starr because he disagreed with them on an obscure federalism issue. Bush then went to Souter in large measure because two New Hampshirites in his inner circle — Chief of Staff John Sununu and Sen. Warren Rudman — assured him that Souter was a reliable, solid conservative. They were wrong, but Bush certainly wasn’t trying to select a liberal.

It’s worth noting that if Bush had had a secret plan to preserve Roe, he likely would not have nominated Clarence Thomas in 1991, a staunch conservative widely and correctly perceived to be anti-Roe. It’s also worth noting that in 1991, there was nothing in the record of Anthony Kennedy — who joined Rehnquist’s opinion in Webster, not O’Connor’s more moderate concurrence — to suggest he supported upholding Roe. That means that irrespective of Souter’s position on the question, Kennedy voting against Roe, as his Webster vote suggested, would have made Thomas the fifth and decisive vote.

Now, it’s fair to say that during this period, Republican presidents were not single-minded about Roe. But in the years since, abortion has become nothing less than a litmus test. The rise of the Federalist Society, which was founded in 1982 and became steadily more influential over time, was in large measure to ensure that another accident like Souter didn’t happen.

The fact remains, however, that none of the post-1980 Republican justices were selected for the purpose of preserving Roe. And had Reagan simply gotten his first choice in 1987, Roe would have been dead.

The fate of Roe

Since 1992, Casey has been the controlling precedent on abortion. Especially after O’Connor left the Court in 2006, the case has allowed states more and more leeway to regulate abortion, although in 2016, a Texas law that would have caused more than half of Texas’s abortion clinics to close finally went too far for Kennedy.

With Kennedy no longer on the Court, the situation for reproductive rights is about to get worse; the only question is how much worse.

It is true that ending Roe would be unpopular, which is an argument pundits like Saletan and Parker have made about why Republicans won’t let the law fall in the end. But it would be odd indeed to use this fact to conclude that therefore Republican elites don’t want it to happen. Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and enact Trump’s tax cuts were enormously unpopular, but they did the latter and were one vote away from the former anyway.

To see what Republicans really think about abortion, just look at the two-track strategy of doing as much as possible to limit access to abortion under existing law while teeing up vehicles to get Roe overruled. Ohio is an example of a state that has pursued both approaches. In addition to the “fetal heartbeat” bill that directly challenges Roe, it has also targeted abortion clinics with onerous legal restrictions, with the result that the number of abortion clinics in the state has been reduced from 45 in 1992 to 10 today.

In addition, the idea that Roe being overturned will mean that evangelicals will no longer have the issue to rally around is puzzling. If Roe is overruled, the result would be conflicts over abortion laws in most states as well as Congress. And preserving the movement’s legislative victories would still require maintaining control of the Supreme Court.

The only hope for Roe, then, lies with Chief Justice Roberts, now the Court’s median vote on the issue. Could Roberts, who disappointed conservatives by casting the deciding vote to uphold most of the Affordable Care Act, cross them again by saving Roe?

This is highly unlikely. NFIB v. Sebelius, the vote that saved Obamacare, was a rare exception in Roberts’s track record, and even in that case, he inflicted significant damage on the statute’s expansion of Medicaid. From eviscerating the Voting Rights Act to gutting campaign finance law, Roberts has generally sided with longstanding movement conservative priorities even when the results are unpopular. On abortion, he voted with the minority in the 2016 case to uphold the Texas anti-abortion law, which, if left in place, would in itself effectively render Roe a nullity by allowing states to stop abortion clinics from operating.

It is true that Roberts has often tried to slowly dismantle precedents he dislikes rather than overruling them immediately. The Court may well take the judicial obfuscation route in dismantling Roe, starting with cases that give states more leeway to restrict abortions instead of explicitly announcing that it is overruling Roe immediately, giving conservative policy victories without the political costs. The Court is likely to try to put off consideration of the laws (like Georgia’s and Alabama’s) that most directly threaten Roe until after the 2020 elections.

But the willingness to overturn decades-old precedent is there. Just this week, the Court’s conservative majority ruled, in Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt, to throw stare decisis out the window and overrule a 1979 decision on whether a state could be sued in another state’s courts — not because the decision had proven unworkable or any relevant facts had changed but because a bare majority of the Court would have ruled differently had they heard the case in the first instance.

The decision had nothing to do with abortion — and everything to do with it. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Stephen Breyer sent up a warning flare: “Today’s decision can only cause one to wonder which cases the court will overrule next.”

However the Court describes what it’s doing to Roe, in short order, states will have the tools necessary to make abortion almost or entirely inaccessible for tens of millions of Americans. Eventually, the Court will have to face Roe head on, and it’s overwhelmingly likely that it will overrule Roe if Roberts is the median vote — and a near certainty if a Republican president can replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Stephen Breyer.",www.vox.com,left,to8fZ1EWctN6Gp2q

WASHINGTON — A steady stream of abortion cases are heading toward the Supreme Court, making it only a matter of time before the justices are likely to consider a new wave of state restrictions.

Although the justices have refused to consider two major cases from Oklahoma in the past two weeks, more states are seeking the high court's blessing for restrictions that have been struck down by state and federal appeals courts.

As conflicting decisions at those courts pile up, it becomes more likely that the justices will agree to consider laws such as those banning abortions after 20 weeks, regulating the use of abortion-inducing drugs, imposing restrictions on clinics and doctors, and requiring that women receive counseling and testing before ending their pregnancies.

""It's a pivotal moment,"" says Caitlin Borgmann, a City University of New York law professor who writes a blog on reproductive rights. ""The restrictions are now getting to a point where they're actually shutting down clinics.""

The court already has on its January calendar a challenge to Massachusetts' 35-foot buffer zone around abortion clinics. Early next month, justices are likely to grant another case challenging the requirement under President Obama's health care law that nearly all employers provide insurance coverage for contraceptives.

Those two cases represent conservatives' challenges to state and federal laws providing added protections for women's health. But the overwhelming majority of cases headed to the high court focus on efforts by states to restrict or limit abortions.

The court refused Tuesday to consider Oklahoma's appeal of a state Supreme Court ruling striking down a requirement that women have ultrasound tests performed, displayed and explained before getting abortions. But a North Carolina case working its way through lower courts eventually could reach the justices.

Last week, the court turned away another Oklahoma appeal of a state Supreme Court decision striking down a law that restricts abortion-inducing drugs to the uses approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Because doctors prefer off-label uses in most cases, the law would have banned almost all medication abortions.

Whatever cases the justices ultimately agree to hear, they will offer the court a chance to clarify its 1992 ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which upheld abortion rights but gave states broader authority to impose restrictions such as 24-hour waiting periods and parental consent.

""The stakes have been ratcheted up,"" says Teresa Collett, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas in Minneapolis who had hoped to defend Oklahoma's mandatory ultrasound law at the Supreme Court. ""The stakes are higher for both sides.""

Since its landmark 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade established a woman's right to abortion, the Supreme Court has revisited the issue on a sporadic basis, and limits have increased.

A 1980 case restricted the use of Medicaid funds for abortions to cases involving rape, incest or the woman's health. Casey approved a range of restrictions in 1992. And in 2007, the justices upheld a federal ban on so-called partial-birth abortions, usually performed between 20 and 24 weeks of pregnancy.

Since then, state restrictions have multiplied. In 2011, 92 provisions passed in 24 states. Last year there were 43 more, according to a survey by the Guttmacher Institute, a sexual and reproductive health think tank that supports abortion rights.

While opponents of abortion may be winning in state legislatures, backers of abortion rights have beaten back many of those laws in court. That has led state officials to appeal their cases to the Supreme Court in hopes that Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the Casey opinion with two colleagues who have since retired, will side with other conservative justices and approve more restrictions.

""If the court decides to take an abortion case, it could certainly use the case to further elaborate on the standard that should be applied to evaluate abortion restrictions,"" says Jennifer Dalvin of the American Civil Liberties Union.

Among the cases headed toward the high court:

-- A Texas law banning most abortions from medications such as Mifepristone, also known as RU-486, and requiring doctors who perform abortions to get hospital admitting privileges. A district court judge struck down the hospital provision, but an appeals court said it could take effect pending the state's challenge. That ruling has been appealed to the Supreme Court.

-- An Arizona law banning most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, by which point the fetus may feel pain. That is before the fetus becomes capable of surviving outside the womb, making it a direct challenge to Roe and Casey.

abortion,Reason,2,https://reason.com/blog/2018/09/11/thinkprogress-kavanaugh-facebook-weekly,ThinkProgress Accuses Facebook of Censorship After Conservative Factchecker Correctly Points Out an Error,2018-09-11,"Scott Shackford, Josh Blackman, Christian Britschgi, Eugene Volokh, Eric Boehm, Joe Setyon","Ian Millhiser , justice editor at ThinkProgress , is upset that The Weekly Standard—a right-of-center magazine whose editors have been granted the power to formally factcheck articles for Facebook—recently labelled one of his articles `` false . ''
But the claim made by the article 's headline— '' Brett Kavanaugh said he would kill Roe v. Wade last week and almost no one noticed '' —is at the very least quite misleading .
ThinkProgress is a left-of-center news site published by the Center for American Progress . Its writers have previously expressed concerns that Facebook would award an explicitly conservative media outlet factchecker status , a privilege enjoyed by just four other organizations : the Associated Press , Factcheck.org , Politifact , and Snopes.com . Articles tagged as false will lose `` 80 percent of future traffic , '' according to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg , and thus the stakes are indeed quite high for media organizations .
`` At its peak , Facebook provided as much as 40 percent of ThinkProgress ' traffic , '' writes Millhiser . `` Facebook recently changed its algorithm in ways that reduced the amount of traffic it sent to most news outlets , but it still accounts for between 10 to 15 percent of our readers . The difference between keeping those readers and losing them could decide whether we can hire more reporters who will continue to report on subjects that the Weekly Standard may have ideological disagreements about . ''
As a legal matter , Facebook is treading on very dangerous ground by providing no oversight of its own `` fact checking '' operation . In its landmark decision in New York Times v. Sullivan , the Supreme Court held that an outlet can be liable for defamation if it publishes false information `` with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not . '' By deferring to The Weekly Standard 's `` expertise and process , '' Facebook acted with reckless disregard of whether The Weekly Standard 's article was false or not .
Millhiser appears to believe that ( 1 ) The Weekly Standard erred in labelling the article false , ( 2 ) Facebook erred in giving The Weekly Standard this power in the first place , and ( 3 ) by refusing to correct these errors , Facebook may have exposed itself to liability for defamation .
Claim # 2 is a judgement call , and I ca n't say whether it 's correct . Maybe giving ideological groups factchecking powers was not a good move for Facebook . I wo n't tackle that topic here .
But claims 1 and 3 collapse if The Weekly Standard 's fact-checkers made the right call regarding the `` false '' article . ( Actually , 3 strikes me as dubious , regardless . Defamation is a high bar to clear . ) Let 's take a look .
Again , the headline is `` Brett Kavanaugh said he would kill Roe v. Wade last week and almost no one noticed . '' But Millhiser 's article makes a more nuanced argument . As he summarizes it in the follow-up post :
Kavanaugh cited in his confirmation hearing the `` Glucksberg test '' —which refers to Washington v. Glucksberg , a 1997 Supreme Court decision establishing that the Constitution does not protect a right to physician-assisted suicide . Under Glucksberg , courts should determine which rights are protected by the Constitution by asking which rights are `` deeply rooted in this Nation 's history and tradition . '' Kavanaugh also said in 2017 that `` even a first-year law student could tell you that the Glucksberg 's approach to unenumerated rights was not consistent with the approach of the abortion cases such as Roe vs. Wade in 1973 , as well as the 1992 decision reaffirming Roe , known as Planned Parenthood vs . Casey . '' Our article also cited law professors Jim Oleske and Jamal Greene , both of whom reached similar conclusions regarding Kavanaugh 's embrace of Glucksberg .
Does this information imply that Kavanaugh would be inclined to overturn Roe v. Wade ? A reasonable person might infer that this is so . The article concludes with this statement : `` Judge Kavanaugh appears to be telegraphing his belief that Roe , Obergefell , and the Supreme Court 's decision in Lawrence v. Texas , which provides that the government can not prosecute consenting adults for having sex , were not correctly decided . ''
If the headline had said that Kavanaugh had `` appeared to be telegraphing , '' or `` hinted at , '' or even `` heavily suggested '' he would kill Roe v. Wade , that would be one thing . But `` said '' is a strong word . It makes it sound like Kavanaugh directly stated his intention to kill Roe v. Wade .
In his follow-up , Millhiser concludes that this all hinges on the definition of the verb `` said . '' So he turns to the dictionary , which does indeed list `` indicate , show , and communicate , '' as possible definitions for the word . But said is generally used as a synonym for indicate , show , and communicate when the subject of the sentence is a thing that ca n't use words . That look in your eyes can say a great deal , but not literally—a `` look '' does n't use words . People , on the other hand , do use words , so when writers describe a person as having said something , it 's implied that they did so with their mouths .
This may seem like nitpicking , but we 're in the midst of an intense news cycle revolving around the question of whether Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade . A headline that straightforwardly claims he admitted he would do so is manipulating readers ' expectations , and thus the claim should have been hedged in the headline—even just a little bit—as it was in the article . If the claim is The Weekly Standard was wrong to say this headline is false , then I rate this claim : Mostly false .","Ian Millhiser, justice editor at ThinkProgress, is upset that The Weekly Standard—a right-of-center magazine whose editors have been granted the power to formally factcheck articles for Facebook—recently labelled one of his articles ""false.""

But the claim made by the article's headline—""Brett Kavanaugh said he would kill Roe v. Wade last week and almost no one noticed""—is at the very least quite misleading.

ThinkProgress is a left-of-center news site published by the Center for American Progress. Its writers have previously expressed concerns that Facebook would award an explicitly conservative media outlet factchecker status, a privilege enjoyed by just four other organizations: the Associated Press, Factcheck.org, Politifact, and Snopes.com. Articles tagged as false will lose ""80 percent of future traffic,"" according to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and thus the stakes are indeed quite high for media organizations.

""At its peak, Facebook provided as much as 40 percent of ThinkProgress' traffic,"" writes Millhiser. ""Facebook recently changed its algorithm in ways that reduced the amount of traffic it sent to most news outlets, but it still accounts for between 10 to 15 percent of our readers. The difference between keeping those readers and losing them could decide whether we can hire more reporters who will continue to report on subjects that the Weekly Standard may have ideological disagreements about.""

Millhiser continued:

As a legal matter, Facebook is treading on very dangerous ground by providing no oversight of its own ""fact checking"" operation. In its landmark decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, the Supreme Court held that an outlet can be liable for defamation if it publishes false information ""with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not."" By deferring to The Weekly Standard's ""expertise and process,"" Facebook acted with reckless disregard of whether The Weekly Standard's article was false or not.

Millhiser appears to believe that (1) The Weekly Standard erred in labelling the article false, (2) Facebook erred in giving The Weekly Standard this power in the first place, and (3) by refusing to correct these errors, Facebook may have exposed itself to liability for defamation.

Claim #2 is a judgement call, and I can't say whether it's correct. Maybe giving ideological groups factchecking powers was not a good move for Facebook. I won't tackle that topic here.

But claims 1 and 3 collapse if The Weekly Standard's fact-checkers made the right call regarding the ""false"" article. (Actually, 3 strikes me as dubious, regardless. Defamation is a high bar to clear.) Let's take a look.

Again, the headline is ""Brett Kavanaugh said he would kill Roe v. Wade last week and almost no one noticed."" But Millhiser's article makes a more nuanced argument. As he summarizes it in the follow-up post:

Kavanaugh cited in his confirmation hearing the ""Glucksberg test""—which refers to Washington v. Glucksberg, a 1997 Supreme Court decision establishing that the Constitution does not protect a right to physician-assisted suicide. Under Glucksberg, courts should determine which rights are protected by the Constitution by asking which rights are ""deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition."" Kavanaugh also said in 2017 that ""even a first-year law student could tell you that the Glucksberg's approach to unenumerated rights was not consistent with the approach of the abortion cases such as Roe vs. Wade in 1973, as well as the 1992 decision reaffirming Roe, known as Planned Parenthood vs. Casey."" Our article also cited law professors Jim Oleske and Jamal Greene, both of whom reached similar conclusions regarding Kavanaugh's embrace of Glucksberg.

Does this information imply that Kavanaugh would be inclined to overturn Roe v. Wade? A reasonable person might infer that this is so. The article concludes with this statement: ""Judge Kavanaugh appears to be telegraphing his belief that Roe, Obergefell, and the Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas, which provides that the government cannot prosecute consenting adults for having sex, were not correctly decided.""

If the headline had said that Kavanaugh had ""appeared to be telegraphing,"" or ""hinted at,"" or even ""heavily suggested"" he would kill Roe v. Wade, that would be one thing. But ""said"" is a strong word. It makes it sound like Kavanaugh directly stated his intention to kill Roe v. Wade.

In his follow-up, Millhiser concludes that this all hinges on the definition of the verb ""said."" So he turns to the dictionary, which does indeed list ""indicate, show, and communicate,"" as possible definitions for the word. But said is generally used as a synonym for indicate, show, and communicate when the subject of the sentence is a thing that can't use words. That look in your eyes can say a great deal, but not literally—a ""look"" doesn't use words. People, on the other hand, do use words, so when writers describe a person as having said something, it's implied that they did so with their mouths.

This may seem like nitpicking, but we're in the midst of an intense news cycle revolving around the question of whether Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. A headline that straightforwardly claims he admitted he would do so is manipulating readers' expectations, and thus the claim should have been hedged in the headline—even just a little bit—as it was in the article.

Opponents of abortion rights are more likely to be Republican than Democratic . And Donald Trump was the anti-abortion rights presidential candidate in the 2016 election .
But that does n't mean the 2017 March For Life on Friday was exactly a Trump rally . The red Make America Great Again hats that speckled the crowd at Trump 's inauguration last week were few and far between , and marchers ranged from enthusiastic Trump supporters to people who fear what his presidency might mean — despite his opposition to abortion . Multiple attendees said the rally was not about politics . Rather , they said , it 's about one thing only .
Abortion is the top voting issue for Sue Thayer , 57 , who runs what she described as a `` pro-life pregnancy center '' in Storm Lake , Iowa . She 's an independent , and for her , she said , the issue transcends party . She spoke of meeting members of the Democrats for Life at a local hotel .
`` And I was like , 'Oh , we know there 's two of you , ' '' she said , hastening to add , `` That 's a joke . ''
For her , party is far less of a priority than abortion . She said she told a recent Democratic Party caller to her house that she 'd happily donate to any candidates opposed to abortion rights the party might have .
`` There are n't very many [ Democrats ] , '' she said . `` So typically my first issue in voting is , are they pro-life ? But typically that lines up with the Republican Party . I vote based on abortion . ''
Another rally-goer quickly shut down NPR 's questions when we asked her about her political party .
`` I would rather not even talk about that , '' said Mary Lou McGrath , a 50-year-old massage therapist from Pawling , N.Y. `` I really am here because not , 'Why not ? ' More like , 'Why ? Why would n't I stand for life over death ? ' So that 's really why I 'm here today . ''
She added , `` It totally transcends politics . I really hate politics . ''
The crowd was not entirely apolitical . Make America Great Again hats and Trump scarves and winter hats were in the mix , but finding them required some searching .
Vice President Mike Pence and Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway represented the White House , addressing the rally crowd . But the attendees were n't all sold on Trump 's abortion-opposition credentials .
`` I 'm praying for him that it 's not just a matter of expediency , '' said Father Don Bedore , a Catholic priest from Kansas . `` And the future will tell . I mean , it 's hard to look into another person 's heart and see what 's there . ''
Craig Eller , a 52-year-old government worker from Chesapeake , Va. , who said he considers himself a conservative , said of Trump 's abortion positions , `` Yes , of course it concerned me during the election , and I 'm just going to wait and see . I support anyone who supports life . I do n't know what 's in Donald Trump 's mind , but I know that I believe that a child in the womb is a member of the human family , and I 'm going to do what I can to make other people , help them recognize that as well . ''
Not that everyone in the crowd shared that kind of doubtfulness . For many abortion-rights opponents , a Trump presidency , combined with a Republican-controlled Congress and a Supreme Court that already has one opening , is an exciting prospect .
`` I think it 's our best chance really since Roe v. Wade to turn things around and have more of a culture for life , '' Thayer said .
Trump is expected to announce his Supreme Court nominee Thursday to replace the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia . NPR 's Nina Totenberg has reported that the pick is down to three , all conservatives .
For her part , Thayer knows very well that it 's possible to change one 's mind on abortion . She worked in a Planned Parenthood clinic before becoming an abortion-rights opponent , so when asked if Trump 's positions on abortion rattled her — he once called himself `` very pro-choice '' — she empathized .
`` I was pro-choice , and now I 'm pro-life , '' Thayer said . `` And so no , that does n't scare me at all . ''
Hannah Millershaski , 18 , wearing one of Trump 's signature red hats , said she was excited about the possibility that Trump might appoint Supreme Court justices who would oppose abortion rights .
`` I see a great future for America with him in office , '' she said .
While abortion-rights opponents are more likely to be Republican than Democratic ( and advocates are more likely to be Democratic than Republican ) , views on the issue do n't fall neatly along party lines . According to an October poll from the Pew Research Center , 62 percent of Republicans believe abortion should be illegal in all or most cases , leaving one-in-three who believe it should be legal in all or most cases . Likewise , 18 percent of Democrats believe abortion should be illegal in all or most cases — a small but by no means insignificant share .
That means that some of the abortion opponents at the march did n't exactly fall in line behind all of Trump 's policy choices . Father Bedore is one of them , and he worries about immigration in particular .
`` I 'll be honest , where I live , and in my ministry , I encounter a lot of Hispanic families , a lot of people that come up from Mexico , wonderful people , faith-filled people , and they work hard .

Opponents of abortion rights are more likely to be Republican than Democratic. And Donald Trump was the anti-abortion rights presidential candidate in the 2016 election.

But that doesn't mean the 2017 March For Life on Friday was exactly a Trump rally. The red Make America Great Again hats that speckled the crowd at Trump's inauguration last week were few and far between, and marchers ranged from enthusiastic Trump supporters to people who fear what his presidency might mean — despite his opposition to abortion. Multiple attendees said the rally was not about politics. Rather, they said, it's about one thing only.

Abortion is the top voting issue for Sue Thayer, 57, who runs what she described as a ""pro-life pregnancy center"" in Storm Lake, Iowa. She's an independent, and for her, she said, the issue transcends party. She spoke of meeting members of the Democrats for Life at a local hotel.

""And I was like, 'Oh, we know there's two of you,'"" she said, hastening to add, ""That's a joke.""

For her, party is far less of a priority than abortion. She said she told a recent Democratic Party caller to her house that she'd happily donate to any candidates opposed to abortion rights the party might have.

""There aren't very many [Democrats],"" she said. ""So typically my first issue in voting is, are they pro-life? But typically that lines up with the Republican Party. I vote based on abortion.""

Another rally-goer quickly shut down NPR's questions when we asked her about her political party.

""I would rather not even talk about that,"" said Mary Lou McGrath, a 50-year-old massage therapist from Pawling, N.Y. ""I really am here because not, 'Why not?' More like, 'Why? Why wouldn't I stand for life over death?' So that's really why I'm here today.""

She added, ""It totally transcends politics. I really hate politics.""

The crowd was not entirely apolitical. Make America Great Again hats and Trump scarves and winter hats were in the mix, but finding them required some searching.

Vice President Mike Pence and Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway represented the White House, addressing the rally crowd. But the attendees weren't all sold on Trump's abortion-opposition credentials.

His past wavering on the issue made some nervous.

""I'm praying for him that it's not just a matter of expediency,"" said Father Don Bedore, a Catholic priest from Kansas. ""And the future will tell. I mean, it's hard to look into another person's heart and see what's there.""

Craig Eller, a 52-year-old government worker from Chesapeake, Va., who said he considers himself a conservative, said of Trump's abortion positions, ""Yes, of course it concerned me during the election, and I'm just going to wait and see. I support anyone who supports life. I don't know what's in Donald Trump's mind, but I know that I believe that a child in the womb is a member of the human family, and I'm going to do what I can to make other people, help them recognize that as well.""

Not that everyone in the crowd shared that kind of doubtfulness. For many abortion-rights opponents, a Trump presidency, combined with a Republican-controlled Congress and a Supreme Court that already has one opening, is an exciting prospect.

""I think it's our best chance really since Roe v. Wade to turn things around and have more of a culture for life,"" Thayer said.

Trump is expected to announce his Supreme Court nominee Thursday to replace the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. NPR's Nina Totenberg has reported that the pick is down to three, all conservatives.

For her part, Thayer knows very well that it's possible to change one's mind on abortion. She worked in a Planned Parenthood clinic before becoming an abortion-rights opponent, so when asked if Trump's positions on abortion rattled her — he once called himself ""very pro-choice"" — she empathized.

""I was pro-choice, and now I'm pro-life,"" Thayer said. ""And so no, that doesn't scare me at all.""

Hannah Millershaski, 18, wearing one of Trump's signature red hats, said she was excited about the possibility that Trump might appoint Supreme Court justices who would oppose abortion rights.

""I see a great future for America with him in office,"" she said.

While abortion-rights opponents are more likely to be Republican than Democratic (and advocates are more likely to be Democratic than Republican), views on the issue don't fall neatly along party lines. According to an October poll from the Pew Research Center, 62 percent of Republicans believe abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, leaving one-in-three who believe it should be legal in all or most cases. Likewise, 18 percent of Democrats believe abortion should be illegal in all or most cases — a small but by no means insignificant share.

That means that some of the abortion opponents at the march didn't exactly fall in line behind all of Trump's policy choices. Father Bedore is one of them, and he worries about immigration in particular.

""I'll be honest, where I live, and in my ministry, I encounter a lot of Hispanic families, a lot of people that come up from Mexico, wonderful people, faith-filled people, and they work hard. They have a place,"" he said, adding that some of the immigrants he knows are in the country illegally. ""I know people who have been in the process for 15 years, 18 years, and nothing has happened. And it's not fair to them, and that's one area that I really want to see some work done.""

Likewise, those Democrats Thayer met at the hotel were represented at the march. Kristen Day, the executive director of Democrats for Life of America, attended with others from her group. Like many Democrats, she was not exactly excited about Trump's win.

""I wasn't optimistic about what he could do for the country,"" she said.

WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Tuesday dealt a major blow to a California law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about publicly funded abortion and contraception services.

A flurry of states last year enacted restrictive anti-abortion laws, including a handful that banned abortion past a certain point in a pregnancy, and Alabama, which effectively outlawed abortion in most cases. Many of these laws have been blocked in court from taking effect.

The Supreme Court will also hear arguments this year on June Medical Services v. Gee, which involves a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital.

A NPR/PBS News/Marist poll of 944 U.S. adults released in June 2019 echoed those results, showing that 77% of Americans wanted to keep Roe v. Wade in place, but many still wanted additional abortion restrictions or policy changes.

Among the more than three-quarters of Americans who broadly supported Roe, 26% wanted the Supreme Court to keep it but add more restrictions, and 14% supported keeping it but reducing some restrictions, according to that poll. Some 21% wanted to see Roe expanded to secure abortion rights under any circumstance, while 16% wanted to keep it the way it is.

AUSTIN, Texas — Republicans in the Texas Legislature passed an omnibus abortion bill that is one of the most restrictive in the nation, but Democrats vowed Saturday to fight both in the courts and the ballot box as they used the measure to rally their supporters.

More than 2,000 demonstrators filled the Capitol building in Austin to oppose the bill, and state troopers drug six out of the Senate chamber for trying to disrupt the debate.

“It Just Got Harder to Get Birth Control in America,” declares the headline, and the subhead is hardly more accurate: “Title X made sure poor women could have access to health care. The Trump administration has compromised that.”

This is precisely the myth that Planned Parenthood and its activist allies have propagated in the wake of the Protect Life rule. As the Times editorial puts it, the Trump administration “has quietly been working to gut the Title X family planning program.”

In reality, the Trump administration hasn’t reduced federal funding for the Title X program by a cent. Instead, the rule forces providers to choose between federal funding and the profits that come from performing abortions. Planned Parenthood has made its decision.

Williamson, Mairead Mcardle, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Andrew C. Mccarthy, Carrie Severino, John Fund, Tobias Hoonhout, Bill Corsair, Jason Richwine","Infanticide did not go out of fashion with the advance from savagery to barbarism and civilization . Rather , it became , as in Greece and Rome , a recognized custom with advocates among leaders of thought and action .
Clarence C. Little was a cultivated man . He was a Harvard graduate who served as president of the University of Maine and the University of Michigan . He was one of the nation ’ s leading genetics researchers , with a particular interest in cancer . He was managing director of the American Society for the Control of Cancer , later known ( in the interest of verbal economy ) as the American Cancer Society ; the president of the American Eugenics Society , later known ( in the interest of not talking about eugenics ) as the Society for Biodemography and Social Biology ; and a founding board member of the American Birth Control League , today known ( in the interest of euphemism ) as Planned Parenthood . His record as a scientist is not exactly unblemished — he will long be remembered as the man who insisted that “ there is no demonstrated causal relationship between smoking or [ sic ] any disease ” — but he was the very picture of the socially conscious man of science , without whom the National Cancer Institute , among other important bodies , probably would not exist .
Little is one of the early figures in Planned Parenthood whose public pronouncements , along with those of its charismatic foundress , Margaret Sanger , often are pointed to as evidence of the organization ’ s racist origins . ( Students at the University of Michigan are , at the time of this writing , petitioning to have his name stripped from a campus building . ) Little believed that birth-control policy should be constructed in such a way as to protect “ Yankee stock ” — referred to in Sanger ’ s own work as “ unmixed native white parentage , ” if Little ’ s term is not clear enough — from being overwhelmed by what was at the time perceived as the dysgenic fecundity of African Americans , Catholic immigrants , and other undesirables . ( “ The feebleminded are notoriously prolific in reproduction , ” Sanger reported in Woman and the New Race . ) The question of racial differences was an obsession of Little ’ s that went well beyond his interest in eugenics and followed him to the end of his life ; one of his later scientific works was “ The Possible Relation of Genetics to Differences in Negro–White Mortality Rates from Cancer , ” published in the 1960s .
The birth-control movement of the Progressive era is where crude racism met its genteel intellectual cousin : Birth Control Review , the in-house journal of Planned Parenthood ’ s predecessor organization , published a review , by the socialist intellectual Havelock Ellis , of Lothrop Stoddard ’ s The Rising Tide of Color against White World Supremacy . Ellis was an important figure in Sanger ’ s intellectual development and wrote the introduction to her Woman and the New Race ; Stoddard was a popular birth-control advocate whose intellectual contributions included lending to the Nazi racial theorists the term “ untermensch ” as well as developing a great deal of their theoretical framework : He fretted about “ imperfectly Nordicized Alpines ” and such . Like the other eugenics-minded progressives of his time , he saw birth control and immigration as inescapably linked issues .
Stoddard ’ s views were so ordinary a part of the mainstream of American intellectual discourse at the time that F. Scott Fitzgerald could refer to his work in The Great Gatsby without fearing that general readers would be mystified by the reference . What did Stoddard want ? “ We want above all things , ” he wrote ,
to preserve America . But “ America , ” as we have already seen , is not a mere geographical expression ; it is a nation , whose foundations were laid over three hundred years ago by Anglo-Saxon Nordics , and whose nationhood is due almost exclusively to people of North European stock — not only the old colonists and their descendants but also many millions of North Europeans who have entered the country since colonial times and who have for the most part been thoroughly assimilated . Despite the recent influx of alien elements , therefore , the American people is still predominantly a blend of closely related North European strains , and the fabric of American life is fundamentally their creation .
Sanger , who believed that the potential for high civilization resided within “ the cell plasms ” of individual humans , made statements that were substantially similar : “ If we are to develop in America a new race with a racial soul , we must keep the birth rate within the scope of our ability to understand as well as to educate . We must not encourage reproduction beyond our capacity to assimilate our numbers so as to make the coming generation into such physically fit , mentally capable , socially alert individuals as are the ideal of a democracy . ”
Such was the intellectual ferment out of which rose the American birth-control movement — or , rather , the American birth-control movements , of which there were really two . Sanger , working within the socialist–feminist alliance of her time , was a self-styled radical who published a short-lived journal called “ The Woman Rebel , ” the aim of which as described in its inaugural issue was “ to stimulate working women to think for themselves and to build up a conscious fighting character. ” To fight what ? “ Slavery through motherhood. ” The Post Office refused to circulate the periodical , a fact that The Woman Rebel reported with glee : “ The woman rebel feels proud the post office authorities did not approve of her . She shall blush with shame if ever she be approved of by officialism or ‘ comstockism. ’ ” But Sanger and her clique did not have a monopoly on the birth-control market . Her rival was Mary Ware Dennett , founder of — see if this name sounds familiar — the Voluntary Parenthood League ( VPL ) .
Where Sanger was a radical , Dennett was a liberal , couching her advocacy in the familiar language of the American civil-libertarian tradition . She was an ally of the American Civil Liberties Union , which had defended her when she was charged with distributing birth-control literature classified ( as most of it was at the time ) as “ obscene. ” While Sanger ’ s organization was focused on setting up birth-control clinics ( the first was in Brooklyn ) , Dennett ’ s group was focused on lobbying Congress for the legalization of contraception . Sanger ’ s group was characterized by a top-down management structure ( the local affiliates had no say in American Birth Control League policymaking ) and a cash-on-the-barrelhead approach to social reform : Its membership and coffers were swelled in no small part by the fact that the ABCL would not provide birth-control literature to anyone who was not a dues-paying member .
As Linda Gordon put it in The Moral Property of Woman : A History of Birth-Control Politics :
Increasingly the ABCL organized its local affiliates as upper-class women ’ s clubs , even high-society charity groups . In 1926 , league organizing in Philadelphia was focused mainly on women of the Main Line , a group of extremely wealthy suburbs . In Grand Rapids , Michigan , Mrs. C. C. Edmonds , of 1414 Wealthy St. , S.E. , was collecting “ influential people ” for a local group . New York meetings were held in the Bryn Mawr Club . These details pile up , drawing an unmistakable picture of an organization of privileged women .
In the contest between the ABCL and VPL , we see the familiar struggle that has long characterized the broader American Left : On one hand , there are liberals advocating a legislative reform project through ordinary democratic means ; on the other hand are progressives , often led by radicals , who are engaged in a social-change project based on coopting institutions and the expertise and prestige associated with them . Gordon concludes : “ It was Sanger ’ s courting of doctors and eugenists that moved the ABCL away from both the Left and liberalism , away from both socialist-feminist impulses and civil liberties arguments toward an integrated population ‘ program for the whole society . ’ ”
Which is to say , the word “ planned ” in “ Planned Parenthood ” can be understood to function as it does in the other great progressive dream of the time : “ planned economy . ”
Sanger herself was generally careful to forswear compulsion in her eugenics program , but in reality the period was characterized by the widespread use of involuntary sterilization . Mandatory-sterilization bills were introduced unsuccessfully in Michigan and Pennsylvania at the end of the 19th century , but in 1907 Indiana became the first of many states to create eugenics-oriented sterilization programs , targeting such “ unfit ” populations as criminals and the mentally ill , along with African Americans ( 60 percent of the black mothers at one Mississippi hospital were involuntarily sterilized ) and other minority groups . The Oregon state eugenics board was renamed but was not disbanded until the 1980s . About 65,000 people in the United States were involuntarily sterilized .
European programs went even further , with the Swiss experiment in involuntary sterilization drawing the attention of Havelock Ellis , who wrote up his views in “ The Sterilization of the Unfit. ” Ellis , too , objected to compulsory measures — up to a point . “ There will be time to invoke compulsion and the law , ” he wrote , “ when sound knowledge has become universal , and when we are quite sure that those who refuse to act in accordance with sound knowledge refuse deliberately. ” He did not have access to the modern progressive term “ denialist , ” but the argument is familiar : Once the science is settled , then the state is empowered to act on it through whatever coercive means are necessary to achieve the end . Two recent press releases from the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute , both from May , are headlined : “ State Abortion Restrictions Flying in the Face of Science ” and “ Many Abortion Restrictions Have No Rigorous Scientific Basis . ”
Progressives frequently talked about eugenics in zoological terms , but , in the main , eugenics was subordinated to the larger progressive economic agenda : the management of productive activity by enlightened experts .
Progressives holding views closer to those of the proto-Nazi Lothrop Stoddard frequently talked about eugenics in zoological terms , but , in the main , eugenics was subordinated to the larger progressive economic agenda : the management of productive activity by enlightened experts . The great economic terrors among progressives of the time were “ overproduction ” and “ destructive competition , ” both of which were thought to put downward pressure on wages , profits , and , subsequently , standards of living . Contraception was widely understood as a political solution to a supply-and-demand problem , with birth control understood as one element in a broad and unified program of economic control . Ellis sums up this view in his foreword to Sanger ’ s Woman and the New Race :
The modern Woman Movement , like the modern Labour Movement , may be said to have begun in the Eighteenth century . The Labour movement arose out of the Industrial Revolution with its resultant tendency to over-population , to unrestricted competition , to social misery and disorder . The Woman Movement appeared as an at first neglected by-product of the French Revolution with its impulses of general human expansion , of freedom and of equality . . . . Woman , by virtue of motherhood , is the regulator of the birthrate , the sacred disposer of human production . It is in the deliberate restraint and measurement of human production that the fundamental problems of the family , the nation , the whole brotherhood of mankind find their solution . The health and longevity of the individual , the economic welfare of the workers , the general level of culture of the community , the possibility of abolishing from the world the desolating scourge of war — all these like great human needs , depend , primarily and fundamentally , on the wise limitation of the human output .
Or , as Sanger insisted : “ War , famine , poverty , and oppression of the workers will continue while woman makes life cheap . ”
There is more to this history than exegesis of Progressive-era thinking . It is significant that Sanger ’ s birth-control movement , and not Dennett ’ s , came to dominate the field . The financially driven structure of local affiliates working in complete subordination to a tightly controlled national body of course survives in the modern iteration of Planned Parenthood , but , more important , so does the humans-as-widgets conception of sexuality and family life . The eugenic habit of mind very much endures , though it is less frequently spoken of plainly .
In his Buck v. Bell decision — confirming that involuntary-sterilization programs pass constitutional muster “ for the protection and health of the state ” — the great humanist Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. declared : “ Three generations of imbeciles are enough. ” Never having been overturned , Buck remains , in theory , the law of the land . But that was long ago . And yet : Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , a reliable supporter of abortion rights , has described Roe v. Wade as being a decision about population control , “ particularly growth in populations that we don ’ t want to have too many of. ” Like Ellis and Sanger , Ginsburg worries that , without government intervention , birth control will be disproportionately practiced by the well-off and not by the members of those “ populations that we don ’ t want to have too many of. ” In an interview with Elle , Ginsburg said , “ It makes no sense as a national policy to promote birth only among poor people. ” That wasn ’ t 1927 — it was 2014 . A co-counsel for the winning side of Roe v. Wade , Ron Weddington , advised President Bill Clinton that an expanded national birth-control policy incorporating ready access to pharmaceutical abortifacients promised immediate benefits : “ You can start immediately to eliminate the barely educated , unhealthy , and poor segment of our country . It ’ s what we all know is true , but we only whisper it . ”
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , a reliable supporter of abortion rights , has described Roe v. Wade as being a decision about population control , ‘ particularly growth in populations that we don ’ t want to have too many of . ’
But it is not true that we only whisper it . In Freakonomics , one of the most popular economics books of recent years , Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner argued that abortion has measureable eugenic effects through reduction in crime rates . Of course that debate has an inescapable racial aspect : “ Fertility declines for black women are three times greater than for whites ( 12 percent compared with 4 percent ) . Given that homicide rates of black youths are roughly nine times higher than those of white youths , racial differences in the fertility effects of abortion are likely to translate into greater homicide reductions , ” Levitt and a different co-author had written in a paper that the book drew from . Whatever the merits of this argument , it is very much in line with the classical progressive case for birth control , which was developed as a national breed-improvement project rather than one of individual women ’ s choices . Linda Gordon notes : “ A content analysis of the Birth Control Review showed that by the late 1920s only 4.9 percent of its articles in that decade had any concern with women ’ s self-determination . ”
The American Birth Control League was founded by Margaret Sanger in 1921 , working out of office space provided by the American Eugenics Society . Sanger would depart seven years later as part of a factional dispute , with various elements of her organization eventually reunited in 1939 as the Birth Control Federation of America . But the words “ birth control ” at that time were considered public-relations poison , and so in 1942 the organization was renamed the Planned Parenthood Federation of America .
Sanger herself often wrote critically about abortion , which , especially early in her career , she classified alongside infanticide , offering contraception as the obvious rational alternative to such savagery . Her arguments will sound at least partly familiar to modern ears : “ Do we want the millions of abortions performed annually to be multiplied ? Do we want the precious , tender qualities of womanhood , so much needed for our racial development , to perish in these sordid , abnormal experiences ? ” But that line of thinking was not destined to endure , and by the 1950s Planned Parenthood was working for the liberalization of abortion laws . Sanger ’ s successor , obstetrician Alan Frank Guttmacher , also served as vice president of the American Eugenics Society and was a signer of the second “ Humanist Manifesto , ” which called for the worldwide recognition of the right to birth control and abortion and , harkening back to the 1920s progressives , the extension of “ economic assistance , including birth control techniques , to the developing portions of the globe. ” The repeated identification of birth control with national economic planning rather than women ’ s individual autonomy is worth noting .
Continuing Sanger ’ s strategy of courting elite opinion as a more effective form of lobbying , Planned Parenthood ’ s medical director , Mary Calderone , convened a conference of her fellow physicians in 1955 to begin pressing for the legalization of abortion for medical purposes . By 1969 , the demand for therapeutic abortions had grown to a demand for the legalization of abortion in all circumstances , which remains Planned Parenthood ’ s position today and , thanks in no small part to its very effective litigation efforts , is the law of the land .
As in Sanger ’ s time , Planned Parenthood keeps an eye on the money and has a corporate gift for insinuation : It lobbied the Nixon administration successfully for an amendment to public-health laws , as a result of which the organization today pulls in more than half a billion dollars in federal-government funds alone , largely through Medicaid . In 1989 , it founded an advocacy arm , Planned Parenthood Action Fund , that today encompasses a political-action committee and super PAC that ranks No . 23 out of 206 outside-spending groups followed by OpenSecrets.org , putting a little over $ 12 million into almost exclusively Democratic pockets during the 2016 election cycle .
In Planned Parenthood ’ s hometown of New York City , a black woman is more likely to have an abortion than to give birth : 29,007 abortions to 24,108 births in 2013 .
Is it working ? Lothrop Stoddard , author of The Rising Tide of Color against White World Supremacy , might be gratified to note that , in Planned Parenthood ’ s hometown of New York City , a black woman is more likely to have an abortion than to give birth : 29,007 abortions to 24,108 births in 2013 . African Americans represent about 12 percent of the population and about 36 percent of the abortions ; Catholics , disproportionately Hispanic and immigrant , represent 24 percent . In total , one in five U.S. pregnancies ( excluding miscarriages ) ends in abortion , and most women who have abortions already have at least one child . The overwhelming majority of them ( 75 percent , as Guttmacher reckons it ) are poor . The public record includes no data about the “ feebleminded ” or otherwise “ unfit , ” but the racial and income figures suggest that Planned Parenthood is today very much functioning as its Progressive-era founders intended .
If Planned Parenthood ’ s operating model remains familiar after 100 years , so does the rhetoric of the abortion movement . Sanger herself relayed the experience of the Scottish ethnologist John Ferguson McLennan : “ When a traveller reproached the women of one of the South American Indian tribes for the practice of infanticide , McLennan says he was met by the retort , ‘ Men have no business to meddle with women ’ s affairs . ’ ”

Clarence C. Little was a cultivated man. He was a Harvard graduate who served as president of the University of Maine and the University of Michigan. He was one of the nation’s leading genetics researchers, with a particular interest in cancer. He was managing director of the American Society for the Control of Cancer, later known (in the interest of verbal economy) as the American Cancer Society; the president of the American Eugenics Society, later known (in the interest of not talking about eugenics) as the Society for Biodemography and Social Biology; and a founding board member of the American Birth Control League, today known (in the interest of euphemism) as Planned Parenthood. His record as a scientist is not exactly unblemished — he will long be remembered as the man who insisted that “there is no demonstrated causal relationship between smoking or [sic] any disease” — but he was the very picture of the socially conscious man of science, without whom the National Cancer Institute, among other important bodies, probably would not exist.

He was a humane man with horrifying opinions.

Little is one of the early figures in Planned Parenthood whose public pronouncements, along with those of its charismatic foundress, Margaret Sanger, often are pointed to as evidence of the organization’s racist origins. (Students at the University of Michigan are, at the time of this writing, petitioning to have his name stripped from a campus building.) Little believed that birth-control policy should be constructed in such a way as to protect “Yankee stock” — referred to in Sanger’s own work as “unmixed native white parentage,” if Little’s term is not clear enough — from being overwhelmed by what was at the time perceived as the dysgenic fecundity of African Americans, Catholic immigrants, and other undesirables. (“The feebleminded are notoriously prolific in reproduction,” Sanger reported in Woman and the New Race.) The question of racial differences was an obsession of Little’s that went well beyond his interest in eugenics and followed him to the end of his life; one of his later scientific works was “The Possible Relation of Genetics to Differences in Negro–White Mortality Rates from Cancer,” published in the 1960s.

The birth-control movement of the Progressive era is where crude racism met its genteel intellectual cousin: Birth Control Review, the in-house journal of Planned Parenthood’s predecessor organization, published a review, by the socialist intellectual Havelock Ellis, of Lothrop Stoddard’s The Rising Tide of Color against White World Supremacy. Ellis was an important figure in Sanger’s intellectual development and wrote the introduction to her Woman and the New Race; Stoddard was a popular birth-control advocate whose intellectual contributions included lending to the Nazi racial theorists the term “untermensch” as well as developing a great deal of their theoretical framework: He fretted about “imperfectly Nordicized Alpines” and such. Like the other eugenics-minded progressives of his time, he saw birth control and immigration as inescapably linked issues.

Stoddard’s views were so ordinary a part of the mainstream of American intellectual discourse at the time that F. Scott Fitzgerald could refer to his work in The Great Gatsby without fearing that general readers would be mystified by the reference. What did Stoddard want? “We want above all things,” he wrote,

to preserve America. But “America,” as we have already seen, is not a mere geographical expression; it is a nation, whose foundations were laid over three hundred years ago by Anglo-Saxon Nordics, and whose nationhood is due almost exclusively to people of North European stock — not only the old colonists and their descendants but also many millions of North Europeans who have entered the country since colonial times and who have for the most part been thoroughly assimilated. Despite the recent influx of alien elements, therefore, the American people is still predominantly a blend of closely related North European strains, and the fabric of American life is fundamentally their creation.

Yesterday’s scientific progressives are today’s romantic reactionaries.

Sanger, who believed that the potential for high civilization resided within “the cell plasms” of individual humans, made statements that were substantially similar: “If we are to develop in America a new race with a racial soul, we must keep the birth rate within the scope of our ability to understand as well as to educate. We must not encourage reproduction beyond our capacity to assimilate our numbers so as to make the coming generation into such physically fit, mentally capable, socially alert individuals as are the ideal of a democracy.”

Such was the intellectual ferment out of which rose the American birth-control movement — or, rather, the American birth-control movements, of which there were really two. Sanger, working within the socialist–feminist alliance of her time, was a self-styled radical who published a short-lived journal called “The Woman Rebel,” the aim of which as described in its inaugural issue was “to stimulate working women to think for themselves and to build up a conscious fighting character.” To fight what? “Slavery through motherhood.” The Post Office refused to circulate the periodical, a fact that The Woman Rebel reported with glee: “The woman rebel feels proud the post office authorities did not approve of her. She shall blush with shame if ever she be approved of by officialism or ‘comstockism.’” But Sanger and her clique did not have a monopoly on the birth-control market. Her rival was Mary Ware Dennett, founder of — see if this name sounds familiar — the Voluntary Parenthood League (VPL).

Where Sanger was a radical, Dennett was a liberal, couching her advocacy in the familiar language of the American civil-libertarian tradition. She was an ally of the American Civil Liberties Union, which had defended her when she was charged with distributing birth-control literature classified (as most of it was at the time) as “obscene.” While Sanger’s organization was focused on setting up birth-control clinics (the first was in Brooklyn), Dennett’s group was focused on lobbying Congress for the legalization of contraception. Sanger’s group was characterized by a top-down management structure (the local affiliates had no say in American Birth Control League policymaking) and a cash-on-the-barrelhead approach to social reform: Its membership and coffers were swelled in no small part by the fact that the ABCL would not provide birth-control literature to anyone who was not a dues-paying member.

As Linda Gordon put it in The Moral Property of Woman: A History of Birth-Control Politics:

Increasingly the ABCL organized its local affiliates as upper-class women’s clubs, even high-society charity groups. In 1926, league organizing in Philadelphia was focused mainly on women of the Main Line, a group of extremely wealthy suburbs. In Grand Rapids, Michigan, Mrs. C. C. Edmonds, of 1414 Wealthy St., S.E., was collecting “influential people” for a local group. New York meetings were held in the Bryn Mawr Club. These details pile up, drawing an unmistakable picture of an organization of privileged women.

In the contest between the ABCL and VPL, we see the familiar struggle that has long characterized the broader American Left: On one hand, there are liberals advocating a legislative reform project through ordinary democratic means; on the other hand are progressives, often led by radicals, who are engaged in a social-change project based on coopting institutions and the expertise and prestige associated with them. Gordon concludes: “It was Sanger’s courting of doctors and eugenists that moved the ABCL away from both the Left and liberalism, away from both socialist-feminist impulses and civil liberties arguments toward an integrated population ‘program for the whole society.’”

Which is to say, the word “planned” in “Planned Parenthood” can be understood to function as it does in the other great progressive dream of the time: “planned economy.”

Who plans for whom?

Sanger herself was generally careful to forswear compulsion in her eugenics program, but in reality the period was characterized by the widespread use of involuntary sterilization. Mandatory-sterilization bills were introduced unsuccessfully in Michigan and Pennsylvania at the end of the 19th century, but in 1907 Indiana became the first of many states to create eugenics-oriented sterilization programs, targeting such “unfit” populations as criminals and the mentally ill, along with African Americans (60 percent of the black mothers at one Mississippi hospital were involuntarily sterilized) and other minority groups. The Oregon state eugenics board was renamed but was not disbanded until the 1980s. About 65,000 people in the United States were involuntarily sterilized.

European programs went even further, with the Swiss experiment in involuntary sterilization drawing the attention of Havelock Ellis, who wrote up his views in “The Sterilization of the Unfit.” Ellis, too, objected to compulsory measures — up to a point. “There will be time to invoke compulsion and the law,” he wrote, “when sound knowledge has become universal, and when we are quite sure that those who refuse to act in accordance with sound knowledge refuse deliberately.” He did not have access to the modern progressive term “denialist,” but the argument is familiar: Once the science is settled, then the state is empowered to act on it through whatever coercive means are necessary to achieve the end. Two recent press releases from the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute, both from May, are headlined: “State Abortion Restrictions Flying in the Face of Science” and “Many Abortion Restrictions Have No Rigorous Scientific Basis.”

Progressives frequently talked about eugenics in zoological terms, but, in the main, eugenics was subordinated to the larger progressive economic agenda: the management of productive activity by enlightened experts.

Progressives holding views closer to those of the proto-Nazi Lothrop Stoddard frequently talked about eugenics in zoological terms, but, in the main, eugenics was subordinated to the larger progressive economic agenda: the management of productive activity by enlightened experts. The great economic terrors among progressives of the time were “overproduction” and “destructive competition,” both of which were thought to put downward pressure on wages, profits, and, subsequently, standards of living. Contraception was widely understood as a political solution to a supply-and-demand problem, with birth control understood as one element in a broad and unified program of economic control. Ellis sums up this view in his foreword to Sanger’s Woman and the New Race:

The modern Woman Movement, like the modern Labour Movement, may be said to have begun in the Eighteenth century. The Labour movement arose out of the Industrial Revolution with its resultant tendency to over-population, to unrestricted competition, to social misery and disorder. The Woman Movement appeared as an at first neglected by-product of the French Revolution with its impulses of general human expansion, of freedom and of equality. . . . Woman, by virtue of motherhood, is the regulator of the birthrate, the sacred disposer of human production. It is in the deliberate restraint and measurement of human production that the fundamental problems of the family, the nation, the whole brotherhood of mankind find their solution. The health and longevity of the individual, the economic welfare of the workers, the general level of culture of the community, the possibility of abolishing from the world the desolating scourge of war — all these like great human needs, depend, primarily and fundamentally, on the wise limitation of the human output.

Or, as Sanger insisted: “War, famine, poverty, and oppression of the workers will continue while woman makes life cheap.”

There is more to this history than exegesis of Progressive-era thinking. It is significant that Sanger’s birth-control movement, and not Dennett’s, came to dominate the field. The financially driven structure of local affiliates working in complete subordination to a tightly controlled national body of course survives in the modern iteration of Planned Parenthood, but, more important, so does the humans-as-widgets conception of sexuality and family life. The eugenic habit of mind very much endures, though it is less frequently spoken of plainly.

In his Buck v. Bell decision — confirming that involuntary-sterilization programs pass constitutional muster “for the protection and health of the state” — the great humanist Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. declared: “Three generations of imbeciles are enough.” Never having been overturned, Buck remains, in theory, the law of the land. But that was long ago. And yet: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a reliable supporter of abortion rights, has described Roe v. Wade as being a decision about population control, “particularly growth in populations that we don’t want to have too many of.” Like Ellis and Sanger, Ginsburg worries that, without government intervention, birth control will be disproportionately practiced by the well-off and not by the members of those “populations that we don’t want to have too many of.” In an interview with Elle, Ginsburg said, “It makes no sense as a national policy to promote birth only among poor people.” That wasn’t 1927 — it was 2014. A co-counsel for the winning side of Roe v. Wade, Ron Weddington, advised President Bill Clinton that an expanded national birth-control policy incorporating ready access to pharmaceutical abortifacients promised immediate benefits: “You can start immediately to eliminate the barely educated, unhealthy, and poor segment of our country. It’s what we all know is true, but we only whisper it.”

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a reliable supporter of abortion rights, has described Roe v. Wade as being a decision about population control, ‘particularly growth in populations that we don’t want to have too many of.’

But it is not true that we only whisper it. In Freakonomics, one of the most popular economics books of recent years, Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner argued that abortion has measureable eugenic effects through reduction in crime rates. Of course that debate has an inescapable racial aspect: “Fertility declines for black women are three times greater than for whites (12 percent compared with 4 percent). Given that homicide rates of black youths are roughly nine times higher than those of white youths, racial differences in the fertility effects of abortion are likely to translate into greater homicide reductions,” Levitt and a different co-author had written in a paper that the book drew from. Whatever the merits of this argument, it is very much in line with the classical progressive case for birth control, which was developed as a national breed-improvement project rather than one of individual women’s choices. Linda Gordon notes: “A content analysis of the Birth Control Review showed that by the late 1920s only 4.9 percent of its articles in that decade had any concern with women’s self-determination.”

The American Birth Control League was founded by Margaret Sanger in 1921, working out of office space provided by the American Eugenics Society. Sanger would depart seven years later as part of a factional dispute, with various elements of her organization eventually reunited in 1939 as the Birth Control Federation of America. But the words “birth control” at that time were considered public-relations poison, and so in 1942 the organization was renamed the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

Sanger herself often wrote critically about abortion, which, especially early in her career, she classified alongside infanticide, offering contraception as the obvious rational alternative to such savagery. Her arguments will sound at least partly familiar to modern ears: “Do we want the millions of abortions performed annually to be multiplied? Do we want the precious, tender qualities of womanhood, so much needed for our racial development, to perish in these sordid, abnormal experiences?” But that line of thinking was not destined to endure, and by the 1950s Planned Parenthood was working for the liberalization of abortion laws. Sanger’s successor, obstetrician Alan Frank Guttmacher, also served as vice president of the American Eugenics Society and was a signer of the second “Humanist Manifesto,” which called for the worldwide recognition of the right to birth control and abortion and, harkening back to the 1920s progressives, the extension of “economic assistance, including birth control techniques, to the developing portions of the globe.” The repeated identification of birth control with national economic planning rather than women’s individual autonomy is worth noting.

Continuing Sanger’s strategy of courting elite opinion as a more effective form of lobbying, Planned Parenthood’s medical director, Mary Calderone, convened a conference of her fellow physicians in 1955 to begin pressing for the legalization of abortion for medical purposes. By 1969, the demand for therapeutic abortions had grown to a demand for the legalization of abortion in all circumstances, which remains Planned Parenthood’s position today and, thanks in no small part to its very effective litigation efforts, is the law of the land.

As in Sanger’s time, Planned Parenthood keeps an eye on the money and has a corporate gift for insinuation: It lobbied the Nixon administration successfully for an amendment to public-health laws, as a result of which the organization today pulls in more than half a billion dollars in federal-government funds alone, largely through Medicaid. In 1989, it founded an advocacy arm, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, that today encompasses a political-action committee and super PAC that ranks No. 23 out of 206 outside-spending groups followed by OpenSecrets.org, putting a little over $12 million into almost exclusively Democratic pockets during the 2016 election cycle.

In Planned Parenthood’s hometown of New York City, a black woman is more likely to have an abortion than to give birth: 29,007 abortions to 24,108 births in 2013.

Is it working? Lothrop Stoddard, author of The Rising Tide of Color against White World Supremacy, might be gratified to note that, in Planned Parenthood’s hometown of New York City, a black woman is more likely to have an abortion than to give birth: 29,007 abortions to 24,108 births in 2013. African Americans represent about 12 percent of the population and about 36 percent of the abortions; Catholics, disproportionately Hispanic and immigrant, represent 24 percent. In total, one in five U.S. pregnancies (excluding miscarriages) ends in abortion, and most women who have abortions already have at least one child. The overwhelming majority of them (75 percent, as Guttmacher reckons it) are poor. The public record includes no data about the “feebleminded” or otherwise “unfit,” but the racial and income figures suggest that Planned Parenthood is today very much functioning as its Progressive-era founders intended.

If Planned Parenthood’s operating model remains familiar after 100 years, so does the rhetoric of the abortion movement. Sanger herself relayed the experience of the Scottish ethnologist John Ferguson McLennan: “When a traveller reproached the women of one of the South American Indian tribes for the practice of infanticide, McLennan says he was met by the retort, ‘Men have no business to meddle with women’s affairs.’”

Davis 's tactic forced Republicans to start over in the state legislature their effort to pass a ban on most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and toughen regulations for abortion clinics .
Crowds of people advocating on both sides of the debate were expected to converge on the Texas capitol building for the public hearing in the Senate starting on Monday morning .
In an exclusive * Hot Air interview , Lt . Governor David Dewhurst of Texas insists that the attempt to hijack the legislative process by pro-abortion activists this week will not stop the state from passing a limitation on late-term abortions and requirements for clinics to meet the same standards as other ambulatory surgical centers .

The political battle in Texas over proposed restrictions on abortion resumes on Monday with a rally by abortion opponents and a public hearing in the state Senate, where Democrat Wendy Davis staged a filibuster last month to stall the Republican-backed measure.



Davis's tactic forced Republicans to start over in the state legislature their effort to pass a ban on most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and toughen regulations for abortion clinics.



Crowds of people advocating on both sides of the debate were expected to converge on the Texas capitol building for the public hearing in the Senate starting on Monday morning.



In an exclusive* Hot Air interview, Lt. Governor David Dewhurst of Texas insists that the attempt to hijack the legislative process by pro-abortion activists this week will not stop the state from passing a limitation on late-term abortions and requirements for clinics to meet the same standards as other ambulatory surgical centers. Dewhurst also says that his office is reviewing the security tapes from the demonstration that derailed the bill at the end of the regular session, and that arrests may be made for inciting a riot — including perhaps some members of the media.



“I had the votes,” Dewhurst told me, “I had the strategy.” He had wanted the Senate to tackle the bill, SB5, a little earlier in the session to prevent the obstructionism that he foresaw. When it came time to clear the galleries, Dewhurst lacked the resources to finish the job on time. “These are common sense … measures that the majority, the big majority of Texans support,” Dewhurst insisted, “so I was frustrated. I’m not going to let a minority group of demonstrators — Planned Parenthood and ACLU — block the will of the majority. And I will pass this bill.”

ASTONISHING MARGIN

Anti-abortion activists conceded defeat early on Saturday as their opponents expressed astonishment at the scale of their victory. Lawmakers who campaigned for a “No” vote said they would not seek to block the government’s plans to allow abortions with no restriction up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy.

“What Irish voters did yesterday is a tragedy of historic proportions,” the Save The 8th group said. “However, a wrong does not become a right simply because a majority support it.”

MIDDLE GROUND

No social issue had divided Ireland’s 4.8 million people as sharply as abortion, which was pushed up the political agenda by the death in 2012 of a 31-year-old Indian immigrant from a septic miscarriage after she was refused a termination.

A federal judge in Austin struck down part of a Texas law that would have required all abortion clinics in the state to meet the same standards as outpatient surgical centers. The regulation, which was set to go into effect Monday, would have shuttered about a dozen abortion clinics, leaving only eight places in Texas to get a legal abortion — all in major cities.

Judge Lee Yeakel ruled late Friday afternoon that the state's regulation was unconstitutional and would have placed an undue burden on women, particularly on poor and rural women living in west Texas and the Rio Grande Valley.

Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican running for governor, immediately filed an appeal with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

""We applaud today's ruling from Judge Yeakel,"" says Rochelle Tafolla, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast in Houston. ""But we also understand that the fight to protect women's access to medical care, including safe and legal abortion, is not over.""

Supporters of the law argued that the surgical center requirement would make abortion safer, but the judge found no health benefit. He ruled that the effect might actually be the opposite, writing: ""Higher health risks associated with increased delays in seeking early abortion care, risks associated with longer distance automotive travel on traffic-laden highways, and the act's possible connection to observed increases in self-induced abortions almost certainly cancel out any potential health benefit associated with the requirement.""

Yeakel also noted that the intent of the Texas rule was to close existing abortion clinics, given that the state left no provision for ""grandfathering"" existing clinics that could not afford millions of dollars in upgrades to comply with the regulations that govern surgery centers.

A local Houston obstetrician-gynecologist who performs abortions calls Yeakel's ruling ""beautiful."" (The physician asked not to be identified because he fears retribution from abortion protesters.)

The doctor says that if the Texas law had been upheld, he would have had to stop performing abortions in his two office locations because they do not meet the surgery center requirements, which include particular hallway dimensions and certain equipment. He says he cannot afford to construct or purchase an outpatient surgery center, and leasing space in an existing center is difficult because other tenants don't want protesters around.

""This was a good case,"" he says ""There is no medical anything, anywhere, to show that having this done in a hospital or ambulatory surgical center is safer. It's nonsense; it's not. Complications are the same, risks are the same.""

With the day the law was supposed to go into effect fast approaching, the doctor says he told some patients who called this week seeking abortions to make appointments, but to keep in contact with his office.

"" 'You call me, listen to the news, keep your fingers crossed and pray for the women of Texas to have their constitutional rights restored.' That's what I told patients today,"" he says.

abortion,TheBlaze.com,2,https://www.theblaze.com/news/aclu-sues-texas-towns-that-declared-themselves-sanctuary-cities-for-unborn-children,ACLU sues Texas towns that declared themselves 'sanctuary cities' for unborn children,2020-02-26,Nate Madden,"In its latest pro-abortion litigation effort , the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves `` sanctuary cities '' for unborn children .
The ACLU brought the suit on behalf of two pro-abortion groups , the Lilith Fund and the Texas Equal Access Fund ( TEA Fund ) , saying that their rights to free expression and association are violated by the pro-life ordinances .
The first of the `` sanctuary '' ordinances listed in Tuesday 's lawsuit was passed by the city of Waskom back in June ; the other listed cities which followed later are Naples , Joaquin , Tenaha , Rusk , Gary , and Wells .
According to the ACLU of Texas ' news release on the lawsuit , the ordinances in question contain language that would outlaw abortion altogether within city limits if the Supreme Court 's ruling in Roe v. Wade is ever overturned , which the 79-page legal complaint argues `` misleads residents of these cities as to whether individuals can in fact exercise their right to access abortion . ''
The lawsuit also contends that the cities ' ordinances have dubbed abortion providers and pro-abortion entities as `` criminal organizations , '' which keeps them from clearing up confusion and assisting people with aborting their unborn children .
`` As a result of being designated criminal , Plaintiffs are prohibited from operating , speaking , and associating within these cities , '' the lawsuit contends . `` Consequently , Plaintiffs are hampered from countering or clarifying the confusion created by the ordinances as to the legality of abortion services . ''
`` These ordinances are unconstitutional , '' said ACLU of Texas staff attorney Anjali Salvador in a statement . `` Abortion is legal in every state and city in the country . Cities can not punish pro-abortion organizations for carrying out their important work – especially when they do so in a way that violates the First Amendment . ''
Mark Dickson , the director of Right to Life East Texas , has been a leading figure in the unborn sanctuary movement in the Lone Star State for months now . Before Waskom passed its initial ordinance , he voiced his frustration to the city council that legislators in Austin were n't passing `` meaningful legislation that protects unborn life . ''
`` We have every intention of targeting every part of the state , '' Dickson told the Texas Tribune last month . `` Every city , no matter what size , is valuable . ''
In a Tuesday facebook post , Dickson derided the ACLU 's complaint as `` a meritless lawsuit brought to deter and intimidate cities from enacting these ordinances , which are entirely constitutional and consistent with the laws of Texas . '' He also said , `` We have a legal team ready to defend these ordinances at no charge to the cities , and we are prepared to defend all other cities that enact these laws at no charge to the taxpayers .

Cities cannot punish pro-abortion organizations for carrying out their important work – especially when they do so in a way that violates the First Amendment.""

Mark Dickson, the director of Right to Life East Texas, has been a leading figure in the unborn sanctuary movement in the Lone Star State for months now. Before Waskom passed its initial ordinance, he voiced his frustration to the city council that legislators in Austin weren't passing ""meaningful legislation that protects unborn life.""



""We have every intention of targeting every part of the state,"" Dickson told the Texas Tribune last month. ""Every city, no matter what size, is valuable.""

In a Tuesday facebook post, Dickson derided the ACLU's complaint as ""a meritless lawsuit brought to deter and intimidate cities from enacting these ordinances, which are entirely constitutional and consistent with the laws of Texas."" He also said, ""We have a legal team ready to defend these ordinances at no charge to the cities, and we are prepared to defend all other cities that enact these laws at no charge to the taxpayers.""",www.theblaze.com,right,euKnaH1pAldtA34Q

On the selflessness of the pro-life movement

Washington, D.C. — The last time the pro-life movement achieved a major policy win was at the turn of the century, when the Supreme Court upheld the federal ban on partial-birth abortion. Though incremental abortion restrictions have found a foothold in many states, the pro-life cause is routinely stymied and shunted at the federal level. Politicians on the left have radicalized on the issue even as politicians on the right have grown increasingly wary of talking about it at all.

And yet this morning, the foot soldiers of the pro-life cause are marching once again. They’ve shown up in Washington, as they do every year, to mark the anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade.

In recent decades, the anti-abortion movement has mustered more sustained political energy than most other causes, despite being largely frozen out of the highest levels of our politics. It takes unique perseverance to continue to show up at the table, decade after decade, despite losing almost constantly on nearly every one of its major policy objectives.

The people lingering on the National Mall have no reason to believe that their demonstration will effect immediate change in public policy. They have no reason to believe that the media will pay them any heed or give their cause its due. They have no reason to believe that, if they board buses from California and Nebraska and North Carolina, spend nights trekking the long miles to the nation’s capital, and stand in the snow for hours, the killing of innocent unborn children will cease.

But for 45 years, they have shown up anyway. Why do they do it?

They say they want the government to protect the right to life of every human being, including the unborn. They march on behalf of a class of human beings that can do absolutely nothing for them. They demonstrate for a cause that has nothing, ostensibly, to do with their own quality of life. Theirs is a movement motivated by selflessness.

Give them more, they say.

Those who lobby for the government-enshrined right to abortion, by contrast, want the power to eliminate the consequences of living a libertine sexual lifestyle. They want abortion available as last-ditch emergency contraception, the ultimate backstop against personal responsibility. They want to codify a woman’s ability to exercise bodily autonomy not only over herself but over the independent body within hers.

Give me more, they say.

Proponents of abortion rights would have you believe that the pro-life position is a lie, that the March for Life is a frightening freak show. They insist that opposition to abortion is motivated by a desire to control women’s bodies, to empower the government to dictate and proscribe personal choices. The fashionable progressive tactic is to dismiss pro-life activism as dominated by men eager to preserve their privilege and power by subjugating women.

Are we to believe, then, that thousands of pro-life women — for there are women here, by the thousands — return to Washington every year because they are desperate to eliminate their own rights? This is an obvious, inherent tension in the core propositions of the pro-choice position. They insist simultaneously that women are autonomous individuals capable of thinking for themselves and that any woman who supports the right to life of the unborn does so only because she has been tricked by a cabal of men into lobbying against her own rights.

But, surrounded by thousands of men and children holding signs that say “Pro-Life Is Pro-Woman,” these women stubbornly choose to appear on the National Mall every January, for little political reward and no personal gain. If the pro-life movement is a long con, it is one of the least effective in history.

The pro-life movement presents what seems like a paradox. On one hand, its advocates have suffered a string of defeats, disadvantaged at the outset by having to fight abortion in the landscape Roe created. There has been a slow, minimal decline in the abortion rate, but federal law remains inhospitable to pro-life goals, and the pressure in liberal circles to adopt a no-exceptions defense of “reproductive rights” has intensified. Yet this movement, a supposed relic of a bygone era, has nevertheless persisted.

How to resolve it? It’s simple.

But that bill was a backup , after another proposal to ban so-called `` late -term '' abortions was suddenly yanked the late Wednesday night because of blow back from moderate Republicans who argued it was too extreme .
The bill barring federal taxpayer funds was approved in the last Congress . On Thursday it passed 242-179 , with three Democrats joining virtually all House Republicans to support the bill . GOP Rep. Richard Hanna of New York was the one Republican who voted against it .
Earlier on Thursday , the White House promised to veto the legislation if it ended up on the President 's desk .
The vote came as tens of thousands of anti-abortion rights activists descended on the National Mall for the annual `` March for Life .

But that bill was a backup, after another proposal to ban so-called ""late -term"" abortions was suddenly yanked the late Wednesday night because of blow back from moderate Republicans who argued it was too extreme.

The bill barring federal taxpayer funds was approved in the last Congress. On Thursday it passed 242-179, with three Democrats joining virtually all House Republicans to support the bill. GOP Rep. Richard Hanna of New York was the one Republican who voted against it.

Earlier on Thursday, the White House promised to veto the legislation if it ended up on the President's desk.

The vote came as tens of thousands of anti-abortion rights activists descended on the National Mall for the annual ""March for Life."" Thursday's event coincides with the 42nd anniversary the of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision which upheld a woman's access to abortion based on privacy rights in the Constitution.

Republican leaders initially planned to pass the ""Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,"" a bill banning abortion procedures for women who are beyond 20 weeks into their pregnancy. A similar version of that bill was approved by the House in 2013.

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi needled the GOP about the internal spat, saying, ""They didn't even have their act together.""

And she criticized the GOP for spending time on the abortion debate instead of debating measures focused on job creation.

""They're putting a bill on the floor that undermines the health of America's women. The bill is worse than the bill they pulled from the floor yesterday,"" Pelosi said in a news conference.

Wade,2019-05-16,,"New strict abortion laws in states like Alabama and Georgia are setting the stage for a legal fight that could make its way to the Supreme Court , sparking fears that the court ’ s conservative majority could reverse Roe v. Wade .
Legal experts have previously cast doubt on the possibility of the Supreme Court revisiting the landmark ruling in Roe v. Wade anytime soon . But Justice Stephen Breyer appeared to raise the possibility this week in an opinion opposing conservative justices ’ reversal of an unrelated 1979 ruling .
“ Today ’ s decision can only cause one to wonder which cases the court will overrule next , ” Breyer wrote , in what many viewed to be a warning against a potential Roe v. Wade reversal .
The court overturning the 1979 ruling , coupled with Breyer ’ s remarks , has intensified fears among abortion rights supporters who say a conservative-leaning Supreme Court could also overturn Roe v. Wade , which legalized abortion nationwide in 1973 .
“ This week the Supreme Court has shown a willingness to jettison precedent , ” said Carrie Flaxman , Planned Parenthood ’ s deputy director of public policy litigation and law . “ With Justice [ Brett ] Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court , there is a grave threat to abortion rights . That ’ s what these bills are targeted at . The sponsors of these bills are doing this , and states are doing this , because they hope that the court will overturn Roe . ”
Advocacy groups are gearing up for lawsuits over the new state laws that offer up even more avenues for an abortion case to land before the justices .
Planned Parenthood vowed to sue if Alabama Gov . Kay Ivey ( R ) signed into law a measure passed Tuesday by state lawmakers banning abortion , with exemptions if the life of the mother is at serious risk , but none for cases of rape or incest .
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit Wednesday challenging a law signed by Ohio Gov . Mike DeWine ( R ) that bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected , usually around six weeks of pregnancy .
Legal challenges are also pending in Mississippi and Kentucky , where Republican governors have recently signed fetal heartbeat abortion laws . And a lawsuit is also likely in Georgia , where Gov . Brian Kemp ( R ) signed a similar measure last week .
Several of the laws appear to be designed to force the Supreme Court to revisit a key component of Roe v. Wade that said states can ’ t place certain restrictions on abortion .
Hans von Spakovsky , a legal fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation , noted that Alabama ’ s abortion law is unlikely to hold up under the legal standard set by Roe . But he said the point of the new law is to force the Supreme Court to revisit abortion .
“ I think the sponsors have made it clear that they are passing this law with a full expectation in Alabama that the lower courts will strike it down because they want this to get to the Supreme Court , because they ’ re hoping that it ’ ll be the opportunity for the Supreme Court to potentially overturn its prior precedents about this , ” von Spakovsky said .
But the justices may be wary of taking up a controversial topic like abortion , particularly during an election year when it could give the appearance of putting the issue on the ballot . The Supreme Court ’ s current term is wrapping up , and the next one will begin in the fall , with major rulings usually reserved for June .
Mary Ziegler , a law professor at Florida State University who specializes in reproductive rights , said the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals would likely oversee challenges to the abortion laws in Georgia and Alabama .
She said that appeals court appears ready to punt the question to the Supreme Court , but has been “ begrudgingly ” upholding the precedent so far .
Even if the Supreme Court is presented with the case , the justices could decline to hear it .
“ If the court doesn ’ t want to deal with this right now , they can easily avoid it , ” Ziegler said . “ If the lower courts are striking these laws down , they could just decide not to take a case . ”

So we asked all of them what their positions were on abortion rights and access , and what policies they ’ d support to make this a reality .
While not every candidate responded to ███ ’ s direct inquiry , all 24 have discussed their position on abortion rights in some capacity in the past . For the candidates who did not respond to our request , we examined statements they ’ ve made in interviews , town halls , and reports in other publications including BuzzFeed , ThinkProgress and HuffPost .
Some of the candidates offered ███ more details than others about how they ’ d protect reproductive rights . Booker , for example , said he would create a White House Office of Reproductive Freedom , while Harris said she ’ d require states that have passed laws that violate Roe in recent years to obtain DOJ approval for any abortion-related laws they ’ d like to implement down the line .
But what stands out at this point in the Democratic primary campaign — and was highlighted at the Planned Parenthood forum on Saturday — is the extent to which the candidates have converged around a series of policies on abortion that would have seemed remarkably progressive just five years ago , especially when it comes to the Hyde Amendment , which bans federal funding for most abortions . As the Republican Party has backed increasingly restrictive laws , the Democratic Party has responded by moving toward increasing and multilayered support for abortion rights .
“ What ’ s going on in this country right now is not just an attack on women , ” Warren said at the Planned Parenthood forum on Saturday . “ It ’ s an attack on women who have fewer resources . It ’ s a class attack on women . It ’ s a race attack . ”
Her words encapsulated what has , at this point , become a shared position among virtually the entire Democratic field : that abortion should be not just legal but affordable and accessible for all Americans .
Many Democrats have converged on a set of policies to protect abortion rights and access
In our survey , a few commonalities quickly emerged . Many of the candidates we heard from support the following policies :
Repealing the Hyde Amendment . The ban on federal funding for abortions bars Medicaid from covering the procedure , putting it out of reach for many low-income Americans . The president doesn ’ t have the power to repeal Hyde ; that authority rests with Congress . But presidential pressure to repeal Hyde still matters , and since Hyde was often treated as politically untouchable before 2016 , the fact that so many Democratic candidates now back its repeal is a sign of the times .

But presidential pressure to repeal Hyde still matters , and since Hyde was often treated as politically untouchable before 2016 , the fact that so many Democratic candidates now back its repeal is a sign of the times . Codifying Roe v. Wade in statute . In May , Sens . Gillibrand , Warren , and others put forth plans calling on Congress to make the right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade a part of federal law , so that it would stand even if Roe is overturned . Such a law could be challenged in court in the event of a repeal of Roe , but candidates see it as an important bulwark against the loss of reproductive rights . Like a repeal of Hyde , this is something only Congress could accomplish .

Such a law could be challenged in court in the event of a repeal of Roe , but candidates see it as an important bulwark against the loss of reproductive rights . Like a repeal of Hyde , this is something only Congress could accomplish . Repealing the domestic and global gag rules . Like every Republican president since Reagan , President Trump reinstated the global gag rule , which bars organizations abroad that take American aid from providing or discussing abortion ( Trump expanded this rule to apply to a larger pool of money than in previous administrations ) . He then went further by imposing a domestic gag rule , barring organizations in the United States that receive federal family planning funds under Title X from providing or referring patients for the procedure . Unlike repealing Hyde or codifying Roe , this is something a president could do without help from Congress . It ’ s also a reminder that the Trump administration has taken a number of actions to restrict both abortion and contraceptive access ; the next president would have the power to roll any of these back .

It ’ s also a reminder that the Trump administration has taken a number of actions to restrict both abortion and contraceptive access ; the next president would have the power to roll any of these back . A Roe litmus test for federal judges , including Supreme Court justices . Several candidates ( though not all ) have said they would only appoint judges who support Roe v. Wade to the federal court system . Trump made the opposite promise in 2016 and has made good on it by appointing Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court , as well as judges seen as anti-abortion to lower federal courts ; it ’ s largely because of his appointments that Roe is at risk today . It ’ s unclear how many opportunities the next president will have to make a Supreme Court appointment , but lower federal judges also hold great influence over the interpretation of abortion law . And , like repealing the gag rules , this is an action the president can take ( though judges do require congressional approval ) .
Given how similar the candidates ’ response are overall , we spoke with NARAL , an advocacy group that ’ s fought for stronger protections for abortion rights , about how to best differentiate them .
The key thing to look out for , according to NARAL vice president of communications Adrienne Kimmell , is more specifics . Since repealing Hyde and codifying Roe have become baseline positions , candidates who are able to offer more details in their proposals suggest that they ’ ve engaged with the issue further .
“ Voters should look for candidates who step up with concrete plans to protect access to care and guarantee reproductive freedom for every American , ” she says . “ We ’ re heartened to see that candidates like Elizabeth Warren , Kamala Harris , Cory Booker , and Kirsten Gillibrand are already leading the way by announcing specific plans laying out how they would defend reproductive freedom . ”
Some of the Democratic candidates support abortion rights policies beyond the commonly shared positions on Hyde and Roe as well . It ’ s also important to note that while we chose to focus on abortion for the purpose of this survey , many advocates see that right as part of a larger spectrum of issues , including maternal health ( the subject of another survey to be published soon ) and equal access to health care for people of all races and genders .
Here ’ s where the candidates stand on abortion based on responses they shared — and other public statements
“ I believe in Roe v. Wade , ” the senator said at a Fox News town hall in May . “ Of course , there are limits there in the third trimester that are very important , ” she added . “ But I think overall , what we want to do is make sure women have the right to make their own decisions . ”
In an interview with Fox News later that month , she said , “ If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade I would make sure that we are codifying Roe v. Wade into law. ” She has also co-sponsored legislation to repeal the Hyde Amendment .
At the Planned Parenthood forum , she added that if elected , she would repeal the domestic and global gag rules . She also mentioned the importance of “ making sure that we have judges that follow the law of the land ” when it comes to Roe v. Wade .
The entrepreneur supports codifying Roe , repealing Hyde , and providing “ safe and affordable abortion services ” to all Americans . “ I have the feeling that if men became pregnant instead of women , there would be absolutely no restriction on reproductive rights , ” he said in a statement on his campaign website .
At the Planned Parenthood forum , Yang also said that his plan to give all Americans a universal basic income of $ 1,000 a month would help low-income people afford abortion care .
“ Bernie believes that abortion is a constitutional right for all women , ” said Sarah Ford , deputy communications director for the Sanders campaign .
The senator supports a Roe litmus test for judges , and his Medicare-for-all plan would make abortion free to all patients , effectively making the Hyde Amendment moot . “ Abortion rights are part of what Medicare-for-all is , ” he said at the Planned Parenthood forum .
Sanders is also a co-sponsor of the Women ’ s Health Protection Act , which would codify Roe in federal statute .
The former Congress member from Texas has released a reproductive rights plan that includes repealing Hyde and guaranteeing private insurance coverage for abortion , codifying Roe in statute , and “ appointing judges who respect Roe v. Wade as the settled law of the land. ” He also promises , if elected , to reverse the Trump administration ’ s domestic gag rule . And he says he would direct the Food and Drug Administration to remove “ labeling regulations that impose barriers to the use of medication-based abortions . ”
“ Beto would mobilize the full force of the federal government to protect women ’ s reproductive rights and access to abortion , ” a spokesperson for the campaign told ███ . “ Throughout Beto ’ s career , he has fought to protect women ’ s access to health care and their right to make their own decisions about their bodies , dating back to his first run for Congress where he took on a Democratic primary opponent who opposed federal funding for Planned Parenthood . ”
The mayor has supported repealing Hyde . He ’ s previously called out former Vice President Joe Biden for his prior position backing Hyde . “ If you don ’ t support repeal , you shouldn ’ t be the Democratic nominee , ” de Blasio tweeted .
New York City has also been at the forefront of expanding abortion rights during de Blasio ’ s tenure . Most recently , it became the first city in the country to directly fund abortions .
The senator released a reproductive rights plan on May 22 , amid the passage of state-level abortion bans around the country . In it , he pledges to work to repeal Hyde and codify Roe in statute , as well as to nominate judges who are supportive of Roe .
In addition , he promises to take a number of executive actions to protect reproductive rights , including ending the domestic and global gag rules , reversing the Trump administration ’ s guidelines prioritizing abstinence-based programs for federal teen pregnancy prevention funding , and undoing the administration ’ s rules allowing health care providers to refuse to perform abortions on the basis of their “ conscience ” or religion .
If elected , the senator says he would also create a White House Office of Reproductive Freedom , “ charged with coordinating and affirmatively advancing abortion rights and access to reproductive health care across my administration — addressing all barriers to full reproductive autonomy , such as access to health care , including maternal and infant health , quality , affordable child care , and comprehensive paid family leave . ”
At the Planned Parenthood forum , Booker called on men to stand up for reproductive rights . “ This is not a woman ’ s issue , ” he said . “ Don ’ t tell me just because you have a wife or a mother or a daughter , that that ’ s how you relate to this . You have a body . ”
Warren was among the first candidates to put forth a detailed reproductive rights plan . The plan , released May 17 , calls for codifying Roe in statute , repealing Hyde and the domestic gag rule , and guaranteeing private insurance coverage for abortion .
“ We must build a future that protects the right of all women to have children , the right of all women to not have children , and the right to bring children up in a safe and healthy environment , ” Warren wrote in announcing her plan .
Swalwell is an original co-sponsor of the EACH Woman Act , which would repeal Hyde . He is also a co-sponsor of the Women ’ s Health Protection Act and of legislation to repeal the global gag rule . As president , he would support codifying Roe in statute , according to his campaign .
“ We will defend Roe v. Wade and a woman ’ s right to choose at all costs , ” Swalwell said in a statement to ███ . “ As president , I ’ ll work with Congress to protect women ’ s control of their own bodies without government interference and ensure women in every state retain access to abortion care . But I also want to encourage America ’ s young men to stand up and link arms with women in this fight — we need to be vocal , active allies in defending freedom . ”
“ I will be a president who negotiates up on this issue rather than down , ” he promised at the Planned Parenthood forum .
Inslee supports repealing Hyde and codifying Roe in statute , his campaign said . As governor , he signed Washington state ’ s Reproductive Parity Act , which guarantees public and private insurance coverage for abortion , and he would support similar legislation as president . He would also repeal both domestic and global gag rules ; the attorney general of Washington state was one of several to sue the Trump administration to block the domestic rule .
After stating in early June that he supports Hyde , Biden changed course and says he now believes the amendment should be repealed . At the Planned Parenthood forum , he said that he had changed positions on Hyde because his health care plan would need to include coverage of abortion .
“ I laid out a health care plan that ’ s going to provide federally funded health care for all women and women who now are denied even Medicare in their home states , ” he said . “ It became really clear to me that although the Hyde Amendment was designed to try to split the difference here , to make sure women still had access , you can ’ t have access if everyone ’ s covered by a federal policy . That ’ s why at the same time I announced that policy , I announced that I could no longer continue to abide by the Hyde Amendment . ”
The former vice president also supports codifying Roe in statute and repealing the global gag rule , according to his campaign . A practicing Catholic , Biden has said he is personally opposed to abortion . But , he said at a vice presidential debate in 2012 , “ I just refuse to impose that on others . ”
Delaney supports repealing the Hyde Amendment , according to his campaign . His universal health care plan , BetterCare , would cover reproductive health care , including abortions .
The former Colorado governor supports repealing Hyde and increasing and protecting Title X family planning funding . “ Governor Hickenlooper always has been a strong advocate of a woman ’ s right to choose , ” a spokesperson for his campaign said . “ He believes that all decisions should be made between a woman , her faith , and her doctor . ”
The former housing and urban development secretary has committed to nominating judges and Cabinet members who are “ pro-choice. ” Additionally , he backs repealing Hyde and codifying Roe v. Wade . “ All women should have access to reproductive care , regardless of their income or the state they live in , ” he previously tweeted .
Harris is among the Democrats who ’ s offered a more detailed plan on abortion rights that seeks to curb state laws attempting to infringe on them . Under Harris ’ s proposal , which is modeled after the Voting Rights Act , states whose abortion-related laws have recently been struck down by courts for violating Roe would have to obtain federal approval from the Justice Department before they ’ re able to implement any new abortion laws .
“ As president , I will stop dangerous state laws restricting reproductive rights before they go into effect , ” Harris said in a statement . She also backs undoing Hyde , making Roe v. Wade law , and appointing judges that support abortion rights .
At the Planned Parenthood forum , Harris pledged “ to do the work on the defense , and to fight , but also work on the offense ” when it comes to abortion rights .
Gillibrand has made gender equity and reproductive rights a central piece of her campaign and is considered a leader on the issue . She was the first 2020 Democrat to commit to appointing judges that support Roe , and in the wake of state laws restricting abortion access laid out a wide-ranging plan to protect abortion rights .
In addition to repealing Hyde and codifying Roe , Gillibrand supports undoing the gag rule the Trump administration has imposed . She would also establish a new funding stream in order to ensure that every state has a reproductive health center .
“ We must come together to declare , loud and clear , that reproductive rights are human rights . They are civil rights . And they are nonnegotiable , ” she wrote in a Medium post .
The author and spiritual adviser , who has described herself as “ one hundred percent pro-choice , ” backs codifying Roe and repealing the Hyde Amendment .
“ I believe the decision of whether or not to have an abortion lies solely with the pregnant woman , according to the dictates of her conscience and in communion with the God of her understanding , ” she notes on her campaign website . “ I do not feel the government has an appropriate right to deny or restrict that decision . ”
Bennet supports “ enshrining Roe v. Wade into federal statute , preempting states that try to interfere with women ’ s health rights , repealing the Hyde Amendment , and standing up against other efforts to undermine access to necessary care , ” according to a campaign spokesperson .
“ Women ’ s reproductive rights are under assault all over the United States . Women ’ s health care is under assault all over the United States , ” he said during a CNN town hall earlier this year . Bennet has also said he would only appoint judges that back Roe .
Former Alaska Sen. Gravel , a candidate who ’ s notably in the race in order to prompt debate , has an expansive and unique abortion rights agenda . Gravel ’ s landmark provision would tie an individual ’ s ability to become a specialized physician with a commitment to providing abortions .
“ Our signature point on abortion access is mandating the ability and willingness to provide an abortion as a condition of obstetrician licensing , ” according to a campaign spokesperson . “ In addition , we support a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to an abortion , as well as lawmaking through the People ’ s legislature , a fourth branch of government that Mike Gravel supports setting up that would allow direct lawmaking by the American people . ”
Gravel also backs repealing Hyde and codifying Roe into law .
Buttigieg supports repealing Hyde , codifying Roe into law , and appointing judicial nominees who would support Roe . “ The mayor is pro-choice and trusts women to make their own health care decisions . He also recognizes the harm in having men legislate women ’ s bodies , ” said a campaign spokesperson .
Buttigieg has previously called for more men to speak out about abortion . “ I think it ’ s particularly important from a political stance for men to stand up , ” he said during a campaign event earlier this year , according to HuffPost .
Moulton backs the repeal of the Hyde Amendment and enshrining Roe in federal law . He ’ s said undoing Hyde ensures that all women have the funding they need for health care and compared it to the funding the military needs .
“ It ’ s sort of like saying , you know , I support the troops but don ’ t want to pay them , ” Moulton said of Hyde in a CNN interview . “ That ’ s the analogy here , and I think it ’ s wrong . ”
Moulton has also said he will exclusively appoint judges that support Roe and added that he backs Harris ’ s proposal to require DOJ review of certain state laws .
Bullock supports ending Hyde , codifying Roe , and strengthening Title X funding , which provides money for family planning and preventive health care clinics ( though the domestic gag rule currently restricts it to institutions that do not provide abortions ) .
“ As governor , Bullock has stopped every single effort to restrict reproductive health care , and made Title X funding permanent so it would no longer be a political football , ” a campaign spokesperson said .
“ It ’ s not what I think , it ’ s what does an individual woman need to do with her body and with her health care , ” Bullock recently told CNN .
Ryan supports codifying Roe and repealing Hyde . He had previously expressed opposition to abortion rights but explained in a 2015 editorial why he ’ s changed his position .
“ I came in as a Catholic school kid from northeast Ohio who didn ’ t think a whole lot about the issue and went into Congress pro-life , ” Ryan told BuzzFeed . “ My opinion changed that there should not be anyone from the federal government between a woman and her doctor . ”
Gabbard is supportive of abortion rights , according to a campaign spokesperson , and would back using federal money to provide abortions . Gabbard has previously been anti-abortion but has since changed her position .
Messam supports codifying Roe and using federal money to provide abortion services . He emphasized , in an interview with WBUR , that he sees Roe as “ settled law . ”
“ I think when a woman is faced with a tough decision to abort a pregnancy , it ’ s tough enough by itself to have to make such a personal decision — a tough decision to make — and currently right now in our country this issue has been demagogued , and I think that primarily us men are making the decisions in the laws , ” he said .","With near-total bans on abortion passing in state after state — and others responding by loosening restrictions on the procedure — the right to terminate a pregnancy is emerging as a major election issue in 2020.

When CNN pollsters asked Iowa Democratic voters earlier this month what issues were must-haves in a presidential candidate, support for abortion rights came out on top, with 79 percent of in-person caucus-goers listing it as crucial. And on Saturday, voters got to hear 20 of the 24 Democratic presidential candidates speak on abortion and broader issues of reproductive justice, including sex education and contraceptive access, at a forum convened by Planned Parenthood.

Earlier this year, many candidates condemned the restrictive anti-abortion laws passing in Alabama and elsewhere, but fewer put forth specific policies for defending reproductive rights. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Cory Booker stood out from the field by issuing detailed plans for safeguarding abortion access.

Since then, more candidates have made policy statements, like expressing support for the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would enshrine in federal statute the right to an abortion guaranteed by Roe v. Wade. But Vox wanted to take a holistic look at the abortion rights policies of all 24 candidates in the race. So we asked all of them what their positions were on abortion rights and access, and what policies they’d support to make this a reality.

While not every candidate responded to Vox’s direct inquiry, all 24 have discussed their position on abortion rights in some capacity in the past. For the candidates who did not respond to our request, we examined statements they’ve made in interviews, town halls, and reports in other publications including BuzzFeed, ThinkProgress and HuffPost.

Some of the candidates offered Vox more details than others about how they’d protect reproductive rights. Booker, for example, said he would create a White House Office of Reproductive Freedom, while Harris said she’d require states that have passed laws that violate Roe in recent years to obtain DOJ approval for any abortion-related laws they’d like to implement down the line.

As the Republican Party has backed increasingly restrictive laws, the Democratic Party has responded by moving toward increasing and multilayered support for abortion rights.

“What’s going on in this country right now is not just an attack on women,” Warren said at the Planned Parenthood forum on Saturday. “It’s an attack on women who have fewer resources. It’s a class attack on women. It’s a race attack.”

Her words encapsulated what has, at this point, become a shared position among virtually the entire Democratic field: that abortion should be not just legal but affordable and accessible for all Americans.

Codifying Roe v. Wade in statute. In May, Sens. Gillibrand, Warren, and others put forth plans calling on Congress to make the right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade a part of federal law, so that it would stand even if Roe is overturned. Such a law could be challenged in court in the event of a repeal of Roe, but candidates see it as an important bulwark against the loss of reproductive rights.

Here’s where the candidates stand on abortion based on responses they shared — and other public statements

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN)

“I believe in Roe v. Wade,” the senator said at a Fox News town hall in May. “Of course, there are limits there in the third trimester that are very important,” she added. “But I think overall, what we want to do is make sure women have the right to make their own decisions.”

In an interview with Fox News later that month, she said, “If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade I would make sure that we are codifying Roe v. Wade into law.” She has also co-sponsored legislation to repeal the Hyde Amendment.

At the Planned Parenthood forum, she added that if elected, she would repeal the domestic and global gag rules. She also mentioned the importance of “making sure that we have judges that follow the law of the land” when it comes to Roe v. Wade.

Andrew Yang

The entrepreneur supports codifying Roe, repealing Hyde, and providing “safe and affordable abortion services” to all Americans. “I have the feeling that if men became pregnant instead of women, there would be absolutely no restriction on reproductive rights,” he said in a statement on his campaign website.

At the Planned Parenthood forum, Yang also said that his plan to give all Americans a universal basic income of $1,000 a month would help low-income people afford abortion care.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)

“Bernie believes that abortion is a constitutional right for all women,” said Sarah Ford, deputy communications director for the Sanders campaign.

The senator supports a Roe litmus test for judges, and his Medicare-for-all plan would make abortion free to all patients, effectively making the Hyde Amendment moot. “Abortion rights are part of what Medicare-for-all is,” he said at the Planned Parenthood forum.

Sanders is also a co-sponsor of the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would codify Roe in federal statute.

Beto O’Rourke

The former Congress member from Texas has released a reproductive rights plan that includes repealing Hyde and guaranteeing private insurance coverage for abortion, codifying Roe in statute, and “appointing judges who respect Roe v. Wade as the settled law of the land.” He also promises, if elected, to reverse the Trump administration’s domestic gag rule. And he says he would direct the Food and Drug Administration to remove “labeling regulations that impose barriers to the use of medication-based abortions.”

“Beto would mobilize the full force of the federal government to protect women’s reproductive rights and access to abortion,” a spokesperson for the campaign told Vox. “Throughout Beto’s career, he has fought to protect women’s access to health care and their right to make their own decisions about their bodies, dating back to his first run for Congress where he took on a Democratic primary opponent who opposed federal funding for Planned Parenthood.”

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio

The mayor has supported repealing Hyde. He’s previously called out former Vice President Joe Biden for his prior position backing Hyde. “If you don’t support repeal, you shouldn’t be the Democratic nominee,” de Blasio tweeted.

New York City has also been at the forefront of expanding abortion rights during de Blasio’s tenure. Most recently, it became the first city in the country to directly fund abortions.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ)

The senator released a reproductive rights plan on May 22, amid the passage of state-level abortion bans around the country. In it, he pledges to work to repeal Hyde and codify Roe in statute, as well as to nominate judges who are supportive of Roe.

In addition, he promises to take a number of executive actions to protect reproductive rights, including ending the domestic and global gag rules, reversing the Trump administration’s guidelines prioritizing abstinence-based programs for federal teen pregnancy prevention funding, and undoing the administration’s rules allowing health care providers to refuse to perform abortions on the basis of their “conscience” or religion.

If elected, the senator says he would also create a White House Office of Reproductive Freedom, “charged with coordinating and affirmatively advancing abortion rights and access to reproductive health care across my administration — addressing all barriers to full reproductive autonomy, such as access to health care, including maternal and infant health, quality, affordable child care, and comprehensive paid family leave.”

At the Planned Parenthood forum, Booker called on men to stand up for reproductive rights. “This is not a woman’s issue,” he said. “Don’t tell me just because you have a wife or a mother or a daughter, that that’s how you relate to this. You have a body.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)

Warren was among the first candidates to put forth a detailed reproductive rights plan. The plan, released May 17, calls for codifying Roe in statute, repealing Hyde and the domestic gag rule, and guaranteeing private insurance coverage for abortion.

“We must build a future that protects the right of all women to have children, the right of all women to not have children, and the right to bring children up in a safe and healthy environment,” Warren wrote in announcing her plan.

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA)

Swalwell is an original co-sponsor of the EACH Woman Act, which would repeal Hyde. He is also a co-sponsor of the Women’s Health Protection Act and of legislation to repeal the global gag rule. As president, he would support codifying Roe in statute, according to his campaign.

“We will defend Roe v. Wade and a woman’s right to choose at all costs,” Swalwell said in a statement to Vox. “As president, I’ll work with Congress to protect women’s control of their own bodies without government interference and ensure women in every state retain access to abortion care. But I also want to encourage America’s young men to stand up and link arms with women in this fight — we need to be vocal, active allies in defending freedom.”

“I will be a president who negotiates up on this issue rather than down,” he promised at the Planned Parenthood forum.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee

Inslee supports repealing Hyde and codifying Roe in statute, his campaign said. As governor, he signed Washington state’s Reproductive Parity Act, which guarantees public and private insurance coverage for abortion, and he would support similar legislation as president. He would also repeal both domestic and global gag rules; the attorney general of Washington state was one of several to sue the Trump administration to block the domestic rule.

Joe Biden

After stating in early June that he supports Hyde, Biden changed course and says he now believes the amendment should be repealed. At the Planned Parenthood forum, he said that he had changed positions on Hyde because his health care plan would need to include coverage of abortion.

“I laid out a health care plan that’s going to provide federally funded health care for all women and women who now are denied even Medicare in their home states,” he said. “It became really clear to me that although the Hyde Amendment was designed to try to split the difference here, to make sure women still had access, you can’t have access if everyone’s covered by a federal policy. That’s why at the same time I announced that policy, I announced that I could no longer continue to abide by the Hyde Amendment.”

The former vice president also supports codifying Roe in statute and repealing the global gag rule, according to his campaign. A practicing Catholic, Biden has said he is personally opposed to abortion. But, he said at a vice presidential debate in 2012, “I just refuse to impose that on others.”

John Delaney

Delaney supports repealing the Hyde Amendment, according to his campaign. His universal health care plan, BetterCare, would cover reproductive health care, including abortions.

John Hickenlooper

The former Colorado governor supports repealing Hyde and increasing and protecting Title X family planning funding. “Governor Hickenlooper always has been a strong advocate of a woman’s right to choose,” a spokesperson for his campaign said. “He believes that all decisions should be made between a woman, her faith, and her doctor.”

Julián Castro

The former housing and urban development secretary has committed to nominating judges and Cabinet members who are “pro-choice.” Additionally, he backs repealing Hyde and codifying Roe v. Wade. “All women should have access to reproductive care, regardless of their income or the state they live in,” he previously tweeted.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA)

Harris is among the Democrats who’s offered a more detailed plan on abortion rights that seeks to curb state laws attempting to infringe on them. Under Harris’s proposal, which is modeled after the Voting Rights Act, states whose abortion-related laws have recently been struck down by courts for violating Roe would have to obtain federal approval from the Justice Department before they’re able to implement any new abortion laws.

“As president, I will stop dangerous state laws restricting reproductive rights before they go into effect,” Harris said in a statement. She also backs undoing Hyde, making Roe v. Wade law, and appointing judges that support abortion rights.

At the Planned Parenthood forum, Harris pledged “to do the work on the defense, and to fight, but also work on the offense” when it comes to abortion rights.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY)

Gillibrand has made gender equity and reproductive rights a central piece of her campaign and is considered a leader on the issue. She was the first 2020 Democrat to commit to appointing judges that support Roe, and in the wake of state laws restricting abortion access laid out a wide-ranging plan to protect abortion rights.

In addition to repealing Hyde and codifying Roe, Gillibrand supports undoing the gag rule the Trump administration has imposed. She would also establish a new funding stream in order to ensure that every state has a reproductive health center.

“We must come together to declare, loud and clear, that reproductive rights are human rights. They are civil rights. And they are nonnegotiable,” she wrote in a Medium post.

Marianne Williamson

The author and spiritual adviser, who has described herself as “one hundred percent pro-choice,” backs codifying Roe and repealing the Hyde Amendment.

“I believe the decision of whether or not to have an abortion lies solely with the pregnant woman, according to the dictates of her conscience and in communion with the God of her understanding,” she notes on her campaign website. “I do not feel the government has an appropriate right to deny or restrict that decision.”

Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO)

Bennet supports “enshrining Roe v. Wade into federal statute, preempting states that try to interfere with women’s health rights, repealing the Hyde Amendment, and standing up against other efforts to undermine access to necessary care,” according to a campaign spokesperson.

“Women’s reproductive rights are under assault all over the United States. Women’s health care is under assault all over the United States,” he said during a CNN town hall earlier this year. Bennet has also said he would only appoint judges that back Roe.

Mike Gravel

Former Alaska Sen. Gravel, a candidate who’s notably in the race in order to prompt debate, has an expansive and unique abortion rights agenda. Gravel’s landmark provision would tie an individual’s ability to become a specialized physician with a commitment to providing abortions.

“Our signature point on abortion access is mandating the ability and willingness to provide an abortion as a condition of obstetrician licensing,” according to a campaign spokesperson. “In addition, we support a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to an abortion, as well as lawmaking through the People’s legislature, a fourth branch of government that Mike Gravel supports setting up that would allow direct lawmaking by the American people.”

Gravel also backs repealing Hyde and codifying Roe into law.

South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg

Buttigieg supports repealing Hyde, codifying Roe into law, and appointing judicial nominees who would support Roe. “The mayor is pro-choice and trusts women to make their own health care decisions. He also recognizes the harm in having men legislate women’s bodies,” said a campaign spokesperson.

Buttigieg has previously called for more men to speak out about abortion. “I think it’s particularly important from a political stance for men to stand up,” he said during a campaign event earlier this year, according to HuffPost.

Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA)

Moulton backs the repeal of the Hyde Amendment and enshrining Roe in federal law. He’s said undoing Hyde ensures that all women have the funding they need for health care and compared it to the funding the military needs.

“It’s sort of like saying, you know, I support the troops but don’t want to pay them,” Moulton said of Hyde in a CNN interview. “That’s the analogy here, and I think it’s wrong.”

Moulton has also said he will exclusively appoint judges that support Roe and added that he backs Harris’s proposal to require DOJ review of certain state laws.

Montana Gov. Steve Bullock

Bullock supports ending Hyde, codifying Roe, and strengthening Title X funding, which provides money for family planning and preventive health care clinics (though the domestic gag rule currently restricts it to institutions that do not provide abortions).

“As governor, Bullock has stopped every single effort to restrict reproductive health care, and made Title X funding permanent so it would no longer be a political football,” a campaign spokesperson said.

“It’s not what I think, it’s what does an individual woman need to do with her body and with her health care,” Bullock recently told CNN.

Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH)

Ryan supports codifying Roe and repealing Hyde. He had previously expressed opposition to abortion rights but explained in a 2015 editorial why he’s changed his position.

“I came in as a Catholic school kid from northeast Ohio who didn’t think a whole lot about the issue and went into Congress pro-life,” Ryan told BuzzFeed. “My opinion changed that there should not be anyone from the federal government between a woman and her doctor.”

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI)

Gabbard is supportive of abortion rights, according to a campaign spokesperson, and would back using federal money to provide abortions. Gabbard has previously been anti-abortion but has since changed her position.

Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam

Messam supports codifying Roe and using federal money to provide abortion services. He emphasized, in an interview with WBUR, that he sees Roe as “settled law.”

“I think when a woman is faced with a tough decision to abort a pregnancy, it’s tough enough by itself to have to make such a personal decision — a tough decision to make — and currently right now in our country this issue has been demagogued, and I think that primarily us men are making the decisions in the laws,” he said.",www.vox.com,left,JhcGuYyTwzlVAll3

Gee and Gee v. June Medical Services — that present the greatest threat to the right to an abortion in decades .
The Trump administration filed a brief in these cases last week , asking the Court to dramatically curtail reproductive choice . Much of that brief asks the Court to effectively ignore its decision in Whole Woman ’ s Health v. Hellerstedt ( 2016 ) , which struck down an abortion restriction that is virtually identical to the one at issue in the June Medical cases . But the brief also offers a subtle and arcane argument involving the question of who is allowed to bring a lawsuit challenging laws restricting abortion .
Should this argument prevail — and there ’ s a good chance it will appeal to conservative justices who want to quietly roll back abortion rights while avoiding a political backlash — it would fundamentally alter the landscape of abortion rights . Its immediate effect would likely be to shut down suits challenging anti-abortion laws before those laws take effect ( often , a new state law does not take effect until weeks or months after it is enacted ) .
On the surface , that may seem like a relatively minor inconvenience for abortion advocates , but the Trump administration ’ s argument could also form part of a two-pronged attack on abortion rights that could render them virtually useless .
Last February , Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested he would impose a different procedural barrier on abortion plaintiffs , effectively preventing these plaintiffs from obtaining a court order that applies to anyone other than themselves . The combination of Kavanaugh ’ s proposed barrier and the one advanced by the Trump administration would be devastating to abortion rights .
In effect , this one-two punch against abortion plaintiffs could make it nearly impossible for anyone to obtain an abortion in states that bar the procedure .
The June Medical cases are a showdown over “ TRAP ” laws
For many years , retired Justice Anthony Kennedy was the Supreme Court ’ s “ swing ” vote in abortion cases . Kennedy typically voted to uphold restrictions on abortion , but he also ruled against laws that cut so deeply into the right to an abortion that they effectively eliminated it . This need to secure Kennedy ’ s vote produced an entire cottage industry of anti-abortion lawyers who tried to draft aggressive restrictions on abortion that , at least on the surface , appeared to be something other than an outright ban on abortion .
Abortion proponents deride much of this legislation as “ targeted restrictions on abortion providers , ” or “ TRAP ” laws . TRAP laws are abortion restrictions that superficially appear designed to make abortion safer for patients but actually do little more than make it harder for abortion clinics to operate .
In Whole Woman ’ s Health , Justice Kennedy provided the crucial fifth vote to strike down two provisions of a Texas TRAP law , including a provision requiring abortion providers to obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital before they can perform an abortion .
Admitting privileges are often difficult for abortion doctors to obtain . And they serve little purpose . As one federal judge explained , if a patient experiences complications from an abortion , a hospital “ will treat her regardless of whether her abortion doctor has admitting privileges. ” Moreover , as the Supreme Court explained in Whole Woman ’ s Health , such complications are exceedingly rare — studies indicate that they occur in “ less than one-quarter of 1 percent ” of first-trimester abortions .
June Medical involves a Louisiana admitting privileges law that is virtually identical to the one struck down in Whole Woman ’ s Health . Indeed , the most relevant distinction between the two cases has little to do with the law or the facts of either case . The most relevant distinction is that Kennedy is now retired , and his replacement — Kavanaugh — has a far more anti-abortion record .
But June Medical also places the justices in an awkward position . Because the law in June Medical is almost indistinguishable from the one struck down in Whole Woman ’ s Health , a decision upholding the Louisiana law would reveal that the outcome of major Supreme Court cases has more to do with who sits on the Court than what the law actually says .
Though a conservative lower court tried to argue that the Texas and Louisiana cases are factually distinguishable , this effort earned a sharp rebuke from Judge Patrick Higginbotham , a Reagan appointee , who accused his colleagues of ignoring the Supreme Court ’ s determination that “ ‘ unnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden ’ on the exercise of that right . ”
And that brings us to the Trump administration ’ s procedural argument , which potentially gives the Supreme Court ’ s Republican majority a way to toss out this lawsuit without having to explicitly declare that TRAP laws are constitutionally acceptable .
June Medical is technically two consolidated cases , June Medical Services v. Gee and Gee v. June Medical Services . The first case concerns the constitutionality of Louisiana ’ s admitting privileges law . The second concerns a threshold question — whether the right party brought this lawsuit in the first place .
The general rule in federal courts is that a plaintiff “ must assert his own legal rights and interests , and can not rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties. ” Thus , because the constitutional right to an abortion belongs to the person seeking an abortion , the ordinary rule would require that person to be the plaintiff in any lawsuit challenging an abortion restriction .
But the Supreme Court also allows third parties to bring a lawsuit in limited circumstances — when “ the party asserting the right has a ‘ close ’ relationship with the person who possesses the right ” and “ there is a ‘ hindrance ’ to the possessor ’ s ability to protect his own interests. ” This doctrine is known as “ third-party standing . ”
Thus , the Court has historically allowed abortion providers to challenge laws restricting abortion under the third-party standing doctrine . As Justice Harry Blackmun explained in Singleton v. Wulff ( 1976 ) , “ the constitutionally protected abortion decision is one in which the physician is intimately involved. ” And abortion patients may be hindered in their ability to assert their rights , in no small part because an individual seeking an abortion is likely to give birth before the scope of their rights is fully litigated .
Both Louisiana and the Trump administration ask the justices to strip abortion providers of their ability to bring such lawsuits — or , at least , to strip them of their ability to challenge laws like Louisiana ’ s TRAP laws . According to the administration ’ s brief , abortion providers should not be able to assert the rights of their patients because the providers ’ interests are “ potentially in conflict ” with the interests of those patients .
The Trump administration claims the law at issue in June Medical “ requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges in part as a prophylactic measure for the safety of women who obtain abortions. ” Such a law obviously burdens physicians . But , at least according to the administration , the law “ imposes no direct costs on [ patients ] , and they may see its benefits as quite significant . ”
One problem with this argument is that the Supreme Court already determined , in Whole Woman ’ s Health , that the health benefits of an admitting privileges law are minimal at best .
Another problem is that the administration ’ s argument assumes its own conclusion . The core legal question in June Medical is whether Louisiana ’ s law is a legitimate health regulation or a sham law enacted to shut down abortion clinics . But the Trump administration ’ s argument effectively requires courts to assume that Louisiana is telling the truth , and then use this assumption to kick physicians out of court .
As the plaintiffs argued in a brief to the Supreme Court , if this attack on third-party standing is embraced by the Court , “ a state could negate an abortion provider ’ s third-party standing in any case , even if its proffered health and safety justifications for the challenged law were pretextual. ” A state could require all abortion clinics to keep a stable full of unicorns , then strip those clinics of their right to challenge that law by claiming that unicorns help improve health outcomes .
The Supreme Court could quash the right to an abortion entirely through procedural shenanigans
As a practical matter , a decision stripping abortion providers of third-party standing would make it much harder to challenge abortion restrictions in court . Lawyers would have to track down an actual pregnant person who wants to get an abortion but is prevented from doing so by a state abortion restriction , and they ’ d need to convince this person to sign on as a plaintiff .
This inconvenience probably would not be enough to shut down abortion litigation entirely — Roe v. Wade , after all , was brought by an individual woman seeking an abortion . But an attack on third-person standing is one half of an agenda that could effectively destroy abortion rights .
The other half can be found in a dissenting opinion Kavanaugh wrote just a few months after he joined the Court , which argued that the Supreme Court should not have temporarily stayed the lower court ’ s decision upholding the Louisiana law .
Much of Kavanaugh ’ s opinion rests on a distinction between “ facial ” challenges to an unconstitutional law and “ as applied ” challenges . When the Supreme Court declares a law to be invalid on its face , that means the law ceases to operate altogether — it ’ s as if the law never existed . Whole Woman ’ s Health , for example , held that Texas ’ s admitting privileges law was facially invalid .
When a court strikes down a law as applied to a particular plaintiff , by contrast , that means the law can not be applied in the specific circumstances that arose in that case . But the state may still be able to enforce the same law against other parties who are not before the court .
Kavanaugh suggested that a facial challenge to Louisiana ’ s TRAP law is not appropriate . Rather , plaintiffs must file an as-applied challenge if they wish to contest such a law .
Which brings us back to the question of third-party standing . If Louisiana and the Trump administration get their way in June Medical , that will mean abortion providers and clinics will no longer be able to bring lawsuits challenging many abortion restrictions — only individual patients will be able to do so .
Moreover , if Kavanaugh gets his way on facial and as-applied challenges — an outcome that four justices pushed for in Planned Parenthood v. Casey ( 1992 ) —that would mean that an individual patient challenging an abortion restriction would only be able to secure a court order allowing them and them alone to obtain an abortion . Someone seeking an abortion would need to find a lawyer , file a lawsuit , secure a court order , obtain the abortion , and do all of this before their pregnancy became so advanced that it was no longer legal for them to terminate it .
And that ’ s assuming they could still find an abortion clinic within their state . It ’ s not at all clear that abortion clinics could continue to operate if they were only allowed to treat patients who secured a court order .
In a world without a constitutional right to an abortion , reproductive choice becomes a privilege restricted to people of means . Wealthy individuals will still be able to fly to another state — or even another country — if they need to do so to obtain an abortion . They are also more likely to have the job flexibility they need to travel to a distant clinic . And should they encounter legal obstacles along the way , wealthy individuals will have a much easier time securing legal counsel .
Less well-off patients , meanwhile , will likely be forced to carry their pregnancy to term .
For these individuals , it won ’ t matter if they are denied the right to an abortion because that right is formally overruled , or because the Supreme Court has erected so many procedural barriers that it is impossible to vindicate the abortion right in court . In either event , the outcome will be the same .","In March, the Supreme Court will hear a pair of consolidated cases — June Medical Services v. Gee and Gee v. June Medical Services — that present the greatest threat to the right to an abortion in decades.

Third-party standing, explained

June Medical is technically two consolidated cases, June Medical Services v. Gee and Gee v. June Medical Services. The first case concerns the constitutionality of Louisiana’s admitting privileges law. The second concerns a threshold question — whether the right party brought this lawsuit in the first place.

The general rule in federal courts is that a plaintiff “must assert his own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.” Thus, because the constitutional right to an abortion belongs to the person seeking an abortion, the ordinary rule would require that person to be the plaintiff in any lawsuit challenging an abortion restriction.

But the Supreme Court also allows third parties to bring a lawsuit in limited circumstances — when “the party asserting the right has a ‘close’ relationship with the person who possesses the right” and “there is a ‘hindrance’ to the possessor’s ability to protect his own interests.” This doctrine is known as “third-party standing.”

Thus, the Court has historically allowed abortion providers to challenge laws restricting abortion under the third-party standing doctrine. As Justice Harry Blackmun explained in Singleton v. Wulff (1976), “the constitutionally protected abortion decision is one in which the physician is intimately involved.” And abortion patients may be hindered in their ability to assert their rights, in no small part because an individual seeking an abortion is likely to give birth before the scope of their rights is fully litigated.

Both Louisiana and the Trump administration ask the justices to strip abortion providers of their ability to bring such lawsuits — or, at least, to strip them of their ability to challenge laws like Louisiana’s TRAP laws. According to the administration’s brief, abortion providers should not be able to assert the rights of their patients because the providers’ interests are “potentially in conflict” with the interests of those patients.

The Trump administration claims the law at issue in June Medical “requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges in part as a prophylactic measure for the safety of women who obtain abortions.” Such a law obviously burdens physicians. But, at least according to the administration, the law “imposes no direct costs on [patients], and they may see its benefits as quite significant.”

One problem with this argument is that the Supreme Court already determined, in Whole Woman’s Health, that the health benefits of an admitting privileges law are minimal at best.

Another problem is that the administration’s argument assumes its own conclusion. The core legal question in June Medical is whether Louisiana’s law is a legitimate health regulation or a sham law enacted to shut down abortion clinics. But the Trump administration’s argument effectively requires courts to assume that Louisiana is telling the truth, and then use this assumption to kick physicians out of court.

As the plaintiffs argued in a brief to the Supreme Court, if this attack on third-party standing is embraced by the Court, “a state could negate an abortion provider’s third-party standing in any case, even if its proffered health and safety justifications for the challenged law were pretextual.” A state could require all abortion clinics to keep a stable full of unicorns, then strip those clinics of their right to challenge that law by claiming that unicorns help improve health outcomes.

The Supreme Court could quash the right to an abortion entirely through procedural shenanigans

As a practical matter, a decision stripping abortion providers of third-party standing would make it much harder to challenge abortion restrictions in court. Lawyers would have to track down an actual pregnant person who wants to get an abortion but is prevented from doing so by a state abortion restriction, and they’d need to convince this person to sign on as a plaintiff.

This inconvenience probably would not be enough to shut down abortion litigation entirely — Roe v. Wade, after all, was brought by an individual woman seeking an abortion. But an attack on third-person standing is one half of an agenda that could effectively destroy abortion rights.

The other half can be found in a dissenting opinion Kavanaugh wrote just a few months after he joined the Court, which argued that the Supreme Court should not have temporarily stayed the lower court’s decision upholding the Louisiana law.

Much of Kavanaugh’s opinion rests on a distinction between “facial” challenges to an unconstitutional law and “as applied” challenges. When the Supreme Court declares a law to be invalid on its face, that means the law ceases to operate altogether — it’s as if the law never existed. Whole Woman’s Health, for example, held that Texas’s admitting privileges law was facially invalid.

When a court strikes down a law as applied to a particular plaintiff, by contrast, that means the law cannot be applied in the specific circumstances that arose in that case. But the state may still be able to enforce the same law against other parties who are not before the court.

Kavanaugh suggested that a facial challenge to Louisiana’s TRAP law is not appropriate. Rather, plaintiffs must file an as-applied challenge if they wish to contest such a law.

Which brings us back to the question of third-party standing. If Louisiana and the Trump administration get their way in June Medical, that will mean abortion providers and clinics will no longer be able to bring lawsuits challenging many abortion restrictions — only individual patients will be able to do so.

Moreover, if Kavanaugh gets his way on facial and as-applied challenges — an outcome that four justices pushed for in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) —that would mean that an individual patient challenging an abortion restriction would only be able to secure a court order allowing them and them alone to obtain an abortion. Someone seeking an abortion would need to find a lawyer, file a lawsuit, secure a court order, obtain the abortion, and do all of this before their pregnancy became so advanced that it was no longer legal for them to terminate it.

And that’s assuming they could still find an abortion clinic within their state. It’s not at all clear that abortion clinics could continue to operate if they were only allowed to treat patients who secured a court order.

In a world without a constitutional right to an abortion, reproductive choice becomes a privilege restricted to people of means. Wealthy individuals will still be able to fly to another state — or even another country — if they need to do so to obtain an abortion. They are also more likely to have the job flexibility they need to travel to a distant clinic. And should they encounter legal obstacles along the way, wealthy individuals will have a much easier time securing legal counsel.

Less well-off patients, meanwhile, will likely be forced to carry their pregnancy to term.

For these individuals, it won’t matter if they are denied the right to an abortion because that right is formally overruled, or because the Supreme Court has erected so many procedural barriers that it is impossible to vindicate the abortion right in court. In either event, the outcome will be the same.",www.vox.com,left,HCeWxT3BKK9d4K4a

The filibuster of Texas Sen. Wendy Davis became a viral sensation

Barely a week after Indiana's ill-fated religious freedom fight had people eulogizing social conservatism, Rand Paul picked a fight on abortion — and won.

When a reporter cited the Democratic National Committee before asking Paul if there were any exceptions to his opposition to abortion, the GOP presidential candidate challenged the reporter to ask if there were any exceptions to the DNC's support for legal abortion.

Why don't we ask the DNC: Is it OK to kill a 7-pound baby in the uterus? You go back and go ask Debbie Wasserman Schultz if she's OK with killing a 7-pound baby that's just not born yet. Ask her when life begins, and ask Debbie when she's willing to protect life. When you get an answer from Debbie, come back to me. [Rand Paul]

DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz replied with a press release, but didn't exactly list any exceptions to her position.

Here's an answer. I support letting women and their doctors make this decision without government getting involved. Period. End of story. [Debbie Wasserman Schultz]

Conservatives celebrated Paul for being the rare Republican to finally go on the offensive on abortion rather than seem embarrassed by his position. And after an initially hostile press reaction to Paul's comments, mainstream journalists started comparing it to Ronald Reagan's ""I paid for this microphone"" moment in the 1980 presidential campaign. Even some liberals started getting into the act.

Why? Because lots of people are actually conflicted about abortion.

Abortion really does end the life of a fetus, just like pro-life Americans say. And unwanted pregnancy really is a major hardship for women, just like pro-choice Americans say. Both sides make a legitimate, intellectually coherent case — and the millions upon millions of Americans who live far from our political poles understand this.

Supporters of legal abortion frequently focus on the hard cases. They tend to emphasize victims of rape and incest, women and fetuses with serious health problems, and the impact some abortion restrictions might hypothetically have on widely used forms of birth control. There's an old saying that hard cases make bad law, but pro-choice activists have found them a more effective defense of their preferred policies than an unqualified endorsement of elective abortion.

Yet their side has its own hard cases. Rand Paul isn't the first person to point this out.

During the 1990s, the pro-life movement shifted its tactics. After years of demanding a constitutional amendment that would either outlaw abortion or kick abortion policy back to the states by overturning Roe v. Wade, they began advocating incremental legislation. Their biggest legislative victory prior to that point was the Hyde amendment barring Medicaid-funded abortions. So why not try similar measures?

These included bans on other types of taxpayer funding for abortion, laws requiring parental notification or consent for minors seeking abortions (usually with a judicial bypass option), and outlawing partial-birth abortion. (Partial-birth abortion — frequently put in scare quotes by media outlets who recognized it as an anti-abortion phrase — describes a particularly grisly late-term abortion procedure that involves the partial delivery of the fetus.)

Barbara Boxer and Rick Santorum once had a memorable exchange on the Senate floor about how much of a baby would have to be outside of the womb before it received legal protection. Boxer initially suggested that full legal rights begin ""when you bring your baby home,"" prompting Santorum to ask ""if the baby's foot was inside the mother and the rest of the baby was outside, could that baby be killed?"" National Review's Ramesh Ponnuru later described this back-and-forth as ""a deadly game of Hokey-Pokey.""

But this debate over partial-birth abortion generally coincided with a broader anti-abortion trend in public opinion. Why? Because for once, supporters of legal abortion were on the defensive about a hard case.

In general, support for legal abortion is strongest in the earliest stages of pregnancy and lowest in the later stages. Defending late-term abortion is unpopular — just like opposing legal abortion for rape victims.

Wendy Davis' position on abortion is not much more popular than Todd Akin's. Yet, as Rand Paul might remind us, Akin faced (and flubbed) much tougher abortion-related questions than Davis did.

More than 70 percent of Americans tell Gallup they support at least some abortion restrictions. I haven't seen recent polling that tests support for legal abortion for any reason throughout pregnancy with at least some public funding available, but I doubt it would be appreciably more popular than no-exceptions opposition to abortion.

Since 1988, every Republican presidential nominee has favored exceptions for rape and incest. (The only exception since abortion became a contested political issue was Reagan.) Since 1993, Republicans have accepted exceptions for rape and incest in the Hyde amendment.

Where will the next Democratic presidential candidate stand on the hard cases? They might hide behind misconceptions of what Roe v. Wade actually allows or try to come up with late-term abortion measures with extremely broad exceptions.

( AP ) — New York state enacted one of the nation ’ s strongest protections for abortion rights Tuesday , a move that state leaders say was needed to safeguard those rights should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade .
The Democrat-led Senate and Assembly passed the bill Tuesday , the 46th anniversary of the Roe decision . Democratic Gov . Andrew Cuomo immediately signed it into law . At his side at a hastily arranged signing ceremony was Sarah Weddington , the Texas attorney who successfully argued Roe before the nation ’ s highest court .
“ Thank you for what you ’ ve done for women , ” she told Cuomo and the assembled lawmakers and advocates who worked for years to pass the bill .
Known as the Reproductive Health Act , the measure replaces a 1970 state abortion law that was passed three years before Roe legalized abortion nationwide . It codifies many abortion rights laid out in Roe and other court rulings , including a provision permitting late-term abortions when a woman ’ s health is endangered . The previous law , which was in conflict with Roe and other subsequent abortion rulings , only permitted abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy if a woman ’ s life was at risk .
The new law also authorizes physician assistants to perform some abortions and moves the section of state law dealing with abortion from the penal code to health statutes .
Nine other states including California , Washington and Oregon have already put protections for abortion rights in their state statute , giving them a legal backstop should Roe be overturned .
Abortion rights supporters had pushed for years to update the law to reflect those rulings only to be blocked in the state Senate , long controlled by Republicans . But big election gains put Democrats in charge of the Senate this year , and the act easily cleared both chambers . Supporters said the election of Republican President Donald Trump — and his nomination of conservative justices — helped galvanize the effort .
“ We have a president who has made it very , very clear that he wants to overturn Roe v. Wade , ” said the Senate ’ s new leader , Democrat Andrea Stewart-Cousins of Yonkers , who vowed to make the bill an early priority in 2019 . “ Today in New York we are saying ‘ No . Not here in New York . ’ ”
Opponents lamented the enactment of the act , which some predicted would lead to an increase in late-term abortion . Others argued that the new law could make it harder for prosecutors to bring charges when a woman is assaulted and loses her pregnancy .
“ Today , New York state has added a sad chapter to this already solemn date of January 22 , the anniversary of Roe v. Wade , ” the state ’ s Catholic bishops said in a statement .
Republicans in the Senate tried to derail the bill and offered up proposals to create new legal penalties for harming a pregnant woman . They were joined at a press conference Tuesday morning by Livia Abreu , an Army veteran and Bronx resident whose ex-boyfriend stabbed her last year , ending her 26-week pregnancy . The man faces multiple charges , including violations of the state ’ s 1970 law . Abreu said repealing the law would tie the hands of prosecutors in similar future cases .

The law required doctors to have admitting privileges for hospitals within 30 miles of an abortion clinic ( via Associated Press/Huffington Post ) :
A federal judge has temporarily blocked enforcement of Louisiana 's restrictive new abortion law . District Judge John deGravelles says the law can still take effect Monday but officials can not penalize doctors or clinics for breaking it while a challenge is heard . The law would require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges to a hospital within 30 miles of their clinics . A Center for Reproductive Rights lawsuit claims doctors have n't had enough time to obtain privileges and the law likely would force Louisiana 's five abortion clinics to close .
BREAKING : US judge temporarily blocks La . from enforcing law imposing toughened abortion restrictions . — The Associated Press ( @ AP ) September 1 , 2014
The law would have fined non-compliant doctors $ 4,000 and the loss of their medical license . While the law goes into effect without enforcement measures , the judge noted that it 's unclear if the regulatory fallout would lead to abortion clinic closures :
However , deGravelles wrote , clinics ' lawyers have not proven that enforcing the law would shut down most , if not all , of Louisiana 's clinics , eliminating access to legal abortions in Louisiana . Because the doctors ' applications have n't all been acted on and the attorneys do n't represent two clinics , that 's speculative , he said . `` How many patients do these other two facilities treat ?

The law required doctors to have admitting privileges for hospitals within 30 miles of an abortion clinic (via Associated Press/Huffington Post):

A federal judge has temporarily blocked enforcement of Louisiana's restrictive new abortion law. District Judge John deGravelles says the law can still take effect Monday but officials cannot penalize doctors or clinics for breaking it while a challenge is heard. The law would require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges to a hospital within 30 miles of their clinics. A Center for Reproductive Rights lawsuit claims doctors haven't had enough time to obtain privileges and the law likely would force Louisiana's five abortion clinics to close.

The law would have fined non-compliant doctors $4,000 and the loss of their medical license. While the law goes into effect without enforcement measures, the judge noted that it's unclear if the regulatory fallout would lead to abortion clinic closures:

However, deGravelles wrote, clinics' lawyers have not proven that enforcing the law would shut down most, if not all, of Louisiana's clinics, eliminating access to legal abortions in Louisiana. Because the doctors' applications haven't all been acted on and the attorneys don't represent two clinics, that's speculative, he said. ""How many patients do these other two facilities treat? How many doctors practice there? How many of these doctors have applied for admitting privileges and what is the status of their applications?"" he wrote. He said he needs answers to those and other questions, including how far patients would have to travel for care if the other two clinics stayed open. Admitting privileges laws have passed across the South. A panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over Louisiana, upheld a similar Texas law. But in July, a different panel of the 5th Circuit voted to overturn Mississippi's law, which would have shuttered the state's only abortion clinic, saying every state must guarantee the right to an abortion.

By midnight Texas time, it was all over but the parliamentary inquiries. After a nearly 11-hour filibuster attempt by state Sen. Wendy Davis to block sweeping restrictions on abortion, the Republican-dominated Texas Senate successfully shut down the filibuster on points of order. (See update at the bottom of this post.)

""This is probably the worst night that I've experienced since I've been in the Senate, maybe since I've been in public life,"" said state Sen. Kirk Watson, a Democrat from Austin.

Update at 6 p.m. ET. Perry Calls For Special Session:

Gov. Rick Perry says lawmakers will take up the abortion legislation and other measures on Monday, as he calls for a special session of the Legislature.

Our original post continues:

Davis stood and spoke continuously for nearly 11 hours in an attempt to block passage of SB 5, a bill that would ban all abortions after 20 weeks and could effectively close all but five abortion clinics in the state. Supporters say the new, stringent standards raise the level of care for Texas women. The majority of Texas voters polled have shown support for restrictions on abortion.

The dramatic restrictions in the bill had already drawn national attention for their reach. But her riveting, one-woman attempt to stop it put Wendy Davis' name on the national map. A single mother at 19 who raised her children while putting herself through Harvard Law School, Davis has represented a Fort Worth swing district in the Texas Senate since 2008. To catch a glimpse of her, the line outside the Texas Senate gallery wound down three floors of the Texas Capitol for hours. President Obama tweeted a link to the livestream, saying, ""Something special is happening in Austin tonight."" Fueled by a popular Twitter hashtag, #standwithwendy, more than 100,000 people were still watching a parliamentary debate over Roberts Rules of Order on the livestream at midnight.

Davis' chair was removed before she began speaking at 11:18 a.m. CT Tuesday. Donning pink tennis shoes, she started by saying, ""I'm rising on the floor today to humbly give voice to thousands of Texans who have been ignored. These voices have been silenced by a governor who made blind partisanship and personal political ambition the official business of our great state.""

Had the filibuster continued until midnight, Davis would have blocked the controversial abortion bill from passage because the Legislature's special session was constitutionally required to come to a close by then. A successful filibuster would have prevented the Senate from getting a chance to take a final vote on the bill.

Her tweet “ I need birth control because I have endometriosis and it helps manage pain . Why do you ? ” went viral . And at first I couldn ’ t figure out why .
Haven ’ t we all known since the contraception mandate debate began that there are a “ few ” women who “ occasionally ” use contraception for reasons other than delaying , or avoiding , motherhood ? Sandra Fluke , for instance , name-checked some of these women during the congressional testimony that turned her into a conservative target and then a feminist rock star .
But conversations with friends following Dunham ’ s twitter-confession helped me realize why the tweet struck a chord : Many women use birth control for reasons other than pregnancy , and we just haven ’ t heard from them much because those reasons are usually embarrassing . As a result , women rarely discuss other reasons for using birth control among themselves , let alone boyfriends or husbands , and certainly not in public political discourse .
In the years since the contraception debate first exploded , the media narrative has remained largely the same : Women rely on birth control to prevent pregnancy , and a handful of women who have more exotic health woes need contraception for something else . They are rarities , so the thinking goes , and if they really and truly need birth control for health reasons they will find some way to get it covered , regardless of how religious their employers are .
However , after chatting with a few friends who , like me , had relied on birth control at one time or another for reasons beyond pregnancy prevention , I decided to email 10 other women and ask the awkward question : Have any of you taken birth control for reasons that had nothing to do with preventing pregnancy ? Only two women wrote back to say pregnancy prevention was the primary reason they had used birth control throughout their lives . The eight others wrote back with stories about a variety of health conditions that caused them to take some form of contraception .
One Texas based woman said her menstrual flow was so heavy as a young woman her doctor prescribed birth control so she would not become anemic . A woman named Deborah wrote back and said she is currently using an IUD , one of the forms of birth control at the heart of the Hobby Lobby dispute , for the same reason . ( An ob-gyn quoted by The New York Times in 2008 cited IUDs as one of the best methods for treating heavy menstrual bleeding . )
Three women said they had severe acne and the doctors tried birth control pills as a last resort . Another woman said she is currently using it to battle polycystic ovaries . Others mentioned severe premenstrual symptoms—the kind that can ’ t be cured by popping a Tylenol .
While 10 women do not constitute a comprehensive survey , the responses are striking nonetheless . Furthermore , a 2011 analysis by the nonprofit Guttmacher Institute found that 14 percent of women use contraception exclusively for something other than pregnancy prevention . In fact , many of these women have never had sexual intercourse .
And the same data found that only 42 percent of respondents use the pill exclusively for pregnancy prevention , meaning that for nearly 60 percent of women , preventing pregnancy is only one reason they take contraception . Making this number more noteworthy is that some of the contraceptive-using women I emailed made a point to note that they are not currently sexually active .
Why does that matter ? Because , in a study , they may technically fall into the category of someone who has used contraception for pregnancy prevention and other reasons , even though right now the reasons they take birth control have nothing to do with pregnancy prevention .
And there are a host of other reasons women take birth control that have come up in previous conversations I ’ ve had , but would be unlikely to emerge in an article on public policy . For instance , some women use it not only to curb premenstrual symptoms , but also to control when they menstruate . So if a woman has a job that will be particularly demanding and require more physical exertion during a certain time of the month , she can use her birth control pills to ensure that she doesn ’ t get her period at a moment when it could really inhibit her performance . That not only benefits her , but her employer as well .
Rolling your eyes ? Then consider this . In 2013 , Taiwan passed an amendment to its Gender Equality Act allotting women three paid days of menstrual leave each year . Which seems like a better economic move for employers : Having women miss work because of preventable symptoms , or covering medication that can alleviate the symptoms ?
But even raising the role of birth control in treating menstrual symptoms publicly can be politically fraught for some women . After all , there are already thousands of jokes out there about women and PMS . And there is already the perception among some men that , if we need meds to help us function once a month because of mother nature , then we really are the weaker sex .
This may be one reason that some of the women I reached out to , some of whom are in media , have never mentioned their own non-pregnancy-related birth control needs on the record—even when they have addressed the topic publicly . Only two women I talked to , in fact , were comfortable with me using their names in this piece .
While women may not want to have a candid conversation about pregnancy prevention with a boss , even fewer want to have a candid conversation about menstruating , or endometriosis or acne for that matter . On the one hand , we shouldn ’ t have to . Ideally our health matters should be private . But since so much of the debate around contraception has become about necessity versus choice , and sexual choice in particular , maybe if some of us gathered the courage to speak more openly about the reasons we need contraception—reasons that are awkward and uncomfortable but still important—the conversation would shift .
Viagra originally gained wide public acceptance not because of the sexy ads we are all used to seeing now , where jazz music plays softly as a “ mature ” couple frolics in a hot tub , but because Bob Dole starred in a bunch of uncomfortable commercials . He reminded us he had a health problem and found a medication that addressed it .
Maybe more women need to be willing to do that ; to tell the truth , no matter how uncomfortable it makes us , and no matter how uncomfortable it makes some of the men making decisions for us . In fact , my guess is that if President Obama stopped talking about “ choice ” and “ reproductive health ” and repeated over and over “ A lot of women have heavy menstrual bleeding and need medication , ” most male opposition would retreat , if only so they never had to hear the words “ menstrual bleeding ” ever again .
So instead of just focusing on court cases and politicking , maybe supporters of birth control should focus on finding the movement ’ s Bob Dole , who can send a convincing and compelling message that contraception is a necessity .","Lena Dunham recently sparked an online frenzy by tweeting about something that doesn’t seem particularly controversial: birth control.

Three women said they had severe acne and the doctors tried birth control pills as a last resort. Another woman said she is currently using it to battle polycystic ovaries. Others mentioned severe premenstrual symptoms—the kind that can’t be cured by popping a Tylenol.

While 10 women do not constitute a comprehensive survey, the responses are striking nonetheless. Furthermore, a 2011 analysis by the nonprofit Guttmacher Institute found that 14 percent of women use contraception exclusively for something other than pregnancy prevention. In fact, many of these women have never had sexual intercourse.

And the same data found that only 42 percent of respondents use the pill exclusively for pregnancy prevention, meaning that for nearly 60 percent of women, preventing pregnancy is only one reason they take contraception. Making this number more noteworthy is that some of the contraceptive-using women I emailed made a point to note that they are not currently sexually active.

Why does that matter? Because, in a study, they may technically fall into the category of someone who has used contraception for pregnancy prevention and other reasons, even though right now the reasons they take birth control have nothing to do with pregnancy prevention.

And there are a host of other reasons women take birth control that have come up in previous conversations I’ve had, but would be unlikely to emerge in an article on public policy. For instance, some women use it not only to curb premenstrual symptoms, but also to control when they menstruate. So if a woman has a job that will be particularly demanding and require more physical exertion during a certain time of the month, she can use her birth control pills to ensure that she doesn’t get her period at a moment when it could really inhibit her performance. That not only benefits her, but her employer as well.

Rolling your eyes? Then consider this. In 2013, Taiwan passed an amendment to its Gender Equality Act allotting women three paid days of menstrual leave each year. Which seems like a better economic move for employers: Having women miss work because of preventable symptoms, or covering medication that can alleviate the symptoms?

But even raising the role of birth control in treating menstrual symptoms publicly can be politically fraught for some women. After all, there are already thousands of jokes out there about women and PMS. And there is already the perception among some men that, if we need meds to help us function once a month because of mother nature, then we really are the weaker sex.

This may be one reason that some of the women I reached out to, some of whom are in media, have never mentioned their own non-pregnancy-related birth control needs on the record—even when they have addressed the topic publicly. Only two women I talked to, in fact, were comfortable with me using their names in this piece.

While women may not want to have a candid conversation about pregnancy prevention with a boss, even fewer want to have a candid conversation about menstruating, or endometriosis or acne for that matter. On the one hand, we shouldn’t have to. Ideally our health matters should be private. But since so much of the debate around contraception has become about necessity versus choice, and sexual choice in particular, maybe if some of us gathered the courage to speak more openly about the reasons we need contraception—reasons that are awkward and uncomfortable but still important—the conversation would shift.

Viagra originally gained wide public acceptance not because of the sexy ads we are all used to seeing now, where jazz music plays softly as a “mature” couple frolics in a hot tub, but because Bob Dole starred in a bunch of uncomfortable commercials. He reminded us he had a health problem and found a medication that addressed it.

Maybe more women need to be willing to do that; to tell the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it makes us, and no matter how uncomfortable it makes some of the men making decisions for us. In fact, my guess is that if President Obama stopped talking about “choice” and “reproductive health” and repeated over and over “A lot of women have heavy menstrual bleeding and need medication,” most male opposition would retreat, if only so they never had to hear the words “menstrual bleeding” ever again.

So instead of just focusing on court cases and politicking, maybe supporters of birth control should focus on finding the movement’s Bob Dole, who can send a convincing and compelling message that contraception is a necessity.",www.thedailybeast.com,left,N8O8aSuaOnS6gMPl

But there is one method that both consistently produces more liberal responses on abortion policy — and which also seems methodologically appropriate , on the merits . On so-called moral issues such as abortion , voters often have difficulty distinguishing questions about their political views from inquiries into their personal ethics . For example , one can interpret “ Should abortion be allowed in X circumstance ? ” as “ Do you think it is right for someone to have an abortion in X circumstance ? ” — rather than as “ Do you think the government should establish criminal penalties for doctors who provide abortions in X circumstance ? ” Thus to get an accurate sense of what voters actually want the government to do on issues of reproductive rights , it is best to foreground the fact that you are not asking about how individuals should behave but about how politicians should legislate .
And when the law is foregrounded , many voters turn out to be a lot more “ pro-choice ” than they believe themselves to be . For example , a recent survey commissioned by the Knights of Columbus found a majority of voters saying that their opinion on abortion was best described as either “ abortion should be allowed only during the first three months of a pregnancy ” or “ abortions should only be allowed in cases of rape , incest , or to spare the life of the mother. ” Only 11 percent said their view was best summarized as “ abortion should be allowed during the first six months of a pregnancy. ” These findings were then reported as showing majoritarian support for substantial new legal restrictions on abortion .
And yet when PerryUndem asked voters specifically whether they wanted their elected representatives to restrict abortion after the first trimester , opposition to the idea was overwhelming . Asked whether the government should “ pass a new law ” restricting abortion to the first three months of pregnancy , just 15 percent of respondents said yes — while 85 percent agreed that “ it ’ s better if lawmakers stay out of this because every situation is different . ”
This comports with a 2017 PerryUndem survey that asked , “ Who should decide how far along in a pregnancy a woman can have an abortion ? , ” and then gave respondents a variety of options , including “ the doctor , ” “ the medical profession , ” “ the woman , ” “ the Supreme Court , ” “ politicians in Congress , ” and “ politicians at the state level , ” among others — then invited them to select as many of these authorities as they felt appropriate .

He ’ s not alone . On Wednesday afternoon , 18 House Republicans told leadership that they “ can not and will not support any funding resolution … that contains any funding for Planned Parenthood. ” Meanwhile , GOP social conservatives like Sens . James Lankford of Oklahoma and Jeff Sessions of Alabama said they ’ d consider supporting an effort to attach a spending rider that would eliminate Planned Parenthood ’ s $ 528 million in annual government funding to must-pass spending legislation this fall .
It ’ s a potentially ominous sign for GOP leaders desperate to avoid another shutdown debacle . While Cruz may be radioactive in the Senate GOP conference after calling his leader a liar , his analysis of next week ’ s vote has merit : With Democrats vowing to block the measure , Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) won ’ t be able to get the 60 votes he needs to advance the bill next week , a result that likely won ’ t satisfy a conservative base itching for confrontation over abortion .
In a Wednesday interview , Cruz said the GOP should go as hard as it can to block funding for Planned Parenthood , including the same strategy he tried to use to defund Obamacare in 2013 : force the issue by blocking funding in a government spending bill that must pass by Sept. 30 .
Asked whether he would support such a maneuver again , Cruz replied : “ I would support any and all legislative efforts to defund Planned Parenthood . We do not need a legislative show-vote . ”
On the other side of the Capitol , Rep. Mick Mulvaney ( R-S.C. ) said dozens of House Republicans will back his effort to oppose any spending bill — whether a continuing resolution stopgap or longer-term funding package — that includes any money for Planned Parenthood .
“ This is one of those line-in-the-sand type of issues , ” Mulvaney said Wednesday . “ Every time we say we don ’ t want to spend money on something , the answer is it will provoke a shutdown . ”
This weekend , Senate conservatives had pushed to attach defunding provisions to the must-pass transportation bill , but now they are shifting their sights to this fall ’ s government spending bill . Lankford , both a social conservative and an ally of leadership , said he ’ d support defunding Planned Parenthood “ wherever we can get it , ” and Sessions said Republicans “ don ’ t need to take no for an answer ” after Democrats reject the GOP defunding bill next week .
“ Congress doesn ’ t have to fund any program it doesn ’ t think is justified . How does it get to be that a minority of the Democrats can dictate that a majority party has to fund programs it doesn ’ t believe in ? ” Sessions added . “ We don ’ t need to go at it halfheartedly . ”
Democrats say the GOP efforts will be futile . Republicans lost a 2011 fight to defund Planned Parenthood and a 2013 push to defund Obamacare plunged the government into a shutdown . Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) said a repeat of that show would be “ gridlock ” — but other party insiders warned the results could be even more consequential .
“ The immovable object is about to meet the unstoppable force : Republicans can not pass a bill that funds Planned Parenthood and congressional Democrats and President [ Barack ] Obama can not vote for or sign a bill that defunds it , ” said a senior Senate Democratic aide .
But many Republicans aren ’ t willing to go there yet , including the recipient of Cruz ’ s “ show-vote ” diss , Sen. Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) , who ’ s working with Lankford , Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa and party leaders to set up next week ’ s vote to slash Planned Parenthood ’ s funding .
“ First things first . We ’ re going to try to see if we can win this vote . It ’ s a big , big battle and we ’ re going to try to see if we can get some Democrats to vote with us on this , ” Paul said . “ We are going to bring the fight to them . ”
Another Republican presidential hopeful , Sen. Marco Rubio ( R-Fla. ) , refused to say a word when asked about the strategy .
Indeed , with Cruz using attacks on McConnell to raise campaign money , the confrontational tactics must catch fire beyond just the party ’ s right flank if supporters of defunding hope to force GOP leaders to include a controversial rider in a spending bill . Several GOP senators said in interviews that they weren ’ t ready to commit to a hard-line strategy or pledge to vote against any funding bill that included money for Planned Parenthood .
“ Not there yet . Got to figure out how we do this , ” said Sen. Jerry Moran ( R-Kan. ) .
McConnell is pressing forward with the first vote in Congress to defund the women ’ s health-care organization since controversial videos surfaced of Planned Parenthood employees sifting through fetal tissue and discussing the price of handling body parts . His decision to keep the Senate in session into August to take on the controversy over Planned Parenthood has temporarily mollified some conservatives and anti-abortion groups , even if he has no chance of beating a Democratic filibuster .
But a failed cloture vote is going to leave many conservatives unsatisfied . And Senate GOP leaders have not discussed the more aggressive step of including a spending rider in the coming must-pass spending bill .
“ The vote next week is something everybody felt like needed to happen . But I suppose that could be another way you could do it , ” said John Thune of South Dakota , the No . 3 Senate Republican . “ We haven ’ t thought that far ahead yet . ”
But it ’ s clear that the conservative wing has . The 18 Republicans who wrote to House Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) and his team on Wednesday constitute a crew that ’ s frequently been a thorn in the side of leadership . Several of them voted against Boehner for speaker and supported the Obamacare defunding fight .
“ Hard to imagine a Republican-controlled Congress voting to continue federal funding of Planned Parenthood in September , ” said Dan Holler , a spokesman for Heritage Action , a conservative lobbying operation .
But if the Republican Congress tries to block that funding , Democrats say they won ’ t go along with it . That places the federal government squarely in the cross hairs of a partisan shutdown fight this fall , after a summer of more leaked Planned Parenthood videos and rising conservative agitation across the country .
Though the amount of money that the parties are fighting over is minuscule compared with sums at stake in the GOP ’ s attempt to defund Obamacare in 2013 , the dynamics are the same . Republicans are trying to balance governing with satisfying their conservative base while Democrats are agitating for a fight they believe will pay political dividends by revealing Republican overreach .
“ I ’ m not going to tell you that there ’ s logic to what the Republicans ” are doing , said Sen. Patty Murray ( D-Wash. ) . Asked to respond to Republicans ’ attempt to force Democrats to defund Planned Parenthood by linking it with a spending bill , she replied : “ Not on my watch . ”","Calling next week’s Senate roll call to defund Planned Parenthood a “legislative show vote,” GOP firebrand Ted Cruz said Republicans should do everything they can to eliminate federal money for the group — even if it means a government shutdown fight this fall.

He’s not alone. On Wednesday afternoon, 18 House Republicans told leadership that they “cannot and will not support any funding resolution … that contains any funding for Planned Parenthood.” Meanwhile, GOP social conservatives like Sens. James Lankford of Oklahoma and Jeff Sessions of Alabama said they’d consider supporting an effort to attach a spending rider that would eliminate Planned Parenthood’s $528 million in annual government funding to must-pass spending legislation this fall.

It’s a potentially ominous sign for GOP leaders desperate to avoid another shutdown debacle. While Cruz may be radioactive in the Senate GOP conference after calling his leader a liar, his analysis of next week’s vote has merit: With Democrats vowing to block the measure, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) won’t be able to get the 60 votes he needs to advance the bill next week, a result that likely won’t satisfy a conservative base itching for confrontation over abortion.

In a Wednesday interview, Cruz said the GOP should go as hard as it can to block funding for Planned Parenthood, including the same strategy he tried to use to defund Obamacare in 2013: force the issue by blocking funding in a government spending bill that must pass by Sept. 30.

Asked whether he would support such a maneuver again, Cruz replied: “I would support any and all legislative efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. We do not need a legislative show-vote.”

On the other side of the Capitol, Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) said dozens of House Republicans will back his effort to oppose any spending bill — whether a continuing resolution stopgap or longer-term funding package — that includes any money for Planned Parenthood.

“This is one of those line-in-the-sand type of issues,” Mulvaney said Wednesday. “Every time we say we don’t want to spend money on something, the answer is it will provoke a shutdown.”

In a stunning turn of events , the grand jury declined to indict officials from the abortion provider , and instead handed up a felony charges of tampering with a government record against Center for Medical Progress founder David Daleiden and center employee Sandra Merritt . Daleidon was also charged with a misdemeanor count related to purchasing human organs .
`` We were called upon to investigate allegations of criminal conduct by Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast , '' Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson said . `` As I stated at the outset of this investigation , we must go where the evidence leads us . All the evidence uncovered in the course of this investigation was presented to the grand jury . I respect their decision on this difficult case . ''
The case sprang from a series of dramatic undercover videos in which Center for Medical Progress employees posed as prospective buyers of fetal tissue , and captured several employees of Planned Parenthood and its contractors appearing to discuss practices banned by law . However , when the videos were released online last year , Planned Parenthood claimed selective editing had created a misperception .
Anderson did n't provide details on the charges , including what record or records were allegedly tampered with and why Daleiden faces a charge related to buying human organs . Anderson 's office said it could not provide details until the documents charging Daleiden and Merritt were formally made public .
`` The Center for Medical Progress uses the same undercover techniques that investigative journalists have used for decades in exercising our First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and of the press , and follows all applicable laws , '' Daleiden said in a statement in response to the indictment .
`` We respect the processes of the Harris County District Attorney , and note that buying fetal tissue requires a seller as well . Planned Parenthood still can not deny the admissions from their leadership about fetal organ sales captured on video for all the world to see , '' the statement continued .
`` These anti-abortion extremists spent three years creating a fake company , creating fake identities , lying , and breaking the law . When they could n't find any improper or illegal activity , they made it up , '' Eric Ferrero , vice president of communications for Planned Parenthood Federation of America , said in a statement .
“ As the dust settles and the truth comes out , it 's become totally clear that the only people who engaged in wrongdoing are the criminals behind this fraud , and we 're glad they 're being held accountable , ” Ferrero said .
The videos , some of which were shot in Texas , riled anti-abortion activists and prompted Republicans in Congress last summer to unsuccessfully called for cutting off funding for the organization .
Texas Gov . Greg Abbott , a Republican , has called footage from the Planned Parenthood clinic in Houston `` repulsive and unconscionable . '' It showed people pretending to be from a company that procures fetal tissue for research touring the facility . Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton also opened his own investigation into the videos .
Abbott said the indictments will not impact the state 's investigation
“ The State of Texas will continue to protect life , and I will continue to support legislation prohibiting the sale or transfer of fetal tissue , ” he said in a statement .
Rep. Diane Black , R-Tenn. , author of the House-passed `` Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015 , '' said the she was “ profoundly disappointed ” in the indictments .
“ It is a sad day in America when those who harvest the body parts of aborted babies escape consequences for their actions , while the courageous truth-tellers who expose their misdeeds are handed down a politically motivated indictment instead , ” she said .
Planned Parenthood says it abides by a law that allows providers to be reimbursed for the costs of processing tissue donated by women who have had abortions .
The Texas video was the fifth released by the group . Before its release , Melaney Linton , president of the Houston Planned Parenthood clinic , told state lawmakers last summer that it was likely to feature actors — pretending to be from a company called BioMax — asking leading questions about how to select potential donors for a supposed study of sickle cell anemia .
Linton said the footage could feature several interactions initiated by BioMax about how and whether a doctor could adjust an abortion if the patient has offered to donate tissue for medical research . She also said Planned Parenthood believed the video would be manipulated .
Earlier this month , Planned Parenthood sued the center in a California federal court , alleging extensive criminal misconduct . The lawsuit says the center 's videos were the result of numerous illegalities , including making recordings without consent , registering false identities with state agencies and violating non-disclosure agreements .
After the lawsuit was filed , Daleiden told The Associated Press that he looked forward to confronting Planned Parenthood in court .","A Houston grand jury investigating criminal allegations against Planned Parenthood stemming from a series of undercover videos on Monday instead indicted two of the anti-abortion activists who shot the footage.

In a stunning turn of events, the grand jury declined to indict officials from the abortion provider, and instead handed up a felony charges of tampering with a government record against Center for Medical Progress founder David Daleiden and center employee Sandra Merritt. Daleidon was also charged with a misdemeanor count related to purchasing human organs.

""We were called upon to investigate allegations of criminal conduct by Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast,"" Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson said. ""As I stated at the outset of this investigation, we must go where the evidence leads us. All the evidence uncovered in the course of this investigation was presented to the grand jury. I respect their decision on this difficult case.""

The case sprang from a series of dramatic undercover videos in which Center for Medical Progress employees posed as prospective buyers of fetal tissue, and captured several employees of Planned Parenthood and its contractors appearing to discuss practices banned by law. However, when the videos were released online last year, Planned Parenthood claimed selective editing had created a misperception.

Anderson didn't provide details on the charges, including what record or records were allegedly tampered with and why Daleiden faces a charge related to buying human organs. Anderson's office said it could not provide details until the documents charging Daleiden and Merritt were formally made public.

""The Center for Medical Progress uses the same undercover techniques that investigative journalists have used for decades in exercising our First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and of the press, and follows all applicable laws,"" Daleiden said in a statement in response to the indictment.

""We respect the processes of the Harris County District Attorney, and note that buying fetal tissue requires a seller as well. Planned Parenthood still cannot deny the admissions from their leadership about fetal organ sales captured on video for all the world to see,"" the statement continued.

Planned Parenthood officials swiftly hailed the indictment as vindication.

""These anti-abortion extremists spent three years creating a fake company, creating fake identities, lying, and breaking the law. When they couldn't find any improper or illegal activity, they made it up,"" Eric Ferrero, vice president of communications for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement.

“As the dust settles and the truth comes out, it's become totally clear that the only people who engaged in wrongdoing are the criminals behind this fraud, and we're glad they're being held accountable,” Ferrero said.

The videos, some of which were shot in Texas, riled anti-abortion activists and prompted Republicans in Congress last summer to unsuccessfully called for cutting off funding for the organization.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has called footage from the Planned Parenthood clinic in Houston ""repulsive and unconscionable."" It showed people pretending to be from a company that procures fetal tissue for research touring the facility. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton also opened his own investigation into the videos.

Abbott said the indictments will not impact the state's investigation

“The State of Texas will continue to protect life, and I will continue to support legislation prohibiting the sale or transfer of fetal tissue,” he said in a statement.

Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., author of the House-passed ""Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015,"" said the she was “profoundly disappointed” in the indictments.

“It is a sad day in America when those who harvest the body parts of aborted babies escape consequences for their actions, while the courageous truth-tellers who expose their misdeeds are handed down a politically motivated indictment instead,” she said.

Planned Parenthood says it abides by a law that allows providers to be reimbursed for the costs of processing tissue donated by women who have had abortions.

Lindsey Graham introduced a bill Thursday that would ban most abortions nationwide after 20 weeks of pregnancy — putting the veteran lawmaker in the middle of a renewed national debate over late-term abortions .
The push comes despite some concerns — including from within the Republican ranks — that the proposal could be unconstitutional .
Flanked by pro-life advocates , Mr. Graham said advancements in science and technology have shown that unborn children can feel pain after about six months and that he is speaking up on their behalf by pushing the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act .
“ We are choosing today to speak up for all babies at 20 weeks , and trying to create legal protections under the theory that if you can feel pain , the government should protect you from being destroyed by an abortion , which I imagine would be a very painful way to die , ” the South Carolina Republican said .
The two-term senator has been targeted by tea party conservatives and will have at least three challengers in the South Carolina GOP primary next year .
The legislation he rolled out Thursday carves out abortion exemptions in the case of rape or incest against a minor or to save the life of the mother .
More than 30 Republicans in the Senate have signed onto the bill , though there are some notable exceptions , including Sens . Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah , a pair of tea party favorites and self-described constitutional conservatives .
Brian Phillips , a Lee spokesman , said the freshman senator is still mulling over the potential constitutional hurdles . “ That ’ s what he ’ s working on and why he ’ s talking to other members and outside groups , ” Mr. Phillips said . Mr. Paul ’ s office did not respond to a phone call and email seeking comment .
The proposal , though , does have support from a couple of other tea party favorites : Sens . Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida .
“ We ’ ll continue to work with other senators on language that addresses the constitutional issues , but he wanted to co-sponsor Graham ’ s legislation because he agrees with the bill ’ s goals , ” said Alex Conant , a Rubio spokesman .
Pro-life supporters of the bill say they are confident they have legal standing , and say the Commerce Clause grants Congress the power to control interstate commerce , and is broad enough to encompass limiting abortions . And they cite the 14th Amendment ’ s equal protection and due process guarantees .
Mr. Graham , meanwhile , suggested Thursday that it is up to the courts , not Congress , to decide the constitutionality of the law .
“ We are not the court , ” he said . “ We are the legislative branch of our checks-and-balances government . ”
But pro-choice groups fired back , saying the Graham legislation is unconstitutional and the latest chapter in the “ war on women . ”
“ Make no mistake , this legislation is being proposed as a next step by those who aim to overturn Roe v. Wade . It is blatantly unconstitutional , banning abortion before viability and violating women ’ s fundamental right to make the very personal decision whether or not to continue a pregnancy , ’ said Andrea Friedman , director of reproductive health programs at the National Partnership for Women and Families .
A similar proposal passed the House in June by a vote of 228-196 .
Senate Democrats said Thursday that the Graham proposal smacks of politics and that lawmakers should be focused on policies that put more people back to work and foster economic growth .
“ We are here today to make one thing abundantly clear , and that is that this extreme , unconstitutional abortion ban is an absolute nonstarter , ” Sen. Patty Murray , Washington Democrat , said on the Senate floor . “ It ’ s going nowhere in the Senate and Republicans know it . ”
Mr. Graham agreed that the bill likely does not have the votes to pass the Senate — at least now .
He said he is confident that a robust debate on the issue will build momentum for passage and convince lawmakers to join the fight , much like they did in previous congressional battles over the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act and Unborn Victims of Violence Act .
Mr. Graham also said he is not introducing the proposal because he is facing a primary challenge in the 2014 election .
“ I came into the political arena pro-life and I will leave pro-life , ” Mr. Graham said , adding that voters in South Carolina will decide whether he serves another term . “ Did I wake up because I have a primary and say ‘ Hey , let ’ s be pro-life ? ’ No . ”
He said South Carolina voters will likely respond to the bill in a similar fashion to the rest of the nation . “ When they understand what I am trying to do , they will say , ‘ Yeah , that makes sense , ’ ” he said . “ Will it wipe away all the other criticisms ? No . ”","Facing political challengers on his right flank back home in South Carolina, Sen.

abortion,The Guardian,0,http://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jun/27/us-supreme-court-abortion-clinton-trump-sanders-november-election,"Clinton hails Texas abortion decision a 'victory for women', Trump stays silent",2016-06-27,Lauren Gambino,"A woman ’ s control over her body will be a defining issue for female voters in November , Planned Parenthood says after landmark supreme court ruling
Elated cheers rang out from the steps of the supreme court on Monday morning as the justices handed down a decision that overturned a slate of restrictions that would have closed all but a handful of abortion providers in Texas . The landmark ruling is considered one of the most consequential and sweeping legal victories for reproductive rights since the court handed down Roe v Wade in 1973 .
Hillary Clinton immediately hailed the decision as a “ victory for women across America ” . Donald Trump did not immediately comment on the decision .
“ By striking down politically motivated restrictions that made it nearly impossible for Texans to exercise their full reproductive rights , the court upheld every woman ’ s right to safe , legal abortion , no matter where she lives , ” the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said .
The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders , who was defeated by Clinton in the Democratic primary , also applauded the decision .
“ After all the progress we have made on women ’ s rights , we can not go back to the days when women in America did not have the right to control their own bodies , ” Sanders said .
Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards said that the opinion would be a “ defining issue ” for female voters , a group that Trump is struggling to court .
“ I think we are going to see a record gender gap in November and this is going to be one of the main reasons , and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund , as well as others , will be making this an important point in the months to come , ” Richards said on MSNBC after the ruling .
The group has criticized the presumptive Republican nominee for his silence following the Monday morning decision .

In the early days of the Republican primary , Trump ’ s opponents criticized his evolving stance on abortion . In an interview from 1999 , Trump said he “ hates ” the concept of abortion but considered himself “ very pro-choice ” . He attributed his stance to having grown up in New York , which led to Ted Cruz ’ s memorable claim that Trump espoused liberal “ New York values ” .
More recently , Trump suggested there should be some form of punishment for women who have abortions . Hours later , his campaign in effect retracted the statement and said that if abortions were ever outlawed , he would expect the doctor who performed the procedure to be punished .
On Monday , Clinton attacked Trump for his muddled stance on the issue .
It 's finally official : limiting abortion in the guise of helping women is a sham | Jessica Valenti Read more
“ Today ’ s decision is a reminder of how much is at stake in this election , ” she said , adding that Trump had also supported efforts to defund Planned Parenthood . “ We need a president who will defend women ’ s health and rights and appoint supreme court justices who recognize Roe v Wade as settled law . We must continue to protect access to safe and legal abortion – not just on paper , but in reality . ”
Elsewhere in Washington and around the country , the decision received reactions on predictable party lines .
The Democratic Nevada senator Harry Reid noted that even without nine justices , “ the court clearly saw through the sham law enacted by the state of Texas solely to limit women ’ s rights and restrict access to healthcare ” .
Wendy Davis , the former Democratic state senator from Texas who staged a filibuster to stop an abortion bill , said she was “ overjoyed ” .
“ I was fighting back tears a moment ago as I was reading the Scotus blog and the first line that came out , saying that the fifth circuit opinion or decision had been reversed . It ’ s incredible news for the women of Texas , ” Davis said on MSNBC . “ It ’ s incredible news for the women throughout this country . ”
Nancy Pelosi ( @ NancyPelosi ) Today 's @ SCOTUS ruling is an important victory for the rights of America ’ s women , but challenges remain # StopTheSham https : //t.co/r5VEHVoFsb
Meanwhile , the House speaker , Paul Ryan , said he was “ disappointed ” .
Paul Ryan ( @ SpeakerRyan ) I 'm disappointed in the Court ’ s decision . But our fight to protect women ’ s health & promote life will not stop here . pic.twitter.com/sG0TyuT521
Cruz , the Republican senator from Texas , said he was profoundly disappointed in the decision .

Elated cheers rang out from the steps of the supreme court on Monday morning as the justices handed down a decision that overturned a slate of restrictions that would have closed all but a handful of abortion providers in Texas. The landmark ruling is considered one of the most consequential and sweeping legal victories for reproductive rights since the court handed down Roe v Wade in 1973.

Hillary Clinton immediately hailed the decision as a “victory for women across America”. Donald Trump did not immediately comment on the decision.

“By striking down politically motivated restrictions that made it nearly impossible for Texans to exercise their full reproductive rights, the court upheld every woman’s right to safe, legal abortion, no matter where she lives,” the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said.

The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who was defeated by Clinton in the Democratic primary, also applauded the decision.

“After all the progress we have made on women’s rights, we cannot go back to the days when women in America did not have the right to control their own bodies,” Sanders said.

Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards said that the opinion would be a “defining issue” for female voters, a group that Trump is struggling to court.

“I think we are going to see a record gender gap in November and this is going to be one of the main reasons, and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, as well as others, will be making this an important point in the months to come,” Richards said on MSNBC after the ruling.



The group has criticized the presumptive Republican nominee for his silence following the Monday morning decision.

In the early days of the Republican primary, Trump’s opponents criticized his evolving stance on abortion. In an interview from 1999, Trump said he “hates” the concept of abortion but considered himself “very pro-choice”. He attributed his stance to having grown up in New York, which led to Ted Cruz’s memorable claim that Trump espoused liberal “New York values”.

More recently, Trump suggested there should be some form of punishment for women who have abortions. Hours later, his campaign in effect retracted the statement and said that if abortions were ever outlawed, he would expect the doctor who performed the procedure to be punished.

On Monday, Clinton attacked Trump for his muddled stance on the issue.

“Today’s decision is a reminder of how much is at stake in this election,” she said, adding that Trump had also supported efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. “We need a president who will defend women’s health and rights and appoint supreme court justices who recognize Roe v Wade as settled law. We must continue to protect access to safe and legal abortion – not just on paper, but in reality.”



Elsewhere in Washington and around the country, the decision received reactions on predictable party lines.

The Democratic Nevada senator Harry Reid noted that even without nine justices, “the court clearly saw through the sham law enacted by the state of Texas solely to limit women’s rights and restrict access to healthcare”.

Wendy Davis, the former Democratic state senator from Texas who staged a filibuster to stop an abortion bill, said she was “overjoyed”.

“I was fighting back tears a moment ago as I was reading the Scotus blog and the first line that came out, saying that the fifth circuit opinion or decision had been reversed. It’s incredible news for the women of Texas,” Davis said on MSNBC. “It’s incredible news for the women throughout this country.”

House minority leader Nancy Pelosi welcomed the ruling.

Meanwhile, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, said he was “disappointed”.

Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas, said he was profoundly disappointed in the decision.

“Texas enacted HB 2’s commonsense health standards to ensure that women receive safe care,” Cruz wrote. “Unfortunately, the Supreme Court sided with abortion extremists who care more about providing abortion-on-demand than they do protecting women’s health.”

The majority opinion, which was decided 5-3, extinguished the argument that the Texas law was predicated on improving women’s health.



“It is beyond rational belief that H.B. 2 could genuinely protect the health of women, and certain that the law ‘would simply make it more difficult for them to obtain abortions’,” wrote Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who joined Justice Stephen Breyer in his majority opinion. “When a State severely limits access to safe and legal procedures, women in desperate circumstances may resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners ... at great risk to their health and safety.”",www.theguardian.com,left,eieMwZhxpcpdDQzv

Ben Carson alleged in an interview with Fox News Wednesday that Planned Parenthood puts most of its clinics in black neighborhoods to ""control the population"" and that its founder, Margaret Sanger, ""was not particularly enamored with black people.""

Planned Parenthood has been a target on the campaign trail after a series of sting videos was released alleging the organization illegally profits from selling aborted fetal tissue. Carson, a famed neurosurgeon turned Republican presidential candidate, has been a vocal opponent of the group. He was also in the news this week after reports surfaced that he once used aborted fetal tissue for research.

Here's a closer look at Carson's comments:

What Carson said

On Fox News Wednesday, Carson was asked about Democrats' criticism that Republicans who want to defund Planned Parenthood are waging a ""war on women."" He responded:

""Maybe I am not objective when it comes to Planned Parenthood, but, you know, I know who Margaret Sanger is, and I know that she believed in eugenics, and that she was not particularly enamored with black people. ""And one of the reasons you find most of their clinics in black neighborhoods is so that you can find a way to control that population. I think people should go back and read about Margaret Sanger who founded this place — a woman Hillary Clinton by the way says that she admires. Look and see what many people in Nazi Germany thought about her.""

It's not the first time Planned Parenthood has faced criticism about its founder and the placement of its clinics — former presidential candidate Herman Cain made a similar statement in 2011.

What Planned Parenthood said

In response, Planned Parenthood said Carson was not only ""wrong on the facts, he's flat-out insulting."" Alencia Johnson, assistant director of constituency communications, told NPR:

""Does he think that black women are somehow less capable of making the deeply personal decision about whether to end a pregnancy than other women? ... It's a shame that a doctor, who should understand the barriers black women face accessing high-quality preventive and reproductive health care services, would pander so clearly to anti-abortion extremists on the right.""

Did Margaret Sanger believe in eugenics?

Yes, but not in the way Carson implied.

Eugenics was a discipline, championed by prominent scientists but now widely debunked, that promoted ""good"" breeding and aimed to prevent ""poor"" breeding. The idea was that the human race could be bettered through encouraging people with traits like intelligence, hard work, cleanliness (thought to be genetic) to reproduce. Eugenics was taken to its horrifying extreme during the Holocaust, through forced sterilizations and breeding experiments.

In the United States, eugenics intersected with the birth control movement in the 1920s, and Sanger reportedly spoke at eugenics conferences. She also talked about birth control being used to facilitate ""the process of weeding out the unfit [and] of preventing the birth of defectives.""

Historians seem to disagree on just how involved in the eugenics movement she was. Some contend her involvement was for political reasons — to win support for birth control.

In reading her papers, it is clear Sanger had bought into the movement. She once wrote that ""consequences of breeding from stock lacking human vitality always will give us social problems and perpetuate institutions of charity and crime.""

""That Sanger was enamored and supported some eugenicists' ideas is certainly true,"" said Susan Reverby, a health care historian and professor at Wellesley College. But, Reverby added, Sanger's main argument was not eugenics — it was that ""Sanger thought people should have the children they wanted.""

It was a radical idea for the time.

Sanger wrote about this mission herself in 1921: ""The almost universal demand for practical education in Birth Control is one of the most hopeful signs that the masses themselves today possess the divine spark of regeneration.""

Was Sanger ""not particularly enamored with black people""?

Sanger's birth control movement did have support in black neighborhoods, beginning in the '20s when there were leagues in Harlem started by African-Americans. Sanger also worked closely with NAACP founder W.E.B. DuBois on a ""Negro Project,"" which she viewed as a way to get safe contraception to African-Americans.

In 1946, Sanger wrote about the importance of giving ""Negro"" parents a choice in how many children they would have.

""The Negro race has reached a place in its history when every possible effort should be made to have every Negro child count as a valuable contribution to the future of America,"" she wrote. ""Negro parents, like all parents, must create the next generation from strength, not from weakness; from health, not from despair.""

Her attitude toward African-Americans can certainly be viewed as paternalistic, but there is no evidence she subscribed to the more racist ideas of the time or that she coerced black women into using birth control. In fact, for her time, as the Washington Post noted, ""she would likely be considered to have advanced views on race relations.""

Are most of Planned Parenthood's clinics in black neighborhoods?

In 2014, the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research center, surveyed all known abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood clinics, in the U.S. (nearly 2,000) and found that 60 percent are in majority-white neighborhoods.

Planned Parenthood has not released numbers on the neighborhoods of its specific clinics, but responding to a request for demographic information, the organization said that in 2013, 14 percent of its patients nationwide were black. That's nearly equal to the proportion of the African-American population in the U.S.

However, Carson is tapping into a more subtle sentiment — the targeting of African-Americans in health care systems. There have been documented cases of that happening, including the now-infamous Tuskegee study. Starting in the 1930s, the Tuskegee Institute enrolled black sharecroppers in experiments and allowed them to suffer from syphilis untreated, though they were told they were getting treatment.

And, Wellesley's Reverby said, that was sometimes the case for birth control clinics historically, too. They may have been available in communities where more general health care was not, raising some ethical questions.

""One of the issues is ... what happens when you can find birth control clinics but you can't find primary care? It's just a question of what the state's willing to provide for,"" Reverby said. ""Was there overuse of birth control and sterilization in poor communities in some states? Absolutely. It's a complicated story.""

Did Sanger have a connection to Nazi Germany?

Not that NPR found. Sanger herself wrote in 1939 that she had joined the Anti-Nazi Committee ""and gave money, my name and any influence I had with writers and others, to combat Hitler's rise to power in Germany.""

She also said books of hers had been destroyed and that she had intellectual friends who were sent to concentration camps or put to death. Sanger did not have a connection to the Nazis, but a loose association comes through her involvement in the eugenics movement.

But it ’ s the GOP victories in the statehouses and governor ’ s mansions that are priming the ground for another round of legal restrictions on abortion .
Arkansas , for instance , already has strict anti-abortion laws . But with a Republican governor succeeding a Democrat who had vetoed two measures that would have banned most abortions beyond a certain stage of pregnancy , lawmakers plan to seek more restrictions — such as barring doctors from administering abortion drugs through telemedicine . Republican gains in the West Virginia Legislature will redouble pressure on Democratic Gov . Earl Ray Tomblin to accept a ban on most abortions after 20 weeks , which he has previously deemed unconstitutional . And Tennessee voters approved a ballot initiative that removes a 15-year barrier to legislation limiting abortion legislation in that deeply conservative state .

But with a Republican governor succeeding a Democrat who had vetoed two measures that would have banned most abortions beyond a certain stage of pregnancy, lawmakers plan to seek more restrictions — such as barring doctors from administering abortion drugs through telemedicine. Republican gains in the West Virginia Legislature will redouble pressure on Democratic Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin to accept a ban on most abortions after 20 weeks, which he has previously deemed unconstitutional.

Abortion rights advocates have had setbacks in the states for several years, with a surge of legislative activity since 2011. Women seeking abortions may face mandatory waiting periods or ultrasound requirements. Clinics may face stricter building codes or hospital admitting privilege rules they can’t satisfy. Dozens of clinics have shut down in multiple states. Texas, for instance, has fewer than 10 abortion clinics now. A year ago, it had 40.

Republicans now hold two-thirds of the state legislative bodies, after winning control of 11 more chambers. They completely control the legislature in more than half the states, adding Nevada, New Hampshire and West Virginia to that list earlier this month. And they gained two more governor’s seats, so they will hold 31 next year.

Republican leaders who will control the U.S. Senate come January say they want to take up abortion this year, perhaps on a House-passed bill that would limit the procedure after 20 weeks. But the reality is that Senate Republicans will still fall a few votes shy of the 60 needed for controversial major legislation. It’s the states where Republicans can enact more abortion limits.

That 's important because the Supreme Court is now considering those laws as part of Whole Woman 's Health v. Hellerstedt , the court 's most consequential abortion case in decades . If it finds that the laws place an `` undue burden '' on women , they 'll likely be struck down .
Researchers with the Texas Policy Evaluation Project ( TxPEP ) , looking into exactly that , have already found that some women had to wait as much as three weeks longer for an appointment . Some women they 've interviewed were n't able to secure an abortion at all , due to the logistical and financial barriers .
Now , TxPEP has published a significant study , in the American Journal of Public Health , on the effects of HB2 , the omnibus anti-abortion bill that the Court could end up partially striking down . The study shows just how many burdens were placed on women as a result of the clinics closed by the law .
Women had to travel an average of four times as far to get to a clinic
Researchers surveyed 398 Texas women , comparing women whose nearest abortion clinic was closed in mid-2014 with those whose nearest clinic was still open in April 2013 , shortly before the Texas legislature debated HB2 .
The results were striking . Of the women surveyed , 38 percent lived in a zip code where the closest clinic was open in 2013 but closed in 2014 .
One key finding : Women whose nearest clinic had n't closed had to travel an average of 22 miles , while women whose nearest clinic had closed traveled an average of 85 miles — almost four times as far . And a quarter of women in the latter group had to travel more than 139 miles to get an abortion .
This was the case even six months after HB2 went into effect , when abortion providers would have had at least some time to adjust to the initial chaos of closures .
Women whose nearest clinics closed had a tougher time by just about every measure : They had to travel farther and pay more out of pocket for things like gas , hotels , and child care .
They were less likely to be able to access medication abortion instead of surgical abortion if they wanted it — probably because Texas law requires four different doctors ' visits for medication abortion , which is a lot tougher to manage when you live far away .
Unsurprisingly , they were also more likely to report that it was `` somewhat hard '' or `` very hard '' to get care .
Women whose nearest clinics closed also faced more burdens — for instance , they were more likely to both travel more than 50 miles and spend more than $ 100 on the trip . Twenty-four percent of women in the closure group reported facing three or more different kinds of burdens , compared to just 4 percent of women whose clinics remained open .
And the study only looked at women who eventually got their desired abortion — so it could n't account for the women who were n't able to get one at all because the burdens were too high .
`` This study is unusual in its ability to assess multiple burdens imposed on women as a result of clinic closures , but it is important to note that the burdens documented here are not the only hardships that women experienced as a result of HB2 , '' said study author Liza Fuentes in a statement .
Strangely , there was no significant difference between the two groups of women in how far along they were in their pregnancy when they had an abortion . That 's inconsistent with other TxPEP research that found , after HB2 passed , a small but significant increase in second-trimester abortion procedures , which are not quite as safe and a lot more expensive compared to the first trimester procedures .

Democrats against abortion say that a party that prides itself on diversity and inclusion should be able to reconcile support for women ’ s bodily autonomy with sincerely held religious beliefs about – or at least moral uncertainty over – the procedure .

Yet a case to be argued before the U.S. Supreme Court on March 4 shows their enduring power . At the heart of June Medical Services LLC v.

Act 620 requires doctors who provide abortions to gain admitting privileges – or legal permission to admit patients – at a hospital within 30 miles of their abortion clinic .
If the high court finds the law constitutional , Louisiana will be left with only one abortion provider . It could also , critics say , set a standard that would all but remove the right to abortion access .
Which is what the law ’ s author , state Sen. Katrina Jackson , has advocated her whole career .
“ I plan on standing with our attorney general to argue in favor of this law , ” she said in a phone interview with the Monitor in 2019 . “ I will be taking calls from people , responding to emails , talking to my colleagues , posting on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , and trying to encourage everyone to take the pro-life stance . It ’ s what I always do . ”
Not long ago , Senator Jackson ’ s views would not have been too out of sync with her party ’ s . When the nonprofit Democrats for Life of America was founded in the early 2000s , it listed more than 40 members of Congress in its coalition . As recently as 2008 , Hillary Clinton was campaigning on making abortion “ safe , legal , and rare ” – which still acknowledged , and tried to appeal to , Democratic voters who had moral doubts about the procedure .
As the ideological distance between the two parties have grown , however , the space for internal dissent on hot-button issues like abortion has shrunk . The GOP has unequivocally become the party against abortion . The Democratic Party , meanwhile , has had to wrestle with whether or not it can continue to make room for lawmakers like Ms. Jackson , who says she only splits with the platform on this one issue and has no desire to become a Republican .
Democrats against abortion say that a party that prides itself on diversity and inclusion should be able to reconcile support for women ’ s bodily autonomy with sincerely held religious beliefs about – or at least moral uncertainty over – the procedure . Abortion rights advocates argue that such a party can not defend policies that prevent women – often poor , nonwhite women – from access to the full range of choices regarding their own bodies , including the decision of when and whether or not to parent .
Now , with June Medical on the docket and the 2020 elections fast on its heels , this intraparty tension has taken on new urgency . Progressive advocates say candidates must commit to fighting the wave of legal restrictions the procedure faces at the state and national levels , and recognize the socioeconomic and racial realities experienced by women seeking abortion . They ’ re convinced that those ideas are a cornerstone of the Democratic Party ’ s future , and that explaining them clearly to voters is a winning strategy .
Democrats for Life is pushing back hard . They ’ re recruiting candidates who are willing to both stand against abortion and advocate comprehensive supports for women – including policies around contraception and paid family leave . They argue that it ’ s about defending life “ from womb to tomb , ” a philosophy they say is consistent with Democratic positions on everything from the role of social safety net programs to minimum wage increases to the death penalty .
And they worry that by excluding abortion opponents from the party , national Democrats are alienating crucial swing voters in a pivotal election year .
“ We ’ re supposed to be the big-tent party , so it ’ s mystifying to me that we ’ re really not , ” says Kristen Day , executive director of Democrats for Life . “ We ’ ve got to take the party back . ”
Ann Hermes/Staff Joan Barry , a former Missouri state legislator shown here in her St. Louis home on December 10 , 2019 , led an effort to insert language into the state Democratic Party platform asserting that its members “ have sometimes different positions ” on abortion .
Perhaps nowhere has the Democratic conflict over abortion played out more clearly than in Missouri , a state once called a “ barometer of the American middle . ”
In 2018 , former state legislator Joan Barry led an effort to insert language into the state Democratic Party platform asserting that its members “ have sometimes different positions ” on the issue . This diversity of views , the statement added , is “ a strength. ” The attempt triggered a furious debate over the party ’ s commitment to reproductive rights . It ended with members overwhelmingly voting down Ms. Barry ’ s proposal at a public meeting that summer .
The dispute left a bitter aftertaste . When the midterm elections took place a few months later , Missouri ’ s two-term Democratic senator Claire McCaskill lost her seat to conservative Republican Josh Hawley . State Democrats bickered over the reason : Some said it was partly because Senator McCaskill had publicly supported abortion rights . Others shot back that it was because she hadn ’ t defended them enough .
The thought of Democrats fighting among themselves over reproductive rights makes Pamela Merritt sigh over her cinnamon roll . The longtime liberal activist – who was a member of the platform reform committee during the 2018 dispute – maintains that Ms. Barry and her allies at Democrats for Life hijacked a year ’ s worth of difficult deliberations in order to foist a conservative agenda onto the party .
Isn ’ t it enough , she asks , that Missouri is one of the most abortion-restrictive states in the nation ? As of January , state law requires women to wait 72 hours between mandatory in-person counseling and the actual procedure , parental consent for minors seeking an abortion , and an array of logistical standards that providers must meet before they are licensed to perform abortions . Only one abortion clinic has been active in Missouri since 2018 .
“ We would never say , ‘ We value the environment and clean air , but we welcome pro-coal people as a strength , ’ ” Ms. Merritt says over breakfast at a cafe in St. Louis ’ Shaw neighborhood . “ We would never say , ‘ We value our LGBTQ party members but we welcome people who support conversion therapy as a strength. ’ So why would we ever say it about abortion ? ”
In her view , Democrats need to give voters the opportunity to understand why the right to choose when to parent is crucial for women , for families , and for society . Do that , she says , and they will reward your trust . Ms. Merritt points to recent Democratic victories in Virginia , where in November the party took control of all three branches of the state government for the first time in a quarter-century . As part of the campaign , Planned Parenthood ’ s political arm in Virginia spent more than $ 1 million on candidates who supported abortion access . Abortion rights activists called it a victory for the cause .
Ms. Merritt chafes at Missouri Democrats ’ reluctance to take a similar course . “ Rather than learn how to talk about this and educate potential constituents … we ’ re just going to pretend like it ’ s not workable , ” she says .
At her home in the suburbs just outside St. Louis , Ms. Barry , dressed in a lavender sweater and dark slacks , shakes her head .
Like many moderate Democrats , she holds the view that focusing on abortion could antagonize voters in relatively conservative places like Missouri . Abortion did flare briefly ahead of the 2018 midterms , during the controversial Senate confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court . But it was kitchen-table issues like health care that energized voters in swing districts and won Democrats control of the U.S. House of Representatives that year – not abortion .
Why not try to sway voters with those issues , instead of pushing Democrats like her away ?
“ They think that everybody feels like them , and that ’ s not true , ” Ms. Barry says of abortion rights advocates . “ We should not be ostracized . We belong in there . ”
Where Missouri is a battleground for Democrats for Life , Louisiana is about as close as its members have to a stronghold . The state ’ s brand of socially conscious religious conservatism is fertile ground for abortion opponents of all political stripes . More than half of Louisiana residents , including nearly 40 % of Democrats , say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases , according to a 2016 survey . ( Nationally , nearly two-thirds of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases , with 76 % of Democrats in agreement . )
The governor , John Bel Edwards , is one of the organization ’ s most prominent members .
In this environment , Ms. Jackson , the Democratic state senator , has bloomed into a star . Born and raised in Monroe , Louisiana – a city of about 48,000 – she grew up in a household that placed great store by duty to God and to community . Prayer and fasting mark her life milestones , including the decision to run for the state legislature in 2011 . She hails from a family of Democrats , and feels strongly about her party ’ s commitment to defending the marginalized .
“ They still fight for those who can ’ t fight for themselves , ” she says .
She draws a hard line at abortion . To her , it ’ s unequivocal : Abortion is murder , and murder goes against God ’ s will . Over two terms as a state representative – she joined the Senate in 2019 – Ms. Jackson put her name to a slew of laws that have made headlines and drawn furious protests from abortion rights activists in Louisiana and nationwide .
Act 620 , which passed in 2014 , is among her crowning achievements .
“ One of my best moments in the legislature was when this bill came up for final passage … and almost 80-some members , both Democrat and Republican , stood at the mic with me to pass this bill , ” she says . “ It showed a unity in the state of Louisiana that is not often seen . ”
The experience also came with angry phone calls , nasty social media posts , even death threats that forced her to hire police to ensure the safety of her staff . But Ms. Jackson refuses to budge on the issue . “ To the extent that the party is on the wrong side of an issue – and what I mean by the wrong side is that they veer away from the Christian faith – then I have to stand with God , ” she says .
“ That doesn ’ t mean that I don ’ t support the party , ” she adds . “ [ But ] I will not choose the party over God . ”
To Ms. Day at Democrats for Life , Ms. Jackson is a model of leadership . “ That ’ s exactly what we need at this point – someone who ’ s solidly pro-life , ” she says . The group is actively recruiting state and local candidates to run in 2020 , and raising funds to support their campaigns .
Existing members have also grown bolder . Illinois Rep. Dan Lipinski , one of the few members of Congress endorsed by the organization , co-signed an amicus brief at the start of the year that urged the Supreme Court to “ revisit ” Roe v. Wade , the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion , “ and , if appropriate , overrule it. ” The move prompted Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot to announce her bid to challenge Representative Lipinski in the 2020 primary , making her the third Democrat to do so .
Democrats for Life members have also gathered at the 2020 Democratic presidential primary debates in Atlanta , Los Angeles , Houston , and elsewhere , calling on candidates to publicly recognize their views .
Some have argued that if Democrats were committed to progressive principles , they would focus on coalition building and finding common spaces on difficult issues – like abortion . Jane Kleeb , a board member of the progressive nonprofit Our Revolution , compares the challenge to early efforts to stop the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline .
Climate change activists had led the charge against the project , crying out against potential risks to the environment . But the strength of the movement came from other stakeholders , who “ came to work with us on that because of eminent domain , sovereign rights , water – all sorts of reasons , ” says Ms. Kleeb , who is also chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party . “ If I ’ d said to farmers and ranchers and tribal nations : ‘ You can only come to the table and work with us if you ’ re against Keystone XL because of climate , ’ ” she says , the coalition wouldn ’ t have been possible .
The Trump administration has since approved a right-of-way permit that would allow the pipeline to be built on U.S. lands , taking the project a step closer to reality despite activists ’ efforts . Still , Ms. Kleeb says , the Democratic Party needs to think of abortion the same way .
“ It ’ s [ about ] going to voters and saying , We may disagree on abortion and gun reform . Here are the 20 other areas we agree on , ” she says . “ You now have a choice . Do you stick with the party that agrees with you on those two issues , but completely abandoned you on these other 20 ? ”
Jeff Roberson/AP Pamela Merritt , a reproductive rights advocate , speaks to supporters on May 30 , 2019 , in St. Louis . Since 2018 Missouri has had only one active abortion clinic . Ms. Merritt calls Democrats for Life a “ messaging machine ” that ’ s trying to drive a wedge between the Democratic Party and the abortion rights movement .
Democratic party officials and progressive activists play down the notion of a rift over abortion within the party . In an email , a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee affirmed the organization ’ s commitment to supporting women ’ s right to choose . The Missouri Democratic Party said in a separate statement that while it recognizes that Democrats hold a range of beliefs , “ we can come together and support reproductive rights . ”
Ms. Merritt in St. Louis dismisses Democrats for Life as a “ messaging machine ” that ’ s trying to drive a wedge between the Democratic Party and the abortion rights movement .
“ People who try to advance reproductive oppression must be met , every single time they do it , with resistance , ” she says .
And despite all the steps they ’ re taking ahead of 2020 , Democrats who want the party to reverse itself on abortion have a steep climb ahead . Louisiana is an anomaly ; nationwide , 82 % of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters say abortion should be legal in all or most cases , according to the Pew Research Center . Among party moderates , the figure dips a bit to 75 % ; among liberals , it surges to 91 % .
Ms. Barry knows this . At a November meeting of the Oakville Democratic Organization in St. Louis County , where Ms. Barry serves as committeewoman , she gently asks the Monitor to avoid bringing up abortion . Later , she admits that her work on the platform hurt some of her relationships with other party members . “ It ’ s still very sad to think that my party feels that everyone should be included , except someone who is pro-life , ” she says .
“ I believe in what the Democratic Party stands for , ” she adds . “ But I also believe that I need to be known as a member of that party . ”

(Nationally, nearly two-thirds of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, with 76% of Democrats in agreement.)

The governor, John Bel Edwards, is one of the organization’s most prominent members.

In this environment, Ms. Jackson, the Democratic state senator, has bloomed into a star. Born and raised in Monroe, Louisiana – a city of about 48,000 – she grew up in a household that placed great store by duty to God and to community. Prayer and fasting mark her life milestones, including the decision to run for the state legislature in 2011. She hails from a family of Democrats, and feels strongly about her party’s commitment to defending the marginalized.

“They still fight for those who can’t fight for themselves,” she says.

She draws a hard line at abortion. To her, it’s unequivocal: Abortion is murder, and murder goes against God’s will. Over two terms as a state representative – she joined the Senate in 2019 – Ms. Jackson put her name to a slew of laws that have made headlines and drawn furious protests from abortion rights activists in Louisiana and nationwide.

Act 620, which passed in 2014, is among her crowning achievements.

“One of my best moments in the legislature was when this bill came up for final passage … and almost 80-some members, both Democrat and Republican, stood at the mic with me to pass this bill,” she says. “It showed a unity in the state of Louisiana that is not often seen.”

The experience also came with angry phone calls, nasty social media posts, even death threats that forced her to hire police to ensure the safety of her staff. But Ms. Jackson refuses to budge on the issue. “To the extent that the party is on the wrong side of an issue – and what I mean by the wrong side is that they veer away from the Christian faith – then I have to stand with God,” she says.

“That doesn’t mean that I don’t support the party,” she adds. “[But] I will not choose the party over God.”

Fighting for a place

To Ms. Day at Democrats for Life, Ms. Jackson is a model of leadership. “That’s exactly what we need at this point – someone who’s solidly pro-life,” she says. The group is actively recruiting state and local candidates to run in 2020, and raising funds to support their campaigns.

Existing members have also grown bolder. Illinois Rep. Dan Lipinski, one of the few members of Congress endorsed by the organization, co-signed an amicus brief at the start of the year that urged the Supreme Court to “revisit” Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion, “and, if appropriate, overrule it.” The move prompted Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot to announce her bid to challenge Representative Lipinski in the 2020 primary, making her the third Democrat to do so.

Democrats for Life members have also gathered at the 2020 Democratic presidential primary debates in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Houston, and elsewhere, calling on candidates to publicly recognize their views.

Some have argued that if Democrats were committed to progressive principles, they would focus on coalition building and finding common spaces on difficult issues – like abortion. Jane Kleeb, a board member of the progressive nonprofit Our Revolution, compares the challenge to early efforts to stop the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.

Climate change activists had led the charge against the project, crying out against potential risks to the environment. But the strength of the movement came from other stakeholders, who “came to work with us on that because of eminent domain, sovereign rights, water – all sorts of reasons,” says Ms. Kleeb, who is also chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party. “If I’d said to farmers and ranchers and tribal nations: ‘You can only come to the table and work with us if you’re against Keystone XL because of climate,’” she says, the coalition wouldn’t have been possible.

The Trump administration has since approved a right-of-way permit that would allow the pipeline to be built on U.S. lands, taking the project a step closer to reality despite activists’ efforts. Still, Ms. Kleeb says, the Democratic Party needs to think of abortion the same way.

“It’s [about] going to voters and saying, We may disagree on abortion and gun reform. Here are the 20 other areas we agree on,” she says. “You now have a choice. Do you stick with the party that agrees with you on those two issues, but completely abandoned you on these other 20?”

Jeff Roberson/AP Pamela Merritt, a reproductive rights advocate, speaks to supporters on May 30, 2019, in St. Louis. Since 2018 Missouri has had only one active abortion clinic. Ms. Merritt calls Democrats for Life a “messaging machine” that’s trying to drive a wedge between the Democratic Party and the abortion rights movement.

Democratic party officials and progressive activists play down the notion of a rift over abortion within the party. In an email, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee affirmed the organization’s commitment to supporting women’s right to choose. The Missouri Democratic Party said in a separate statement that while it recognizes that Democrats hold a range of beliefs, “we can come together and support reproductive rights.”

Ms. Merritt in St. Louis dismisses Democrats for Life as a “messaging machine” that’s trying to drive a wedge between the Democratic Party and the abortion rights movement.

“People who try to advance reproductive oppression must be met, every single time they do it, with resistance,” she says.

And despite all the steps they’re taking ahead of 2020, Democrats who want the party to reverse itself on abortion have a steep climb ahead. Louisiana is an anomaly; nationwide, 82% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to the Pew Research Center. Among party moderates, the figure dips a bit to 75%; among liberals, it surges to 91%.

Ms. Barry knows this. At a November meeting of the Oakville Democratic Organization in St. Louis County, where Ms. Barry serves as committeewoman, she gently asks the Monitor to avoid bringing up abortion. Later, she admits that her work on the platform hurt some of her relationships with other party members. “It’s still very sad to think that my party feels that everyone should be included, except someone who is pro-life,” she says.

“I believe in what the Democratic Party stands for,” she adds. “But I also believe that I need to be known as a member of that party.”

Imagine the equivalent of the lives of 2.7 million children snuffed out to serve the whims of the third richest man in the world. Most people would say that’s a story, most likely several.

Oh no, supporters will cry. Planned Parenthood, NARAL and other similar groups do more than just abortions. And Buffett does more than fund the abortion industry. But that is the core of his agenda, just as it is theirs.

Buffett’s own charity, The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, is named after his first wife who was an abortion supporter. Its domestic operation is led by pro-abortion activist Tracy Weitz, Ph.D., MPA. Weitz has worked at Planned Parenthood, The Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health and once defined abortion as “a moral action undertaken by moral agents.”

None of that is obvious from the charity’s website. It includes information on college scholarships and the “Alice Buffett Outstanding Teacher Award.” Neither that award, for “Outstanding Omaha Public School Teachers (K –12),” nor the scholarships even hint at the darker direction of the massive charity.

The site itself seems deliberately insular. Copyrights on the pages read “2008” and the charity makes it clear: “The Buffett Foundation responds to questions about College Scholarships and the Alice Buffett Outstanding Teacher Award only. We will not respond to any other inquiries.”

No wonder. They wouldn’t want to damage Warren Buffett’s incredible media profile by telling the nearly half of America that is prolife how he spends some of his billions. Lord knows the American media would never do that.

Since 2001, there has only been one tangential mention of Buffett’s support for abortion on the broadcast TV network morning and evening news shows. It wasn’t even really about Buffett.

No mention of Buffett’s billions then either.

Instead we get grandfatherly Buffett, tax-hiking Buffett, investor Buffett. As a reliable liberal businessman, journalists turn to him as a source for almost any commentary.

It’s easy to understand. If you give $1,000 to a ballot initiative to defend traditional marriage, that’s controversial. If you give $1.25 billion to promote abortion, journalists, who are wildly pro-abortion, don’t dare see any controversy.

The Republican legislators who support it say the bill isn't about banning abortions, but rather about protecting women's health. For them, it is about preventing situations like what occurred at an abortion clinic in Philadelphia , in a case in which Kermit Gosnell was sentenced to life with no parole for killing babies.

However, Pastor Rick Scarborough, of Vision America, who was asked to provide opening remarks for the news conference, offered a much more succinct end goal: ""This is a small, important step toward the beginning of the end of abortion in America.""",www.edition.cnn.com,left,zKOsLTqgXxZY7hsj

(CNN) - An outspoken and provocative conservative who emerged from Saturday's Republican Party of Virginia Convention as the party's nominee for lieutenant governor once compared Planned Parenthood to the Ku Klux Klan and blasted African-Americans for their ""slavish devotion"" to the Democratic Party.

E.W. Jackson, an African-American pastor and attorney from Chesapeake, made the comments in a self-produced ""message to black Christians"" posted on YouTube last year.



""The Democrat Party has created an unholy alliance between certain so-called civil rights leaders and Planned Parenthood, which has killed unborn black babies by the tens of millions. Planned Parenthood has been far more lethal to black lives than the KKK ever was,"" he said in the video. ""And the Democrat Party and the black civil rights allies are partners in this genocide.""

Sensing an opportunity to tie Jackson to the rest of the Republican ticket in Virginia, especially conservative gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli, Democrats have already started highlighting those remarks and others in emails to reporters.

Cuccinelli, the state Attorney General, will face Democrat Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chairman, in the November election.

""Extremely divisive rhetoric from Jackson and Cuccinelli reflects the social agenda they would impose on Virginia. At a time when Virginians are looking for leaders who focus on jobs, the Tea Party has nominated a ticket whose careers have been defined by a radical social agenda,"" McAuliffe campaign spokesman Brennan Bilberry said in a statement.

Cuccinelli and Jackson were nominated at Saturday's GOP convention in Richmond, where Jackson beat out six other candidates for the number two spot on the ticket. Party activists tapped Mark Obenshain to be their nominee for attorney general.

Jackson, the founder of a nondenominational church, is a former Marine and graduate of Harvard Law School. But he is rapidly becoming known for a raft of controversial statements that have bubbled up online in the wake of his surprise victory on Saturday. He has publicly questioned President Barack Obama's faith and has been spearheading efforts to recruit black Democrats to the GOP since last year, when he unsuccessfully ran for Senate in Virginia.

""Shame on us for allowing ourselves to be sold to the highest bidder. We belong to God,"" he said in the video. ""Our ancestors were sold against their will centuries ago, but we're going through the slave market voluntarily today.""

As lieutenant governor, Jackson would hold the tie-breaking vote in what is currently an evenly divided state Senate. Republicans currently hold the lieutenant governorship and control of the 40-seat body. But with the unpolished Jackson as the GOP nominee, Democrats are now a safe bet to pick up the lieutenant governor's office and control of the senate.

Democrats will decide their nominee in a June 11 primary. To the frustration of establishment Republicans, GOP activists in the state chose to nominate their candidates at a convention instead of in a primary, a move that gave a relatively small group of conservative activists control over the nomination process.

A purple state, Virginia currently has a Republican governor, Bob McDonnell, but voted for Obama in the last two presidential elections.

Poll numbers so far show neither party with a sizable lead in the race, less than six months before Election Day. Because Virginia voters elect the governor and lieutenant governor separately, it's possible that the winners could be from different parties.

Opponents say it's “basically relying on junk science.”,2017-10-03,"Anna North, Constance Grady, Sean Collins, Sigal Samuel, Aja Romano, David Roberts, Umair Irfan","On Monday , the Senate will hold a procedural vote on a bill that would make abortion after 20 weeks illegal in every state in the country . Called the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act , it ’ s based on the idea that a fetus at 20 weeks ’ gestation can feel pain .
“ The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act will protect the voiceless , the vulnerable , and the marginalized , '' said Rep. Kevin McCarthy ( R-CA ) , the House majority leader , in a statement in September ( the House passed the bill in early October ) . `` It will protect those children who science has proven can feel pain. ” While the bill is unlikely to pass the Senate because of the 60 votes required , President Donald Trump has promised to sign the it if it passes ; during the campaign , he said such a bill “ would end painful late-term abortions nationwide . ”
In fact , the best available science shows that fetuses probably can not feel pain until well after 20 weeks . Advocates of abortion rights say 20-week bans at the state level have harmed women , forcing them to travel to another state , often at great expense , to get the care they seek . And opponents of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act fear that , even if it never passes , it will ultimately spread dangerous misinformation .
The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is not based on accepted science
The bill , sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-SC ) , would ban abortions after 20 weeks nationwide , except in cases of rape , incest , or a threat to the life of the mother . A doctor who performed an abortion after 20 weeks , except in those cases , could face up to five years in prison . Women seeking abortions would not be penalized under the bill .
The text of the bill includes a section on the science of fetal pain , which states that “ there is substantial medical evidence that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain at least by 20 weeks after fertilization , if not earlier . ”
However , the general scientific consensus is that no such evidence exists . “ There ’ s actually conclusive evidence that shows that the neurologic structures in a fetus aren ’ t completely laid down and working yet until much further along in pregnancy , we think even the third trimester , ” said Jennifer Conti , a clinical assistant professor and OB-GYN at Stanford University and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health . Twenty weeks , she said , “ is just an arbitrary limit set in place by politicians that has no medical or scientific backing . ”
The most comprehensive look at fetal pain to date was a literature review published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2005 . According to the review , the structures needed for fetuses to feel pain begin to develop between 23 and 30 weeks ’ gestation , and studies of premature babies suggest they can ’ t feel pain until 29 or 30 weeks . While this review is now 12 years old , it still holds true — “ no research since its publication has contradicted its findings , ” wrote Mark S. DeFrancesco on behalf of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2015 .
The bill makes a number of claims that contradict scientific consensus . For instance , the bill states that “ after 20 weeks , the unborn child reacts to stimuli that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult human , for example , by recoiling. ” However , according to the group Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health ( ANSIRH ) at the University of California , San Francisco , “ limb withdrawal occurs even in full-term babies in response to non-painful tactile sensations , including light touch . Thus the appearance of limb withdrawal on ultrasound represents a reflex rather than a response to pain . ”
The bill , said Amy Friedrich-Karnik , senior federal policy adviser at the Center for Reproductive Rights , is “ basically relying on junk science . ”
This bill isn ’ t new — and we ’ ve already seen some of its effects
The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act previously passed the House in 2015 , as Jessie Hellmann notes at the Hill , but failed in the Senate . Similar bans have also passed in more than a dozen states .
People seek abortions after 20 weeks for a variety of reasons . One patient who came to Conti seeking an abortion said that a clinic the previous week had told her she was 12 weeks pregnant . But the clinic turned out to be a crisis pregnancy center that had given her incorrect information — she was actually 21 weeks along . “ Essentially her care was sabotaged , ” Conti said — and under a 20-week ban , she would have been unable to get an abortion .
Patients can also be pushed to get abortions later in pregnancy by financial or logistical problems , like difficulty getting to a clinic or getting together the money for the procedure . In states with 20-week bans already in place , patients who need later abortions typically have to travel to another state , said Friedrich-Karnik . That can cause enormous financial strain , she said . But “ to imagine a ban like this nationwide and to think that no one could even have the opportunity to go to another state to get the care is frightening . ”
The bill passed the House by a vote of 237-189 . It probably will not pass the Senate , Hellmann writes , where it would need a 60-vote majority . Republicans may be using Monday ’ s vote as a way to put pressure on Democratic senators in red states , like Claire McCaskill ( D-MO ) and Heidi Heitkamp ( D-ND ) , Hellmann noted in January . Both voted against the 20-week ban in 2015 , and anti-abortion activists hope a vote against the bill this year will make the senators vulnerable in November ’ s elections .
Even if it never becomes federal law , Conti said , the bill can still cause harm . “ By even putting this issue on a national platform , ” she said , “ you ’ re misleading the American people . ”
“ You ’ re really providing false and dangerous information that is affecting millions of women , ” she added .","On Monday, the Senate will hold a procedural vote on a bill that would make abortion after 20 weeks illegal in every state in the country.

Thus the appearance of limb withdrawal on ultrasound represents a reflex rather than a response to pain.”

The bill, said Amy Friedrich-Karnik, senior federal policy adviser at the Center for Reproductive Rights, is “basically relying on junk science.”

This bill isn’t new — and we’ve already seen some of its effects

The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act previously passed the House in 2015, as Jessie Hellmann notes at the Hill, but failed in the Senate. Similar bans have also passed in more than a dozen states.

People seek abortions after 20 weeks for a variety of reasons. One patient who came to Conti seeking an abortion said that a clinic the previous week had told her she was 12 weeks pregnant. But the clinic turned out to be a crisis pregnancy center that had given her incorrect information — she was actually 21 weeks along. “Essentially her care was sabotaged,” Conti said — and under a 20-week ban, she would have been unable to get an abortion.

Patients can also be pushed to get abortions later in pregnancy by financial or logistical problems, like difficulty getting to a clinic or getting together the money for the procedure. In states with 20-week bans already in place, patients who need later abortions typically have to travel to another state, said Friedrich-Karnik. That can cause enormous financial strain, she said. But “to imagine a ban like this nationwide and to think that no one could even have the opportunity to go to another state to get the care is frightening.”

The bill passed the House by a vote of 237-189. It probably will not pass the Senate, Hellmann writes, where it would need a 60-vote majority. Republicans may be using Monday’s vote as a way to put pressure on Democratic senators in red states, like Claire McCaskill (D-MO) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Hellmann noted in January. Both voted against the 20-week ban in 2015, and anti-abortion activists hope a vote against the bill this year will make the senators vulnerable in November’s elections.

Even if it never becomes federal law, Conti said, the bill can still cause harm. “By even putting this issue on a national platform,” she said, “you’re misleading the American people.”

“You’re really providing false and dangerous information that is affecting millions of women,” she added.",www.vox.com,left,ooh6p0YxwM4Dfa0B

Given all this , you could be forgiven for thinking there 's been a public-opinion shift against abortion rights in the U.S .
Abortion is one of those rare issues in which public opinion never seems to budge all that much . Americans are still more or less where they were on whether they think it should be legal as in 1975 , just after the Supreme Court 's Roe v. Wade decision . That is , with the largest share of Americans somewhere in the murky middle .
According to Gallup data , by 29 percent to 19 percent , Americans think it should be legal in all circumstances . But a majority — 51 percent — say it should be legal in only certain circumstances — in cases of rape , incest or where the mother 's life is threatened , for example . That number has barely changed in 40 years .
Those kinds of data stand in stark contrast to what 's available about other social issues . Consider same-sex marriage , for example , where public opinion has swung dramatically toward legalization in the past decade .
Or take the death penalty — upticks in crime and opposition to government spending are two factors that have driven Americans ' opinions on this topic back and forth over the years .
Abortion is n't like that . Strong majorities have consistently opposed overturning Roe since 1989 , today by nearly 2 to 1 .
That 's perhaps even more surprising when considering what 's happened over the past 40 years : a patchwork of state laws passed to define very specific restrictions on abortion , a decline in teen pregnancy , and increasing political polarization . All of that has apparently neither caused nor been the result of big shifts in national public opinion on abortion .
It might have to do with another fact about public opinion on abortion — it 's a topic for which the realities are anything but black and white , which is exactly how the arguments are all too often framed in the political arena .
A majority of Americans support legal abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy . But a majority also oppose it in the second and third trimesters . Most support it in cases of rape or incest , but most oppose it if the mother simply ca n't afford another child .
Those opinions get much messier when you dive deeper into the research .
`` Not only is opinion remarkably stable ... it is deeply contradictory , '' said Karlyn Bowman , who studies public opinion at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute . When people are asked , `` 'Is it murder ? ' people say yes , '' Bowman said . But if asked , `` 'Should it be a personal choice between a woman and her doctor ? ' a large majority say yes . ''
In one poll from the Public Religion Research Institute , 43 percent of Americans identified as both `` pro-life '' and `` pro-choice . '' Those labels are their own source of uncertainty .
Since the mid-1990s , the share of people who consider themselves `` pro-choice '' ( by Gallup 's count ) has fallen moderately — even while opinions on abortion circumstances have held steady . ( Still , a majority — 50 percent — consider themselves `` pro-choice , '' while 44 percent say they are `` pro-life . '' )
These contradictions may be why public opinion holds so steady .
`` When that [ contradiction ] happens on a public policy issue , when there are deep contradictions , most people pull away from an issue , '' Bowman said . `` They do n't see any reason to resolve the tensions in their opinions . So that leaves the topic up to the pro-life and the pro-choice activists . And those groups do n't really represent most people . ''
So if most Americans do n't firmly oppose abortion , one might say it 's foolhardy for Republicans , like this week 's GOP debate participants , to stake such firm anti-abortion stances .
But abortion is an issue that fires up the bases of both parties . It 's one of the top issues used by Republicans and Democrats to motivate , fundraise and organize .
What 's more , though , the latest abortion fight is n't focused on the larger issue of abortion itself . It 's been about Planned Parenthood . And recent surveys suggest that public opinion on the organization is more malleable than opinion on the topic of abortion .
Today , a plurality of Americans — 37 percent — view Planned Parenthood favorably , according to a recent Monmouth poll ( with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points ) . But just three years ago , the same poll found that far more people — 55 percent — viewed the organization favorably .
It 's just one survey , but it suggests that making the abortion debate about Planned Parenthood ( and taxpayer money ) may be a more successful tactic for the GOP than trying to pass laws restricting abortion itself .
Of course , that does n't mean a shutdown over the issue would be a good idea for the GOP . The Republican Party 's favorability rating fell sharply during the October 2013 partial government shutdown — making it one area where public opinion does tell a clear story .","Despite Constant Debate, Americans' Abortion Opinions Rarely Change

It's been a big week for abortion news.

Carly Fiorina's passionate (if inaccurate) depiction of a Planned Parenthood sting video was one of the most memorable moments of last week's GOP debate. And the House of Representatives on Friday passed two abortion-related bills — one aimed at cutting federal funds to Planned Parenthood, the other at punishing doctors who fail to provide medical care to infants that survive abortion attempts.

Given all this, you could be forgiven for thinking there's been a public-opinion shift against abortion rights in the U.S.

But you'd be wrong.

Abortion is one of those rare issues in which public opinion never seems to budge all that much. Americans are still more or less where they were on whether they think it should be legal as in 1975, just after the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision. That is, with the largest share of Americans somewhere in the murky middle.

According to Gallup data, by 29 percent to 19 percent, Americans think it should be legal in all circumstances. But a majority — 51 percent — say it should be legal in only certain circumstances — in cases of rape, incest or where the mother's life is threatened, for example. That number has barely changed in 40 years.

Those kinds of data stand in stark contrast to what's available about other social issues. Consider same-sex marriage, for example, where public opinion has swung dramatically toward legalization in the past decade.

Or take the death penalty — upticks in crime and opposition to government spending are two factors that have driven Americans' opinions on this topic back and forth over the years.

Abortion isn't like that. Strong majorities have consistently opposed overturning Roe since 1989, today by nearly 2 to 1.

That's perhaps even more surprising when considering what's happened over the past 40 years: a patchwork of state laws passed to define very specific restrictions on abortion, a decline in teen pregnancy, and increasing political polarization. All of that has apparently neither caused nor been the result of big shifts in national public opinion on abortion.

So what's going on?

It might have to do with another fact about public opinion on abortion — it's a topic for which the realities are anything but black and white, which is exactly how the arguments are all too often framed in the political arena.

A majority of Americans support legal abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. But a majority also oppose it in the second and third trimesters. Most support it in cases of rape or incest, but most oppose it if the mother simply can't afford another child.

Those opinions get much messier when you dive deeper into the research.

""Not only is opinion remarkably stable ... it is deeply contradictory,"" said Karlyn Bowman, who studies public opinion at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. When people are asked, "" 'Is it murder?' people say yes,"" Bowman said. But if asked, "" 'Should it be a personal choice between a woman and her doctor?' a large majority say yes.""

In one poll from the Public Religion Research Institute, 43 percent of Americans identified as both ""pro-life"" and ""pro-choice."" Those labels are their own source of uncertainty.

Since the mid-1990s, the share of people who consider themselves ""pro-choice"" (by Gallup's count) has fallen moderately — even while opinions on abortion circumstances have held steady. (Still, a majority — 50 percent — consider themselves ""pro-choice,"" while 44 percent say they are ""pro-life."")

These contradictions may be why public opinion holds so steady.

""When that [contradiction] happens on a public policy issue, when there are deep contradictions, most people pull away from an issue,"" Bowman said. ""They don't see any reason to resolve the tensions in their opinions. So that leaves the topic up to the pro-life and the pro-choice activists. And those groups don't really represent most people.""

Why Planned Parenthood is the focus

So if most Americans don't firmly oppose abortion, one might say it's foolhardy for Republicans, like this week's GOP debate participants, to stake such firm anti-abortion stances.

But abortion is an issue that fires up the bases of both parties. It's one of the top issues used by Republicans and Democrats to motivate, fundraise and organize.

What's more, though, the latest abortion fight isn't focused on the larger issue of abortion itself. It's been about Planned Parenthood. And recent surveys suggest that public opinion on the organization is more malleable than opinion on the topic of abortion.

Today, a plurality of Americans — 37 percent — view Planned Parenthood favorably, according to a recent Monmouth poll (with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points). But just three years ago, the same poll found that far more people — 55 percent — viewed the organization favorably.

It's just one survey, but it suggests that making the abortion debate about Planned Parenthood (and taxpayer money) may be a more successful tactic for the GOP than trying to pass laws restricting abortion itself.

Of course, that doesn't mean a shutdown over the issue would be a good idea for the GOP. The Republican Party's favorability rating fell sharply during the October 2013 partial government shutdown — making it one area where public opinion does tell a clear story.",www.npr.org,center,BlDw7PzMlmf4UeHX

The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act cleared its first hurdle on Tuesday in a near party-line vote of 237-189 in the lower chamber .
It faces an uphill battle in the Senate , where Republicans don ’ t have the votes to override a filibuster from Democrats , who blocked similar versions of the legislation in 2013 and 2015 .
Jeanne Mancini , president of the March for Life , said she remains optimistic about the bill ’ s chances . She compared it to the yearslong effort to pass the Partial-Birth Abortion Act , which was enacted in 2003 .
“ We have hope , ” Ms. Mancini said . “ Unless we start to make these strides on one side , then we won ’ t on the other side . The partial-birth abortion ban took a long time to get passed and ultimately enacted . So I see it a little bit like that . ”
Introduced by Rep. Trent Franks , Arizona Republican , the Pain-Capable Act would criminalize the performance of abortion after 20 weeks of gestation except in the cases of rape , incest or threat to the life of the mother .
The White House issued a statement Monday reaffirming President Trump ’ s intention to sign the bill if it reaches his desk .
“ The Administration strongly supports H.R . 36 , the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act , and applauds the House of Representatives for continuing its efforts to secure critical pro-life protections , ” the statement said .
The House held an emotional debate over the bill prior to its passage .
Rep. Christopher H. Smith , New Jersey Republican , said children born prematurely at 20 weeks can laugh , cry and feel pain . He said the law shouldn ’ t treat children differently based on if they ’ re in the womb or not .
“ Again , these children are there being assisted , and if you touch them , if you try to dismember them once they ’ re born , they will feel the pain , ” Mr. Smith said . “ In like manner , an unborn child at 20 weeks gestation will feel the pain . ”
Rep. Mia B . Love , Utah Republican , said “ each human life should be protected under the rule of law . ”
“ Each life that feels pain should be free from being tortured , ” Ms. Love said . “ I can not believe that we are here on the floor of the House , the people ’ s House , continuing to plead and ask for life . ”
Twenty states currently have 20-week abortion bans on the books . But opponents of such legislation argue it ’ s unconstitutional .
“ When life puts a woman in even the toughest of circumstances , the highest court in the land said the decision that she makes should be hers , free from any interference from the government , ” said Rep. Louise McIntosh Slaughter , New York Democrat . “ Roe v. Wade is a firewall that women rely on , but with every passing year and every new session of Congress , politicians have tried to chip away at it brick by brick , hoping it will crumble away . ”
Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman , New Jersey Democrat , told a story about one of her constituents named Carrie who procured a late-term abortion because she didn ’ t want her child , who had been diagnosed with several fetal abnormalities , to suffer .
“ The doctor informed them that infants with this condition very rarely survive more than a few days after delivery , ” Ms. Watson Coleman said . “ According to Carrie , ‘ We both calmly made the decision to have an abortion . We did not want our little girl to suffer ; we would much rather take on that suffering for her . ’ ”
About 2 percent of all abortions in America occur after 20 weeks gestation . The Congressional Budget Office estimated the Pain-Capable Act could prevent as many as 10,000 late-term abortions from taking place every year .
Chuck Donovan , president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute , the research arm of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List , said Democrats will probably block the bill once it reaches the Senate .
But he said Tuesday ’ s vote is important because it forced lawmakers to come out for or against late-term abortion and raised awareness about the prevalence of the procedure in America .
“ The fact is we ’ re one of seven countries in the world that allows elective abortion after 20 weeks in most states , ” Mr. Donovan said . “ The education lets people know not only that it ’ s legal , but that babies are surviving premature birth . The whole concept of viability is a creation of abortion law , but we can actually save most of these kids now . ”","For the third time in five years, the Republican-led House has passed legislation that would prohibit most late-term abortions when the fetus can feel pain.

“When life puts a woman in even the toughest of circumstances, the highest court in the land said the decision that she makes should be hers, free from any interference from the government,” said Rep. Louise McIntosh Slaughter, New York Democrat. “Roe v. Wade is a firewall that women rely on, but with every passing year and every new session of Congress, politicians have tried to chip away at it brick by brick, hoping it will crumble away.”

Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, New Jersey Democrat, told a story about one of her constituents named Carrie who procured a late-term abortion because she didn’t want her child, who had been diagnosed with several fetal abnormalities, to suffer.

“The doctor informed them that infants with this condition very rarely survive more than a few days after delivery,” Ms. Watson Coleman said. “According to Carrie, ‘We both calmly made the decision to have an abortion. We did not want our little girl to suffer; we would much rather take on that suffering for her.’”

About 2 percent of all abortions in America occur after 20 weeks gestation. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the Pain-Capable Act could prevent as many as 10,000 late-term abortions from taking place every year.

Chuck Donovan, president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, said Democrats will probably block the bill once it reaches the Senate.

But he said Tuesday’s vote is important because it forced lawmakers to come out for or against late-term abortion and raised awareness about the prevalence of the procedure in America.

“The fact is we’re one of seven countries in the world that allows elective abortion after 20 weeks in most states,” Mr. Donovan said. “The education lets people know not only that it’s legal, but that babies are surviving premature birth. The whole concept of viability is a creation of abortion law, but we can actually save most of these kids now.”

(CNN) – New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Thursday there’s far too many people sitting in prisons for non-violent drug crimes and called on Republicans to focus on people not just before they’re born but after as well.

“I’m pro-life and if you’re pro-life you have to be pro-life when they get out of the womb also,” Christie said in an appearance at the Aspen Institute in Colorado, similar to comments he made last month at a major social conservative gathering in the nation's capital.

Christie was in Colorado for events associated with his role as Chairman of the Republican Governors Association.

Thursday night’s event was a panel with other Republican governors including, Rick Scott of Florida, Sam Brownback of Kansas, Nikki Haley of South Carolina and Scott Walker of Wisconsin.

Christie said the justice system must stop stigmatizing the disease of drug addiction and focus more on rehabilitation.

“We don’t give them any kind of significant treatment, long-range treatment, and then we release them. And then we wonder why they go back and commit more crimes to support their habit,” Christie said.

The potential 2016 presidential candidate also said giving drug addicts treatment instead of prison time would help the economy too.

“You get someone off of drugs and back into a productive life, that not only helps society and our economy financially but it also makes us feel better about who we are,” Christie said.

The U.S. Sentencing Commission voted last week to reduce some the sentences of some drug offenders in federal prisons after Attorney General Eric Holder called for it.

The vote still needs to be approved by Congress and prisoners would have to apply for the reductions.

Meanwhile, Christie encouraged the GOP to focus on its core values while changing the norms for punishment in the war on drugs.

“If we are a party that believes that every life is precious and that no one, no one should be deprived of a second chance, well then we need to get on that issue,” Christie said.

Chris Christie's 'pro-life' message

Last month Christie was well received as he spoke at the fifth annual Road to the Majority conference, which is organized by Ralph Reed's Faith and Freedom Coalition.

Christie touted his credentials on important social issues, and framed the issue of drug addiction and treatment in a social conservative way.

When Obamacare made its debut before SCOTUS, the government’s lawyers were ruthlessly strafed by the majority of the Court. The law’s defenders were despondent after that performance. Yet, in the end, fear and ideology won the day. The justices may do the right thing this time. Hope springs eternal.",www.spectator.org,right,mdmXSgT3heIwfwdc

The rule was soon challenged in court by state officials and reproductive rights groups and has been the subject of a legal battle ever since . Most recently , on July 3 , the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a preliminary injunction blocking the rule from taking effect while legal challenges work their way through the courts .
The new rule , first proposed last year , is known by some reproductive rights advocates as the “ domestic gag rule. ” It bars Planned Parenthood and any other provider that performs abortions or offers abortion referrals from receiving funding under Title X , which pays for birth control and other family planning services for low-income patients .
Anti-abortion groups have long backed such a rule , arguing that organizations that provide abortion should not receive federal support . But Planned Parenthood and other groups say that the rule will leave low-income patients without access to health care they need . Planned Parenthood says it sees about 41 percent of patients who get family planning services under Title X .
The rule immediately faced legal challenges from Planned Parenthood , the American Medical Association , the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association ( NFPRHA ) , the American Civil Liberties Union , and a number of states . Earlier this year , the challengers won temporary injunctions keeping the rule from taking effect , but those injunctions were lifted after the Trump administration appealed . On July 3 , the Ninth Circuit issued a new injunction , this one in connection with the suit by the NFPRHA and ACLU .
“ Today ’ s ruling is an important victory in the fight against the Trump administration ’ s attempts to upend Title X , ” said Ruth Harlow , senior staff attorney for the ACLU ’ s Reproductive Freedom Project , said in a statement . “ It allows us to go back to court to ensure that the millions of low-income people who rely on the nation ’ s only family planning program will continue to receive vital health services — and we will not give up until the rule is blocked for good . ”
The move to restrict Title X funds is one of a number of actions by the Trump administration that critics say will limit access to contraception and abortion . It also comes as the president ramps up his rhetoric on abortion , which he may see as a winning issue for him and the Republican Party in 2020 .
The new rule would require providers that receive Title X funds be both physically and financially separate from any entity that provides or refers for abortions . That means that because some Planned Parenthood health centers perform abortions , all Planned Parenthood centers would be barred from getting Title X funding .
In addition to Planned Parenthood affiliates , Title X funds also go to Health Department centers , hospital-run clinics , and other facilities , all of which would be barred from performing abortions under the new rule .
Providers were already banned from using Title X money to pay for abortions , but Title X funding recipients could still perform abortions if they covered the costs with other funds .
The rule was first proposed in May 2018 but did not go into effect at that time . When it was finalized , the rule was scheduled to take effect this May .
A similar rule was proposed under President Reagan but was only in effect for a month , in 1992 . That rule prohibited Title X recipients from even discussing abortion , as Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Michael D. Shear note at the New York Times , but the new rule does not go that far .
Abortion opponents have applauded the rule . “ We thank President Trump for taking decisive action to disentangle taxpayers from the big abortion industry led by Planned Parenthood , ” said Marjorie Dannenfelser , president of Susan B. Anthony List , in a statement .
“ Americans United for Life is pleased that HHS has taken steps to stop Title X funds from subsidizing abortion , ” Catherine Glenn Foster , president of the group , said in a statement .
But Planned Parenthood and other groups say it will leave many low-income patients without access to contraceptive care . Planned Parenthood also argues that the rule is illegal , since it violates laws requiring that pregnant patients receiving care through Title X get unbiased counseling about all of their options , which include abortion .
“ The gag rule is unconscionable and unethical , ” said Dr. Leana Wen , president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America , in a statement to media when a draft of the rule was published in February . “ This rule compromises the oath that I took to serve patients and help them with making the best decision for their own health . ”
In many places , Planned Parenthood is the only option for low-income patients ; a 2015 analysis by the Guttmacher Institute found 103 counties where Planned Parenthood is the only provider of publicly funded contraceptives . If Planned Parenthood were locked out of Title X funds , other health centers might struggle to pick up the slack . According to another Guttmacher analysis , other providers would have to increase their caseloads by an average of 70 percent to serve all the patients currently seen by Planned Parenthood .
“ If fully implemented , the proposed changes to Title X would shrink the network of participating providers and have major repercussions for low-income women across the country that rely on them for their family planning care , ” wrote a team from the Kaiser Family Foundation in a November 2018 analysis of the proposed rule .
The Title X rule is just one of several moves by the Trump administration that limit access to contraception or abortion . In 2017 , for instance , the administration released interim rules allowing almost any employer to get an exemption from the Obama-era requirement that employers offer contraceptive coverage as part of employee health insurance . Those rules were finalized in 2018 , one day after the midterm elections .
Trump has stepped up his anti-abortion rhetoric in recent months , after Virginia Gov . Ralph Northam ’ s confusing comments on a bill in his state led to a larger controversy around abortions late in pregnancy . The president ’ s appointment of conservative Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh has boosted his popularity among conservatives , according to Vivian Wang of the New York Times . And with a potential challenge to Roe v. Wade on the horizon , Trump may see opposition to abortion — and to Planned Parenthood — as a winning strategy going into 2020 .","The Trump administration in March released a final rule barring clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from getting federal family planning funds.

One of the Navy officials further clarified Thursday morning that the discussion included obscuring the ship or moving it , which was not practical because the ship was under repairs at the time .
`` Once leadership heard about it , they said knock it off , '' a senior Navy official told CNN .
Speaking to reporters Thursday morning before leaving the White House , Trump denied knowing about the plan and said that although he `` is not a big fan '' of McCain , he would n't have supported it .
`` Now , somebody did it because they thought I did n't like him -- OK -- and they were well-meaning , I will say . I did n't know anything about it . I would never have done that , '' he said .
The ship ultimately was not moved nor was anything done to obscure McCain 's name , said Cmdr . Clay Doss , a spokesman for the 7th Fleet , and Trump tweeted Wednesday night that he was `` not informed about anything having to do with the Navy Ship USS John S . McCain . '' But the emails underscore Trump 's extraordinary and bitter personal feud with McCain , with whom he frequently sparred when the Arizona Republican was alive and even after he passed away from brain cancer in August .
The Journal reported Wednesday that a tarp was put in place to cover the ship 's name since it could not be moved due to repairs , but three Navy officials speaking to CNN pushed back on this claim .
`` We did n't do anything to obstruct the name of the ship . The Wall Street Journal piece refers to a photo of a tarp covering the ship , that photo was taken Friday , May 24 , the tarp was removed the following day , '' another US Navy official told CNN .
The official said they had not seen the emails in question , but was adamant nothing had been done to obscure the ship .
Another Navy official with direct knowledge of the matter told CNN that the tarp and paint palette were there for preservation and maintenance purposes , adding that the palette is a typical fixture for docked ships . The official said the ship 's commanding officer was n't aware of the tarp and that it was gone before he arrived on board Saturday .
Doss told CNN on Wednesday that he could confirm `` that the picture of the tarp is from Friday and it was taken down on Saturday . Paint barge was also removed ahead of the visit . ''
Officials pushed back on the Journal 's reporting that a barge had been moved so as to obscure the name of the ship . One official said `` the barge had been there regularly . At one angle , you might not have seen the ship 's name , but the name was visible at all times . ''
The US Navy 's chief of information , Rear Adm. Charlie Brown , also tweeted Wednesday night that the name had been visible .
`` The name of USS John S. McCain was not obscured during the POTUS visit to Yokosuka on Memorial Day , '' Brown said in a tweet . `` The Navy is proud of that ship , its crew , its namesake and its heritage . ''
Trump first said Wednesday night on Twitter that he had not been made aware of any plans concerning the ship : `` I was not informed about anything having to do with the Navy Ship USS John S. McCain during my recent visit to Japan . Nevertheless , @ FLOTUS and I loved being with our great Military Men and Women - what a spectacular job they do ! ''
On Thursday morning , acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan told reporters , `` in terms of ship movements , the only ships I 've moved is the USS Abraham Lincoln , '' a reference to recent US military moves to pressure Iran
`` Furthermore , I would never dishonor the memory of a great American patriot like Senator McCain . I also think it 's important -- I 'd never disrespect the young men and women that crew that ship . I 've asked my chief of staff to look into the matter , '' said Shanahan , adding that he first learned of the incident Thursday morning .
Trump and McCain , who was the 2008 Republican presidential nominee , were frequently at odds before and during Trump 's presidency . In 2015 , Trump attacked McCain -- who had been a prisoner of war in Vietnam -- as `` not a war hero '' and again criticized the senator from Arizona after he died of brain cancer last August .
The barbs against McCain from the President did not stop after his death . Seven months after McCain passed away , Trump mocked him on Twitter inaccurately for coming `` last in his class , '' and rebuked McCain for voting against a GOP bid to repeal Obamacare . `` I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be , '' Trump said at the time .
McCain 's daughter Meghan McCain , reacting on Twitter Wednesday to the Journal 's report , called Trump `` a child who will always be deeply threatened by the greatness of my dads incredible life . ''
`` There is a lot of criticism of how much I speak about my dad , but nine months since he passed , Trump wo n't let him RIP . So I have to stand up for him . It makes my grief unbearable , '' she wrote .
Former Defense Secretary William Cohen , a friend of McCain 's , said Thursday on CNN 's `` The Situation Room '' that while he gave Trump the `` benefit of the doubt '' that he did not know about the incident , he also thought the President was responsible for the climate in which it had occurred . Cohen , who served under President Bill Clinton , went on to defend McCain 's legacy in the face of Trump 's continued criticism .
`` There 's no question he was a hero of tremendous proportions , '' Cohen said . `` And also the fact that John was a hero on a global scale . Whether you were talking about Japan or China or any other place , they looked to him as a man of great courage who would endure tremendous personal suffering and still not yield his place in going back to the United States .

The theme of this year ’ s march is “ Love Saves Lives . ”
In the future , love is likely to get a helping hand from science and technology to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court ’ s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision , which said women and girls have the right to an abortion under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution . The ruling struck down laws banning abortion across the nation .
There have been enormous advances in science and technology in the last 45 years since the Supreme Court ruling . Speaking at last year ’ s March for Life , Vice President Mike Pence said : “ Life is winning through the steady advance of science that illuminates when life begins , more and more , every day. ” That ’ s good news for everyone who is pro-life .
With all of these advances in technology , it ’ s hard to imagine this not having some impact on the way Americans are beginning to view the abortion debate . The impact can be measure in opinion polls .
An annual poll released Wednesday by The Knights of Columbus and Marist on Americans ’ abortion views found that 63 percent of Americans now strongly support a ban on abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy , up from 59 percent just a year ago . The number of Democrats who support the same ban has increased to 56 percent from 49 percent in January 2017 . Also noteworthy is that 61 percent of Democrats want significant restrictions on abortion .
The poll also found that 62 percent of Americans said they believe life begins within the first three months of a woman ’ s pregnancy . Among those who believe life begins at conception , 46 percent said they believe so because it is “ a biological and scientific fact , ” versus 45 percent who said they believe it based on “ a philosophical or religious belief . ”
In a survey conducted by the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates ( NIFLA ) , a network of pro-life pregnancy centers , reported confirming 75,318 pregnancies through ultrasound technology in 2013 on patients identified as either seriously considering an abortion or open to getting an abortion . Of those , 78 percent – or 58,634 – chose to carry their baby to term after seeing an ultrasound image of their child in the womb .
The list of advances in science and technology dealing with pregnancy and unborn children is since the Roe v. Wade decision was handed down is long and impressive .
In the 1970s , the U.S. first saw two-dimensional ultrasounds of unborn children – black and white still images that expectant parents have become accustomed to seeing in the doctor ’ s office . From there , three dimensional ultrasounds were developed , which take pictures from multiple points .
Stephen Smith , professor of biomedical engineering at Duke University , who helped design and develop 3-D ultrasound scanners , was asked in 2007 how he thought the 3-D ultrasound would be used in 20 or 50 years . His answer : “ Everywhere 2-D is being used now there will be 3-D , and it will be in portable devices that are as small as a laptop or a PDA . ”
It ’ s only been 11 years since that interview and technology is increasing so rapidly that we ’ ve already seen at least three other advances in ultrasound technology since the 3-D ultrasound . Among them , the 4-D ultrasound .
Computer technology has now advanced to where images of the baby ’ s movements can now be streamed , as opposed to a series of 3-D still pictures . The “ 4th dimension ” is time . The 4-D moving portion can actually be recorded on a DVD as well .
Then there is High Definition ( HD ) , which is an improved version of the 3-D and 4-D technology . HD images still have a slight bronze tint , but with enhanced clarity and brightness . The images of the movements are more fluid . Many 3-D/4-D sessions are now performed in HD .
Going a step beyond HD , is HDLIVE4-D , which generates remarkably realistic images of the baby . Gone is the bronze tint in favor of a more genuine flesh tone . This advance allows the nurse or technician to move the light source from point to point , producing images that have truly broken new ground .
With these advances in technology , you can now find out the gender of the baby as early as 14 weeks . In fact , some companies are so confident they can tell you the gender at that early stage they offer a cash guarantee .
One thing Professor Smith may have been on to is the use of ultrasound technology in portable devices . Founded in 2014 , Clarius Mobile Health created an ultrasound device that clinicians can carry in their pockets . This has led to higher adoption rates and more ( and better ) care more quickly , because most of the controls are automated .
This portable device combines new technology and knowledge of ultrasounds gathered over decades with a mobile phone . The user now has what amounts to a point-and-shoot mobile ultrasound apparatus with very high quality .
Laurent Pelissier , founder of Clarius said : “ Eventually , we believe every doctor will own a handheld ultrasound that they will use in daily practice , just like a visual stethoscope . ”
In the words of Vice President Pence : “ Life is Winning. ” It ’ s not just winning because of good arguments or debates , or a well-crafted bill in Congress . All of those things have their place , but that ’ s not what ’ s going to transform hearts and change minds .
Life is winning because technology always advances , it never retreats . Life is winning with good old-fashioned science and modern technology – one ultrasound at a time .","A crowd of more than 100,000 is expected to congregate in Washington on Friday for the 45th annual March for Life, the world’s largest annual pro-life demonstration.

abortion,Christian Science Monitor,1,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2019/0613/The-view-from-one-of-the-last-abortion-clinics-in-Louisiana,The view from one of the last abortion clinics in Louisiana,2019-06-13,Jessica Mendoza,"“ I am reminded almost every day of ... how difficult my life has been because I work with this clinic , ” says Doe .
Now , as activists on both sides prepare for the possible overturning of Roe v. Wade , the long-term strategy is paying off . The dwindling number of abortion providers in conservative states face public antagonism , and worse . Clinics that manage to stay open are tied up in compliance and litigation , a drain on time and resources . The pressure has seeped into medical schools : Students don ’ t get exposed to even basic abortion care unless they seek it outside their regular coursework .
Abortion providers have for decades been a key target of anti-abortion activists ; an entire category of regulations is aimed at chipping away at their ability , and by extension their desire , to offer abortion care .
“ Dr . John Doe 1 , ” as he ’ s known in court papers , is still in scrubs when he walks into the front office at Hope Medical clinic . It ’ s only about 4 p.m. but he ’ s had a long day , having delivered a baby that morning at his private practice . Doe is one of the last remaining OB-GYNs in the state of Louisiana still providing abortion care . Now , after 40 years , he ’ s getting ready to retire – and wondering if anyone will be around to take his place .
He ’ s provided abortions for nearly 40 years . Now , the man known in court documents as “ Dr . John Doe 1 ” – or “ Doe ” for short – is ready to retire and wondering whether anyone will be around to take his place . There are one or two local physicians who might be willing to hack it – to risk judgment from their peers and neighbors , face hostility from antiabortion extremists , and conceal their identities from the public , as Doe has done for most of his career .
But at some point , likely late this year , he plans to hang up his scrubs for good .
“ We ’ re going to kind of face the point where [ I have to ] say , ‘ Look , if none of the other OB-GYNs in this state are willing to come up and step up to the plate , then too bad , ’ ” he says one April afternoon after his shift at Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport , Louisiana , where he ’ s performed abortions since 1981 . “ I ’ ve done as much as I can do , you know ? ”
Providers have for decades been a key target of anti-abortion activists ; an entire category of abortion regulations is aimed at chipping away at their ability , and by extension their desire , to offer abortion care .
Now , as activists on both sides prepare for the possible overturning of Roe v. Wade , that long-term strategy is paying off . When not facing the threat of public animosity , doctors in anti-abortion strongholds like Louisiana are often shamed for their decision to provide abortions . A barrage of laws restrict how , where , and when they can perform the procedure . Clinics that manage to stay open are tied up in compliance and litigation , a drain on time and resources . The pressure has seeped into medical schools , especially in conservative areas where providers are most scarce : Students aren ’ t getting exposed to even basic abortion care unless they seek it outside their regular coursework .
Abortion rights opponents say you can ’ t force doctors to do , or teach , something to which they ’ re morally opposed . Abortion is often a medically unnecessary procedure , and it would be unethical to compel anyone to perform it , they say . Medical schools and residencies need only train students to attend to emergency abortions or miscarriages – which schools and hospitals do – and not actively prevent students who want to from learning about abortion .
Abortion rights activists , however , say that the current environment is one in which doctors who choose to provide abortions feel scorned and even threatened . It discourages physicians who would otherwise perform abortions from doing so and chokes the provider pipeline , particularly in restrictive states . Women then have to deal with longer wait times at clinics and doctors who are tired or overextended . Some women aren ’ t able to access abortions at all .
What good is a woman ’ s right to choose whether or not to have an abortion , they ask , if no one is able or willing to perform them ?
Doe is still in scrubs when he walks into the clinic administrator ’ s office at Hope Medical . It ’ s only about 4 p.m. but he ’ s had a long day ; he was late for his shift at the clinic , he says , because he had to deliver a baby that morning for a patient at his private practice .
Providing abortions had never been Doe ’ s first choice . The clinic had first approached him in the early 1980s , less than a decade after the Supreme Court legalized abortion in the United States via Roe v. Wade . He ’ d only lived in Louisiana a few years , having moved here from Texas for his residency . He says he believed abortions should be legal and safe , and that women should have access to them . But it seemed every doctor he knew who volunteered to perform abortions soon found themselves overwhelmed by the demand .
Ann Hermes/Staff A.J . Haynes ( r. ) speaks with visitors at Hope Medical Group For Women on April 1 in Shreveport , Louisiana . Hope Medical Group For Women is one of the few remaining abortion clinics in the state .
What changed his mind was a young man ’ s sense of bright-eyed duty , helping women in need . “ I kind of viewed myself as this knight in shining armor , ” he says with an ironic smile . “ How terribly naive I was . ”
He soon discovered that a wall stood between him and his colleagues . He had been in partnership with two other physicians , both of whom wound up leaving the practice because he was doing abortions and “ they couldn ’ t stand the pressure. ” These days , only two local OBs in his hospital network will take calls for him , forcing him to work six , seven , eight days without reprieve .
Meanwhile , the landscape for providers was changing . Abortion clinics like Hope Medical began cropping up , moving abortion care away from hospitals and the schools with which they were affiliated . The shift broadened access to the procedure , but it also created a gap between abortion and academic medical care .
Clinics were also becoming easy targets for harassment and violence . The National Abortion Federation , the professional association of providers , counted 40 clinic bombings and seven murders of doctors and staff between 1977 and 1999 . The first murder was that of Florida physician David Gunn , who was shot and killed outside a clinic in Pensacola in 1993 . A rash of others followed : In 1994 , receptionists Shannon Lowry and Leanne Nichols were gunned down at the clinic where they worked in Brookline , Massachusetts . Later that year , provider John Bayard Britton and volunteer James Barrett were shot and killed outside another abortion clinic in Pensacola . In 1998 , security guard Robert Sanderson died in a bombing at an Alabama clinic , while provider Barnett Slepian was murdered in his home in Amherst , New York .
All this began to weigh on Doe , who struggled with depression . He started hiding his identity , although that didn ’ t stop protesters from accosting him when he went to and from Hope Medical , or sending nasty mailers about him to his neighbors . “ I was receiving so much grief over providing abortion services , I wanted to quit working here , ” he says .
He kept going because he felt – still feels – an obligation to the women and girls who came to the clinic for help : Like the intellectually disabled young woman who ’ d been raped by her brother , and who ’ d hummed church hymns in the operating room . Or the woman whose pregnancy was at risk because she ’ d needed a heart transplant . Or hundreds of others , he says , their stories both tragic and everyday .
“ I ’ m not pro-abortion . I ’ m just pro-choice , ” Doe says firmly . “ If you believe that abortion should be available , you at some point decide : Where does the buck stop ? ”
A similar question drew Rachael Phelps into the reproductive health field more than a quarter-century ago . In the spring of 1992 , just before she started medical school , Ms. Phelps heard a speaker at a women ’ s rights march in Washington , D.C. , talk about the lack of physicians willing and able to perform abortions . She decided that day to become a provider herself . After getting her degree at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , she worked at Planned Parenthood , spending 13 years as the organization ’ s medical director . Dr. Phelps still provides abortions about one day a week , driving hundreds of miles from her home in upstate New York to support clinics throughout the state .

But she and Doe are in the minority . A recent survey in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology found that in 2016-17 , 72 % of OBs reported having had a patient in the past year who needed or wanted an abortion , but only 23 % said they had performed one . Most of those who said they did not provide abortion care came from the South and the Midwest . The most common reasons given were personal beliefs , restrictions placed on their practice , and attitudes among office staff . A previous study by the Guttmacher Institute also found that more than a third of OBs in private practice who declined to provide abortions also said they wouldn ’ t provide a referral to patients seeking one .
“ There ’ s a lot of people who go into private practice who want to provide the service for their own patients and are kept from doing it because of ... partners who won ’ t do it , staff who object , hospitals who won ’ t let you do the case in the hospital , ” says Dr. Phelps , who now works at Medical Students For Choice ( MSFC ) , a Philadelphia-based nonprofit that funds and advocates for abortion care training in medical schools .
Since starting at MSFC earlier this year , Dr. Phelps has focused on connecting medical students in campuses nationwide with professionals willing to train them in abortion care . She also leads training sessions herself .
“ Most medical schools in the U.S. never mention the word ‘ abortion ’ in their curriculum , ” Dr. Phelps says in a phone interview . “ There is a huge shortage of providers , and there ’ s nobody getting trained to replace [ them ] . ”
“ It ’ s really dependent on your experience , ” adds Alana , a former president of the Tulane Medical School chapter of MSFC , in New Orleans , who asks that her last name not be used . “ If a resident or attending [ physician ] is not comfortable discussing any of these topics , and you don ’ t have a lecture about it , how are you going to learn about it ? ”
A spokesman for Tulane – which is a private university and not subject to state restrictions on abortion in public institutions – told the Monitor in an email that abortion education at the school “ is restricted to lecture instruction as part of our third year clinical rotation. ” He did not respond to a request for details on what the instruction looks like .
Anthony Levatino , a retired OB-GYN who performed more than 1,200 abortions early in his career but has since become a vocal opponent of abortion rights , says he doesn ’ t remember much specific training on abortion provision from his years in med school . Most of what he learned came from his residency , and he says students today who want that kind of training should choose hospitals and clinics where they can get that exposure .
“ I would tell them , ‘ If this is important to you , look critically at the training in residency , ’ ” says Dr. Levatino , who stopped doing abortions after his daughter was killed in a car accident in 1984 . “ ‘ Don ’ t put yourself in a position where you ’ re going to face some kind of barrier – for instance , a Catholic hospital. ’ [ Students ] are not helpless . ”
In Dr. Levatino ’ s view , one reason fewer physicians are performing abortions is that the procedure takes a toll on them . They start to see , he says , that abortion is taking a life . Doctors who feel that way have the right to choose not to provide abortions , he adds .
“ What Roe v. Wade says is that patients can legally obtain this procedure . It is not granted as a positive right , ” Daniel Sulmasy , who teaches biomedical ethics at Georgetown University . “ [ The law ] respects the conscientious choices of physicians who , even if they don ’ t want to interfere in that opportunity for women , do not feel comfortable providing it themselves . ”
Physicians who do choose to perform abortions shouldn ’ t have to face violence or harassment , he adds .
It ’ s also unrealistic to expect uniformly broad access to any medical procedure in a country like the U.S. says Jeffery Bishop , a professor of philosophy and health care ethics at St. Louis University . “ You ’ re going to get a different kind of medicine in New York City than you will in some rural town in Wyoming , ” he says . “ That ’ s just the nature of it . ”
For providers like Doe who live that reality , however , it ’ s a lot to shoulder . Hope Medical is one of only three remaining clinics in Louisiana – and that number could go down under a state law , currently being litigated ( Doe is a plaintiff ) , that would require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital . “ I don ’ t know where to go from here , ” Doe says .
On a Monday night this spring , Alana sits in a conference room with 20 or so other medical students . On the table before her is a papaya – a proxy for a uterus – and a pump . The students are here for an MSFC-hosted training session on manual vacuum aspiration , the most common form of abortion . For about half an hour , Alana and her peers practice the technique on the fruit as two physicians , both volunteers , roam the room , commenting on and correcting their work .
It ’ s the kind of event that Alana had hosted when she was MSFC president her freshman year . Under her leadership , the chapter had forged relationships with local women ’ s rights groups and MSFC affiliates at other universities . Alana herself had testified against antiabortion bills in Baton Rouge and , in the summer of 2017 , spent two weeks shadowing doctors at an abortion clinic in Mexico City . All done in addition to her required coursework .
Now a year away from graduation , Alana remains an active MSFC member . At a café in New Orleans the morning after the training session , she talks about seeing her work as a kind of advocacy . “ If you ’ re really trying to provide a full spectrum of care , ” particularly to underserved or underprivileged communities , she says , then that must include “ trying to change the system in some way . ”
She knows that she ’ s unusual in her cohort , that she ’ s choosing a difficult path . She ’ s not even sure she ’ ll want to live in a state like Louisiana if she becomes an abortion provider . But she sees medicine through a humanitarian lens – she worked in international development before switching gears and going to med school – and hopes to use her skills to improve women ’ s lives .
“ Unfortunately , or fortunately , there ’ s a lot of prestige that comes with wearing a white coat , ” Alana says . “ I ’ m going to wear it and use it as a tool to advocate . ”
In Shreveport , Doe mulls the idea of a new generation of activist abortion providers , and the thought brings a smile to his face . “ I ’ d love to talk to them , ” he says . He ’ d have advice ; stuff he learned the hard way over four decades .
“ Most of the time it ’ s really not horrible , ” he says . “ But I am reminded almost every day of ... how difficult my life has been because I work with this clinic . ”

“ You ’ ve got to do it just because you believe women deserve the opportunity . ”","“I am reminded almost every day of ... how difficult my life has been because I work with this clinic,” says Doe.

Now, as activists on both sides prepare for the possible overturning of Roe v. Wade, the long-term strategy is paying off. The dwindling number of abortion providers in conservative states face public antagonism, and worse. Clinics that manage to stay open are tied up in compliance and litigation, a drain on time and resources. The pressure has seeped into medical schools: Students don’t get exposed to even basic abortion care unless they seek it outside their regular coursework.

Abortion providers have for decades been a key target of anti-abortion activists; an entire category of regulations is aimed at chipping away at their ability, and by extension their desire, to offer abortion care.

“Dr. John Doe 1,” as he’s known in court papers, is still in scrubs when he walks into the front office at Hope Medical clinic. It’s only about 4 p.m. but he’s had a long day, having delivered a baby that morning at his private practice. Doe is one of the last remaining OB-GYNs in the state of Louisiana still providing abortion care. Now, after 40 years, he’s getting ready to retire – and wondering if anyone will be around to take his place.

He’s provided abortions for nearly 40 years. Now, the man known in court documents as “Dr. John Doe 1” – or “Doe” for short – is ready to retire and wondering whether anyone will be around to take his place. There are one or two local physicians who might be willing to hack it – to risk judgment from their peers and neighbors, face hostility from antiabortion extremists, and conceal their identities from the public, as Doe has done for most of his career.

But at some point, likely late this year, he plans to hang up his scrubs for good.

“We’re going to kind of face the point where [I have to] say, ‘Look, if none of the other OB-GYNs in this state are willing to come up and step up to the plate, then too bad,’” he says one April afternoon after his shift at Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, Louisiana, where he’s performed abortions since 1981. “I’ve done as much as I can do, you know?”

Providers have for decades been a key target of anti-abortion activists; an entire category of abortion regulations is aimed at chipping away at their ability, and by extension their desire, to offer abortion care.

Now, as activists on both sides prepare for the possible overturning of Roe v. Wade, that long-term strategy is paying off. When not facing the threat of public animosity, doctors in anti-abortion strongholds like Louisiana are often shamed for their decision to provide abortions. A barrage of laws restrict how, where, and when they can perform the procedure. Clinics that manage to stay open are tied up in compliance and litigation, a drain on time and resources. The pressure has seeped into medical schools, especially in conservative areas where providers are most scarce: Students aren’t getting exposed to even basic abortion care unless they seek it outside their regular coursework.

Abortion rights opponents say you can’t force doctors to do, or teach, something to which they’re morally opposed. Abortion is often a medically unnecessary procedure, and it would be unethical to compel anyone to perform it, they say. Medical schools and residencies need only train students to attend to emergency abortions or miscarriages – which schools and hospitals do – and not actively prevent students who want to from learning about abortion.

Abortion rights activists, however, say that the current environment is one in which doctors who choose to provide abortions feel scorned and even threatened. It discourages physicians who would otherwise perform abortions from doing so and chokes the provider pipeline, particularly in restrictive states. Women then have to deal with longer wait times at clinics and doctors who are tired or overextended. Some women aren’t able to access abortions at all.

What good is a woman’s right to choose whether or not to have an abortion, they ask, if no one is able or willing to perform them?

‘How terribly naive I was’

Doe is still in scrubs when he walks into the clinic administrator’s office at Hope Medical. It’s only about 4 p.m. but he’s had a long day; he was late for his shift at the clinic, he says, because he had to deliver a baby that morning for a patient at his private practice.

Providing abortions had never been Doe’s first choice. The clinic had first approached him in the early 1980s, less than a decade after the Supreme Court legalized abortion in the United States via Roe v. Wade. He’d only lived in Louisiana a few years, having moved here from Texas for his residency. He says he believed abortions should be legal and safe, and that women should have access to them. But it seemed every doctor he knew who volunteered to perform abortions soon found themselves overwhelmed by the demand.

Ann Hermes/Staff A.J. Haynes (r.) speaks with visitors at Hope Medical Group For Women on April 1 in Shreveport, Louisiana. Hope Medical Group For Women is one of the few remaining abortion clinics in the state.

What changed his mind was a young man’s sense of bright-eyed duty, helping women in need. “I kind of viewed myself as this knight in shining armor,” he says with an ironic smile. “How terribly naive I was.”

He soon discovered that a wall stood between him and his colleagues. He had been in partnership with two other physicians, both of whom wound up leaving the practice because he was doing abortions and “they couldn’t stand the pressure.” These days, only two local OBs in his hospital network will take calls for him, forcing him to work six, seven, eight days without reprieve.

Meanwhile, the landscape for providers was changing. Abortion clinics like Hope Medical began cropping up, moving abortion care away from hospitals and the schools with which they were affiliated. The shift broadened access to the procedure, but it also created a gap between abortion and academic medical care.

Clinics were also becoming easy targets for harassment and violence. The National Abortion Federation, the professional association of providers, counted 40 clinic bombings and seven murders of doctors and staff between 1977 and 1999. The first murder was that of Florida physician David Gunn, who was shot and killed outside a clinic in Pensacola in 1993. A rash of others followed: In 1994, receptionists Shannon Lowry and Leanne Nichols were gunned down at the clinic where they worked in Brookline, Massachusetts. Later that year, provider John Bayard Britton and volunteer James Barrett were shot and killed outside another abortion clinic in Pensacola. In 1998, security guard Robert Sanderson died in a bombing at an Alabama clinic, while provider Barnett Slepian was murdered in his home in Amherst, New York.

All this began to weigh on Doe, who struggled with depression. He started hiding his identity, although that didn’t stop protesters from accosting him when he went to and from Hope Medical, or sending nasty mailers about him to his neighbors. “I was receiving so much grief over providing abortion services, I wanted to quit working here,” he says.

He kept going because he felt – still feels – an obligation to the women and girls who came to the clinic for help: Like the intellectually disabled young woman who’d been raped by her brother, and who’d hummed church hymns in the operating room. Or the woman whose pregnancy was at risk because she’d needed a heart transplant. Or hundreds of others, he says, their stories both tragic and everyday.

“I’m not pro-abortion. I’m just pro-choice,” Doe says firmly. “If you believe that abortion should be available, you at some point decide: Where does the buck stop?”

PERSONAL DECISIONS

“Information is power, and all women should have access to the information they need when making personal healthcare decisions,” Becerra said.

The crisis pregnancy centers counsel women not to have abortions. These facilities, according to critics, often are located near hospitals and abortion clinics, offer ultrasounds and are staffed by people wearing medical garb. Some are medically licensed facilities, others are not.

The law requires licensed healthcare facilities to post a notice saying that the state has programs for “immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services ... prenatal care, and abortion for eligible women.” For non-licensed medical facilities, an additional notice is required stating that the center “has no licensed medical provider who provides or directly supervises the provision of services.”

The other plaintiffs are two centers in San Diego County. The court did not act on three other cases brought by other centers making similar claims.

The Supreme Court found that women have a constitutional right to an abortion in the landmark 1973 case Roe v. Wade. The court most recently backed abortion rights in 2016 when it struck down a Texas law that imposed strict regulations on clinics that provided abortions.

If the court strikes down California’s law on free speech grounds, it could make it harder for Democratic-leaning states to regulate anti-abortion pregnancy centers. But it also could threaten laws passed in Republican-leaning states that impose certain requirements on abortion clinics.

In 2015, the justices left in place a lower court ruling that struck down North Carolina’s law requiring physicians to perform an ultrasound, display the sonogram and describe the fetus to women seeking an abortion.

The court has taken a series of cases involving free speech arguments to which its conservative majority is often receptive.

Take the latest episode of NBC ’ s “ Law & Order : Special Victims Unit ” for example – an episode that almost literally treats its characters like puppets to spout talking points that could have come from a Planned Parenthood pamphlet .
As reported by Newsbusters , the October 17 episode “ The Burden of Our Choices ” focuses on a 13-year-old girl from an evangelical Christian family in Ohio who escaped to New York in order to obtain an abortion after her stepfather rapes her . Since Ohio requires minors to have permission from family members in order to obtain an abortion , the girl ’ s case becomes a major court battle . At one point in the episode , members of the SVU debate the case and it ’ s hard not to see a Planned Parenthood executive writing the script where the showrunners left off .
Carisi : Appeals court just refused to hear Ohio ’ s case . Even some pro-life groups thought the charges were ridiculous . Olivia : Well , they are . Tamin : So you guys aren ’ t under arrest ? What about the stay on the abortion ? Carisi : Family court didn ’ t want to make a ruling until Ohio ’ s arrest warrants have been dismissed . They ’ re still deliberating . Tamin : For how long ? She ’ s 12 weeks pregnant . Any day after the first trimester , it gets more complicated . Olivia : And that ’ s part of Ohio ’ s plan , is to run out the clock . Tamin : I ’ m sorry , what century is this ? All these old white men trying to control women ’ s bodies ? I mean , how far off are we from “ The Handmaid ’ s Tale ” ? Olivia : You grew up taking these rights for granted . My mother , there was a time when she considered abortion , and her only option was – was back-alley . The bottom line is , if you have enough money , there ’ s always a way . But it ’ s these poor women , these girls – in some states , they ’ re gon na see deaths . That ’ s where this is going . Tamin : They think that ’ s what we ’ re going back to . Carisi : Fundamentalists , Catholics – they see abortion as deaths . Tamin : You ’ re Catholic , right ? Is that what you think ?

Spoilers : The episode ends with the 13-year-old girl receiving the abortion .","Abortion propaganda has become so pervasive in the entertainment industry that the dialogue on TV shows is now starting to sound like “Fireproof” for abortion enthusiasts. Take the latest episode of NBC’s “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” for example – an episode that almost literally treats its characters like puppets to spout talking points that could have come from a Planned Parenthood pamphlet.

As reported by Newsbusters, the October 17 episode “The Burden of Our Choices” focuses on a 13-year-old girl from an evangelical Christian family in Ohio who escaped to New York in order to obtain an abortion after her stepfather rapes her. Since Ohio requires minors to have permission from family members in order to obtain an abortion, the girl’s case becomes a major court battle. At one point in the episode, members of the SVU debate the case and it’s hard not to see a Planned Parenthood executive writing the script where the showrunners left off.

From the transcript provided by Newsbusters:

Carisi: Appeals court just refused to hear Ohio’s case. Even some pro-life groups thought the charges were ridiculous. Olivia: Well, they are. Tamin: So you guys aren’t under arrest? What about the stay on the abortion? Carisi: Family court didn’t want to make a ruling until Ohio’s arrest warrants have been dismissed. They’re still deliberating. Tamin: For how long? She’s 12 weeks pregnant. Any day after the first trimester, it gets more complicated. Olivia: And that’s part of Ohio’s plan, is to run out the clock. Tamin: I’m sorry, what century is this? All these old white men trying to control women’s bodies? I mean, how far off are we from “The Handmaid’s Tale”? Olivia: You grew up taking these rights for granted. My mother, there was a time when she considered abortion, and her only option was – was back-alley. The bottom line is, if you have enough money, there’s always a way. But it’s these poor women, these girls – in some states, they’re gonna see deaths. That’s where this is going. Tamin: They think that’s what we’re going back to. Carisi: Fundamentalists, Catholics – they see abortion as deaths. Tamin: You’re Catholic, right? Is that what you think? Carisi: What I think is what I think. But if a woman is the victim of rape or incest – Tamin: I hear that, and it sounds like you’re saying that a woman has to be a victim in order to have control over her own body. Olivia: That’s not what he’s saying. Tamin: Good. Because it’s not a decision that should ever be made by a group of men or a prosecutor who’s never had to make that choice. Olivia: Guys, guys, guys. Carisi: J-just so we’re clear. My job is to uphold that girl’s rights, and that’s what I’m doing. But I’m sorry, I don’t see this as black-and-white. In my experience, no woman wants to have an abortion. Olivia: Okay. Tamin: Fair enough. But these laws that are getting passed, they are not the answer. Olivia: No, they’re not.

“We’re in the middle of a moment that is calling for us to take action in a way we have never taken action before, and we’re ready,” Kelly Robinson, Planned Parenthood’s deputy national organization director, said to supporters last week on Facebook Live.

“We won’t back down, we won’t be silenced, and we will not let these politicians attack our health and rights without a fight.”

The fight is expected to stretch out over the next few years and to play a role in the 2018 midterm elections — when Democrats and Republicans alike could use votes for Planned Parenthood as a campaign weapon.

But the initial fight will be over defunding.

While Obama vetoed legislation defunding Planned Parenthood a year ago, if a bill gets to Trump, he is expected to sign it.

Defunding efforts also have the enthusiastic support of Vice President-elect Mike Pence Michael (Mike) Richard PenceTrump faces high stakes in meeting with Erdoğan amid impeachment drama Democrats announce public impeachment hearings with eight witnesses next week Haley seeks to quell talk she could replace Pence MORE.

During his time in Congress, Pence repeatedly introduced legislation that would ban Planned Parenthood, and other abortion-providing entities, from receiving federal funding.

One bill passed the House in 2011, though it was rejected by the Democratic-controlled Senate. The Hyde amendment, a rider first passed in 1976, prevents certain federal funds such as Medicaid from being used for abortions with a few exceptions.

So Planned Parenthood is trying to stop the bill in the Senate.

“We’ve talked to every member of Congress who we think has an open mind,” said Donna Crane, vice president of policy for the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League (NARAL).

She declined to name specific lawmakers the group is targeting, though GOP centrist Sens. Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsGOP senators warn against Trump firing intelligence community official This week: House kicks off public phase of impeachment inquiry Senate panel clears controversial Trump court pick MORE (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski Lisa Ann MurkowskiGoogle sparks new privacy fears over health care data This week: House kicks off public phase of impeachment inquiry GOP senators plan to tune out impeachment week MORE (Alaska) have publicly shown reservations about supporting the measure if it includes the Planned Parenthood provision.

Crane said she refuses to “accept the premise” that the GOP will succeed in defunding Planned Parenthood.

“We are going to throw everything we have at these attempts,” she said. “I think every member of Congress, ever respectable member of Congress, is thinking hard about how they will vote.”

Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis Ryan Retirees should say 'no thanks' to Romney's Social Security plan California Governor Newsom and family dress as 2020 Democrats for Halloween DC's liaison to rock 'n' roll MORE (R-Wis.) said defunding Planned Parenthood would be included in a reconciliation bill repealing ObamaCare, though he hasn’t provided further details.

Senate Republicans could pass the legislation without Democratic support — as long as at least 50 GOP members vote in favor of it. Reconciliation bills cannot be filibustered, weakening the Democratic minority.

Democratic lawmakers are heaping pressure on Republicans, arguing that defunding Planned Parenthood could leave millions of low-income women and men without access to services like cancer screenings and STD testing.

“The focus has been on getting Republicans to vote against it and even in the Senate right now, we’re beginning to see a number of Republicans who are against defunding,” said Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), the ranking member on the House's select panel investigating Planned Parenthood.

While federal funding can't be used to pay for abortion, Republicans argue money given to Planned Parenthood essentially subsidizes the procedure.

Ryan hasn’t specified what funding avenues Republicans want to cut off.

Planned Parenthood gets their federal funding from two sources: Medicaid reimbursements and Title X grants, which are awarded to clinics that provide family planning and preventative healthcare resources.

A special investigative panel formed by Republicans recommended in a report last week that Planned Parenthood lose access to both its Medicaid reimbursements and Title X funds.

It's not clear if the Planned Parenthood provision in the reconciliation bill will follow the same path, but Black introduced the same bill last year, and it passed the House.

“This is about promoting true women’s healthcare over elective abortion and honoring the conscience rights of American taxpayers who don’t want their tax dollars used to fund a scandal-ridden abortion enterprise,” Black said in a statement.

While Black’s bill specifies that all federal funding would be cut off, previous bills passed by the House, including one passed in 2011, would have disallowed any abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood, from receiving Title X funds.

That could be detrimental to the organization.

Roughly 40 percent, or $553 million, of Planned Parenthood's revenue comes from government health services grants and reimbursements.

Supporters of Planned Parenthood know it is under siege, and the organization has increased its fundraising.

abortion,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/planned-parenthood-senate-moderates-mitch-mcconnell-239374,Fate of Planned Parenthood funding tied to Senate moderates,2017-06-11,"Burgess Everett, Jennifer Haberkorn","Two female Senate Republicans could stop the anti-abortion movement from achieving its most significant win against Planned Parenthood in decades .
Most Republicans want to eliminate the group ’ s $ 555 million in federal funding as part of their bill to repeal Obamacare . But as Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tries to solve the legislative Rubik ’ s Cube of finding 50 votes for repeal , he may have to drop the Planned Parenthood cut to win the support of the two Republican moderates , Sens . Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska .
The problem is , McConnell would then face the wrath of the anti-abortion community — and its supporters within the Senate . Several prominent anti-abortion groups warned Thursday in a letter to the Senate that they would oppose a bill that doesn ’ t cut off funding to Planned Parenthood and prohibit insurance subsidies from covering abortion .
“ We have a strong pro-life majority in the Senate , and so it ’ s going to be in there , ” said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas , the No . 2 Republican in the Senate .
The debate over using the repeal bill to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood is one of a half-dozen issues that have threatened to divide the Republican conference and prevent them from achieving their long-term goal of repealing the health care law .
Planned Parenthood is blunt about the consequences of such a cut . “ People will lose access and women will die , ” said Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens . “ Thousands of women have had their cancer and precancerous conditions discovered by Planned Parenthood . There are not enough places for women to go to get this care . ”
But how many Republicans may be willing to stake their vote for Obamacare repeal on the bill ’ s inclusion of Planned Parenthood cuts is unclear .
Sen. Marco Rubio ( R-Fla. ) , a prominent opponent of abortion , said he isn ’ t ready to go that far .
“ I ’ m always looking for an opportunity to do what ’ s right on that issue , ” Rubio told ███ . “ But that said , I would say that my focus right now is on the broader health care marketplace , getting it fixed . Certainly , if it has that in there , it would be something I ’ d be supportive of . Whether I condition my vote on it is not something I ’ m prepared to say . ”

The question is how many lawmakers would make a similar calculus .
The fate of funding will likely be determined by whether McConnell needs the votes of Collins and Murkowski . To pass the repeal under the fast-track budget procedure , he requires support from 50 of his 52 Senate Republicans , assuming Vice President Mike Pence casts a tie-breaking vote . If every other Republican backs the bill , McConnell won ’ t need the two moderates .
But even before the bill is written , other possible defections are emerging .
Sen. Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) has voiced strong opposition to the provisions discussed so far , trashing the legislation for keeping “ 90 percent ” of Obamacare . Other conservatives could follow . Or , moderates could balk at the big cuts to Medicaid .
Murkowski has repeatedly said she doesn ’ t think zeroing out Planned Parenthood ’ s funding should be part of the repeal bill . “ I don ’ t think that it should even be part of the discussion about health care , ” she said .
However , she has not gone as far as saying she would oppose a bill that includes it .
Collins has been more emphatic . She opposes cutting Planned Parenthood , but the federal funding is just one of several concerns she has with the Obamacare bill .
Every other Republican has supported eliminating funding in the past . Sen.

Last year , Planned Parenthood got $ 555 million in government funding . The organization has said the majority of that money is reimbursements for health services provided under Medicaid , which prohibits funding abortion except in cases of rape , incest and the mother ’ s health .
Laguens said that if Planned Parenthood loses a half-billion dollars , it would likely have to close some facilities or reduce services .
“ There is no way Planned Parenthood could fundraise to be the public health safety net in this country for low-income women , ” she said .
Republicans say they would take the federal funding that now goes to Planned Parenthood and divert it to community health centers , which they say are more accessible to certain groups ; for instance , people in rural areas . Planned Parenthood argues that most community health centers don ’ t provide the women ’ s health services they do — and that Medicaid recipients should be able to choose the best health care provider for them .
Planned Parenthood and Democrats say they would do everything they could to make defunding — and repeal of the Affordable Care Act overall — huge political issues in the 2018 election , forcing Republicans to defend their decisions to take health care away from vulnerable populations .
“ Particularly swing states — Arizona , Nevada , Colorado — those are the kind of states ” where defunding would be a vulnerability , Laguens said .
But anti-abortion groups , which are influential with many conservatives , say the issue is just as important for them .
If the cut is not in the bill , “ it would be time for a very serious conversation , ” warned Catherine Glenn Foster , president and CEO of Americans United for Life , which opposes abortion . “ I expect it to be in there . I know the House expects it to be in there . Certainly AUL and allied groups are expecting it to be in there . This is part of why we elected these representatives and these senators . ”
A group of conservative Republicans has tried for years to strip Planned Parenthood of its federal funding . In fact , Pence was one of the first Republicans to raise the issue a decade ago , but he had few supporters then . But the effort gained traction two years ago with the release of videos by an anti-abortion group , accusing Planned Parenthood of selling fetal tissue , which the group strongly denies .
“ A couple of years ago , I wouldn ’ t have said ” the bill needs to include defunding , said Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R-Iowa ) . Since the videos came out , “ that kind of make it an easy answer . ”","Two female Senate Republicans could stop the anti-abortion movement from achieving its most significant win against Planned Parenthood in decades.

Most Republicans want to eliminate the group’s $555 million in federal funding as part of their bill to repeal Obamacare. But as Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tries to solve the legislative Rubik’s Cube of finding 50 votes for repeal, he may have to drop the Planned Parenthood cut to win the support of the two Republican moderates, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

Story Continued Below

The problem is, McConnell would then face the wrath of the anti-abortion community — and its supporters within the Senate. Several prominent anti-abortion groups warned Thursday in a letter to the Senate that they would oppose a bill that doesn’t cut off funding to Planned Parenthood and prohibit insurance subsidies from covering abortion.

“We have a strong pro-life majority in the Senate, and so it’s going to be in there,” said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate.

The debate over using the repeal bill to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood is one of a half-dozen issues that have threatened to divide the Republican conference and prevent them from achieving their long-term goal of repealing the health care law.

Planned Parenthood is blunt about the consequences of such a cut. “People will lose access and women will die,” said Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens. “Thousands of women have had their cancer and precancerous conditions discovered by Planned Parenthood. There are not enough places for women to go to get this care.”

But how many Republicans may be willing to stake their vote for Obamacare repeal on the bill’s inclusion of Planned Parenthood cuts is unclear.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a prominent opponent of abortion, said he isn’t ready to go that far.

“I’m always looking for an opportunity to do what’s right on that issue,” Rubio told POLITICO. “But that said, I would say that my focus right now is on the broader health care marketplace, getting it fixed. Certainly, if it has that in there, it would be something I’d be supportive of. Whether I condition my vote on it is not something I’m prepared to say.”

The question is how many lawmakers would make a similar calculus.

The fate of funding will likely be determined by whether McConnell needs the votes of Collins and Murkowski. To pass the repeal under the fast-track budget procedure, he requires support from 50 of his 52 Senate Republicans, assuming Vice President Mike Pence casts a tie-breaking vote. If every other Republican backs the bill, McConnell won’t need the two moderates.

But even before the bill is written, other possible defections are emerging.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has voiced strong opposition to the provisions discussed so far, trashing the legislation for keeping “90 percent” of Obamacare. Other conservatives could follow. Or, moderates could balk at the big cuts to Medicaid.

Murkowski has repeatedly said she doesn’t think zeroing out Planned Parenthood’s funding should be part of the repeal bill. “I don’t think that it should even be part of the discussion about health care,” she said.

However, she has not gone as far as saying she would oppose a bill that includes it.

Collins has been more emphatic. She opposes cutting Planned Parenthood, but the federal funding is just one of several concerns she has with the Obamacare bill.

Every other Republican has supported eliminating funding in the past. Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), perhaps the most vulnerable Republican up for reelection in 2018, said at an April town hall meeting that he wants to “protect” Planned Parenthood, but later said he opposes funding if the organization performs abortions.

The 2015 Obamacare repeal bill, which Republicans crafted as a dry-run for repeal if a Republican president was elected, included defunding of Planned Parenthood. Murkowski and Collins supported an amendment to strike the provision, but it failed. Murkowski still voted for the bill, but Collins did not.

“Everything is going to be trying to get to 50,” said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), a member of Senate leadership. “The people who are opposed to having that provision in the bill, I’m sure there will be discussions with them to figure out what it will take to get the vote.

“But we’ve got individual members who have issues with a lot of different features in the bill. So putting together the strategy that gets us to 50 is no doubt going to be a challenge.”

Wade decision that made abortion legal — by promising to end it .
By the size of the crowds and the enthusiasm of the speakers , it was impossible to tell that just the night before , Republican leaders on Capitol Hill had spiked one of social conservatives ' biggest priorities , a bill banning abortion after the 20th week of pregnancy .
The scramble over the bill behind closed doors was the latest in a series of conflicts within the caucus , and again underscored the challenge facing the GOP as they head into a presidential election year : How to expand the party 's appeal with untapped demographic groups , while still appeasing their conservative base .
That was the concern raised by Rep. Renee Ellmers , the North Carolina Republican who , along with a group of GOP women and centrists in the party , led the successful effort to get the bill pulled .
`` The first vote we take , or the second vote , or the fifth vote , should n't be on an issue where we know that millennials—social issues just are n't as important [ to them ] , '' she told National Journal last week
Ellmers and Rep. Jackie Walorski pulled their sponsorships because of concerns over a requirement that rape victims file a police report to get an exemption from the ban .
Other centrist Republicans expressed concerns on Thursday that the party should be focusing on less controversial issues with broader appeal .
`` This appeared to be messaging bill , and the message that was being sent was not a very good one , '' Republican Rep Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania said
`` I would prefer that our party spent less time focusing on these very contentious social issues , because that distracts us from broader economic messages where I think we have much greater appeal to the larger public , '' he said .
The GOP has long faced significant issues in wooing single female voters and young voters , which contributed to its unexpected loss of the White House in 2012 . After that election , an RNC post-mortem report diagnosing the party 's problems suggested the GOP `` must in fact and deed be inclusive and welcoming '' on social issues .
But as centrists in the party look to move away from the abortion issue , they 'll run up against fierce opposition from social conservatives , who were calling for revenge against Ellmers and other lawmakers who led the effort to drop the bill .
Marjorie Dannenfelser , president of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List , told CNN she met with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Wednesday night and was `` shocked and surprised '' when she was told they would n't be bringing the bill to a floor for a vote .

NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge on Wednesday struck down a new Trump administration rule that could open the way for more health care workers to refuse to participate in abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds.

He said the department’s claim that there was a significant increase in complaints about workers being forced to violate their conscience was “flatly untrue.” The HHS rule, he said, is a classic “solution in search of a problem.”

An HHS spokeswoman had no comment.

Nineteen states, the District of Columbia, three local governments, health organizations and others had sued to block the rule from taking effect Nov. 22, arguing that it would be discriminatory and would interfere with people’s access to health care.

For many watching the abortion fight in Texas, it's deja vu all over again.

Abortion-rights protesters once again gathered Monday at the state capitol building to express their outrage at the Legislature's attempt to further restrict abortions in the state. The images from Austin looked a lot like the previous week's when state Sen. Wendy Davis famously filibustered to stop the legislation from passing.

But another reason the scene looks familiar is that Texas is the latest state in which protesters in the hundreds have descended on a Republican-controlled state capitol to try to stop legislative efforts to implement elements of a conservative agenda.

And just as the protesters in Texas appear to have the odds against them, so did protesters in Wisconsin and North Carolina who failed to stop the changes that spurred their activism.

In Wisconsin, protesters laid siege to the state capitol in 2011 as part of an attempt to turn back the effort by Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature to restrict the collective bargaining power of most public employee unions.

Not only did protesters fail to stop the legislation they despised but they also fell short in their goal to oust Walker or to gain partial control of the Legislature.

This spring, protesters in North Carolina, led by the NAACP, staged what they called Moral Mondays, rallies at the state capitol building in Raleigh to protest legislative efforts by the Republican governor and lawmakers that progressives found abhorrent.

Many demonstrators wound up getting arrested, placing further strains on an already strained county court system, according to one news report.

But they couldn't stop the conservative agenda put forward by Republican Gov. Pat McCrory and GOP lawmakers. Among the laws pushed through: an end to long-term jobless benefits and a resumption of executions, a penalty that had been halted for several years owing to concerns about racial disparities in death sentences.

Measured by their success in stopping the legislative efforts that galvanized them, the protests in North Carolina and Wisconsin didn't accomplish much, at least to date. And in Texas, protesters are likely to share a similar outcome.

But these protests may end up advancing other goals. They've served as focal points for organizing, they've helped new leaders to surface and they've proved to be great tools for raising money.

The Texas protests, for example, have raised Davis' profile, sparking talk that she could use the publicity as a springboard to run for governor.

While anti-choice lawmakers are showing no signs of slowing down in their quest to push increasingly draconian restrictions on women 's reproductive freedom , the movement of people fighting back is stronger , smarter and more organized than ever .
There is a long road ahead , but here are five reasons to feel pretty good about 2014 :
This was a dark year for reproductive rights , but an inspiring time for reproductive rights activism . Wendy Davis ' marathon filibuster was only one of several moments during 2013 that women ( and men ) called out the dangerous misogyny of laws scaling back women 's access to basic healthcare .
A few of the movement 's strongest advocates , in their own words :
Texas activist Sarah Slamen testifies against Texas ' abortion ban : `` Thank you for being you , Texas Legislature . You have radicalized hundreds of thousands of us , and no matter what you do for the next 22 days , women and their allies are coming for you . ''
Texas state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte challenges the silencing of women 's voices in the state legislature : `` At what point must a female senator raise her hand or her voice to be recognized over the male colleagues in the room ? ''
Michigan state Sen. Gretchen Whitmer shares personal testimony in opposition to her state 's ban on private and public insurance for abortion care : `` I think you need to see the face of the women who you are impacting with this vote today . ”
The conversation about reproductive justice is happening at an unprecedented scale
Abortion bans enacted throughout the country have had devastating consequences for women 's health , but the fight against these measures -- whether in legislatures , courts or on the streets -- has made reproductive justice primetime news throughout much of 2013 .
Wendy Davis ' marathon filibuster is perhaps the most cinematic example of how a local law became national news , but it was n't just the duration of her protest that made it significant . Over the course of nearly 12 hours , Davis shared the testimony of women who had bravely shared their experiences with abortion , showcasing the range of personal and medical reasons women need safe and affordable access to such care . She also uplifted the scientific and medical facts around abortion to dispel myths about unsafe clinic conditions or the claims of anti-choice activists that these laws `` protect '' women 's health . In addition to inspiring the country with her endurance and commitment to women 's health , Davis used her platform to debunk some of the most pervasive myths about abortion care in this country . Elsewhere in Texas , the work being done by activists in the Rio Grande region exposed how HB 2 and other laws like it disproportionately impact low-income women and women of color , contributing to a number of high-profile conversations about how -- even 40 years after Roe v. Wade -- access to abortion remains uneven and often inaccessible for far too many women .
These stories showed the nation that reproductive rights are human rights . They also showed that , in addition to providing abortion care , reproductive health facilities enable women and their communities to access low- and no-cost medical care beyond terminating a pregnancy , including pap smears , cancer screenings and prenatal and postnatal checkups .
Teenagers are staking their claim in the reproductive rights movement
Another major voice to emerge from Texas this year was that of 14-year-old Tuesday Cain . After watching Wendy Davis ' filibuster , Tuesday and her father Billy were inspired to head to the Capitol to join with thousands of others in protesting the law . Tuesday 's protest sign ( `` Jesus is n't a dick , so keep him out of my vagina '' ) stirred conservative outrage and major backlash from the anti-choice movement , but rather than allow her critics to silence her , Tuesday became even more bold .
As she told ███ about her experience protesting in Texas :
I ’ ve definitely learned a lot about politics . I ’ ve learned a lot about protest . I ’ ve learned all sorts of things from all sorts of people , people contacting me to tell me their stories , share their wisdom . And because I don ’ t see any of these bills stopping or slowing down anytime soon , I ’ ll continue to fight for women ’ s rights and women ’ s equality . And other things , too .
She also used her own experience to encourage other teens to get involved in causes they care about -- and urged parents to support their children in doing so . `` I think people should be supportive of [ teenagers becoming politically active ] , '' she said . `` Wouldn ’ t they support their own kids getting involved in issues they cared about , doing what they felt was right ? ''
Pro-choice lawmakers are finally playing offense to defend women 's health
Democratic lawmakers may have finally gotten the memo that they need to do more than just vote against harmful restrictions if they really want to support abortion rights in this country . After three years of record-breaking anti-choice initiatives , the United States Congress finally introduced a measure to fight back .
A coalition of Democrats , led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal , D-Conn. and Rep. Judy Chu , D-Calif. , in November introduced a measure that would curtail the proliferation of so-called Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers ( TRAP ) laws and other medically unnecessary barriers to abortion care . As ███ has previously reported , the Women ’ s Health Protection Act would `` create federal protections against state laws that have nothing to do with protecting women ’ s health and everything to do with undermining women ’ s bodily autonomy and constitutional rights in order to score political points . ''
This assault on essential , constitutionally protected rights has gone on too long . We are introducing the Women ’ s Health Protection Act of 2013 this week to end it , once and for all . Our bill would stop states from subjecting reproductive health care providers to burdensome requirements that are not applied to medical professionals providing similar services .
California bucked a national trend and actually expanded access to abortion care
California gets special recognition for being the only state in the country to pass a law that actually expanded access to abortion care in 2013 .
California is now one among several states that allow nurses , midwives and physician assistants to perform early abortions . The measure broadens the pool of available medical professionals able to provide women with abortion care , and expands access into communities that have been traditionally underserved , such as rural areas where providers are often few and far between .
Lawmakers in the state know that they are bucking a national trend by acknowledging that access continues to be a problem for far too many women , and doing something to change it . “ We are trending in a different direction , and we ’ re very proud of it , ” Toni Atkins , the state assemblywoman who wrote the bill , remarked at the time . “ This is an issue of accessibility , ” she added . “ California is a very large state , and more than half the counties don ’ t have an abortion provider . ”","There are lots of reasons to feel very bad about reproductive justice in the United States right now (see here for more on that), but there are also plenty or reasons to feel optimistic that things are going to get better in the coming year.

While anti-choice lawmakers are showing no signs of slowing down in their quest to push increasingly draconian restrictions on women's reproductive freedom, the movement of people fighting back is stronger, smarter and more organized than ever.

""I think people should be supportive of [teenagers becoming politically active],"" she said. ""Wouldn’t they support their own kids getting involved in issues they cared about, doing what they felt was right?""

Pro-choice lawmakers are finally playing offense to defend women's health

Democratic lawmakers may have finally gotten the memo that they need to do more than just vote against harmful restrictions if they really want to support abortion rights in this country. After three years of record-breaking anti-choice initiatives, the United States Congress finally introduced a measure to fight back.

A coalition of Democrats, led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. and Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., in November introduced a measure that would curtail the proliferation of so-called Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers (TRAP) laws and other medically unnecessary barriers to abortion care. As Salon has previously reported, the Women’s Health Protection Act would ""create federal protections against state laws that have nothing to do with protecting women’s health and everything to do with undermining women’s bodily autonomy and constitutional rights in order to score political points.""

Here's Blumenthal on the measure:

This assault on essential, constitutionally protected rights has gone on too long. We are introducing the Women’s Health Protection Act of 2013 this week to end it, once and for all. Our bill would stop states from subjecting reproductive health care providers to burdensome requirements that are not applied to medical professionals providing similar services.

California bucked a national trend and actually expanded access to abortion care

California gets special recognition for being the only state in the country to pass a law that actually expanded access to abortion care in 2013.

California is now one among several states that allow nurses, midwives and physician assistants to perform early abortions. The measure broadens the pool of available medical professionals able to provide women with abortion care, and expands access into communities that have been traditionally underserved, such as rural areas where providers are often few and far between.

Lawmakers in the state know that they are bucking a national trend by acknowledging that access continues to be a problem for far too many women, and doing something to change it. “We are trending in a different direction, and we’re very proud of it,” Toni Atkins, the state assemblywoman who wrote the bill, remarked at the time. “This is an issue of accessibility,” she added. “California is a very large state, and more than half the counties don’t have an abortion provider.”",www.salon.com,left,cuuVMBX67Ij5dxqL

abortion,Guest Writer - Right,2,https://spectator.org/infanticide-makes-a-comeback/,OPINION: Infanticide Makes a Comeback,,Wesley J. Smith,"It ’ s not that Democrats support infanticide : They just aren ’ t against it . What other conclusion can one reach when 44 out of 47 Senate Democrats blocked the Senate from voting on a bill requiring that any baby who survives an abortion — in other words , a baby who was born — must be brought to a hospital for care and treated with “ the same degree of professional skill , care , and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child as a reasonably diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to any other child born alive at the same gestational age . ”
Whoever intentionally performs or attempts to perform an overt act that kills a child born alive described under subsection ( a ) , shall be punished… for intentionally killing or attempting to kill a human being .
Good grief , who could object to that ? At least six want-to-be presidents — Kamala Harris , Bernie Sanders , Kirsten Gillibrand , Amy Klobuchar , Cory Booker , and Elizabeth Warren — did . That ’ s stunning .
We have been here before . During the height of the eugenics movement in the 1920s and 30s , activists sought to “ improve ” the human herd by preventing the so-called “ unfit ” from being born — generally through involuntary sterilization of those considered eugenically incorrect . Appallingly , some 60,000 people were involuntarily sterilized under color of law in the United States during the first half of the 20th century .
Some famous advocates wanted to go even further , advocating the killing of babies who did not pass eugenics muster . For example , in his splendid history of the eugenics movement , War Against the Weak , Edwin Black reports that birth control advocate and social Darwinist Margaret Sanger , proudly spouted “ the extreme eugenic view that human ‘ weeds ’ should be ‘ exterminated. ’ ” Bizarrely , so did Helen Keller — as if the fact that her disabilities weren ’ t congenital would have protected her once the slaughter of the “ defectives ” began .
Systematic infanticide was never legalized in the United States . But in Germany , doctors killed tens of thousands of disabled babies between 1939-1945 . It is important to note that Hitler did not force medical personnel to kill disabled babies ( although doctors and midwives were required legally to report their births ) . Rather , doctors who committed infanticide did so willingly , believing that their killing was a “ healing treatment ” for the child , the family , and the Reich .
After the war , infanticide was scorned universally as evil . But now , that moral consensus has frayed . Indeed , one could say that infanticide is making a comeback .
One need only look at the world ’ s foremost medical and bioethics journals to see the trendline . Princeton University ’ s bioethics professor Peter Singer became famous by claiming that newborn babies are killable because they have not yet developed the cognitive capacities to be considered a “ person. ” He wrote in Rethinking Life and Death , “ Since neither a newborn infant nor a fish is a person the wrongness of killing such beings is not as great as the wrongness of killing a person. ” In other words , to Singer , a newborn infant is the moral equivalent of a mackerel .
In a 2010 Harvard symposium on abortion and infanticide , Singer tied infanticide to the legality of abortion : “ The position that allows abortion also allows infanticide under some circumstances.… If we accept abortion , we do need to rethink some of those more fundamental attitudes about human life . ”
In another world and time , Singer ’ s advocacy would make him an intellectual outcast . Instead , far from being a fringe character , Singer is invited to present at seminars , symposia , and philosophy association conventions throughout the world . He is often quoted respectfully in the mainstream media , including frequently in New York Times , where he is also a recurring contributor .
Singer is far from alone . A few years ago , the Journal of Medical Ethics published an advocacy article entitled , “ After-Birth Abortion : Why Should the Baby Live ? ” Consider the following quotes that the editors of one of the world ’ s most prestigious bioethics journals considered worthy of respectful dissemination :
“ The moral status of an infant is equivalent to that of a fetus , that is , neither can be considered a ‘ person ’ in a morally relevant sense . ”
“ In spite of the oxymoron in the expression , we propose to call this practice ‘ after-birth ’ abortion , ’ rather than ‘ infanticide , ’ to emphasize that the moral status of the individual killed is comparable with that of a fetus… rather than that of a child . ”
“ We claim that killing a newborn could be ethically permissible in all circumstances where abortion would be . ”
“ Merely being human is not in itself a reason for ascribing someone a right to life . ”
The authors also claim that killing healthy and able-bodied babies should be allowable because , “ we also need to consider the interests of the mother who might suffer psychological distress from giving up her child for adoption. ” The mind boggles .
Alas , infanticide has gone beyond mere advocacy in the modern world . For decades , China turned a blind eye to chronic female infanticide that resulted from its odious “ one child policy , ” recently abandoned because it led to a catastrophic demographic imbalance between males and females . India has also seen a problem with sex-selection “ after-birth abortions . ”
The Netherlands has embraced wartime Germany ’ s scorned policy of allowing babies born with terminal illnesses and serious disabilities to be subjected to homicide by doctors . And , it is done under color of law under a bureaucratic checklist known as “ The Groningen Protocol , ” which permits doctors to lethally inject infants under three scenarios :
The baby has no chance of survival ( a circumstance that is sometimes misdiagnosed ) ; The baby “ may survive after a period of intensive treatment but expectations for their future are very grim ” ; The baby does “ not depend on technology for physiologic stability ” but has “ suffering [ that ] is severe , sustained , and can not be alleviated . ”
Thus , Dutch doctors not only speed up dying babies ’ deaths , but also kill those with serious disabilities who do not need intensive care . Showing the dark currents that are flowing in favor of infanticide , the Groningen Protocol was published with all due respect in the New England Journal of Medicine .
Some politicians and advocates are slightly less blatant , arguing in support of what could be called infanticide-by-neglect . The most well-known recent example was Virginia Governor Ralph Northam ( D-VA ) , who falsely ( according to a study published by the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute ) claimed that late-term abortions are restricted to “ cases where there may be severe deformities , there may be a fetus that ’ s non-viable. ” And if such babies are born alive , Northam was asked in a radio interview . He stated coldly :
So , in this particular example , if a mother is in labor , I can tell you exactly what would happen . The infant would be delivered . The infant would be kept comfortable . The infant would be resuscitated if that ’ s what the mother and the family desired , and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother .
Think about this . The Governor of Virginia endorsed the moral equivalent of the Roman Empire ’ s ancient practice of exposing disabled infants on hills — except that instead of leaving the baby in the weeds to be consumed by animals , the child would be left to die unattended in a bassinette . Awful .
The recent open and notorious support for infanticide by society ’ s most powerful voices forces us to support , reject , or be openly indifferent to the sanctity of human life . If there is moral accountability in creation , we had better be very careful about what we do next . History will judge us most harshly if we turn a blind eye to the killing of the most weak , defenseless , and innocent among us .
Award winning author Wesley J. Smith is a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute ’ s Center on Human Exceptionalism and a consultant to the Patients Rights Council . His most recent book is Culture of Death : The Age of “ Do Harm ” Medicine .","It’s not that Democrats support infanticide: They just aren’t against it.

But , under Trump , the net has been thrown wider and pulled tighter than ever . Sexual health organisations have said women will die as a consequence as they pursue dangerous DIY solutions or “ back street ” abortions instead .
In March , the US extended the gag , stating that any organisation counselling women on abortion and using funds from elsewhere – even from its own government or a donor in another country – will no longer be eligible for any US funding . The diktat applies to all global health organisations . HIV and children ’ s charities must sign up to the pledge , alongside those running sexual and reproductive health clinics .

What that means for organisations such as Marie Stopes International and the International Planned Parenthood Federation ( IPPF ) is a blight on sexual and reproductive health services even in countries where abortion is never offered because it is illegal .
Every time the global gag has been reimposed by a Republican president , rates of back street and self-administered abortions sometimes ending in death have gone up , along with unwanted pregnancies . Two years since Trump ’ s original edict , on the day he came into office and in line with his pledge to religious groups he courted for votes , it is still early to assess the impact , but it is likely to be considerable .
“ The global gag rule hits hardest the women living at the margins – the poorest , the most remote and those under 25 , ” said Ana Maria Bejar , the director of advocacy at IPPF . “ Progress can only be made when we can expand access for women and girls , not by reducing it .
“ The policy has had a disastrous impact for IPPF in [ more than ] 30 countries . Tailored services for contraception , Zika information , maternal health , antenatal care , reproductive cancers , and HIV prevention and treatment felt the brunt .
“ Any cuts to critical , affordable , high-quality , integrated reproductive healthcare is denying a woman or girl the right to decide what to do with her body , her life and her future . ”
IPPF had 49 projects run by local member organisations in 31 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean , sub-Saharan Africa , and South Asia in January 2017 when the rule came in . Services in some areas shrunk by up to 42 % within the year and the impact is already visible .
In Kibera , one of Nairobi ’ s biggest slums , volunteers report a rise in sexually transmitted infections , such as syphilis , and unsafe abortions . An outreach family planning clinic arrives once a month instead of three to four times . In some rural areas of Kenya , such clinics have stopped completely . Some HIV clinics have closed .
In Dakar , Senegal , volunteers report a rise in unsafe abortions , teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections in an impoverished neighbourhood where three out of five clinics that had been funded by IPPF have closed .
Marie Stopes International is the other big funder of family planning services across the world . John Lotspeich , its director of external affairs , called the latest extension of the gag “ quite outrageous … what they are saying is , even if an organisation ’ s money mainly comes from other organisations , say the Danish government , there is a ban on that money from being used to discuss abortion ” .
US funds , he points out , have never gone towards paying for abortion . There is a separate piece of legislation that prevents it .
Marie Stopes International supports family planning services in many countries where abortion is illegal . Some of those have ended .
“ It happened very quickly in 2017 , ” Lotspeich said . “ Most outreach services in Uganda had to stop. ” In Madagascar , they had to give their trucks back to the US Agency for International Development ( USAid ) . “ They wouldn ’ t even let us buy them from them .
“ Then there are examples in countries like Malawi , where only we and [ the ] IPPF are the providers. ” They have had to stretch their resources , meaning fewer services are allocated across the country .
Sexual and reproductive health is a sensitive area , highly vulnerable to changes in the political and moral climate .
Lotspeich said that within three to four months of Tanzania banning pregnant girls from attending school “ some of our providers say they were seeing teenage girls coming in having tried to self-abort . Being pregnant , they couldn ’ t go to school , so they tried to take matters into their own hands. ” There can be tragic consequences .
The Danish and Canadian governments have given MSI funding . The movement She Decides was started in response to Trump ’ s reimposition of the gag by the Dutch government minister Lilianne Ploumen , along with her counterparts in the governments of Belgium , Denmark and Sweden . It has raised funds and championed women ’ s rights to sexual and reproductive healthcare , including abortion , but it can not match the loss of funds from the United States .
US money is being switched from the big family planning providers to faith groups that have a specifically anti-abortion stance . Some are also opposed to modern contraception . They will say they do family planning – but they teach “ natural ” methods and abstention . There is a change in the atmosphere and the argument .
In Verona in March , the World Congress of Families held its annual rally , declaring its commitment to “ the right to life ” from conception , as well as marriage being solely the union of one man and one woman for life . Just as hostile to LGBTI rights and abortion is the ultraconservative CitizenGO , started in Spain but now promoting petitions in 50 countries . These movements are reinvigorated by Trump ’ s global war on abortion .
“ We are starting to see this is a hugely political play , ” Lotspeich said . “ The Trump administration is giving a lot of air cover for people to express these views that women ’ s rights are not paramount , even though they are enshrined in the Beijing declaration and so on . ”
The rhetorical battle has intensified . She Decides is leading the fight back , taking on the cause of women ’ s rights all over the world . But while US money is denied to those who would help women have control over their bodies , the deaths and serious mental and physical harm will inevitably continue .","The Trump administration has taken its war on abortion worldwide, cutting off all funding to any overseas organisation or clinic that will not agree to a complete ban on even discussing it.

IPPF had 49 projects run by local member organisations in 31 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia in January 2017 when the rule came in. Services in some areas shrunk by up to 42% within the year and the impact is already visible.

In Kibera, one of Nairobi’s biggest slums, volunteers report a rise in sexually transmitted infections, such as syphilis, and unsafe abortions. An outreach family planning clinic arrives once a month instead of three to four times. In some rural areas of Kenya, such clinics have stopped completely. Some HIV clinics have closed.

In Dakar, Senegal, volunteers report a rise in unsafe abortions, teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections in an impoverished neighbourhood where three out of five clinics that had been funded by IPPF have closed.

Marie Stopes International is the other big funder of family planning services across the world. John Lotspeich, its director of external affairs, called the latest extension of the gag “quite outrageous … what they are saying is, even if an organisation’s money mainly comes from other organisations, say the Danish government, there is a ban on that money from being used to discuss abortion”.

US funds, he points out, have never gone towards paying for abortion. There is a separate piece of legislation that prevents it.

Marie Stopes International supports family planning services in many countries where abortion is illegal. Some of those have ended.

“It happened very quickly in 2017,” Lotspeich said. “Most outreach services in Uganda had to stop.” In Madagascar, they had to give their trucks back to the US Agency for International Development (USAid). “They wouldn’t even let us buy them from them.

“Then there are examples in countries like Malawi, where only we and [the] IPPF are the providers.” They have had to stretch their resources, meaning fewer services are allocated across the country.

Sexual and reproductive health is a sensitive area, highly vulnerable to changes in the political and moral climate.

Lotspeich said that within three to four months of Tanzania banning pregnant girls from attending school “some of our providers say they were seeing teenage girls coming in having tried to self-abort. Being pregnant, they couldn’t go to school, so they tried to take matters into their own hands.” There can be tragic consequences.

The Danish and Canadian governments have given MSI funding. The movement She Decides was started in response to Trump’s reimposition of the gag by the Dutch government minister Lilianne Ploumen, along with her counterparts in the governments of Belgium, Denmark and Sweden. It has raised funds and championed women’s rights to sexual and reproductive healthcare, including abortion, but it cannot match the loss of funds from the United States.

US money is being switched from the big family planning providers to faith groups that have a specifically anti-abortion stance. Some are also opposed to modern contraception. They will say they do family planning – but they teach “natural” methods and abstention. There is a change in the atmosphere and the argument.

In Verona in March, the World Congress of Families held its annual rally, declaring its commitment to “the right to life” from conception, as well as marriage being solely the union of one man and one woman for life. Just as hostile to LGBTI rights and abortion is the ultraconservative CitizenGO, started in Spain but now promoting petitions in 50 countries. These movements are reinvigorated by Trump’s global war on abortion.

“We are starting to see this is a hugely political play,” Lotspeich said. “The Trump administration is giving a lot of air cover for people to express these views that women’s rights are not paramount, even though they are enshrined in the Beijing declaration and so on.”

The rhetorical battle has intensified. She Decides is leading the fight back, taking on the cause of women’s rights all over the world. But while US money is denied to those who would help women have control over their bodies, the deaths and serious mental and physical harm will inevitably continue.",www.theguardian.com,left,Lrfx5bHudFEjbjYE

The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to stop Texas from implementing a part of a new abortion law that requires doctors to get admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic where they're providing abortion services.

A federal appeals court had reinstated the key part of the law, which is considered among the most restrictive in the country.

Republican State Sen.

`` You do n't have to raise that child , you do n't have to carry that child , you do n't have to provide for that child , you do n't have to do anything for that child , '' she told Chambliss . `` But yet you want to make that decision for that woman , that that 's what she has to do . ''
Figures proposed amendments to have legislators who backed the bill pay for the anticipated legal fees accrued by subsequent legal challenges , to expand Medicaid in anticipation of the bill 's impact on low-income women , and to make having a vasectomy a class A felony , as the bill would designate performing an abortion . All three motions failed .
Eric Johnston , head of the Alabama Pro-life Coalition and the drafter of the initial legislation , told CNN that while the amendment to exempt rape and incest victims is `` sympathetic '' and `` deals with very difficult issues , '' it would upend the law 's legal standing .
`` Regardless of how the conception takes place , the product is a child , and so we 're saying that that unborn child is a person entitled to protection of law , '' he added . `` So if , be it a rape or incest conception , then it would be impossible to ask a judge which of these is protected by law and which is not . ''
Staci Fox , president of Planned Parenthood Southeast , told CNN before the chamber 's vote that `` even the authors of this bill know that it is blatantly unconstitutional and would n't stand up in court . ''
`` We 've seen the continual chipping away year after year in Alabama and efforts get bolder and bolder each year , '' Fox said . `` I think with the President and now Kavanaugh on the court , the politics in Alabama just feel emboldened to take this egregious swipe at women 's health care . ''
But in the larger legal landscape , Marshall cast doubt on whether this bill would ever take on Roe , citing how the case would take several years to get to the Supreme Court while several other states have already passed so-called heartbeat bills effectively banning abortion .
`` There are already 14 cases nationwide in the pipeline , two of which are currently at the Supreme Court of the United States , '' he said . `` The notion that somehow this is going to be the vehicle for the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v.

Rodger Smitherman asked what would happen under the bill to a young girl who was a victim of incest and found out she was pregnant, Chambliss said that he hoped that the bill would result in young women learning to seek physical and mental help quickly if they are abused.

""What I hope is, if we pass this bill, that all young ladies would be educated by their parents, their guardians that should a situation like this occur, you need to go get help -- you need to do it immediately,"" Chambliss said.

""Then also they can get justice in the situation,"" he added. ""If they wait, justice delayed is justice denied.""

Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures told Chambliss that a rape victim's trauma ""is not your business.""

""You don't have to raise that child, you don't have to carry that child, you don't have to provide for that child, you don't have to do anything for that child,"" she told Chambliss. ""But yet you want to make that decision for that woman, that that's what she has to do.""

Figures proposed amendments to have legislators who backed the bill pay for the anticipated legal fees accrued by subsequent legal challenges, to expand Medicaid in anticipation of the bill's impact on low-income women, and to make having a vasectomy a class A felony, as the bill would designate performing an abortion. All three motions failed.

Eric Johnston, head of the Alabama Pro-life Coalition and the drafter of the initial legislation, told CNN that while the amendment to exempt rape and incest victims is ""sympathetic"" and ""deals with very difficult issues,"" it would upend the law's legal standing.

""Regardless of how the conception takes place, the product is a child, and so we're saying that that unborn child is a person entitled to protection of law,"" he added. ""So if, be it a rape or incest conception, then it would be impossible to ask a judge which of these is protected by law and which is not.""

Staci Fox, president of Planned Parenthood Southeast, told CNN before the chamber's vote that ""even the authors of this bill know that it is blatantly unconstitutional and wouldn't stand up in court.""

""We've seen the continual chipping away year after year in Alabama and efforts get bolder and bolder each year,"" Fox said. ""I think with the President and now Kavanaugh on the court, the politics in Alabama just feel emboldened to take this egregious swipe at women's health care.""

But in the larger legal landscape, Marshall cast doubt on whether this bill would ever take on Roe, citing how the case would take several years to get to the Supreme Court while several other states have already passed so-called heartbeat bills effectively banning abortion.

""There are already 14 cases nationwide in the pipeline, two of which are currently at the Supreme Court of the United States,"" he said. ""The notion that somehow this is going to be the vehicle for the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade is really misplaced.""

abortion,CNN (Web News),0,http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/31/politics/tim-kaine-hillary-clinton-hyde-amendment-abortion/index.html,Kaine breaks with Clinton on abortion provision,2016-07-31,,"( CNN ) Tim Kaine differs with Hillary Clinton on a longstanding rule banning federal taxpayer dollars from funding abortions , the Democratic vice presidential candidate told CNN 's Jake Tapper on `` State of the Union , '' in an interview that aired Sunday .
That 's a rare policy disagreement with Clinton , the Democratic presidential nominee , and her running mate , who said he was `` so humbled '' to be chosen for the ticket .
`` My job is really to just do everything I can to support a great Clinton presidency and I 'm really excited to be off and running on that task , '' the Virginia senator said .
Abortion , though , remains a point of difference between the pair . Kaine said he supports the Hyde Amendment , a 40-year-old rule preventing federal taxpayer dollars from funding abortions . That contradicts comments by Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook in a July 24 `` State of the Union '' appearance . Kaine `` has said that he will stand with Secretary Clinton to defend a woman 's right to choose , to repeal the Hyde Amendment , '' Mook quoted Kaine as saying .
`` My voting position on abortion has n't really changed , '' Kaine said in the interview aired Sunday . `` I support the Hyde Amendment . I have n't changed that . ''
`` That is not accurate and I do n't think Robby has said that , Jake , '' Kaine responded .
Clinton spokesperson Jesse Ferguson told CNN on July 26 that Kaine 's commitment to stand with Clinton on repealing the Hyde Amendment `` was made privately . ''
Kaine said in the interview that he thought about his differences with Clinton over abortion before joining the ticket . As a potential vice president `` I had to get comfortable with the notion that I can have my personal views but I 'm going to support the president of the United States , and I will . ''
Still the issue is likely to linger among some Clinton supporters . NARAL Pro-Choice America president Ilyse Hogue called Kaine 's continued opposition to repealing the Hyde Amendment `` deeply disappointing '' in a t weeted statement that was apparently deleted and then reposted
`` While we appreciate Senator Kaine 's clarification that he will support the nominee 's position on this , we sincerely hope that Sen. Kaine will continue to educate himself on what Hyde means to the most vulnerable women in this country and join us in fighting this injustice , '' the statement said .
On Sunday the group tamped down its criticism , and tweeted it is now `` glad '' Kaine will stand with Clinton to `` end Hyde , '' exhibiting a more optimistic outlook on Kaine supporting Clinton regardless of his personal views .
We 're glad @ TimKaine will stand w/ @ HillaryClinton to end Hyde . We must keep educating leaders on how it affects the most vulnerable women . — NARAL ( @ NARAL ) July 31 , 2016
Tapper asked Kaine if he agreed with former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg 's suggestion in his speech at the Democratic convention that Trump is not sane .
`` I do n't know anything about his sanity . I have n't met him , '' Kaine said . But he did express confusion at some of Trump 's statements and tactics , especially a recent episode in which Trump confused Kaine with a former Republican governor of New Jersey , Tom Kean .
`` Tom Kean was governor of New Jersey and he finished his term 26 years ago , '' Kaine said . `` I 've got to scratch my head about that guy every day . ''
Kaine , a former Virginia governor , also criticized Trump 's seeming invitation last week for Russia to hack into US servers and find Clinton 's missing emails -- a comment Trump later said was `` sarcastic . ''
`` I do n't think cyber security is a big joking matter , '' Kaine told Tapper . `` The guy 's got a bizarre sense of humor . ''
Kaine said that , `` sure , there is '' work to be done to unify the Democratic party . `` But I feel like we 're in really good shape . ''
The convention in Philadelphia got off a to a rocky start due to protests by Bernie Sanders supporters angry at what they called bias toward Clinton 's campaign by the Democratic National Committee . The protests came after the group WikiLeaks released thousands of hacked emails portraying DNC staffers in an unfavorable light .
Kaine said these kind of arguing factions make the Democratic party better than their Republican rivals .
`` I 'm used to the fact that we 're a big family with a lot of different points of view . Unlike the Republicans , you know we have n't had the litmus test where if you do n't believe this , we 're going to throw you out . We have ideological breadth and that 's good , that 's what we want to have . ''
Kaine , an early backer of Barack Obama in the 2008 in his primary fight against Hillary Clinton , said he believes that the Democratic Party is more unified today than it was at this point eight years ago , following the protracted primary battle between the pair .
The Democratic National Convention made history on Wednesday by nominating Clinton , a former secretary of state , as the first female presidential candidate of a major party . Kaine was quick to share his own awe , as well as his mother 's .
`` I said to Hillary when I walked out , when I walked out into that fantastic evening I said to her , 'This is a great country , and you just made it a lot greater . ' ''
Kaine 's mother , he recalled , `` said , 'This is the best night of my life . ' Now when mom says that to her son I feel like I know at least for the next 48 or 72 hours , I 'm going to be in good shape .

Abortion, though, remains a point of difference between the pair. Kaine said he supports the Hyde Amendment, a 40-year-old rule preventing federal taxpayer dollars from funding abortions. That contradicts comments by Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook in a July 24 ""State of the Union"" appearance. Kaine ""has said that he will stand with Secretary Clinton to defend a woman's right to choose, to repeal the Hyde Amendment,"" Mook quoted Kaine as saying.

""My voting position on abortion hasn't really changed,"" Kaine said in the interview aired Sunday. ""I support the Hyde Amendment. I haven't changed that.""

Tapper pressed Kaine, saying Mook told CNN otherwise.

""That is not accurate and I don't think Robby has said that, Jake,"" Kaine responded.

Clinton spokesperson Jesse Ferguson told CNN on July 26 that Kaine's commitment to stand with Clinton on repealing the Hyde Amendment ""was made privately.""

Kaine said in the interview that he thought about his differences with Clinton over abortion before joining the ticket. As a potential vice president ""I had to get comfortable with the notion that I can have my personal views but I'm going to support the president of the United States, and I will.""

Still the issue is likely to linger among some Clinton supporters. NARAL Pro-Choice America president Ilyse Hogue called Kaine's continued opposition to repealing the Hyde Amendment ""deeply disappointing"" in a t weeted statement that was apparently deleted and then reposted

""While we appreciate Senator Kaine's clarification that he will support the nominee's position on this, we sincerely hope that Sen. Kaine will continue to educate himself on what Hyde means to the most vulnerable women in this country and join us in fighting this injustice,"" the statement said.

On Sunday the group tamped down its criticism, and tweeted it is now ""glad"" Kaine will stand with Clinton to ""end Hyde,"" exhibiting a more optimistic outlook on Kaine supporting Clinton regardless of his personal views.

We're glad @TimKaine will stand w/ @HillaryClinton to end Hyde. We must keep educating leaders on how it affects the most vulnerable women. — NARAL (@NARAL) July 31, 2016

On Trump

Tapper asked Kaine if he agreed with former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's suggestion in his speech at the Democratic convention that Trump is not sane.

""I don't know anything about his sanity. I haven't met him,"" Kaine said. But he did express confusion at some of Trump's statements and tactics, especially a recent episode in which Trump confused Kaine with a former Republican governor of New Jersey, Tom Kean.

""Tom Kean was governor of New Jersey and he finished his term 26 years ago,"" Kaine said. ""I've got to scratch my head about that guy every day.""

Kaine, a former Virginia governor, also criticized Trump's seeming invitation last week for Russia to hack into US servers and find Clinton's missing emails -- a comment Trump later said was ""sarcastic.""

""I don't think cyber security is a big joking matter,"" Kaine told Tapper. ""The guy's got a bizarre sense of humor.""

Unifying the Democratic party

Kaine said that, ""sure, there is"" work to be done to unify the Democratic party. ""But I feel like we're in really good shape.""

The convention in Philadelphia got off a to a rocky start due to protests by Bernie Sanders supporters angry at what they called bias toward Clinton's campaign by the Democratic National Committee. The protests came after the group WikiLeaks released thousands of hacked emails portraying DNC staffers in an unfavorable light.

Kaine said these kind of arguing factions make the Democratic party better than their Republican rivals.

""I'm used to the fact that we're a big family with a lot of different points of view. Unlike the Republicans, you know we haven't had the litmus test where if you don't believe this, we're going to throw you out. We have ideological breadth and that's good, that's what we want to have.""

Kaine, an early backer of Barack Obama in the 2008 in his primary fight against Hillary Clinton, said he believes that the Democratic Party is more unified today than it was at this point eight years ago, following the protracted primary battle between the pair.

On Hillary Clinton making history

The Democratic National Convention made history on Wednesday by nominating Clinton, a former secretary of state, as the first female presidential candidate of a major party. Kaine was quick to share his own awe, as well as his mother's.

""I said to Hillary when I walked out, when I walked out into that fantastic evening I said to her, 'This is a great country, and you just made it a lot greater.'""

Kaine's mother, he recalled, ""said, 'This is the best night of my life.' Now when mom says that to her son I feel like I know at least for the next 48 or 72 hours, I'm going to be in good shape.""",www.cnn.com,left,Y9ViKNoLAcyXysDw

Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis urged Gov . Rick Perry to stop demonizing women for difficult decisions they might have to make , once again responding to the governor ’ s comments on her personal life .
“ Gov . Perry…let ’ s stop demonizing women who face very difficult choices in their life . Let ’ s make sure that we don ’ t close down 37 of the 42 clinics in Texas and leave women with nowhere to go and put them in a situation where there health will be at risk , ” Davis told CNN ’ s Wolf Blitzer on Friday when asked what she would say directly to the Republican if she could .
“ If you , truly care about women ’ s health , let ’ s do something to make sure that we ’ re protecting them . Let ’ s make sure that we ’ re preventing unplanned pregnancies and that we ’ re committing resources to make that happen . Let ’ s make sure that we ’ re working for age-appropriate sex-education in our school system , ” she added . “ Because what we do know is that closing down the ability to access that service unfortunately does not take the need away or women ’ s confronting that issue away . ”
Earlier Friday , the Fort Worth Democrat took Perry to task over highly personal comments he made about her the day before .
“ I would say to him , that I had the privilege of making a choice about the path I chose for my life , ” Davis , who derailed a restrictive abortion bill in the Texas Legislature earlier this week , said on MSNBC ’ s “ Morning Joe. ” “ I ’ m so proud of my daughters but I could never for a moment put myself in the shoes of another woman confronting a difficult personal choice and it really isn ’ t for him to make statements like that . ”
On Thursday , Perry said it was “ unfortunate ” that Davis , who for a time was a single mother , “ hasn ’ t learned from her own example . That every life must be given a chance to realize its own potential ; that every life matters . ”
Perry ’ s office noted in an email on Friday that the governor was “ praising Sen. Davis for her success despite coming from difficult circumstances , ” highlighting the preceding part of his speech in which he asked , “ Who are we to say that children born into the worst of circumstances can ’ t grow to live successful lives ? ”
Their exchange caps off a week of intense national scrutiny of the Lone Star State . On Tuesday , Davis spearheaded a 13-hour filibuster that ultimately prevented a far-reaching abortion measure from being signed into law . A day later , Perry swung back by calling for a new special session of the legislature , which would prioritize that abortion legislation again .

“ The strategy , honestly , will be to hopefully employ the individual voices once again that really made the difference on this issue in the last special session , ” Davis said .
She acknowledged that last time , the Democrats had an advantage : The bill wasn ’ t addressed until the end of the session , so there was a chance to delay the finalization of the vote until after the session concluded .
“ Obviously they let the clock run out , ” she said . “ They put themselves in a position where a tremendous opportunity was put in front of us . ”
Striking a tone of optimism , Davis concluded , “ I expect that [ citizens are ] going to do everything they can to ensure their voices are heard again in this next special session . I only hope that people will listen . ”

Flynn","Since last week , when Alabama joined several other states — Georgia , Mississippi , and Ohio among them — in passing a bill seeking to greatly restrict legal abortions within its borders , the Left has gone almost completely berserk in protest .
This wasn ’ t a surprise , since to the Left abortion is akin to a religious sacrament and extremism in support of ending the lives of the unborn is no longer a vice ( nor moderation a virtue ) to them . When Planned Parenthood is exposed as running an underground marketplace for the chopped-up remains of aborted babies and the response is to kill , or at least arrest , the messenger , when a movie telling the true story of a Planned Parenthood manager who had a crisis of confidence surrounding the organization ’ s practices and became pro-life has to be deleted from theatres , when activists are running free on social media with hashtags like # ShoutYourAbortion… you would expect a normal political movement to hustle to rein itself in for fear of losing the high ground with the American people .
The pro-abort Left has done none of this . Instead , it celebrated a bill in New York that would functionally legalize abortion all the way through pregnancy — with that state ’ s governor lighting the Freedom Tower pink in tribute . And in Virginia a Democrat legislator , with the backing of that state ’ s horrifically inappropriate governor , brought a bill which would have essentially legalized infanticide . That one , thankfully , did not pass .
The public is slowly growing more pro-life , polls show . Younger Americans are more pro-life than their parents . Despite hundreds of thousands of abortions per year it looks like the public is moving away from the practice — partially because of technology .
Forty years ago there was no ability for a pregnant mother to see her baby in the womb in the kind of detail modern sonograms can offer . There was not the ability to detect a fetal heartbeat in the detail available today . By the beginning of the second trimester it ’ s difficult to continue pushing the line that what ’ s in the womb isn ’ t a human being . And the time at which a fetus can be viable outside the womb is becoming earlier and earlier due to medical technology . Some day soon there will be no justification at all for aborting an unborn baby ; not when medical science can remove him or her from the womb and preserve him or her for life apart from the biological mother .
All the while America , with its people starting families later and later and its fertility less and less certain as a result , is awash in parents begging to adopt children . Increasingly Americans are scouring the globe in search of babies in China , Central America , Russia , and Africa to make their own . All while those hundreds of thousands of babies are chopped apart and killed in charnel houses in bad neighborhoods in cities across the fruited plain .
So can anyone blame legislators in Alabama for saying “ Not here , not one minute more ” ?
If not now , when ? If not a full abortion ban to test the shaky foundations of Roe v. Wade , what ?
Clyde Chambliss , the state senator who carried the Alabama bill , says it ’ s intended to create the constitutional fight :
The way that this bill is drafted — it goes to ask the question of personhood . The 14th Amendment gives people , a person the right to life , liberty and property . But it doesn ’ t say when a person becomes a person . Obviously , if somebody is walking around , we know that ’ s a person . In the womb , do we know if that is a person or not ? Unborn babies can hear , they can feel — at what point can they hear and feel and think and feel pain ? We need some guidance from the Supreme Court . So this bill has been drafted so that it goes directly to that question . It goes to the Supreme Court , hopefully . And we do expect it to be ruled unconstitutional at the lower court . It has to be . It has no choice because they have to follow Supreme Court precedent . That ’ s no surprise . We know that ’ s going to happen . We know that will be found unconstitutional on appeal , but hopefully , we ’ ll have the Supreme Court to take up the matter . And we hope and we feel that the Supreme Court will rule this law constitutional because it gets to that personhood issue that is so , so important .
Chambliss and Rep. Terri Collins , the bill author on the Alabama House side , are very clear that the intellectual basis of the bill is the personhood of the fetus . That ’ s why the Alabama bill struck out exceptions for rape and incest — as Collins asked , “ Well , how do we say , ‘ The baby inside is a person unless they ’ re conceived in rape or incest ’ ? If that amendment was to get on the bill , ” she said , “ then I ’ ll kill the bill because it won ’ t go to the Supreme Court . It will contradict itself . ”
If you believe that ’ s a human being in there , you can ’ t kill it . That ’ s the essence of the Alabama bill . It ’ s the essence of the pro-life movement . And if you agree with that proposition you can not also agree that waiting for more favorable political circumstances is preferable to taking every opportunity to pick the fight .
Politically , the Alabama bill might not be the right idea . Politically , stoking the Left ’ s outrage and stirring up its voters in advance of 2020 might be a risky move . But if politics is all that matters , what ’ s the point ? At what point do politicians make so many promises they ’ ll never keep that the voters stop even bothering ? And how does the Overton Window move in a positive direction without direct action to move it ?
Nobody cautioned New York that its hyperaggressive pro-abort legislation would gin up pro-life voters across the country , though clearly given the counterattack from the pro-life movement in the red states that ’ s precisely what happened . But now we have the landed political gentry in Washington telling the redneck rubes of their mistakes — Republicans , you see , must never actually follow through and make their rhetoric a reality for fear of what the other side will do .
Balderdash . There is no point in holding an actionable political majority unless one uses it to bend policy to that majority ’ s will . Assuming that a pro-life policy agenda is better for the people of Alabama , an assumption which our conservative betters don ’ t even challenge , fiddling about while hundreds of thousands of innocent lives are snuffed out essentially to preserve sex as a method of entertainment is hardly a laudable stance . Those same wise masters , after all , are responsible for squandering the House GOP majority in 2018 largely due to an inability to pass the agenda the voters sent them to Washington to make a reality .
Is the Supreme Court ready to overturn Roe v. Wade ? There isn ’ t much reason for confidence . That said , the Alabama bill cuts to the heart of that decision ’ s weakness . National Review ’ s David French last week recounted a conversation he had with Ed Setzler , the author of Georgia ’ s heartbeat bill , in which the state representative noted that Roe ’ s own language identifies its demise :
Specifically , he pointed at a provision in Part IX of Justice Blackmun ’ s opinion , where Blackmun states that if the “ personhood ” of the baby is established , then the pro-abortion case “ collapses. ” The late Supreme Court justice was of course discussing the definition of personhood under the federal constitution . Setzler , however , notes that Supreme Court doctrine has long allowed states to expand constitutional liberties . They can establish standards of religious freedom , free speech , or due process , for example , that go beyond the First and Fifth Amendments . They can not be more restrictive than the federal Constitution . In the abortion context , this doctrine traditionally has been interpreted to allow states like New York to protect abortion rights beyond the minimal threshold required by Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey . Georgia ( and potentially Alabama ) would be asking the Court to permit them to expand the constitutional liberty of the unborn child and to recognize the distinct human identity of the baby in the womb . In other words , Georgia and Alabama are saying : “ We ’ ve read Roe , and we ’ re making the very legal statement that Justice Blackmun says would fundamentally undermine the case for abortion . Under our federal system , we can expand the legal definition of life. ” While pro-life Americans can and do engage in good-faith debates about tactics , I prefer the most direct approach . Tell the Court what life means . Make the Court break the federal system once again .
Again — it ’ s possible that the bills in Alabama , Georgia , Mississippi , Ohio , Missouri , and Louisiana , among other states , which directly challenge the status quo will risk the current political drift toward the pro-life cause . But political capital is built on victory , not inaction , and it ’ s wasted if it ’ s not spent . After all , the Left paid a dear price for Obamacare — but elements of it are still in place despite Trump ’ s victory and rather than being destroyed for mutilating private health insurance Democrats once again control the House .
Given that reality , there is no reason not to take a shot at stopping the killing . Kudos to those state legislators willing to risk their political futures .

The Republican-led Senate voted 19-14 along party lines to override Democratic Gov . Mike Beebe 's veto of the 20-week bill , a day after the GOP-led state House voted to override it . A simple majority was required in each chamber .
That law , which took effect immediately , is based on the contested claim that fetuses can feel pain by that point .
Senate President Michael Lamoureux , R-Russellville , supported an override but told reporters afterward he was unsure whether the ban would survive a constitutional challenge .
`` If it was an easy answer , then people would n't be raising that subject , '' he said after the vote .
Minutes after overriding Beebe 's veto , the Senate 's voted 26-8 in support of a bill that would outlaw most abortions starting in the 12th week of pregnancy , sending it to Beebe for consideration . He must decide by next week whether to sign or veto it .
The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas has already said it would challenge either the 20-week or 12-week bills if they became law , and opponents of the legislation were expected to seek an injunction barring enforcement of the new restrictions pending the outcome of the expected legal challenge .
Beebe said he thinks the new law contradicts the U.S. Supreme Court 's 1976 Roe v. Wade decision , which legalized abortion until a fetus can viably survive outside of the womb , which is typically at 22 to 24 weeks . He said the state will waste money trying to defend it .
Sen. Bruce Maloch , D-Magnolia , previously voted for the 20-week ban but said he voted against the override out of deference to Beebe and the concerns the governor raised over the measure 's constitutionality .
`` These bills are a real dilemma for people who are pro-life , but still there are constitutional concerns . It does really tear at you , '' Maloch said .
The near ban of abortions starting in the 20th week of pregnancy is based on the disputed claim that a fetus can feel pain by then and therefore deserves protection from abortion . Seven states have enacted similar 20-week restrictions based on the fetal pain argument , according to the Guttmacher Institute , which tracks laws affecting women 's health . A similar law in Arizona has been blocked while a federal appeals court reviews a lawsuit challenging it .
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says it knows of no legitimate scientific information supporting the idea that a fetus experiences pain .
The 12-week bill is based on the argument that a fetus should be protected from abortion once its heartbeat can be detected during an abdominal ultrasound . The governor has not said whether he 'll veto the bill but said earlier that he has constitutional concerns with the measure .
Sen. Jason Rapert , R-Conway , the sponsor of the 12-week ban , said Beebe should let the measure go into law without his signature .
`` I respect his opinions and what he has to do as an individual , but I believe he should honor the vote of the Legislature , '' Rapert told reporters after the vote .","The Arkansas Senate voted Thursday to override a veto of a near-ban of abortions starting in the 20th week of pregnancy and backed a separate measure that would outlaw the procedures in most cases beginning in the 12th week.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas has already said it would challenge either the 20-week or 12-week bills if they became law, and opponents of the legislation were expected to seek an injunction barring enforcement of the new restrictions pending the outcome of the expected legal challenge.

Beebe said he thinks the new law contradicts the U.S. Supreme Court's 1976 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion until a fetus can viably survive outside of the womb, which is typically at 22 to 24 weeks. He said the state will waste money trying to defend it.

Sen. Bruce Maloch, D-Magnolia, previously voted for the 20-week ban but said he voted against the override out of deference to Beebe and the concerns the governor raised over the measure's constitutionality.

""These bills are a real dilemma for people who are pro-life, but still there are constitutional concerns. It does really tear at you,"" Maloch said.

The near ban of abortions starting in the 20th week of pregnancy is based on the disputed claim that a fetus can feel pain by then and therefore deserves protection from abortion. Seven states have enacted similar 20-week restrictions based on the fetal pain argument, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks laws affecting women's health. A similar law in Arizona has been blocked while a federal appeals court reviews a lawsuit challenging it.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says it knows of no legitimate scientific information supporting the idea that a fetus experiences pain.

The 12-week bill is based on the argument that a fetus should be protected from abortion once its heartbeat can be detected during an abdominal ultrasound. The governor has not said whether he'll veto the bill but said earlier that he has constitutional concerns with the measure.

Sen. Jason Rapert, R-Conway, the sponsor of the 12-week ban, said Beebe should let the measure go into law without his signature.

""I respect his opinions and what he has to do as an individual, but I believe he should honor the vote of the Legislature,"" Rapert told reporters after the vote.",www.foxnews.com,right,pso4Y97Hl6Xs2jku

Missouri's Senate has passed a bill that would ban abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy or later, except in cases of medical emergency. There are no exceptions for rape or incest.

It's the latest in a series of sweeping abortion restrictions passed by Republican-controlled state legislatures aimed at pushing abortion challenges to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The measure, which saw a series of changes before passing, will now return to the state House. If approved there, it would head to the desk of Republican Gov. Mike Parson.

""Thanks to the leaders in the House and Senate, we have the opportunity to be one of the strongest pro-life states in the country,"" Parson said on Wednesday.

The bill passed the Senate early Thursday morning by a 24-10 vote, as NPR member station St. Louis Public Radio reported.

The text states that performing abortions in violation of the measure would be considered a felony. The legislation states that ""any person who knowingly performs or induces an abortion of an unborn child in violation of this subsection shall be guilty of a class B felony, as well as subject to suspension or revocation of his or her professional license."" Women who undergo abortions would not be prosecuted.

In addition to having no exceptions for rape or incest, the bill also bans all abortions because of race, sex or a diagnosis of Down syndrome.

As St. Louis Public Radio reported, Democrats succeeded in changing a provision that would have required in most cases that the second parent be notified before a minor has an abortion. ""Now, that second-parent notification only applies to the 'parent of a minor who has been awarded joint legal custody or joint physical custody' by a court,"" the member station writes.

A previous version of the bill also would have prohibited abortions after heartbeat activity could be detected — which is about six weeks into a pregnancy.

The Missouri Senate vote comes less than 24 hours after Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed into law what is considered the most restrictive abortion law in the U.S. It bans nearly all abortions, at any stage of pregnancy. The only exceptions are when a woman's life is threatened or if there is a lethal fetal anomaly.

Georgia, Mississippi, Kentucky and Ohio have also recently passed laws banning abortion after heartbeat activity is detected.

Prior to the Missouri vote, Republican state Sen. Bob Onder said, ""The time for negotiations is over. Every provision of the Missouri Stands for the Unborn Act ... is a provision that would protect innocent human life, protect pregnancy care centers and ensure that they get the resources they need to perform their valuable mission, and measures to protect the health and safety of Missouri women.""

abortion,The Hill,1,http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/390325-delayed-abortion-case-fuels-intrigue-at-supreme-court,Delayed abortion case fuels intrigue at Supreme Court,2018-06-03,,"After weeks of delay , the Supreme Court is expected to make a decision soon on an unusual request from the Trump administration in a politically charged abortion case .
In early November , Solicitor General Noel Francisco asked the court to toss out a D.C . Circuit Court of Appeals order that allowed an unaccompanied immigrant teen in federal custody to obtain an abortion . But in a twist , the solicitor general has also asked the court to punish the opposing attorneys at the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) .
Francisco argued the 17-year-old ’ s lawyers improperly snuck her off in the early morning hours — 4:15 a.m. — to get an abortion before the government could appeal the decision to the Supreme Court .
The request has been pending before the justices for months , which could signal there ’ s a fight happening behind the scenes , experts say .
“ It ’ s quite possible that the request has provoked dueling opinions from across the bench that are not just dueling in substance , but whether the Supreme Court should be addressing it in the first place , ” said Steve Vladeck , a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law , who argued a case before the justices earlier in the term .
The justices have relisted the case for consideration at conference 15 different times .
Daniel Epps , an associate professor of law at Washington University School of Law , said it ’ s strange that the court is taking a long time to decide on a fairly simple petition .
In Texas , where the teen was being held , state law requires that women receive counseling at least 24 hours before obtaining an abortion and that the counseling be done by the same doctor who will perform the procedure .
But the government says it was misled about the timing of the counseling and abortion appointments for the minor , referred to in court as Jane Doe . The government thought the teen was getting counseled at 7:30 a.m. on Oct. 25 and therefore would not have the procedure until Oct. 26 .

A decision from the Supreme Court could come on Monday .","After weeks of delay, the Supreme Court is expected to make a decision soon on an unusual request from the Trump administration in a politically charged abortion case.

In early November, Solicitor General Noel Francisco asked the court to toss out a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals order that allowed an unaccompanied immigrant teen in federal custody to obtain an abortion. But in a twist, the solicitor general has also asked the court to punish the opposing attorneys at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).

Francisco argued the 17-year-old’s lawyers improperly snuck her off in the early morning hours — 4:15 a.m. — to get an abortion before the government could appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.

The request has been pending before the justices for months, which could signal there’s a fight happening behind the scenes, experts say.

“It’s quite possible that the request has provoked dueling opinions from across the bench that are not just dueling in substance, but whether the Supreme Court should be addressing it in the first place,” said Steve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, who argued a case before the justices earlier in the term.

The justices have relisted the case for consideration at conference 15 different times.

Daniel Epps, an associate professor of law at Washington University School of Law, said it’s strange that the court is taking a long time to decide on a fairly simple petition.

“This is getting pretty weird,” Epps said.

In Texas, where the teen was being held, state law requires that women receive counseling at least 24 hours before obtaining an abortion and that the counseling be done by the same doctor who will perform the procedure.

But the government says it was misled about the timing of the counseling and abortion appointments for the minor, referred to in court as Jane Doe. The government thought the teen was getting counseled at 7:30 a.m. on Oct. 25 and therefore would not have the procedure until Oct. 26.

But when the same doctor that had already counseled Doe on Oct. 19 became available on Oct. 25, her counseling appointment changed to an appointment for an abortion and was moved to an earlier time without the government being told.

Francisco claims the court’s order requiring the government to make Doe available for pre-abortion counseling and the procedure is moot, given that Doe had the abortion. The government had originally kept Doe from leaving the facility for her appointments, arguing it should not be forced to facilitate an abortion that is not medically necessary for an unaccompanied minor who entered the country illegally and was in federal custody.

“Illegal aliens do not have a right to have an abortion in the United States,” the group’s attorney, Andrew Schlafly, argued in the brief. “Yet the decision below implicitly and improperly invented such a new right where none exists.”

In addition to admonishing the ACLU attorneys, Francisco has asked the court to remand the case back to the lower court with instructions to dismiss all claims for prospective relief regarding pregnant unaccompanied minors.

Doe has filed a class-action lawsuit in the federal district court challenging the government’s policy of blocking unaccompanied children from obtaining an abortion. That challenge brought with another teen, known as Jane Roe, is on behalf of all pregnant immigrant minors in federal custody.

That case is currently making its way through the courts.

Brigitte Amiri, Doe’s attorney and deputy director of the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project, said it would be extraordinary if the court granted the relief Francisco has asked for. She said there’s no basis for his request.

“I think the petition is really out of bounds in what it’s asking of the court and the allegations of misconduct it alleges against myself and my colleagues,” she said.

Amiri and the ACLU attorneys in the case argued in briefs that an order should only be vacated if it would block an opposing party from filing an appeal in future litigation. Since it doesn't in this case, Amiri said, the ruling should be left in place.

In a wide-ranging interview Friday with CNN Special Correspondent Jamie Gangel , the former Florida governor talked about his campaign beyond New Hampshire , but also said he plans to support the Republican nominee -- even if that 's Donald Trump .
`` I will support the Republican nominee no matter who he or she is , '' Bush said when asked about Trump . `` I 've done it my whole entire life . I 've signed a pledge to do it . I 'll do it . ''
Late last year , after Bush began launching an aggressive attack strategy against Trump , the former governor 's aides began looking into the possibility of Bush not backing Trump should he become the nominee . Lately , Bush tends to say definitively that Trump wo n't be the party 's pick and avoids answering the hypothetical .
But on Friday , he said he would support the eventual nominee , but stressed he does n't think Trump would win in the general election .
`` I want to win , though . I want the Republican Party 's candidate to win . I want a conservative to serve in the White House , '' Bush said . `` I believe I 'm best qualified and that 's why I 'm fighting for this . ''
JUST WATCHED Barbara Bush : I 'm sick of Donald Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Barbara Bush : I 'm sick of Donald Trump 01:08
That pledge of party loyalty also extends to Rubio , he said , though Bush and his allies continue to train their fire on the first-term senator , whose third place finish in Iowa ignited a new round of momentum for his campaign .
Since Iowa , where Bush placed sixth , Bush has been traveling across New Hampshire , diligently trying to compare Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz to another first-term senator that ran for president eight years ago : Barack Obama .
Bush said Friday that Rubio is `` charismatic '' but not a `` leader . '' His campaign released a TV ad that included footage of former Sen. Rick Santorum , who ended his campaign this week and backed Rubio but failed to name an accomplishment of Rubio 's in the Senate .
Asked if Bush 's attacks against Rubio will hurt the `` establishment '' lane in the Republican race , as some critics have argued , Bush argued that politics is a contact sport .
`` He 's attacking me , '' Bush said . `` So does that count , or is this just only a one-way street ? Is this the child of privilege that has a free pass , whenever everybody else has to fight for it ? This is n't bean bag , you know . This is politics . Every campaign , every candidate will be contrasted and compared . Their records needs to be shown . ''
New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie has also been going after Rubio this week , raising questions about Rubio 's position on abortion . Rubio believes in exceptions to abortion only in cases where the mother 's life is threatened , not for rape or incest . He has indicated , though , that as president he would sign legislation banning abortion if it had broader exceptions .

This is the long haul . ''","Concord, New Hampshire (CNN) Jeb Bush is sharpening his attacks against rival Marco Rubio in the final few days before the New Hampshire primary, raising questions about the Florida senator's position on abortion and characterizing him as an untested, political showman.

In a wide-ranging interview Friday with CNN Special Correspondent Jamie Gangel, the former Florida governor talked about his campaign beyond New Hampshire, but also said he plans to support the Republican nominee -- even if that's Donald Trump.

""I will support the Republican nominee no matter who he or she is,"" Bush said when asked about Trump. ""I've done it my whole entire life. I've signed a pledge to do it. I'll do it.""

Late last year, after Bush began launching an aggressive attack strategy against Trump, the former governor's aides began looking into the possibility of Bush not backing Trump should he become the nominee. Lately, Bush tends to say definitively that Trump won't be the party's pick and avoids answering the hypothetical.

But on Friday, he said he would support the eventual nominee, but stressed he doesn't think Trump would win in the general election.

""I want to win, though. I want the Republican Party's candidate to win. I want a conservative to serve in the White House,"" Bush said. ""I believe I'm best qualified and that's why I'm fighting for this.""

That pledge of party loyalty also extends to Rubio, he said, though Bush and his allies continue to train their fire on the first-term senator, whose third place finish in Iowa ignited a new round of momentum for his campaign.

Since Iowa, where Bush placed sixth, Bush has been traveling across New Hampshire, diligently trying to compare Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz to another first-term senator that ran for president eight years ago: Barack Obama.

Bush said Friday that Rubio is ""charismatic"" but not a ""leader."" His campaign released a TV ad that included footage of former Sen. Rick Santorum, who ended his campaign this week and backed Rubio but failed to name an accomplishment of Rubio's in the Senate.

Asked if Bush's attacks against Rubio will hurt the ""establishment"" lane in the Republican race, as some critics have argued, Bush argued that politics is a contact sport.

""He's attacking me,"" Bush said. ""So does that count, or is this just only a one-way street? Is this the child of privilege that has a free pass, whenever everybody else has to fight for it? This isn't bean bag, you know. This is politics. Every campaign, every candidate will be contrasted and compared. Their records needs to be shown.""

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has also been going after Rubio this week , raising questions about Rubio's position on abortion. Rubio believes in exceptions to abortion only in cases where the mother's life is threatened, not for rape or incest. He has indicated, though, that as president he would sign legislation banning abortion if it had broader exceptions.

Bush, who considers himself the most pro-life candidate, believes in all three exceptions. Asked if Rubio's position is too extreme, Bush said he ""respects"" it but thinks it won't resonate with large swaths of voters.

""Politically, it's a tough sell to tell a pro-life mother -- had her daughter been raped -- that she would just have to accept that as a sad fact,"" he said. ""This is not an easy decision, but Marco will have to explain that position.""

On March 2 , the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Whole Women 's Health v. Hellerstadt , a challenge to a Texas law that has closed about half of the state 's abortion clinics since 2013 .
If the law is allowed to stand , abortion rights supporters say it would close all but about 10 of Texas 's abortion clinics . Advocates on both sides of the abortion issue say this case could be the most important decision on abortion in 25 years .
Scalia has been a staunch opponent of abortion rights , and critical of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1972 , which established a constitutional right to abortion . `` You want a right to abortion ? There 's nothing in the Constitution about that , '' Scalia said in a 2011 interview .
Scalia was a near-certain vote in favor of upholding the Texas law . Without him , things get a bit more complicated . But the key thing to know is this : Without Scalia , its very hard to see a world where the Supreme Court affirms the Texas law 's constitutionality .
Here 's why : There are almost certainly four votes against the law from the Court 's liberal wing . And it 's possible there are five votes , as justice Anthony Kennedy has been a swing vote on abortion cases . A 5-3 decision would be the best case for abortion rights supporters , as it would repeal the Texas law and prevent other states from passing similar restrictions .
The best case outcome for the abortion rights opponents , meanwhile , is a 4-4 tie . In that case , Supreme Court rules say that the decision of the circuit court is left in place without setting any constitutional precedent .
In that case , this would let the Texas law stand , since the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the restriction . That would be far from an ideal outcome for the law 's challengers and would leave abortion access greatly restricted in Texas .
But it also would n't give other states the clear signal that these types of restrictions are constitutional — something that abortion opponents would very much like to see .
Texas law would leave 900,000 women more than 150 miles from an abortion clinic
The case , Whole Woman 's Health v. Hellerstedt , was brought by Texas abortion providers challenging Texas 's House Bill 2 , which the legislature enacted into law in July 2013 .
That bill has two main restrictions , both of which the clinics challenge in this case . One was a requirement that all abortion clinics have admitting privileges at local hospitals . That piece of HB2 went into effect in September 2013 , and forced 14 clinics that could not obtain admitting privileges to close .
HB2 also requires abortion clinics to become ambulatory surgical centers , essentially mini emergency rooms that can handle complex medical situations . Ambulatory surgical centers , for example , must have wide enough hallways to fit a gurney and larger operating rooms than abortion clinics typically use .
Abortion clinics in Texas have said that upgrading to these new standards would cost upward of $ 1 million . They have argued that the new requirements are unnecessary , as abortions tend to have a very low complication risk . Approximately 0.05 percent of first-trimester abortions have complications that require hospital care .
Texas clinics have said because these upgrades are so costly , many facilities would close . Their lawyers previous stated that about 900,000 of Texas 's 4.5 million reproductive-age women would live more than 150 miles from a clinic if HB2 stands .
The key legal question : Is the Texas law a substantial obstacle to abortion access ?
The Supreme Court has , in previous rulings , articulated standards for judging the constitutionality of abortion restrictions like these . And one key standard the justices have settled on is whether a restriction places an `` undue burden '' on women seeking to terminate a pregnancy .
The Supreme Court has previously defined an undue burden as a law with the `` purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus . '' The Supreme Court has previously ruled that laws requiring women to notify their spouses of their abortion , for example , are an undue burden , as it could make it impossible for some women to access the procedure .
The Texas law requires abortion clinics to become mini emergency rooms
The Texas clinics argue that HB2 ought to fit the `` undue burden '' definition : Because it would force most Texas abortion clinics to close , it would become the type of `` substantial obstacle '' that the Supreme Court has previously found to be unconstitutional .
If the Texas law stands , the clinics argue , `` every woman in Texas would have to live under a legal regime that fails to respect her equal citizenship status and would force her to grapple with unnecessary and substantial obstacles as a condition of exercising her protected liberty . ''
Texas : No evidence that women would be turned away from clinics
Texas has defended its new restrictions as not placing a substantial burden on those seeking abortions . As evidence , it points to the fact that the admitting privileges portion of the law has been in effect for more than a year , forcing 14 clinics to close . The clinics , they pointed out , presented no evidence of women who wanted to obtain an abortion not being able to do so .
The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals used that argument to uphold the law in October .
`` Demand for abortion services in Texas may decrease in the future , as it has done nationally over the past several years , '' the Fifth Circuit ruled . `` The record lacks evidence that the previous closures ... have caused women to be turned away from clinics . Without any evidence ... plaintiffs do not appear to ... show that the ambulatory surgical center provision will result in insufficient clinic capacity . ''
The Fifth Circuit continued that `` the evidence does not indicate , without specificity , that by requiring all abortion clinics to meet the standards of ambulatory surgical centers , the overall costs of accessing an abortion provider will likely increase . ''
Texas has also challenged the clinics ' argument that the new restrictions are unnecessary because abortion is generally a safe procedure , saying it 's not the place of the courts to second-guess the possible outcome of the law .
Abortion rights supporters have pointed to new research that suggests the state was wrong on this . According to the Texas Policy Evaluation Project , major Texas cities have seen significant increases in wait times at abortion clinics . In Dallas , where the average wait time for an abortion was five days prior to HB2 , women may now wait as long as 20 days .","The unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia comes less than a month before the Supreme Court hears its biggest abortion case in a decade.

On March 2, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Whole Women's Health v. Hellerstadt, a challenge to a Texas law that has closed about half of the state's abortion clinics since 2013.

If the law is allowed to stand, abortion rights supporters say it would close all but about 10 of Texas's abortion clinics. Advocates on both sides of the abortion issue say this case could be the most important decision on abortion in 25 years.

Scalia has been a staunch opponent of abortion rights, and critical of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1972, which established a constitutional right to abortion. ""You want a right to abortion? There's nothing in the Constitution about that,"" Scalia said in a 2011 interview.

Scalia was a near-certain vote in favor of upholding the Texas law. Without him, things get a bit more complicated. But the key thing to know is this: Without Scalia, its very hard to see a world where the Supreme Court affirms the Texas law's constitutionality.

Here's why: There are almost certainly four votes against the law from the Court's liberal wing. And it's possible there are five votes, as justice Anthony Kennedy has been a swing vote on abortion cases. A 5-3 decision would be the best case for abortion rights supporters, as it would repeal the Texas law and prevent other states from passing similar restrictions.

The best case outcome for the abortion rights opponents, meanwhile, is a 4-4 tie. In that case, Supreme Court rules say that the decision of the circuit court is left in place without setting any constitutional precedent.

In that case, this would let the Texas law stand, since the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the restriction. That would be far from an ideal outcome for the law's challengers and would leave abortion access greatly restricted in Texas.

But it also wouldn't give other states the clear signal that these types of restrictions are constitutional — something that abortion opponents would very much like to see.

Texas law would leave 900,000 women more than 150 miles from an abortion clinic

The case, Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, was brought by Texas abortion providers challenging Texas's House Bill 2, which the legislature enacted into law in July 2013.

That bill has two main restrictions, both of which the clinics challenge in this case. One was a requirement that all abortion clinics have admitting privileges at local hospitals. That piece of HB2 went into effect in September 2013, and forced 14 clinics that could not obtain admitting privileges to close.

HB2 also requires abortion clinics to become ambulatory surgical centers, essentially mini emergency rooms that can handle complex medical situations. Ambulatory surgical centers, for example, must have wide enough hallways to fit a gurney and larger operating rooms than abortion clinics typically use.

Abortion clinics in Texas have said that upgrading to these new standards would cost upward of $1 million. They have argued that the new requirements are unnecessary, as abortions tend to have a very low complication risk. Approximately 0.05 percent of first-trimester abortions have complications that require hospital care.

Texas clinics have said because these upgrades are so costly, many facilities would close. Their lawyers previous stated that about 900,000 of Texas's 4.5 million reproductive-age women would live more than 150 miles from a clinic if HB2 stands.

The key legal question: Is the Texas law a substantial obstacle to abortion access?

The Supreme Court has, in previous rulings, articulated standards for judging the constitutionality of abortion restrictions like these. And one key standard the justices have settled on is whether a restriction places an ""undue burden"" on women seeking to terminate a pregnancy.

The Supreme Court has previously defined an undue burden as a law with the ""purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus."" The Supreme Court has previously ruled that laws requiring women to notify their spouses of their abortion, for example, are an undue burden, as it could make it impossible for some women to access the procedure.

The Texas law requires abortion clinics to become mini emergency rooms

The Texas clinics argue that HB2 ought to fit the ""undue burden"" definition: Because it would force most Texas abortion clinics to close, it would become the type of ""substantial obstacle"" that the Supreme Court has previously found to be unconstitutional.

If the Texas law stands, the clinics argue, ""every woman in Texas would have to live under a legal regime that fails to respect her equal citizenship status and would force her to grapple with unnecessary and substantial obstacles as a condition of exercising her protected liberty.""

Texas: No evidence that women would be turned away from clinics

Texas has defended its new restrictions as not placing a substantial burden on those seeking abortions. As evidence, it points to the fact that the admitting privileges portion of the law has been in effect for more than a year, forcing 14 clinics to close. The clinics, they pointed out, presented no evidence of women who wanted to obtain an abortion not being able to do so.

The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals used that argument to uphold the law in October.

""Demand for abortion services in Texas may decrease in the future, as it has done nationally over the past several years,"" the Fifth Circuit ruled. ""The record lacks evidence that the previous closures ... have caused women to be turned away from clinics. Without any evidence ... plaintiffs do not appear to ... show that the ambulatory surgical center provision will result in insufficient clinic capacity.""

The Fifth Circuit continued that ""the evidence does not indicate, without specificity, that by requiring all abortion clinics to meet the standards of ambulatory surgical centers, the overall costs of accessing an abortion provider will likely increase.""

Texas has also challenged the clinics' argument that the new restrictions are unnecessary because abortion is generally a safe procedure, saying it's not the place of the courts to second-guess the possible outcome of the law.

Abortion rights supporters have pointed to new research that suggests the state was wrong on this. According to the Texas Policy Evaluation Project, major Texas cities have seen significant increases in wait times at abortion clinics. In Dallas, where the average wait time for an abortion was five days prior to HB2, women may now wait as long as 20 days.",www.vox.com,left,3z6sGrMuw6k5MJaN

Its fate will be decided this week.,2019-10-28,"Anna North, Constance Grady, Sean Collins, Sigal Samuel, Aja Romano, David Roberts, Umair Irfan","The last abortion clinic in Missouri is battling for its existence .
Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis region has been operating for 46 years , serving thousands of patients annually for STI testing , cancer screenings , and abortions . But it might have to stop offering abortion care thanks to a months-long dispute with state regulators .
The controversy started after an audit earlier this year , when officials say they found “ deficient practices ” at the clinic . While they haven ’ t been very specific about what those practices are , officials requested interviews with doctors working at the clinic . Some of the doctors agreed , but others did not , possibly fearing that the state would launch criminal proceedings against them . Meanwhile , officials said that if they couldn ’ t interview all the doctors , they would revoke the clinic ’ s license to perform abortions .
Beginning Monday , representatives from the clinic and the state will testify at a weeklong series of hearings to determine if the facility can keep its license . If the clinic loses , Missouri residents — including more than a million people who can become pregnant — will have to travel across state lines if they want to end a pregnancy . Advocates say this will increase the already significant obstacles that patients — who are disproportionately low-income — face when trying to get the procedure .
The outcome of the hearing could also signal the end of an era in abortion access : if Missouri loses its clinic , it will become the first state with no provider since Roe v. Wade , the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that established the right to an abortion in America .
While near-total bans on abortion grabbed headlines earlier this year , states have also been engaged in quieter , more incremental efforts to restrict abortion . Some , including Missouri , have passed restrictions on abortion doctors , laws similar to one in Louisiana that will go before the Supreme Court this term . But Planned Parenthood says it is also using the clinic licensing process as a roundabout way of shutting the clinic down . If the facility has to stop providing abortions , advocates say , it could be the biggest success yet for the strategy of eliminating access without banning the procedure outright .
“ It is the moment that we have long been warning about , ” Bonyen Lee-Gilmore , director of state media campaigns at Planned Parenthood Federation of America , told ███ : “ the day that abortion access is eliminated without ever overturning Roe . ”
State regulators say they have concerns about the clinic . It ’ s not clear what the concerns are .
The clinic that is now Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region was founded in 1973 , the year Roe was decided . Planned Parenthood bought the facility in 1996 . Over the years , the clinic has been inspected a number of times , and inspectors were always collegial and professional , Dr. David Eisenberg , the clinic ’ s former medical director who still provides abortions and other care there , told ███ . But things started to change after the appointment of a new director , Dr. Randall Williams , to lead the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services in 2017 .
Williams , an OB-GYN , was appointed by former Missouri Gov . Eric Greitens , a Republican , and has spoken little publicly about his position on abortion . In an interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch earlier this year , he said only , “ Abortion is legal in Missouri , and I want it to be safe . ”
But soon after his appointment , Eisenberg said , state regulators essentially started saying , “ We have reinterpreted the rules and regulations and found what you do to no longer be compliant. ” ( The health department has not yet responded to ███ ’ s request for comment . )
The department conducted an audit of the clinic in March , and said it had found “ deficient practices , ” according to Planned Parenthood , but it didn ’ t clarify what practices it found deficient . In a statement in June , the department said it was “ reviewing incidents with significant medical evidence which point to troubling instances and deviations from the standard care , resulting in serious patient harm . ”
To further investigate the deficiencies , the health department said it needed to interview all the doctors who practice at the clinic . The two doctors who are Planned Parenthood employees agreed to the interviews — but others , who were medical residents affiliated with a St. Louis hospital , did not do so .
The state said the results of the interviews could include “ board review ” or “ criminal proceedings , ” a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood said earlier this year . And Planned Parenthood said it could not force the residents to sit for interviews because they were not employees , according to the Kansas City Star .
The clinic was threatened with closure at the end of May , when its license was scheduled to expire and the health department declined to renew it . But a judge issued a preliminary injunction allowing the clinic to stay open .
Since then , the case has been referred to the state ’ s Administrative Hearing Commission , which handles disputes between state agencies and private individuals or groups . The commission will hold all-day hearings in the case this Monday through Friday .
It ’ s not clear when the commission will issue a decision , but the process could take months , Gilmore said .
Planned Parenthood says the state ’ s goal is simple : shut the clinic down
Throughout the process , the state has maintained that there are safety issues at the clinic . According to the statement issued by the health department in June , officials are “ concerned by the refusal of physicians to provide explanations for the deeply troubling instances of patient care and conduct under investigation . ”
Details about the department ’ s concerns have been difficult to obtain — the statement of deficiencies was not made public . But a conference call between state officials and anti-abortion activists in May suggests that the state wanted to investigate “ failed ” abortions , in which a patient remained pregnant , and the number of ambulance visits to the clinic , according to the Kansas City Star .
Planned Parenthood , meanwhile , says the concerns about patient care are essentially a ruse , and the state ’ s real goal is simply to shut down the clinic . “ The state of Missouri has waged political theater in order to ban abortion , ” Gilmore said .
The organization points to the May conference call between Steele Shippy , then-communications director for Missouri Gov . Mike Parson , a Republican , and Republican legislators and anti-abortion activists . The email invitation to the call ended with the phrase “ # shutthemdown , ” the Kansas City Star reported .
On the call , Shippy said that media would ask whether the state ’ s goal was to shut the clinic down . “ While some of us , yes , it ’ s a main goal , but it also should be our main goal to protect the health and safety of women , ” Shippy said .
The governor ’ s office declined to comment to ███ for this story . Shippy , who is now Parson ’ s campaign manager in his reelection campaign , has said that the call was nor arranged by the governor ’ s office . He is scheduled to testify at the hearings this week .
The closure of the clinic would mark a new era for abortion in America
Ahead of the hearings , Planned Parenthood said the stakes could not be higher . Even with the clinic open , “ there ’ s over a million women ” of reproductive age “ in the state of Missouri with one freestanding health center providing abortion care , ” Eisenberg said . If the clinic no longer provides abortions , any of those people facing an unwanted pregnancy would have to go to another state for care .
The majority of people seeking abortions in America are low-income , which means that traveling added distances can be a real financial hardship , especially if it means extra time off work . Last week , Planned Parenthood opened a new clinic just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis , in Illinois , which could see Missourians if the Missouri clinic can not . But other neighboring states , like Iowa , Kentucky , and Kansas , are restricting abortion access , not expanding it .
Meanwhile , the battle with state regulators is already having an effect , according to Eisenberg . “ There ’ s a lot of confusion , ” he said . “ People think that abortion ’ s no longer available , when it is . ”

But , he said , the situation in Missouri should also galvanize activism around abortion rights : “ for anyone who cares about the rights of people who can become pregnant in this country , now is the time to get up and fight back . ”","The last abortion clinic in Missouri is battling for its existence.

Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis region has been operating for 46 years, serving thousands of patients annually for STI testing, cancer screenings, and abortions. But it might have to stop offering abortion care thanks to a months-long dispute with state regulators.

The controversy started after an audit earlier this year, when officials say they found “deficient practices” at the clinic. While they haven’t been very specific about what those practices are, officials requested interviews with doctors working at the clinic. Some of the doctors agreed, but others did not, possibly fearing that the state would launch criminal proceedings against them. Meanwhile, officials said that if they couldn’t interview all the doctors, they would revoke the clinic’s license to perform abortions.

Beginning Monday, representatives from the clinic and the state will testify at a weeklong series of hearings to determine if the facility can keep its license. If the clinic loses, Missouri residents — including more than a million people who can become pregnant — will have to travel across state lines if they want to end a pregnancy. Advocates say this will increase the already significant obstacles that patients — who are disproportionately low-income — face when trying to get the procedure.

The outcome of the hearing could also signal the end of an era in abortion access: if Missouri loses its clinic, it will become the first state with no provider since Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that established the right to an abortion in America.

While near-total bans on abortion grabbed headlines earlier this year, states have also been engaged in quieter, more incremental efforts to restrict abortion. Some, including Missouri, have passed restrictions on abortion doctors, laws similar to one in Louisiana that will go before the Supreme Court this term. But Planned Parenthood says it is also using the clinic licensing process as a roundabout way of shutting the clinic down. If the facility has to stop providing abortions, advocates say, it could be the biggest success yet for the strategy of eliminating access without banning the procedure outright.

“It is the moment that we have long been warning about,” Bonyen Lee-Gilmore, director of state media campaigns at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told Vox: “the day that abortion access is eliminated without ever overturning Roe.”

State regulators say they have concerns about the clinic. It’s not clear what the concerns are.

The clinic that is now Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region was founded in 1973, the year Roe was decided. Planned Parenthood bought the facility in 1996. Over the years, the clinic has been inspected a number of times, and inspectors were always collegial and professional, Dr. David Eisenberg, the clinic’s former medical director who still provides abortions and other care there, told Vox. But things started to change after the appointment of a new director, Dr. Randall Williams, to lead the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services in 2017.

Williams, an OB-GYN, was appointed by former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, and has spoken little publicly about his position on abortion. In an interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch earlier this year, he said only, “Abortion is legal in Missouri, and I want it to be safe.”

But soon after his appointment, Eisenberg said, state regulators essentially started saying, “We have reinterpreted the rules and regulations and found what you do to no longer be compliant.” (The health department has not yet responded to Vox’s request for comment.)

The department conducted an audit of the clinic in March, and said it had found “deficient practices,” according to Planned Parenthood, but it didn’t clarify what practices it found deficient. In a statement in June, the department said it was “reviewing incidents with significant medical evidence which point to troubling instances and deviations from the standard care, resulting in serious patient harm.”

To further investigate the deficiencies, the health department said it needed to interview all the doctors who practice at the clinic. The two doctors who are Planned Parenthood employees agreed to the interviews — but others, who were medical residents affiliated with a St. Louis hospital, did not do so.

The state said the results of the interviews could include “board review” or “criminal proceedings,” a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood said earlier this year. And Planned Parenthood said it could not force the residents to sit for interviews because they were not employees, according to the Kansas City Star.

The clinic was threatened with closure at the end of May, when its license was scheduled to expire and the health department declined to renew it. But a judge issued a preliminary injunction allowing the clinic to stay open.

Since then, the case has been referred to the state’s Administrative Hearing Commission, which handles disputes between state agencies and private individuals or groups. The commission will hold all-day hearings in the case this Monday through Friday.

It’s not clear when the commission will issue a decision, but the process could take months, Gilmore said.

Planned Parenthood says the state’s goal is simple: shut the clinic down

Throughout the process, the state has maintained that there are safety issues at the clinic. According to the statement issued by the health department in June, officials are “concerned by the refusal of physicians to provide explanations for the deeply troubling instances of patient care and conduct under investigation.”

Details about the department’s concerns have been difficult to obtain — the statement of deficiencies was not made public. But a conference call between state officials and anti-abortion activists in May suggests that the state wanted to investigate “failed” abortions, in which a patient remained pregnant, and the number of ambulance visits to the clinic, according to the Kansas City Star.

Planned Parenthood, meanwhile, says the concerns about patient care are essentially a ruse, and the state’s real goal is simply to shut down the clinic. “The state of Missouri has waged political theater in order to ban abortion,” Gilmore said.

The organization points to the May conference call between Steele Shippy, then-communications director for Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, and Republican legislators and anti-abortion activists. The email invitation to the call ended with the phrase “#shutthemdown,” the Kansas City Star reported.

On the call, Shippy said that media would ask whether the state’s goal was to shut the clinic down. “While some of us, yes, it’s a main goal, but it also should be our main goal to protect the health and safety of women,” Shippy said.

The governor’s office declined to comment to Vox for this story. Shippy, who is now Parson’s campaign manager in his reelection campaign, has said that the call was nor arranged by the governor’s office. He is scheduled to testify at the hearings this week.

The closure of the clinic would mark a new era for abortion in America

Ahead of the hearings, Planned Parenthood said the stakes could not be higher. Even with the clinic open, “there’s over a million women” of reproductive age “in the state of Missouri with one freestanding health center providing abortion care,” Eisenberg said. If the clinic no longer provides abortions, any of those people facing an unwanted pregnancy would have to go to another state for care.

The majority of people seeking abortions in America are low-income, which means that traveling added distances can be a real financial hardship, especially if it means extra time off work. Last week, Planned Parenthood opened a new clinic just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, in Illinois, which could see Missourians if the Missouri clinic cannot. But other neighboring states, like Iowa, Kentucky, and Kansas, are restricting abortion access, not expanding it.

Meanwhile, the battle with state regulators is already having an effect, according to Eisenberg. “There’s a lot of confusion,” he said. “People think that abortion’s no longer available, when it is.”

And the outcome of the hearing will have implications outside Missouri too. In the last year, states around the country have passed strict bans on abortion. A Missouri law, for example, bans the procedure at eight weeks into pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape or incest. But all these laws, including Missouri’s, have been blocked by courts.

Another, quieter movement against abortion, however, may be coming to fruition. Since 2010, states have been passing restrictions on abortion clinics and providers that have had the effect of shutting clinics down. A 2016 Supreme Court decision, Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, found several such restrictions in Texas unconstitutional and struck a major blow to them nationwide. But since then, President Trump has appointed two conservative justices, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, to the court.

And earlier this month, the court announced it would hear the case June Medical Services v. Gee, which concerns a law in Louisiana very similar to those at issue in Whole Woman’s Health. Many abortion-rights advocates fear that the court will rule in favor of Louisiana, essentially giving states a green light to pass more and more onerous restrictions on clinics until abortion is impossible to access, even if it’s not banned outright.

Williamson, Tobias Hoonhout, Andrew T. Walker, Rich Lowry","Sen. Amy Klobuchar speaks to supporters at her New Hampshire primary-night rally in Concord , N.H. February 11 , 2020 . ( Gretchen Ertl/Reuters )
The Democratic Party is quibbling over rhetoric and ignoring the real debate .
In recent weeks , several Democratic presidential contenders have been asked whether or not there is room in their party for pro-life Democrats . It ’ s a fair question .
Over the past several campaign seasons , the Democratic Party has shifted its official platform to reflect a growing commitment to erasing any restrictions on access to abortion ( of which there are very few ) . In 2012 , the party removed the word “ rare ” from its platform with regard to abortion , replacing it with a sentence indicating that it now favored “ safe and legal abortion , regardless of ability to pay. ” During the 2016 campaign , the party platform called for the repeal of the Hyde amendment , which has been added to spending bills on a bipartisan basis since 1976 to prohibit federal funds from directly underwriting or reimbursing abortion procedures .
These rhetorical shifts have been mirrored by changes in the policies that Democratic politicians support . In 2009 , about one-quarter of Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to add Hyde-amendment language to the Affordable Care Act , an effort to protect the conscience rights of pro-life Americans . This year , not a single Democrat running for the presidential nomination supports conscience protections for anti-abortion taxpayers .
The Democratic platform and the party ’ s political leaders now hold a nearly uniform stance on abortion : It ought to be legal throughout all nine months of pregnancy , readily available to anyone for any reason , and funded by the U.S. taxpayer .
It ’ s little surprise , then , to discover that those same Democratic politicians increasingly see no reason even to acknowledge that pro-life Democrats exist or that they ought to be welcomed as a sizable bloc within the party .
A recent Gallup survey found that nearly one-third of self-identified Democrats also describe themselves as pro-life . Even Democrats who don ’ t describe themselves that way favor restricting abortion more than the party would prefer . Polling commissioned by the Knights of Columbus this January found that about six in ten Democrats support limiting abortion to the first three months of pregnancy . About half support bills to ban abortion after 20 weeks ’ gestation .
In the view of most left-wing politicians , however , Democratic voters with these views are plumb out of luck .

Is a warm welcome from a party full of smiling politicians with the platform of Amy Klobuchar really all that different ?","Sen. Amy Klobuchar speaks to supporters at her New Hampshire primary-night rally in Concord, N.H. February 11, 2020. (Gretchen Ertl/Reuters)

The Democratic Party is quibbling over rhetoric and ignoring the real debate.

In recent weeks, several Democratic presidential contenders have been asked whether or not there is room in their party for pro-life Democrats. It’s a fair question.

Over the past several campaign seasons, the Democratic Party has shifted its official platform to reflect a growing commitment to erasing any restrictions on access to abortion (of which there are very few). In 2012, the party removed the word “rare” from its platform with regard to abortion, replacing it with a sentence indicating that it now favored “safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay.” During the 2016 campaign, the party platform called for the repeal of the Hyde amendment, which has been added to spending bills on a bipartisan basis since 1976 to prohibit federal funds from directly underwriting or reimbursing abortion procedures.

These rhetorical shifts have been mirrored by changes in the policies that Democratic politicians support. In 2009, about one-quarter of Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to add Hyde-amendment language to the Affordable Care Act, an effort to protect the conscience rights of pro-life Americans. This year, not a single Democrat running for the presidential nomination supports conscience protections for anti-abortion taxpayers.

The Democratic platform and the party’s political leaders now hold a nearly uniform stance on abortion: It ought to be legal throughout all nine months of pregnancy, readily available to anyone for any reason, and funded by the U.S. taxpayer.

It’s little surprise, then, to discover that those same Democratic politicians increasingly see no reason even to acknowledge that pro-life Democrats exist or that they ought to be welcomed as a sizable bloc within the party.

A recent Gallup survey found that nearly one-third of self-identified Democrats also describe themselves as pro-life. Even Democrats who don’t describe themselves that way favor restricting abortion more than the party would prefer. Polling commissioned by the Knights of Columbus this January found that about six in ten Democrats support limiting abortion to the first three months of pregnancy. About half support bills to ban abortion after 20 weeks’ gestation.

In the view of most left-wing politicians, however, Democratic voters with these views are plumb out of luck. Asked during a recent town hall whether there was “such a thing as a pro-life Democrat” in his “vision of the party,” presidential hopeful Senator Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) replied, “I think being pro-choice is an absolutely essential part of being a Democrat.”

The topic came up because Pete Buttigieg, another front-runner for the Democratic nomination, had faced a similar question at a town hall of his own, directed to him by Kristen Day, executive director of the beleaguered interest group Democrats for Life.

Buttigieg offered only equivocations in response, concluding with this remark: “Look, I’ve never encountered a politician or, frankly, another person that I agreed with 100 percent of the time, and even on very important things. . . .

Just how many abortion positions does Mitt Romney have? Once again, that answer is unclear.

This time the confusion began Tuesday, during a meeting with the editorial board of the Des Moines Register.

""There's no legislation with regards to abortion that I'm familiar with that would become part of my agenda,"" Romney said.

He went on to add that he would use an executive order to reinstate the ""Mexico City Policy,"" which bars U.S. aid to international groups that lobby or pay for abortions.

A federal appeals court on Monday will hear arguments in a case challenging a Mississippi law requiring abortion providers to have hospital admitting privileges , a requirement that will shutter the state 's last remaining clinic and throw access to safe abortion care in Mississippi and surrounding states into crisis .

It is now clear that , since her firing , Wen has been engaged in a dispute with Planned Parenthood ’ s top brass over her public statements about the organization , and , it seems , they ’ d prefer her to keep quiet about how Planned Parenthood conducts its business internally .
In her letter , Wen , who is currently pregnant , accuses Planned Parenthood of holding her continued healthcare benefits hostage to her signing a blanket non-disclosure agreement — literally imperiling the health and well-being of a pregnant woman — and charges the group with hypocrisy for “ gagging ” her even as the Trump administration imposes its own global gag rule on abortion providers .
“ It is deeply hypocritical [ that Planned Parenthood ] would attempt to enforce a gag order on its immediate past President/CEO while fighting the Trump administration ’ s gag rule on Title X providers , ” Wen wrote , referring directly to a recent Planned Parenthood decision to withdraw from taking Federal Title X funds over the Trump administration ’ s decision to forbid those who receive federal funds from actively promoting abortion .

abortion,The Flip Side,1,https://www.theflipside.io/archives/march-for-life,March for Life,,,"The left is critical of the pro-life movement ’ s embrace of Trump and opposed to further restrictions on abortion .
“ Just inside the security barricades , several groups of clipboard-toting campaign workers beseeched attendees to sign up for Trump ’ s mailing list . The Trump campaign also distributed signs to marchers that read ‘ TEXT ‘ LIFE ’ TO 88022 ’ ; when I texted the number , the automated reply made no mention of abortion or ‘ life , ’ but asked me to ‘ stand with President Trump against the FAKE NEWS ! ’ …
“ For Trump , the demonstration functioned as a built-in rally—a captive audience of some of his most fervent , unconditional supporters just a few blocks from his house . It ’ s not hard to imagine why , in the middle of his impeachment trial , he ’ d want to spend a morning looking out on a beaming crowd of people in MAGA hats clutching posters with his face on them… It was hard to tell whether Trump or his fans got more out of his appearance on Friday . ”
“ The president has been claiming for some time that Democrats want to allow abortion ‘ until the moment of birth. ’ Trump also began claiming that Democrats want to legalize the killing of infants after they ’ re born , following confusing comments made by Gov .

The left is critical of the pro-life movement’s embrace of Trump and opposed to further restrictions on abortion.

“Just inside the security barricades, several groups of clipboard-toting campaign workers beseeched attendees to sign up for Trump’s mailing list. The Trump campaign also distributed signs to marchers that read ‘TEXT ‘LIFE’ TO 88022’; when I texted the number, the automated reply made no mention of abortion or ‘life,’ but asked me to ‘stand with President Trump against the FAKE NEWS!’…



“For Trump, the demonstration functioned as a built-in rally—a captive audience of some of his most fervent, unconditional supporters just a few blocks from his house. It’s not hard to imagine why, in the middle of his impeachment trial, he’d want to spend a morning looking out on a beaming crowd of people in MAGA hats clutching posters with his face on them… It was hard to tell whether Trump or his fans got more out of his appearance on Friday.”

Christina Cauterucci, Slate

“The president has been claiming for some time that Democrats want to allow abortion ‘until the moment of birth.’ Trump also began claiming that Democrats want to legalize the killing of infants after they’re born, following confusing comments made by Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia that some took as an endorsement of infanticide. In reality, no law in Virginia or anywhere else allows killing babies after they are born. No Democratic legislators support this. Doctors, meanwhile, say that patients do not request abortions during delivery or at ‘the moment of birth,’ nor do providers perform them.”

(CNN) - Ohio is joining Texas as one of the latest battlegrounds in the divisive fight over abortion.

Ohio's Republican governor, John Kasich, signed into law Sunday night the state's budget, which includes some controversial abortion provisions.

Those measures will require ultrasounds for anyone seeking an abortion and limit abortion clinics from transferring patients to public hospitals. If they need more care after a procedure, patients will now have to seek out a private hospital. The budget will also make it more difficult for family planning groups in the Buckeye State to obtain funding for preventive care. And it puts Planned Parenthood behind clinics that don't provide abortions, when it comes to obtaining state funding.

The provisions are part of an overall $62 billion budget, which includes a $2.7 billion tax cut and $1.5 billion for education. Kasich vetoed 22 line-items in the budget, but left the abortion provisions, which were passed Thursday by the Republican-controlled state legislature.

Kasich, who is up for re-election next year, did not take questions from reporters Sunday night after signing the budget.

No Democrats in the state legislature voted for the measures, and the party was quick to spotlight the governor's move.

""This is why Mitt Romney lost in 2012"" was the headline from an email from Elisabeth Smith, a senior adviser and spokeswoman for the Democratic Governors Association.

""Governor John Kasich, surrounded by a smiling group of Republican male legislators, just signed a bill in Ohio that will defund Planned Parenthood and force women seeking abortions to get medically unnecessary ultrasounds.

There was a similar message from the Democratic National Committee.

""Kasich's legislation is just the latest example of Republicans' extreme agenda on women's health- an agenda that aims to systematically prevent personal medical decisions from remaining between a woman and her doctor,"" said an email from the DNC.

Ohio is a crucial battleground state in presidential politics. It was the state that put President George W. Bush over the top in his 2004 re-election, but was won by President Barack Obama in his 2008 and 2012 election victories.

According to a 2014 CNN survey , 20 percent of respondents say abortion should always be illegal , and 38 percent say most abortions should be illegal — so that ’ s 58 percent of Americans who oppose all or virtually all abortions .

Mccarthy, Carrie Severino, John Fund, Tobias Hoonhout, Kevin D. Williamson, Bill Corsair, Jason Richwine","Health and Human Services secretary Alex Azar says there is “ no international right to abortion ” in a statement at the U.N. General Assembly .
At the United Nations General Assembly on Monday , the United States presented a joint statement declaring that there is no “ international right ” to abortion and calling on the governing body to stop using euphemistic terms to describe abortion in its official documents .
“ We do not support references to ambiguous terms and expressions , such as sexual and reproductive health and rights in U.N. documents , because they can undermine the critical role of the family and promote practices , like abortion , ” said Alex Azar , secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services , in his remarks at a U.N. meeting on universal health coverage . Azar delivered his statement on behalf of the U.S. and 18 other member countries .
“ There is no international right to an abortion , ” Azar added , “ and these terms should not be used to promote pro-abortion policies and measures. ” He argued that the use of vague terms ignores both the role of the family in health and “ the sovereign right of nations to implement health policies , ” and that this ambiguous language allows for misinterpretation when policies are implemented to give the U.N. ’ s imprimatur to abortion expansions .
This statement from the U.S. to the U.N. General Assembly is consistent with the Trump administration ’ s policies involving the provision and funding of abortion overseas . One of President Trump ’ s first actions after taking office in January 2017 was to sign an executive order reinstating the Mexico City policy , which prevents foreign-aid groups that provide or promote abortion in other countries from receiving U.S. aid funding .
The policy was first enacted during the presidency of Ronald Reagan and has been undone during each subsequent Democratic presidency and reinstated by Republican administrations . But the Trump administration did more than merely put the policy back in place after President Barack Obama left office .
Until the Trump administration , the Mexico City policy applied only to family-planning funds distributed to overseas-aid programs by the State Department and USAID , amounting to roughly $ 600 million . Under President Trump , the policy was expanded to apply to all foreign-health assistance provided by U.S. government agencies , including the State Department , the Office of the U.S .

Health and Human Services secretary Alex Azar says there is “no international right to abortion” in a statement at the U.N. General Assembly.

At the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, the United States presented a joint statement declaring that there is no “international right” to abortion and calling on the governing body to stop using euphemistic terms to describe abortion in its official documents.

“We do not support references to ambiguous terms and expressions, such as sexual and reproductive health and rights in U.N. documents, because they can undermine the critical role of the family and promote practices, like abortion,” said Alex Azar, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, in his remarks at a U.N. meeting on universal health coverage. Azar delivered his statement on behalf of the U.S. and 18 other member countries.

“There is no international right to an abortion,” Azar added, “and these terms should not be used to promote pro-abortion policies and measures.” He argued that the use of vague terms ignores both the role of the family in health and “the sovereign right of nations to implement health policies,” and that this ambiguous language allows for misinterpretation when policies are implemented to give the U.N.’s imprimatur to abortion expansions.

This statement from the U.S. to the U.N. General Assembly is consistent with the Trump administration’s policies involving the provision and funding of abortion overseas. One of President Trump’s first actions after taking office in January 2017 was to sign an executive order reinstating the Mexico City policy, which prevents foreign-aid groups that provide or promote abortion in other countries from receiving U.S. aid funding.

The policy was first enacted during the presidency of Ronald Reagan and has been undone during each subsequent Democratic presidency and reinstated by Republican administrations. But the Trump administration did more than merely put the policy back in place after President Barack Obama left office.

Until the Trump administration, the Mexico City policy applied only to family-planning funds distributed to overseas-aid programs by the State Department and USAID, amounting to roughly $600 million. Under President Trump, the policy was expanded to apply to all foreign-health assistance provided by U.S. government agencies, including the State Department, the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, and the Defense Department. As a result of this decision, nearly $9 billion in federal aid money is now covered by the policy.

In his speech on Tuesday afternoon at the U.N. General Assembly, Trump himself addressed his administration’s desire to disentangle the U.S. from promoting abortion overseas. “We are aware that many United Nations projects have attempted to assert a global right to taxpayer-funded abortion on demand, right up until the moment of delivery,” Trump said. “Global bureaucrats have absolutely no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that wish to protect innocent life.”

This effort by the U.S. to stop abortion-rights supporters from sneaking abortion-related language into documents under euphemistic labels has been lamented as an attempt to roll back “women’s rights” and “sexual and reproductive rights.”

USA TODAY

BROWNSVILLE, Tex. – The women who visit Lucy Felix at her advocacy center are lately faced with a slate of difficult choices: risk deportation to drive to a clinic, cross the nearby border into Mexico for a risky abortion or keep an unwanted, unplanned pregnancy to term.

Since Texas lawmakers passed new restrictions on abortion clinics last year, the number of clinics in the Rio Grande Valley that perform the service has dropped from two to zero, forcing women to drive more than 300 miles roundtrip to other cities for services or attempt riskier procedures across the border.

In the Valley, the poorest and neediest part of the state, the law is crippling women's rights to abortions, said Felix, a Brownsville-based field coordinator with the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health.

""They have to make really drastic decisions,"" she said of the women she talks to. ""They don't have the same access and the same freedom other women have.""

Under Texas House Bill 2, doctors who perform abortions must have admitting privileges at area hospitals, abortions past 20 weeks are banned, and abortion clinics must have ambulatory surgical centers. The law came on the heels of an earlier legislative action that slashed more than $70 million from the state's family planning budget, which helps fund clinics such as Planned Parenthood in Texas.

The new abortion law spurred an international outcry on social media sites such as Twitter, sparked a march on the state capitol during its debate in Austin and has been challenged in federal court by pro-choice groups such as Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights. A federal judge in Austin is expected to hear one of those cases in August.

In the wake of the new guidelines, the number of licensed abortion facilities in Texas dropped from 41 in 2011 to 24 today, according to the state Department of State Health Services. When the portion of the law requiring ambulatory surgical centers kicks in on Sept. 1, that number could fall to six.

Supporters of the law say the measures are long-overdue to ensure the health and safety of women seeking abortions. The clinics that have closed have done so voluntarily and the new rules will safeguard against health violations at abortion clinics, said Joe Pojman, executive director of the non-profit, pro-life group Texas Alliance for Life.

""The state of Texas is not closing these abortion facilities,"" Pojman said. ""The abortion facilities are deciding they do not wish to provide the new health and safety standards the state requires.""

But the closing clinics often can't afford the costly additions required by the law and amount to unlawful restrictions of abortion rights guaranteed by the U.S. Supreme Court, said Julie Rikelman, legislative director of the Center for Reproductive Rights. Texas is one of more than a dozen states across the USA, including Georgia and Arkansas, that are using state restrictions to chip away at federally-guaranteed abortion rights, she said.

Medical groups such as the Texas Medical Association and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have opposed provisions of the law, Rikelman said.

""These admitting privileges laws are not being pushed by doctors or medical organizations,"" she said. ""They are being pushed by anti-choice politicians. It's not about women's health. It's about choking off access to legal abortion services.""

One of the most vulnerable areas under the new law is the Rio Grande Valley, one of the poorest parts of the state running from Brownsville to Rio Grande City along the Mexican border and home to about 275,000 reproductive age women, according to Ibis Reproductive Health, a non-profit group that studies women's health issues.

After the law passed, two area abortion clinics – one in McAllen, the other in Harlingen – closed, leaving Corpus Christi, 160 miles away, as the nearest alternative, said Dan Grossman, an Oakland-based researcher for Ibis that has been examining Texas women's access to abortions in the wake of the restrictions. After Sept. 1, the Corpus clinic is expected to close, as well.

Besides being more costly, highway trips to Corpus Christi or San Antonio for abortion services pass through Border Patrol checkpoints, which deters many women who don't have proper immigration status, he said in an email. Some women in the Rio Grande Valley are turning to other alternatives, including self-induced abortions by way of drugs such as misoprostol, herbs or being hit in the abdomen, he said.

""The effect of all of this is that women who are able to obtain an abortion are often delayed in the process, possibly into the second trimester of pregnancy when abortion has higher risks,"" Grossman said.

In Brownsville, Felix said she has counseled women who have gone to Mexico for abortion services. Abortion is illegal in some parts of Mexico but the women know where to go to obtain illegal procedures or the pill for self-induced abortions, she said.

Instead of taking such drastic measures, Felix encourages the women to write letters to local newspapers or their state legislators, urging them to return the services to the Valley.

Brian Kemp threatening to boycott the state if a proposed pro-life heartbeat bill passes.

Milano slammed H.B. 481, the Living Infants Fairness and Equality (LIFE) Act, which bans abortions if a heartbeat is detected. As The Daily Wire reported, over fifty celebrities have signed the letter in solidarity.

Responding on Deadline, Bratcher, who portrays pro-life advocate Abby Johnson in the film, says she is a “proud Georgian” and that she is “incredibly proud of my home state for taking a stand in the fight for life amidst backlash and dubious threats”:

For the latter part of a year I’ve watched as women I’ve admired, like you, spoke out in regards to women’s rights, more specifically women’s reproductive rights. With radical laws like the ones in New York and Vermont being passed, it’s more critical than ever that we are using our voices to fight for the rights of women. One problem, you’re forgetting about the rights of women within the womb. If feminism is all about equal rights, then where are her rights? She also criticized Milano for saying that the “state leaders are going down a divisive road once again, refighting culture wars and jeopardizing one of the state’s biggest sources of revenue.”

Bratcher continued:

Well Alyssa, let me make something very clear to you. In Georgia, we care just as much about being pro-life as being pro-film. We don’t believe in putting a price tag on the value of a human life. Our brave leaders have stepped up to say enough is enough, we will no longer sit idly by as innocent lives are taken by the thousands each day.

The anniversary of Roe v. Wade is a natural time to reflect on the country’s view of abortion, a topic on which we are having an ongoing, heartfelt, and still unresolved debate.

CINCINNATI —The impending nomination of a new U.S. Supreme Court justice means abortion opponents could be closer than they’ve been in 45 years to seeing the court overturn its landmark Roe v. Wade decision.

President Donald Trump, who is poised to select the next justice, has vowed his choices for the court would “automatically” repeal the ruling.

But ending Roe won’t end abortion in America – or the fight over abortion.

Instead, a repeal of Roe would shift the battle from the federal courts to state legislatures, where lawmakers in every state would make their own rules about when, where and under what circumstances women could obtain abortions.

States would be free to act because, without Roe, the constitutional right to access abortion would be gone.

“All of a sudden, that’s where the venue is,” said James Bopp Jr., general counsel for National Right to Life. “All federal oversight goes away.”

Those on both sides of the debate say the result would be a patchwork of new laws, with some states enacting outright bans, others setting tougher restrictions and still others maintaining the status quo.

In this new landscape, some women could have access to abortions with few or no restrictions, while others would have to travel hundreds of miles or more to find a clinic in another state.

To some extent, this is already happening. Republican state lawmakers across the country have been attacking Roe around the edges for years with increasingly restrictive rules, from gestational limits to tougher licensing for clinics.

Roughly a dozen other states appear unlikely to enact tougher abortion laws, and some of those, such as California and Maryland, have laws explicitly protecting the right to access abortion.
