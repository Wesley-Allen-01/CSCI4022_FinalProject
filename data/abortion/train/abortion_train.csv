abortion,Salon,0,http://www.salon.com/2013/11/07/antiabortion_activists_transform_city_into_frightening_new_test_lab/,The right's scary new test lab: Antiabortion activists take over a major city,2013-11-07,Katie Mcdonough,"It was June of 2010 , a little more than a year after George Tiller was murdered by an antiabortion activist in Wichita , Kan. , that Operation Rescue announced it would be sending two self-described missionaries from Kansas , where the organization has its headquarters , to New Mexico .
The antiabortion group made no effort to hide the reason behind the move : Tiller ’ s clinic , one of the few in the country to provide late-term abortion services and long the target of Operation Rescue ’ s activism , had closed , and two of its physicians relocated to Albuquerque .
And so Bud and Tara Shaver followed them there , bringing their small family to New Mexico to try to shutter the Southwestern Women 's Options clinic -- and turn their adopted hometown into a petri dish for a new , national strategy to ban abortion at the municipal level .
While state restrictions continue to multiply across the country , the tactic of criminalizing abortion at the city level is a relatively new development among antiabortion activists . But as groups like Operation Rescue and Americans United for Life run out of deep red states with eager , Republican-controlled legislatures to target , it may become increasingly relevant -- and common .
Legislators in Texas and Oklahoma seem to have made a sport of passing increasingly draconian abortion restrictions , but New Mexico ’ s Democratic-controlled Legislature has been incredibly successful at rejecting such measures . If a current ballot initiative to criminalize abortion at 20 weeks passes with Albuquerque voters , it will be the only restriction on the procedure anywhere in the state . It will also make Albuquerque the first city in the country to pass an abortion ban of any kind .
“ Bud and Tara Shaver have been integral to the escalation of this issue here in town , ” Micaela Cadena , policy director of the reproductive justice group Young Women United and a lifelong resident of New Mexico , told ███ .
The sense that the Shavers have tremendous influence , both in New Mexico and at the national level , was shared by each of the people ███ spoke to -- including Tara Shaver herself .
“ Three years ago God called us to come [ to Albuquerque ] to work and focus on the late-term abortion clinic here , ” she explained over the phone . “ We 've been here for three years , laying the groundwork , shedding light on the fact that New Mexico has no abortion restrictions whatsoever , no parental notification laws for minors and is one of 15 states in the country that use taxpayer money to fund abortion .
“ Every single year , these abortion bills never get out of committee . They never make it to the floor , ” she continued . “ As a way to bypass the Legislature , which refuses to hear the voices of the people , we decided to launch an initiative at the city level . ”
But whether the ballot initiative represents the voice of the people of Albuquerque is a subject of considerable debate .
A large number of the people working with the Shavers are out-of-state volunteers , some as young as 16 and 17 years old , brought in by fringe militant groups like Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust and Operation Rescue .
One signature-gathering demonstration , which took place outside the city ’ s Holocaust and Intolerance Museum among signs that read “ American Auschwitz , ” was staffed largely by young people who had been bused in that day from California .
Asked by a local news station what they knew about abortion rights in New Mexico and in Albuquerque specifically , one young protester sheepishly admitted , “ Since I just got here , we ’ ve been learning about it since then , so I don ’ t know too much . ”
The outsider-insider dynamic has not escaped some residents ’ notice , and Cadena is quick to point out that the Shavers ' views on abortion do not reflect what she sees as her home state ’ s core values . Particularly at issue are some of the antiabortion activists ' chosen tactics , including passing out antiabortion propaganda to young trick-or-treaters and driving a so-called Truth Truck -- featuring graphic images of what appear to be fetuses -- through town . ( Tactics that Shaver defended to ███ as provoking the `` social tension necessary to bring about change . '' )
“ Across people 's personal feelings and religious beliefs , there is a shared sense of outrage that there is an out of touch interest that has come to our community to intimidate our medical providers and intimidate our city into accepting their agenda , ” Cadena explained .
Pat Davis , the executive director for progressive advocacy group ProgressNow New Mexico , agreed , citing Operation Rescue 's role in the ballot initiative as further evidence of outside influence .
“ What Bud and Tara Shaver are doing -- it ’ s all Operation Rescue , ” he told ███ . “ We did some research and found that Operation Rescue registered the domain names [ for the ballot initiative campaign ] for them . They have been providing technical and legal assistance from the very beginning . ”
While the Shavers may be the local face of the Albuquerque campaign , Operation Rescue is heavily invested in the outcome . Much like its activism against Tiller 's clinic in Kansas , the group wants to see Southwestern Women 's Options clinic -- and all abortion clinics -- shuttered , making abortion both inaccessible and illegal for women in Albuquerque and everywhere else . The group ’ s president , Troy Newman , made as much clear in a recent interview with Reuters .
`` It is a new strategy . There is more than one way to close an abortion clinic , '' he said .
`` If you ca n't get anything done in a state legislature … you look at what is going on in a city . They say all politics is local . This is a great example of that . ''
Albuquerque may be the first test , but the strategy is eliciting interest from antiabortion activists in other traditionally blue states . “ I am getting calls from other people in other states about our strategy , which is encouraging , ” Shaver said .
And the municipal-level campaign is only the first part of a more aggressive statewide strategy . “ The 20-week abortion ban is just a stepping stone that we hope will springboard into statewide legislation , ” she continued . ” Albuquerque is the largest city in the state , so we think this will send a strong message to the state legislators . ”
Shaver ’ s ambitions aside , right now , the fate of the ballot initiative is anyone ’ s guess . Davis noted that recent surveys suggest that the ban has a 50-50 chance of passing . ( It should also be noted that the measure , called the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Ordinance , is based on medically refuted pseudoscience about fetal pain , a point that advocates like Cadena have been quick to remind voters while advocating against it . )
There is also the state history of supporting women ’ s reproductive rights to be considered , a tradition that Cadena said is an intrinsic part of New Mexico ’ s identity .
`` In New Mexico , we do not believe the government should interfere in our personal medical decisions , ” she explained , referencing the state ’ s history of rejecting such restrictions outright . “ People here really understand that . There is not a government ban that could possibly accommodate the particular circumstances of a family , of every pregnancy . New Mexicans trust women to make these decisions for themselves . ”
But that history has done little to persuade Shaver , who made it clear that she intends to remain in Albuquerque to keep pushing these restrictions and targeting providers until abortion is `` ultimately ended. ” Not just in New Mexico , but everywhere .
“ I do not think were going to go anywhere any time soon , ” she explained . “ If we have to take small steps to reach that end goal , that 's what we 'll do . ”","It was June of 2010, a little more than a year after George Tiller was murdered by an antiabortion activist in Wichita, Kan., that Operation Rescue announced it would be sending two self-described missionaries from Kansas, where the organization has its headquarters, to New Mexico.

The final version of the rule , issued by the Department of Health and Human Services on Wednesday , requires states to distribute dollars from Title X of the Public Health Service Act without taking into account whether recipient clinics perform abortions .
The edict is set to go into effect Jan. 18 , two days before the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump .
Cecile Richards , president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , praised Mr. Obama as a “ champion for women ’ s health ” but expressed doubt as to whether the rule will survive under Mr. Trump ’ s pick to head HHS , Rep. Tom Price of Georgia .
“ This rule protects birth control , cancer screenings , STI testing and treatment , and other health care for millions of people , ” Ms. Richards said in a statement . “ Yet this fight is not over . We are deeply concerned about the future of health care access in this country with extremists like Mike Pence and Tom Price at the helm . ”
Rep. Diane Black , a Tennessee Republican who sits on the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives , said the Obama administration “ will not have the last word ” on the rule .
“ We should not be surprised that his administration would lash out with this eleventh hour power grab on the way out the door , but I am certain this rule will not stand for long , ” Ms. Black said in a statement . “ Come next year , our pro-life majorities in Congress will be positioned to work with President-Elect Trump and pro-life nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services , Dr. Tom Price , to not only roll back this latest overreach but also to enact new legal protections for these most vulnerable members of our society . ”
Title X dollars are earmarked for family planning services such as contraception , as well as testing for sexually transmitted diseases and cancer . They can not be used directly to subsidize abortions . Planned Parenthood receives approximately $ 60 million annually from Title X grants , according to a 2015 Congressional Budget Office analysis .
Unlike the $ 390 million Planned Parenthood receives in Medicaid reimbursements , funding under Title X is provided upfront and can be used toward fixed costs that come with running a clinic , such as staffing and facility maintenance .
At least 14 states have taken action to cut Planned Parenthood ’ s share of Title X funding in recent years , often allocating those dollars to family planning clinics that do not perform abortions .
The new Title X rule is the latest in a herculean effort by Mr. Obama to prevent Republicans at the state and federal levels from defunding Planned Parenthood , most recently in the wake of an undercover video investigation accusing the abortion giant of trafficking in fetal body parts .
Mr. Obama vetoed a bill stripping Planned Parenthood of the bulk of its funding earlier this year , after Congress for the first time sent such a bill to the president ’ s desk .
Shortly thereafter , the Obama administration issued a memo warning officials in all 50 states that blocking Medicaid dollars from Planned Parenthood violates federal law .
Steven H. Aden , senior counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom , said states should be able to choose how to allocate resources at the local level .
“ The Obama administration , even in its waning hours , has chosen to put Planned Parenthood ’ s Big Abortion agenda ahead of women ’ s health and the right of states to decide how best to prioritize public health funding so that patients and the most comprehensive health providers come first , ” Mr. Aden said in a statement .
He said Mr. Trump “ should restore the focus on women ’ s health and the ability of states to best serve them by rescinding this Title X order immediately after taking office as president . ”
Karen A. Scott , chief medical officer to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health , said the rule will “ strengthen access to essential services like cancer screenings and contraception for some of the most vulnerable patients in this country . ”
Although Planned Parenthood says abortion is only a minuscule percentage of its services , the number of health care services it provides continues to dwindle .
According to annual reports released by Planned Parenthood , the number of health care services its clinics provided from 2012 to 2014 dropped by 10 percent , from approximately 10.6 million to 9.5 million . Although nearly 3 million patients visited Planned Parenthood clinics in 2012 , that number fell to 2.5 million in 2014 .
Despite a nationwide abortion downtrend , the number of abortions performed at Planned Parenthood clinics has remained steady or increased . Planned Parenthood performed just under 200,000 abortions in 2001 , and that number ballooned to more than 333,000 by 2011 .
Mr. Aden said there are plenty of health care clinics more deserving of Title X funds than Planned Parenthood .
“ Planned Parenthood isn ’ t superior to true , publicly funded health care centers — which are far more numerous — simply because it claims to focus on dispensing birth control , despite being America ’ s largest abortion business , ” Mr. Aden said .","President Obama is delivering a generous parting gift to Planned Parenthood in the form of a rule prohibiting states from divesting millions of dollars from the nation’s largest abortion provider.

abortion,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48558709,Biden reverses stance on abortion funding amid Democratic backlash,,,"Former US Vice-President Joe Biden has reversed his stance on abortion funding amid mounting criticism from his fellow 2020 Democratic rivals .
At a Democratic gala on Thursday , Mr Biden denounced a law which restricts federal abortion funding , saying he believed all healthcare was a right .
The party 's current front-runner added that he made `` no apologies '' for having backed it previously .
Elizabeth Warren and Beto O'Rourke had been the latest to attack his stance .
Mr Biden had long voiced support for the Hyde Amendment - a law passed in 1976 , right on the heels of the Roe v Wade Supreme Court ruling that legalised abortion across the US .
His campaign had told NBC News this week he was still in favour of the amendment , triggering a backlash from liberal Democrats .
In 1976 , Henry Hyde , an Illinois Republican congressman , wrote an amendment to a federal funding bill that stated : `` None of the funds contained in this Act shall be used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the foetus were carried to term . ''
The amendment meant that the vast majority of women receiving federal assistance through the low-income healthcare programme Medicaid would be blocked from using that money for abortion services , which can often cost several hundred dollars .
In 1994 , under Democratic President Bill Clinton , the Hyde Amendment was updated to include exceptions in cases of rape or incest .
Speaking at a gala by the Democratic National Committee in Atlanta , Mr Biden said the amendment was now incompatible with his views on universal health coverage .
`` If I believe health care is a right , as I do , I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone 's ZIP code . ''
`` I want to be clear , '' he added . `` I make no apologies for my last position . I make no apologies for what I 'm about to say . ''
Mr Biden said he was `` working through the finer details '' of his healthcare plan and had been `` struggling with the problems that Hyde now presents '' .
He cited the recent push by conservative state legislatures nationwide to enact restrictions on abortion - or an outright ban , as Alabama did - as one of the reasons for his policy change .
On Friday , University of Alabama trustees voted to return a $ 26.5m ( £20m ) gift after the donor called on students to boycott the institution over the state 's abortion law - but the school told the Associated Press the decision was made due to the donor 's demands about how the money would be used .
`` Times have changed , '' the former vice-president said . `` I do n't think these guys are going to let up . ''
He did not mention the attacks on his stance from his party members .
Mr Biden is a practising Roman Catholic who has previously said he personally opposes abortion , but does not think he should impose his religious beliefs on others .
Joe Biden 's original opposition to taxpayer-funded abortion was n't so much out of step with the American public as it was in conflict with the active - and vocal - base of the Democratic Party .
It 's a base that passionately - and with valid reason - feels that abortion rights in the US are under the strongest attack in decades . They want to know that Democratic presidential candidates wo n't waiver in support of the procedure 's continued legality .
The former vice-president 's position on the subject , while drawing ire and fire from opponents and advocates , was n't necessarily a political liability , however , given that his support comes from more moderate Democrats and independents . In Mr Biden , these voters may see a reflection their own nuanced and sometimes conflicting views on abortion rights .
If Mr Biden had held firm , the storm would have passed .
Instead , he waffled . If this is how the Biden campaign will handle attacks on his lengthy record , the former vice president could be in for a bumpy ride .
Much of Mr Biden 's support stems from the perception that he is a winning candidate who can stand up to - and defeat - Donald Trump .
Too many fumbles , and that veneer of electability will strip away .
Many among the field of 24 candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination - including Bernie Sanders , Cory Booker and Jay Inslee - expressed support this week for repealing the law .
On Wednesday , both Mr O'Rourke , a former Texas congressman , and Ms Warren , a Massachusetts senator , directly criticised Mr Biden 's now-changed viewpoint .
Speaking to MSNBC during a televised town hall event , Ms Warren said she felt Mr Biden was wrong to support the amendment because `` it 's just discrimination '' against poorer women .
Mr O'Rourke told CBS News that Mr Biden 's viewpoint was `` absolutely wrong '' .
`` Perhaps he does n't understand , '' he said , `` who the Hyde Amendment hurts the most , lower income communities , communities of colour . ''
The four female senators running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination - Ms Warren , Kamala Harris , Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar - have co-sponsored a measure to revoke the Hyde Amendment .
They also tweeted criticisms of the law this week , but did not name Mr Biden .","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Joe Biden has reversed his stance on a decades-old abortion law after days of criticism from 2020 rivals

Former US Vice-President Joe Biden has reversed his stance on abortion funding amid mounting criticism from his fellow 2020 Democratic rivals.

At a Democratic gala on Thursday, Mr Biden denounced a law which restricts federal abortion funding, saying he believed all healthcare was a right.

The party's current front-runner added that he made ""no apologies"" for having backed it previously.

His campaign had told NBC News this week he was still in favour of the amendment, triggering a backlash from liberal Democrats.

What is the Hyde Amendment?

In 1976, Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican congressman, wrote an amendment to a federal funding bill that stated: ""None of the funds contained in this Act shall be used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the foetus were carried to term.""

The amendment meant that the vast majority of women receiving federal assistance through the low-income healthcare programme Medicaid would be blocked from using that money for abortion services, which can often cost several hundred dollars.

In 1994, under Democratic President Bill Clinton, the Hyde Amendment was updated to include exceptions in cases of rape or incest.

Who will take on Trump in 2020?

What did Biden say?

Speaking at a gala by the Democratic National Committee in Atlanta, Mr Biden said the amendment was now incompatible with his views on universal health coverage.

""If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone's ZIP code.""

""I want to be clear,"" he added. ""I make no apologies for my last position. I make no apologies for what I'm about to say.""

""Times have changed,"" the former vice-president said. ""I don't think these guys are going to let up.""

He did not mention the attacks on his stance from his party members.

Mr Biden is a practising Roman Catholic who has previously said he personally opposes abortion, but does not think he should impose his religious beliefs on others.

A bumpy ride ahead?

Joe Biden's original opposition to taxpayer-funded abortion wasn't so much out of step with the American public as it was in conflict with the active - and vocal - base of the Democratic Party.

It's a base that passionately - and with valid reason - feels that abortion rights in the US are under the strongest attack in decades. They want to know that Democratic presidential candidates won't waiver in support of the procedure's continued legality.

The former vice-president's position on the subject, while drawing ire and fire from opponents and advocates, wasn't necessarily a political liability, however, given that his support comes from more moderate Democrats and independents. In Mr Biden, these voters may see a reflection their own nuanced and sometimes conflicting views on abortion rights.

If Mr Biden had held firm, the storm would have passed.

Instead, he waffled. If this is how the Biden campaign will handle attacks on his lengthy record, the former vice president could be in for a bumpy ride.

Much of Mr Biden's support stems from the perception that he is a winning candidate who can stand up to - and defeat - Donald Trump.

Too many fumbles, and that veneer of electability will strip away.

What have other Democrats said?

Many among the field of 24 candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination - including Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker and Jay Inslee - expressed support this week for repealing the law.

On Wednesday, both Mr O'Rourke, a former Texas congressman, and Ms Warren, a Massachusetts senator, directly criticised Mr Biden's now-changed viewpoint.

Speaking to MSNBC during a televised town hall event, Ms Warren said she felt Mr Biden was wrong to support the amendment because ""it's just discrimination"" against poorer women.

Mr O'Rourke told CBS News that Mr Biden's viewpoint was ""absolutely wrong"".

""Perhaps he doesn't understand,"" he said, ""who the Hyde Amendment hurts the most, lower income communities, communities of colour.""

The four female senators running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination - Ms Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar - have co-sponsored a measure to revoke the Hyde Amendment.

They also tweeted criticisms of the law this week, but did not name Mr Biden.",www.bbc.com,center,TAQbO6viX9vmsxmv

The liberal side of the Texas abortion showdown has the two most powerful Democrats in Washington squarely in its corner: Barack Obama and Harry Reid — not to mention a Dixie Chick.

On the right: Rick Perry’s holding down the fort without much obvious help from national Republicans.

Story Continued Below

The RNC hasn’t latched onto the fight. Few national Republicans have weighed in. And a key party official in Texas acknowledged there’s no behind-the-scenes help coming, though he says he doesn’t need it.

Republicans will talk about the abortion bill when they’re asked about it, but they aren’t swooping into the fight with the same enthusiasm as liberals.

The mismatch makes sense: Even abortion bills that poll well, like the one in Texas does, open the door to the kinds of comments that have hurt national Republicans repeatedly — from Rep. Trent Franks’s comments last month on the “very low” number of rape-related pregnancies to Todd Akin blowing his shot at a Senate seat over his “legitimate rape” remarks in 2012.

Missouri's state legislature has passed a controversial bill that would outlaw nearly all abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy.

The bill was approved by the Republican-led Senate on Thursday and the House of Representatives on Friday.

Republican Governor Mike Parson is now expected to sign the bill so it can become law.

If approved, abortions past eight weeks would be banned in most cases, including rape or incest.

Missouri state Senator Jill Schupp, a Democrat, condemned the bill for failing to ""understanding that women's lives all hold different stories"".

However, Republican state Senators Dave Schatz and Caleb Rowden published a joint statement praising the ""life-affirming"" legislation.

The votes come just days after Alabama's governor signed a near-total ban on abortion in the state, promoting protests and concern from pro-choice supporters.

Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky and Ohio are among the other states to pass new abortion restrictions.

Most anti-abortion bills have faced legal challenges. However, this is what pro-life supporters hope will happen, as they want to reach the Supreme Court in order to challenge its landmark decision to legalise abortion in 1973.

Earlier this year the Supreme Court blocked implementation of new abortion restrictions in Louisiana. However, the ruling was made by a narrow margin and the case is due to be reviewed later this year.

Why is this happening now?

The Missouri bill comes amid a nationwide push for new restrictions by opponents of abortions.

They have been emboldened by the addition of two conservative justices nominated by President Donald Trump, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who give the nine-member court a conservative majority.

Their aim, they say, is for the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade ruling to be undermined or overturned completely.

What is the Missouri bill?

The bill, dubbed Missouri Stands With The Unborn, would outlaw performing an abortion in nearly all cases.

Under the bill, exemptions would be made for medical emergencies, but not pregnancies caused by rape or incest.

Doctors who perform abortions more than eight weeks into pregnancy would face five to 15 years in prison, the Associated Press reports.

A woman who has an abortion would not be held criminally liable.

Mr Parson, who supports the bill, said it would allow Missouri to become ""one of the strongest pro-life states in the country"".

Ever since the US Supreme Court handed down Roe v Wade in 1973, anti-abortion activists have understood that until the ideological composition of the nine-member body changed, the progress they could make in restricting abortions would be at the margins. Now, they hope, their decades of effort to reshape the high court are approaching fruition.

That could have a profound impact on US politics heading into the 2020 elections. If the future of Roe is in doubt, the abortion debate could change from a legal to a political one. Instead of pondering the selection of judicial nominees - a sometimes abstract concept - candidates for public office will be pressed for their views on outright prohibition.

It may be an uncomfortable conversation for some conservatives, who already have shied away from endorsing an Alabama abortion ban that is seen by a majority of Americans as too extreme.

Many Democrats, on the other hand, are still struggling to explain when and where they may back some further restrictions.

Until now, the abortion issue has done more to motivate and engage evangelical voters than it has those on the left. If the right to abortion is at risk, that dynamic may change.

What restrictions are other states enacting?

Earlier this year the governors of four states - Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio - signed bills banning abortion if an embryonic heartbeat can be detected.

Opponents say this amounts to a ban on abortion because cardiac activity in an embryo can be detected as early as the sixth week, before a woman may be aware that she is pregnant.

The Guttmacher Institute, which campaigns for reproductive rights, says none of these bans are yet in effect, but their introduction is part of the same strategy to get the cases heard by the Supreme Court, it says.

Overall 28 states are currently considering legislation that would ban abortion in a variety of ways, it says.

At a press conference in South Carolina on Wednesday , Cruz read from the cease-and-desist letter , calling it “ one of the most remarkable letters I have ever read , ” and challenged Trump to go through with his threatened suit .

Trump 's attorney sent Cruz a letter on Tuesday saying the ad was `` replete with outright lies , false , defamatory and destructive statements '' and Cruz could be held liable for damages if it 's not taken down .

The most liberal federal appeals court in the country has unanimously delivered a surprising ruling in favor of a Trump administration pro-life policy .
The Protect Life Rule stops clinics from receiving federal funding if they share office space with abortion providers . It also prevents taxpayer-funded clinics from making abortion referrals .
The move is expected to reduce Planned Parenthood 's federal subsidies by $ 60 million .
Several lower courts had ruled the policy ca n't take effect while it 's being disputed in court .
But a three-judge panel on the liberal Ninth Circuit Federal Appeals Court overturned those rulings , saying the Trump administration rules will be implemented while multiple lawsuits against the policy go forward .
`` We are pleased that the Ninth Circuit has cleared the way for this important executive branch action to take effect while our appeals are pending , '' Justice Department spokeswoman Kelly Laco said . `` The Department of Justice 's position is supported by long-standing Supreme Court precedent and we are confident we will ultimately prevail on appeal . ''
Leaders of the nation 's largest abortion provider , Planned Parenthood , are obviously upset , calling the policy `` unethical , illegal , and harmful to public health . '' The president of the group says , `` Planned Parenthood will not let the government censor our doctors and nurses from informing patients where and how they can access health care . ''
Although the Ninth Circuit 's decision could be a temporary victory , pro-life groups say it 's still a win .
The Alliance Defending Freedom calls it `` another step toward ensuring greater government program integrity and the protection of every human life , no matter how vulnerable . ''
Alliance Defending Freedom Legal Counsel Denise Harle said , `` Americans ' hard-earned tax dollars should never be used to fund abortion , shield child abusers , or force medical professionals to violate their convictions by participating in the end of human life . Today , the 9th Circuit unanimously upheld the Trump administration 's rule as 'reasonable ' and accurately applied the Supreme Court 's precedent by deciding that this rule may immediately go into effect . ''
`` This commonsense ruling simply allows HHS to ensure greater compliance with current federal and state laws , safeguard vulnerable and abused women and children , and help protect freedom of conscience for health care workers .

The legalization of abortion in Ireland sparks a debate about conscience.

Before heading into the last general election, Ireland’s future Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, had described his views as “pro-life” and insisted that he was committed to keeping the protection of life in the Irish constitution, even if he supported an alteration. But things change quickly.

Once in office, and anticipating the change in public opinion, Varadkar came around to support repealing the Eighth Amendment to Ireland’s constitution, which recognized the equal right of the unborn child to life. When Repeal passed overwhelmingly in a national referendum, Varadkar declared the result a Quiet Revolution in Irish life.

And now he’s intent on carrying that quiet revolution further. Varadkar’s full position on what repeal means has only become clear after the votes were cast. National Review predicted in its editorial on the referendum that victory for Repeal would be swiftly followed by attempts to coerce Catholic institutions to provide abortion. Now Varadkar has promised as much.

Confronted in the Dáil by politicians asking how the state would provide abortion, Varadkar said that Catholic hospitals will be compelled to do so. Acknowledging that there will be some conscience protections allowed for individual doctors and nurses, Varadkar explained: “But it will not be possible for publicly funded hospitals, no matter who their patron or owner is, to opt out of providing these necessary services, which will be legal in the state once the legislation is passed by the Dáil and the Seanad.”

The answer may surprise you.,2015-04-20,Jessica Mendoza,"Abortion is one of the most polarizing issues in the United States today , but public opinion may not be as black and white as it seems .
In a Vox survey on abortion policy published earlier this month , careful questioning of more than 1,000 respondents suggests that plenty of Americans identify neither as only `` pro-choice '' nor as only `` pro-life . '' On the contrary , 21 percent said they were neither , while 18 percent said they were both .
The poll ’ s findings unearth the nuances in public opinion often neglected when the media , politicians , and other opinion surveys frame the abortion debate as purely two-sided . The poll could also open up discussion about the issue in ways that – as Fordham University ethicist Charles Camosy put it – involves critical thinking , and takes into account the importance of precise language and constructive engagement when tackling such sensitive subjects as the life of an unborn child and a woman ’ s rights concerning her body .
“ We ’ ve framed our abortion debate all wrong . It isn ’ t black and white – it ’ s thousands of different shades of gray that exist somewhere in the middle , ” Vox senior editor Sarah Kliff wrote . “ This matters because by ignoring that gray space , we miss something important : there are abortion policies that a majority of Americans could agree on . ”
The majority of respondents , for instance , said that they would want to hear from elected officials of both genders talking about the issue . Nearly 70 percent would not want a woman to feel ashamed to admit if she had an abortion . But when asked about abortion being completely illegal or legal , and given various options in between , the largest percentage ( 34 ) chose this answer : `` Abortion should only be legal in cases of rape , abuse , or if the woman ’ s health is at risk . ''
A big challenge to moving the abortion debate forward is overcoming the stereotypes that have evolved as a result of years of framing the discussion in binary terms such as `` pro-life '' versus `` pro-choice , '' or `` liberal '' versus `` conservative , '' according to Mr. Camosy , who teaches Christian ethics at Fordham in the Bronx and wrote , “ Beyond the Abortion Wars : A Way Forward for a New Generation . ”
“ It is no secret that popular media have a real struggle communicating complexity , ” Camosy wrote . “ Thus they struggle not only to accurately describe what Americans think about abortion , but also the complex reasons many women have abortions … the reality for women is far messier and can not be captured by a headline or Tweet . ”
In other words , there ’ s room for discussion beyond yes or no , pro or anti . And that may be a lesson applicable to other issues , such as immigration , that appear to have divided the nation .
In an op-ed for news magazine The Week , for example , journalist Damon Linker pointed out that looking at only two sides of the immigration debate tends to lead exactly where it has gone so far : Nowhere . A viable policy , he wrote , is one that is based neither solely on moral grounds , which would give anyone who shows up at the border full citizenship , nor on the tenets of exclusivism , which would oppose the ideals of the US Constitution .
“ What we 're left with , then , is a position situated somewhere between the universalists and the tribalists , ” Mr. Linker wrote . “ We need a tightly controlled border , but with relatively liberal quotas for legal immigration , some allowances made for humanitarian refugees , and a path to citizenship for those already here . We can and should debate precisely how liberal those quotas should be , how many refugees to let in , and how arduous to make the path to citizenship . ”
The path to useful policies thus lies in how we approach an issue , Camosy wrote . In the abortion debate , he added , that means avoiding using words and phrases – “ radical feminist , ” “ war on women , ” “ anti-science , ” or “ heretic ” – that lead to rhetorical victories at the cost of understanding .
Promoting meaningful discussion also requires humility and , instead of assuming the other side has a secret personal agenda , giving them the courtesy of listening to their arguments .

Since Roe v. Wade granted American women the legal right to abortion in 1973 , the anti-choice movement has been divided over how to roll it back . Incrementalists favor eroding Roe ’ s protections by making abortions ever more difficult to provide and obtain ; a more brazen faction supports a direct attack on the decision itself . Overturning Roe would require at least five justices , so the incrementalists have prevailed , passing hundreds of restrictions on the state and federal levels , including mandatory ultrasounds , biased counseling , restrictions on insurance coverage for the procedure , and for minors , laws requiring parental consent . Ad Policy
Since 2010 , when Republicans gained control of 11 statehouses , the number of restrictions has spiked , and this year , anti-choice legislators have quickened the pace ; 250 restrictions have been introduced in 41 states in 2019 alone . Those restrictions did what they were intended to do : Over a third of American women now live in counties without an abortion provider .
With the addition of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court , anti-choice activists have pounced . In the first three months of 2019 , 28 states introduced some form of abortion ban . Arkansas and Utah now prohibit abortions past 18 weeks . Ohio , Kentucky , Mississippi , and now Georgia have passed six-week bans , outlawing the procedure just two weeks after a woman typically finds out she ’ s pregnant . And states aren ’ t stopping there . Texas and Alabama are attempting to criminalize abortion outright . The Texas legislature this year considered a measure that would make abortion punishable by the death penalty , and in Alabama a proposal introduced this year would make providing an abortion at any stage in pregnancy a felony .
The audacity of these measures is chilling , and that ’ s the whole point . Rather than simply testing Roe ’ s boundaries or finding ways to limit access while leaving the legal framework intact if hollow , these bans are a frontal attack on Roe . And there ’ s a very good chance they could succeed . “ The newly constituted Supreme Court may be willing to reconsider the court ’ s previous rulings protecting the right to abortion , ” said Jordan Goldberg of the National Institute for Reproductive Health . With Kavanaugh on the court , the timing couldn ’ t be better . Through the theft of a Supreme Court seat , the Republican Party has set up the religious right—one of the constituencies on which it most depends—to be in its permanent debt . Related Article Ecuador ’ s Crackdown on Abortion Is Putting Women in Jail Zoë Carpenter
Meanwhile , abortion providers are more vulnerable than they ’ ve been since the 1990s—from 2016 to 2017 , the National Abortion Federation reported , threats of violence against abortion providers nearly doubled , and President Donald Trump does nothing to help , accusing Democrats of being the “ party of late-term abortion ” and throwing around words like “ rip , ” “ execute , ” and “ infanticide . ”
The timing seems right for something else , too , though : Activists have increasingly recognized the role states and municipalities can play in protecting the legal right to abortion—and in ensuring that right is guaranteed not merely on paper . Since Trump ’ s election , Massachusetts , Delaware , Illinois , Oregon , and New York have passed laws protecting legal abortion or expanding access . This year , 13 states have introduced measures that would expand protections or repeal outdated abortion laws . Last week , the Kansas Supreme Court found a fundamental right to abortion in the state ’ s Constitution .
Abortion-rights advocates often say the anti-choice movement doesn ’ t want to end abortion , only safe and legal abortion . Zoë Carpenter traveled to Ecuador to meet women whose painful experiences bear out the truth of that claim . Ecuador has a near-total ban on the procedure , yet thousands of women obtain clandestine abortions there each year . In recent years , the criminal-justice system has cracked down on women who terminate pregnancies . As abortion provision moves further into the shadows , her reporting shows , women have been driven to dangerous lengths to secure the procedure . As in the United States , a vibrant feminist movement is championing reform . But until laws change , Ecuador ’ s women will suffer—revealing just how heartless and misguided abortion bans are .","Ready to fight back?

Ohio, Kentucky, Mississippi, and now Georgia have passed six-week bans, outlawing the procedure just two weeks after a woman typically finds out she’s pregnant. And states aren’t stopping there. Texas and Alabama are attempting to criminalize abortion outright. The Texas legislature this year considered a measure that would make abortion punishable by the death penalty, and in Alabama a proposal introduced this year would make providing an abortion at any stage in pregnancy a felony.

The audacity of these measures is chilling, and that’s the whole point. Rather than simply testing Roe’s boundaries or finding ways to limit access while leaving the legal framework intact if hollow, these bans are a frontal attack on Roe. And there’s a very good chance they could succeed. “The newly constituted Supreme Court may be willing to reconsider the court’s previous rulings protecting the right to abortion,” said Jordan Goldberg of the National Institute for Reproductive Health. With Kavanaugh on the court, the timing couldn’t be better. Through the theft of a Supreme Court seat, the Republican Party has set up the religious right—one of the constituencies on which it most depends—to be in its permanent debt.

Meanwhile, abortion providers are more vulnerable than they’ve been since the 1990s—from 2016 to 2017, the National Abortion Federation reported, threats of violence against abortion providers nearly doubled, and President Donald Trump does nothing to help, accusing Democrats of being the “party of late-term abortion” and throwing around words like “rip,” “execute,” and “infanticide.”

The timing seems right for something else, too, though: Activists have increasingly recognized the role states and municipalities can play in protecting the legal right to abortion—and in ensuring that right is guaranteed not merely on paper. Since Trump’s election, Massachusetts, Delaware, Illinois, Oregon, and New York have passed laws protecting legal abortion or expanding access. This year, 13 states have introduced measures that would expand protections or repeal outdated abortion laws. Last week, the Kansas Supreme Court found a fundamental right to abortion in the state’s Constitution.

Abortion-rights advocates often say the anti-choice movement doesn’t want to end abortion, only safe and legal abortion. Zoë Carpenter traveled to Ecuador to meet women whose painful experiences bear out the truth of that claim. Ecuador has a near-total ban on the procedure, yet thousands of women obtain clandestine abortions there each year. In recent years, the criminal-justice system has cracked down on women who terminate pregnancies. As abortion provision moves further into the shadows, her reporting shows, women have been driven to dangerous lengths to secure the procedure. As in the United States, a vibrant feminist movement is championing reform. But until laws change, Ecuador’s women will suffer—revealing just how heartless and misguided abortion bans are.

Editor’s Note: Shortly after this article was published, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signed the state’s six-week abortion ban into law. The text of the article has been updated in response.",www.thenation.com,left,I3PwikG17Yx1z3qa

The decision came in the case of National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA) v. Becerra.

Every pregnancy is tough. Pregnancy without sufficient support, financial or emotional, can seem impossible. Every year, pregnancy centers across the United States offer a helping hand to thousands of women so that they can confidently choose life for their babies.

These centers provide women personalized attention and care during and after pregnancy, free of charge. Many offer pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, prenatal education and classes on parenting. They also offer tangible support like maternity and baby clothes, diapers and wipes, and even strollers and car seats to lighten the financial burden of caring for a newborn.

But the most important service found at a pregnancy center is caring. When walking through the doors of a pregnancy center, women find the kind of care and attention that reinforces their dignity as women and helps them prepare to become mothers.

Rather than celebrate the work of these nonprofit centers, California tried to impede it. Through California’s Freedom, Accountability, Comprehensive Care and Transparency Act – commonly known as the Reproductive FACT Act – the state targeted pro-life pregnancy centers and forced them to direct women towards abortion, the state’s preferred response to an unexpected pregnancy.

Under the California law, pregnancy centers were required to notify their clients about the state’s free or low-cost family planning programs, which include abortion services. Centers that failed or refused to become abortion-promoting billboards were subject to cumulative fines.

But something got in the way of the California law: the First Amendment of the Constitution.

The First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech includes the right not to be forced by the government to speak. California’s FACT Act did just that, by requiring pro-life pregnancy centers to promote the state’s family planning programs, which include abortion.

As Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the majority opinion in the NIFLA case, forcefully stated: “California cannot co-opt (pregnancy centers) to deliver its message for it.” The government can’t force people to promote an idea they oppose, like the notion that abortion is the solution to a challenging pregnancy.

The Supreme Court’s decision to strike down California’s law vindicates the First Amendment’s prohibition on compelled speech. But more importantly, it vindicates women and the pregnancy centers who help them.

California’s FACT Act was just one example of a troubling trend of cities and states targeting pro-life pregnancy centers.

An amicus brief filed by the Catholic Association in the NIFLA case on behalf of 13 clients of pregnancy centers recounts the experiences of these women and their unwavering opposition to attempts to force centers to promote abortion or shutter their doors. Each woman felt challenged by the circumstances she faced and turned to her local pregnancy center for support.

The unique needs and concerns of these women were heard and responded to with genuine compassion by pregnancy center staff.

As Melissa, one of the 13 women who courageously came forward to share her story, remarked: “I feel like every woman who walks through those doors gets the same treatment – open, loving, very warm – especially if you don’t have any other supports.”

At pregnancy centers, these women were offered an authentic choice and the chance to flourish and thrive as mothers, despite their circumstances.

Laura chose to carry her pregnancy to term even though it meant losing the relationship with her child’s father. A pregnancy center eased the financial burden by offering free diapers and wipes, and the center’s counseling services helped Laura recover from the emotional abuse of her prior relationship.

Angela faced a different challenge. Alone and addicted to drugs, Angela reached out to center staff to help her stay clean for the sake of her developing child. Angela’s son, now a precocious 2-year-old, is the apple of his mother’s eye. Angela still receives counseling and support as she raises her son and prepares to enter the workforce.

The new law is a near-ban on abortion after the 12th week of pregnancy . Unless a lawsuit or court action intervenes before it takes effect this summer , it looks like Arkansas will become the toughest state to get an abortion after the 3 month mark .
Lawmakers in the Republican-dominated Legislature defied Gov . Mike Beebe , overriding the Democrat 's veto . The House voted 56-33 on Wednesday to override Beebe 's veto , a day after the Senate voted to do the same . The votes come less than a week after the Legislature overrode a veto of a separate bill banning most abortions starting in the 20th week of pregnancy . That bill took effect immediately after the final override vote , whereas the 12-week ban wo n't take effect until this summer .
Abortion rights advocates say they will sue over this vote , but those who advocated and voted for this law are not scared of this challenge . The governor , who has continually stated that these laws are unconstitutional due to the Roe v. Wade decision , will face opponents from the Right .
`` Not the governor , nor anyone else other than the courts , can determine if something is constitutional or unconstitutional , '' Rep. Bruce Westerman , a Republican from Hot Springs , said in urging his colleagues to override Beebe . Bill sponsor Sen. Jason Rapert , a Republican from Conway , watched the vote from the House gallery and said a number of law firms have offered to help the state defend the laws in court , if it comes to that . `` I 'm just grateful that this body has continued to stand up for the bills that have passed . The eyes of the entire nation were on the Arkansas House of Representatives today , '' he said .
This 12-week ban will prohibit abortions from the point when a baby ’ s heart rate can be heard through an abdominal ultrasound . “ It includes exemptions for rape , incest , the life of the mother and highly lethal fetal disorders . The 20-week prohibition , which is based on the disputed claim that a fetus can feel pain by the 20th week and therefore deserves protection from abortion , includes all of the same exemptions except for fetal disorders. ” And 6 Democrats even crossed the aisle to join Republicans on this vote .
So if you can hear the heartbeat at 12 weeks , how is it that anti-abortion advocates can claim it is not a live being in there ? Thank you to Arkansas for standing with the women and children of your state and protecting their lives .","Well Arkansas has officially become the state with the most restrictive abortion law and has made a case for life.

The House voted 56-33 on Wednesday to override Beebe's veto, a day after the Senate voted to do the same. The votes come less than a week after the Legislature overrode a veto of a separate bill banning most abortions starting in the 20th week of pregnancy. That bill took effect immediately after the final override vote, whereas the 12-week ban won't take effect until this summer.

Abortion rights advocates say they will sue over this vote, but those who advocated and voted for this law are not scared of this challenge. The governor, who has continually stated that these laws are unconstitutional due to the Roe v. Wade decision, will face opponents from the Right.

""Not the governor, nor anyone else other than the courts, can determine if something is constitutional or unconstitutional,"" Rep. Bruce Westerman, a Republican from Hot Springs, said in urging his colleagues to override Beebe. Bill sponsor Sen. Jason Rapert, a Republican from Conway, watched the vote from the House gallery and said a number of law firms have offered to help the state defend the laws in court, if it comes to that. ""I'm just grateful that this body has continued to stand up for the bills that have passed. The eyes of the entire nation were on the Arkansas House of Representatives today,"" he said.

This 12-week ban will prohibit abortions from the point when a baby’s heart rate can be heard through an abdominal ultrasound. “It includes exemptions for rape, incest, the life of the mother and highly lethal fetal disorders. The 20-week prohibition, which is based on the disputed claim that a fetus can feel pain by the 20th week and therefore deserves protection from abortion, includes all of the same exemptions except for fetal disorders.” And 6 Democrats even crossed the aisle to join Republicans on this vote.

So if you can hear the heartbeat at 12 weeks, how is it that anti-abortion advocates can claim it is not a live being in there? Thank you to Arkansas for standing with the women and children of your state and protecting their lives.",www.townhall.com,right,wjlj3xpzCrlL4pqY

Rand Paul announced Tuesday , in an investigation he said could pry into Planned Parenthood ’ s sale of parts of aborted fetuses for research purposes .
The Department of Health and Human Services ’ Office of Inspector General confirmed the probe in a Dec. 4 letter to Mr. Paul , saying it will interview officials at HHS and particularly those at the National Institutes of Health , which awards most of the funding for human fetal tissue research .

“ Planned Parenthood selling body parts of the unborn demonstrates that the organization deserves not one penny more of our taxpayer dollars , and I am confident this investigation will give further proof of that , ” Mr. Paul said Tuesday .
Mr. Paul wants to know how much third parties paid to Planned Parenthood or similar entities for harvested tissue , how the prices were set and how NIH ensures that no one is profiting from the transfers .
He also would like to know how research groups certify their compliance with existing law .
For its part , Planned Parenthood welcomed the “ timely ” audit , saying it had been asking the NIH since July to create an independent panel to conduct its first examination of fetal tissue research standards since the Reagan administration .
“ As we have made clear from the beginning , Planned Parenthood has never sold fetal tissue for profit , ” said Dawn Laguens , executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America .

The issue broke into the fore after activists at the Center for Medical Progress released a series of videos shot on hidden cameras that implied Planned Parenthood was harvesting fetuses ’ organs and trying to negotiate prices for them .
In combative testimony to a House panel in September , Planned Parenthood chief Cecile Richards called the videos “ edited ” and an effort to “ entrap ” the organization .

Republicans have been trying to end federal taxpayer funding for the organization , which runs to about $ 500 million a year . Democrats have defended the money and managed to keep it flowing so far .
But at least one state is prevailing over Planned Parenthood , as Judge Waddoups voided his temporary restraining order from October that had kept funds flowing to the Planned Parenthood Association of Utah .
The ruling reinstates Utah Gov . Gary Herbert ’ s decision in August to stop $ 275,000 in federal funding from coming to Utah and then the Planned Parenthood affiliate , revenue that was used for an afterschool sex education program , a network monitoring sexually transmitted diseases and STD testing .
“ Indeed , these are the types of decisions that should be left to elected officials , and not managed by the courts , ” Judge Waddoups said in his opinion .
In a statement , Mr. Herbert said he “ appreciate [ s ] today ’ s court decision which recognizes my ability to make contract decisions on behalf of the state . ”
He added that the state would continue to work with “ local health departments , community health centers , non-profit clinics and others to ensure access ” to nonabortion services that Planned Parenthood provides .
Helene Krasnoff , senior director for litigation and law with Planned Parenthood Federation of America , told The Associated Press that the Utah ruling is “ a bit of an outlier ” given that judges in the other Planned Parenthood lawsuits this year have ruled in the organization ’ s favor .
Last month Alabama agreed to pay $ 51,000 in legal fees to Planned Parenthood Southeast to settle a lawsuit over Gov . Robert Bentley ’ s effort to cancel the state ’ s Medicaid contract . A federal judge had ruled that the move deprived patients of the provider of their choice , as required under the Medicaid Act .
The same argument prevailed in Arkansas and Louisiana after state officials canceled their contracts with local Planned Parenthood affiliates . In both states federal judges ordered the states to reinstate funding pending the outcome of lawsuits .
Karrie Galloway , CEO of Planned Parenthood Association of Utah , said in a statement that the judge ’ s order is “ regrettable , ” and that attorneys will consider “ every possible way to continue the critical health care and education programs that are at risk . ”
Another effort to strip federal funding from Planned Parenthood will go to the House floor early next year as part of a budget bill to halt much of Obamacare . It is expected to pass Congress but to meet with a veto from President Obama .

abortion,BBC News,1,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44348991,"Trump 'could pardon himself over Russia but won't', says Giuliani",,,"Donald Trump probably has the power to pardon himself in the Russia collusion affair but does not intend to do so , his lawyer Rudy Giuliani says .
A special counsel is investigating Russia 's role in the 2016 election , and whether Mr Trump obstructed justice .
The question of self-pardon arose after the New York Times published a letter to the counsel from Mr Trump 's lawyers .
In it they say he has absolute power as US legal chief to end investigations , or `` even exercise his power to pardon '' .
Such absolute powers , they argue , mean that he could not have obstructed justice in any case .
He appeared on ABC 's This Week programme and was asked whether Mr Trump had the power to pardon himself .
Mr Giuliani , the head of Mr Trump 's legal team , said he `` probably does '' , but added : `` He has no intention of pardoning himself . ''
He went on : `` I think the political ramifications of that would be tough . Pardoning other people is one thing . Pardoning yourself is another . ''
Speaking on CNN on Sunday , House Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that no president should pardon himself .
It all stems from the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into alleged collusion between the Trump team and Russian officials in the election campaign that brought the president to power .
Mr Trump has always maintained there was no collusion and that the investigation is a `` witch hunt '' .
Part of Mr Mueller 's investigation is looking at whether Mr Trump sought to criminally obstruct it , in particular with the sacking of ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey , and with his reaction to Attorney General Jeff Sessions ' recusal from the investigation .
No-one really knows . There is no precedent for a president trying .
In the case of former President Richard Nixon , the Justice Department said he could not pardon himself , but others argue it is not precluded in the US Constitution .
This latter theory was something touched on in the newly leaked letter .
It is dated 29 January and was sent to Mr Mueller by John Dowd , one of Mr Trump 's lawyers who has since left the team .
The New York Times obtained the letter and published it in full .
It appears to be an attempt to show the president as untouchable . Its main points are that , because the president is the nation 's chief legal officer , he :
Can not be guilty of obstruction of justice because , given his absolute powers , that would effectively mean obstructing himself
Citing the powers given to him by the Constitution , it says the president can `` terminate the inquiry , or even exercise his power to pardon '' .
Mr Giuliani said himself last week that the special counsel 's investigation may be `` entirely illegitimate '' .
But that was dated a while back and the probe is still going ?
He has requested an interview with the president over obstruction of justice . Mr Trump has previously said he might be willing to attend but his lawyers appear opposed , fearing it could lead to charges of perjury .
Mr Giuliani told ABC : `` It 's beginning to get resolved in favour of not doing it . ''
If the president does not attend , Mr Mueller could try a grand jury subpoena but , as the letter above shows , the Trump team would try to block it .
The whole thing could end in a court battle over what can and what can not be applied to a president .
In any case , any attempt to impeach the president over the Russia affair would not be affected . That 's a political process and pardons would not prevent it .
Mr Mueller has indicted 19 people as part of his investigation so far , including four members of the Trump campaign team or administration .

Donald Trump probably has the power to pardon himself in the Russia collusion affair but does not intend to do so, his lawyer Rudy Giuliani says.

A special counsel is investigating Russia's role in the 2016 election, and whether Mr Trump obstructed justice.

The question of self-pardon arose after the New York Times published a letter to the counsel from Mr Trump's lawyers.

In it they say he has absolute power as US legal chief to end investigations, or ""even exercise his power to pardon"".

Such absolute powers, they argue, mean that he could not have obstructed justice in any case.

What has Mr Giuliani said?

He appeared on ABC's This Week programme and was asked whether Mr Trump had the power to pardon himself.

Mr Giuliani, the head of Mr Trump's legal team, said he ""probably does"", but added: ""He has no intention of pardoning himself.""

He went on: ""I think the political ramifications of that would be tough. Pardoning other people is one thing. Pardoning yourself is another.""

Speaking on CNN on Sunday, House Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that no president should pardon himself.

Why would Mr Trump need to pardon himself?

It all stems from the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into alleged collusion between the Trump team and Russian officials in the election campaign that brought the president to power.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Donald Trump has constantly railed against the investigation in Twitter outbursts

Mr Trump has always maintained there was no collusion and that the investigation is a ""witch hunt"".

Part of Mr Mueller's investigation is looking at whether Mr Trump sought to criminally obstruct it, in particular with the sacking of ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, and with his reaction to Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal from the investigation.

So could he do it?

No-one really knows. There is no precedent for a president trying.

In the case of former President Richard Nixon, the Justice Department said he could not pardon himself, but others argue it is not precluded in the US Constitution.

This latter theory was something touched on in the newly leaked letter.

So what is this letter all about?

It is dated 29 January and was sent to Mr Mueller by John Dowd, one of Mr Trump's lawyers who has since left the team.

The New York Times obtained the letter and published it in full.

It appears to be an attempt to show the president as untouchable. Its main points are that, because the president is the nation's chief legal officer, he:

Cannot be subpoenaed

Cannot be indicted

Cannot be guilty of obstruction of justice because, given his absolute powers, that would effectively mean obstructing himself

Citing the powers given to him by the Constitution, it says the president can ""terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon"".

Mr Giuliani said himself last week that the special counsel's investigation may be ""entirely illegitimate"".

The leaking of the letter certainly displeased Mr Trump:

But that was dated a while back and the probe is still going?

It is indeed. Robert Mueller is not going away.

He has requested an interview with the president over obstruction of justice. Mr Trump has previously said he might be willing to attend but his lawyers appear opposed, fearing it could lead to charges of perjury.

Mr Giuliani told ABC: ""It's beginning to get resolved in favour of not doing it.""

If the president does not attend, Mr Mueller could try a grand jury subpoena but, as the letter above shows, the Trump team would try to block it.

The whole thing could end in a court battle over what can and what cannot be applied to a president.

In any case, any attempt to impeach the president over the Russia affair would not be affected. That's a political process and pardons would not prevent it.

Where are we with the Russia-Trump inquiry?

Mr Mueller has indicted 19 people as part of his investigation so far, including four members of the Trump campaign team or administration.

Thirteen Russians have also been charged over their links to the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian ""troll factory"" accused of spreading fake news stories through US social media.

In April, Dutch lawyer Alex van der Zwaan became the first person to be jailed as part of the FBI investigation. He was sentenced to 30 days in prison and fined $20,000 under a plea deal, after being convicted of lying to investigators about his contacts with ex-campaign aide Rick Gates, who was one of the people charged.

MONTGOMERY, Ala. – The Alabama Senate fell into chaos Thursday after the lieutenant governor removed from consideration two amendments that created rape and incest exceptions in a bill that would create a near-total ban on abortion.

The move by Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth led to anger from Senate Democrats, who demanded a vote on whether to keep the amendments in, and ultimately led to a delay in the bill itself.

The legislation, sponsored by Rep. Terri Collins, a Republican from Decatur, would ban abortion in nearly all cases except when a woman's life is in danger. The Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday approved amendments that would include exceptions for rape and incest – exceptions that Collins rejected during the House debate. The full Senate must approve amendments to include them in a bill.

abortion,Christian Science Monitor,1,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2019/0409/Is-our-political-divide-at-heart-really-all-about-abortion,"Is our political divide, at heart, really all about abortion?",2019-04-09,Jessica Mendoza,"“ You have these two wildly important values , at least seemingly in conflict : the well-being of women and the well-being of babies , ” says Charles Camosy , an associate professor of ethics at Fordham University in New York . “ Who wouldn ’ t be motivated by that ? ”
Today , almost no issue has the same ability to divide the country . Indeed , some studies have raised provocative questions about the extent to which partisanship – which often shapes voters ’ views on issues , rather than the other way around – might be grounded in beliefs about abortion .
Over time , however , as the two political parties doubled down on ideological purity , each has effectively used abortion – with its intensely personal stakes – to drive voters to the polls . The confirmation of conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court last fall only raised the stakes .
It ’ s hard to imagine now , but abortion wasn ’ t always the wedge issue it is today . From the time it first surfaced in public discourse in the mid-19th century until the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 , the issue was viewed as polarizing but not partisan .
When Kristen Day joined the nonprofit Democrats for Life of America in 2002 , she wanted only to be put out of business .
A new mom at the time , she had dreamed of a day when abortion would become a nonpartisan issue ; when people who called themselves “ pro-life ” could support the cause regardless of whether they identified as Democrat or Republican ; when a lawmaker ’ s career would no longer hinge on how he or she voted on an abortion bill . She says she believed that moment was near .
“ I was so naive , ” Ms. Day says in a phone interview .
In the years since , as the two political parties have doubled down on ideological purity , liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats have essentially become oxymorons . The partisan divide has grown into a chasm .
And abortion is often the issue that most sharply cuts in between . Each party has used abortion – with its intensely personal , life-and-death stakes – to motivate voters . If you believe that abortion is murder , how could you ever vote for a Democrat ? If you believe it ’ s not , and think that banning it would deny women control over their own bodies , how could you cast a ballot for a Republican ?
Folks like Ms. Day now find themselves shunned by activists on both sides . Attitudes toward abortion , perhaps more than ever , are directly and indirectly shaping the highest reaches of United States politics .
The 2016 election , for instance , turned on factors such as public frustration with politics as usual , the investigation into Hillary Clinton ’ s emails , and the maturing of social media as a tool for political messaging .
But exit polls also showed that among voters who said that the Supreme Court was the most important basis for their decision , nearly two-thirds voted for Donald Trump . That included evangelical Christians , many of whom were willing to put aside concerns about the president ’ s personal life in pursuit of the repeal of Roe v. Wade , the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion .
“ You can make the argument that a nontrivial reason that Donald Trump is president is because of abortion , ” says Mary Ziegler , a law professor at Florida State University who specializes in family , sexuality , and the legal history of reproduction . “ Some voters saw a Supreme Court vacancy , and they held their noses and voted for Trump . ”
That ’ s a direct example of abortion ’ s political impact . But a more intriguing question may be this : If abortion had never become the wedge issue it is today , would our political landscape look anything like it currently does ?
Abortion wasn ’ t always viewed through a political lens . When it first surfaced as a subject of public debate in the mid-19th century , it was against the backdrop of the medical industry ’ s effort to professionalize itself – and chip away at midwives ’ authority in the process , says Karissa Haugeberg , an assistant professor of history at Tulane University in New Orleans . Then , as the century turned and new immigrants began streaming into the country , concerns over abortion began to center around the declining birthrate among white Americans .
“ Even in the 1940s and ’ 50s , it would have seemed strange to ask someone running for president what their view on abortion was , ” says Professor Haugeberg , who traces the history of abortion opponents in her 2017 book , “ Women against Abortion : Inside the Largest Moral Reform Movement of the Twentieth Century . ”
Some of the earliest supporters of modern abortion rights were Republican women like Constance Cook , the state assemblywoman who co-wrote the bill that legalized abortion in New York three years before the Roe ruling . Catholic Democrats , meanwhile , were early opponents of abortion ; among the holdouts against pre-Roe legalization were heavily Catholic states like Rhode Island and Massachusetts .
It wasn ’ t until the 1980s that the parties began to realign according to abortion . The GOP , in an effort to win new voters , backed abortion opponents like televangelist Jerry Falwell and his Moral Majority in their bid to pass a constitutional amendment banning abortion . When the proposal failed in 1983 , the two groups , instead of ending their partnership , settled on a new one : the quest for a reconfigured Supreme Court that could undo Roe .
By 1987 , abortion had become the kind of issue that could make or break a Supreme Court nomination , as in the case of failed nominee Robert Bork . By 1992 , Democrats were barring abortion-rights opponents like Pennsylvania Gov . Bob Casey Sr. from speaking at the national convention . By 2010 , opposition to abortion was driving the tea party revolution , as conservative Republicans picked off congressional Democrats who opposed abortion rights but had voted in support of the Affordable Care Act .
There ’ s a reason that Democrats for Life endorses only three U.S. senators today , down from about 40 in the late 1990s . It ’ s the same reason that only two Republicans in the chamber still publicly support abortion rights .
The confirmation of conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court last fall only raised the stakes .
Anticipating that Roe may soon be overturned , abortion-rights activists have doubled down on their support for choice . At their urging , Democratic-controlled states like Virginia and New York have passed some of the country ’ s most expansive abortion-rights laws to date .
Opponents of abortion , who have been at the forefront of state-level restrictions for years , have pressed for the opposite from GOP state lawmakers . Republicans now are not only working to send a case to the high court that could lead to Roe ’ s repeal , but also preparing to make abortion illegal in certain jurisdictions as soon as the ruling is overturned . On Tuesday , the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the “ Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act , ” which would place a federal ban on abortion at 20 weeks , with some exceptions .
It ’ s a situation ripe for even more ugliness and division – just in time for the 2020 presidential campaign .
“ The abortion issue has been an indicator of a larger symptom of our politics of the last 40 years , ” says Daniel Williams , a history professor at the University of West Georgia and author of “ Defenders of the Unborn : The Pro-Life Movement before Roe v. Wade. ” “ As long as both sides see it as an inalienable human right , it ’ s going to be very difficult to find middle ground . ”
The irony is that for decades , polling has found that most Americans don ’ t see themselves as strictly on one side or the other of the abortion debate . Gallup ’ s survey data going back to 1975 shows that , on average , about half of Americans think abortion should be legal under some circumstances . Only a quarter say the procedure should be legal under all circumstances , and just under 18 percent say it should be illegal without exception .
Tucked within those figures is even more nuance . Most people are willing to consider factors like whether or not the mother ’ s life is at risk , how long she ’ s been pregnant , or if sexual violence was involved .
“ There ’ s this whole range of positions one can have , to the point where the life/choice binary just makes no sense , ” says Charles Camosy , an associate professor of ethics at Fordham University and author of “ Beyond the Abortion Wars : A Way Forward for a New Generation . ”
But when asked to identify as either “ pro-choice ” or “ pro-life ” – the most common terms used to frame the debate – Americans split down the middle , at 48 percent each , according to Gallup . The divide is even more stark when political parties are taken into account . Of those who identify as or lean Republican , 69 percent say they are “ pro-life ” and 29 percent say they are “ pro-choice. ” The numbers flip among Democrats and those who lean Democratic .
One reason is that binaries – choice versus life , liberal versus conservative , us versus them – work well in both media and politics . A group that can quickly identify its enemy is much easier to mobilize come Election Day . Political candidates love voters who can be convinced on the basis of a single issue , just as the media loves covering conflict – especially if it makes a good headline .
Take the Roe decision , says Professor Ziegler at Florida State . “ The pro-life goal is to get rid of Roe , and the choice goal is to save it . It ’ s easy to understand . It ’ s easier to generate soundbites and ads . It ’ s easier to explain to voters who don ’ t want to think about politics all the time . ”
Still , abortion wouldn ’ t be so politically expedient if a small but vocal group of people didn ’ t actually feel so strongly about it . To the most ardent supporters of abortion rights , what ’ s at stake is women ’ s autonomy and freedom and power over their own bodies .
It ’ s hard to imagine a more important value than that , Professor Camosy says , “ except maybe the very right to life of the most vulnerable . ”

Ms. Day at Democrats for Life , who ’ s spent 17 years trying to end abortion in the U.S. , says there ’ s no reason to shame women who ’ ve had abortions or punish them for something they can ’ t change .

Today, almost no issue has the same ability to divide the country. Indeed, some studies have raised provocative questions about the extent to which partisanship – which often shapes voters’ views on issues, rather than the other way around – might be grounded in beliefs about abortion.

Over time, however, as the two political parties doubled down on ideological purity, each has effectively used abortion – with its intensely personal stakes – to drive voters to the polls. The confirmation of conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court last fall only raised the stakes.

It’s hard to imagine now, but abortion wasn’t always the wedge issue it is today. From the time it first surfaced in public discourse in the mid-19th century until the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, the issue was viewed as polarizing but not partisan.

When Kristen Day joined the nonprofit Democrats for Life of America in 2002, she wanted only to be put out of business.

A new mom at the time, she had dreamed of a day when abortion would become a nonpartisan issue; when people who called themselves “pro-life” could support the cause regardless of whether they identified as Democrat or Republican; when a lawmaker’s career would no longer hinge on how he or she voted on an abortion bill. She says she believed that moment was near.

“I was so naive,” Ms. Day says in a phone interview.

In the years since, as the two political parties have doubled down on ideological purity, liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats have essentially become oxymorons. The partisan divide has grown into a chasm.

And abortion is often the issue that most sharply cuts in between. Each party has used abortion – with its intensely personal, life-and-death stakes – to motivate voters. If you believe that abortion is murder, how could you ever vote for a Democrat? If you believe it’s not, and think that banning it would deny women control over their own bodies, how could you cast a ballot for a Republican?

Folks like Ms. Day now find themselves shunned by activists on both sides. Attitudes toward abortion, perhaps more than ever, are directly and indirectly shaping the highest reaches of United States politics.

The 2016 election, for instance, turned on factors such as public frustration with politics as usual, the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails, and the maturing of social media as a tool for political messaging.

But exit polls also showed that among voters who said that the Supreme Court was the most important basis for their decision, nearly two-thirds voted for Donald Trump. That included evangelical Christians, many of whom were willing to put aside concerns about the president’s personal life in pursuit of the repeal of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion.

“You can make the argument that a nontrivial reason that Donald Trump is president is because of abortion,” says Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University who specializes in family, sexuality, and the legal history of reproduction. “Some voters saw a Supreme Court vacancy, and they held their noses and voted for Trump.”

That’s a direct example of abortion’s political impact. But a more intriguing question may be this: If abortion had never become the wedge issue it is today, would our political landscape look anything like it currently does?

A medical – not political – issue

Abortion wasn’t always viewed through a political lens. When it first surfaced as a subject of public debate in the mid-19th century, it was against the backdrop of the medical industry’s effort to professionalize itself – and chip away at midwives’ authority in the process, says Karissa Haugeberg, an assistant professor of history at Tulane University in New Orleans. Then, as the century turned and new immigrants began streaming into the country, concerns over abortion began to center around the declining birthrate among white Americans.

But the issue, while polarizing, was not partisan.

“Even in the 1940s and ’50s, it would have seemed strange to ask someone running for president what their view on abortion was,” says Professor Haugeberg, who traces the history of abortion opponents in her 2017 book, “Women against Abortion: Inside the Largest Moral Reform Movement of the Twentieth Century.”

Some of the earliest supporters of modern abortion rights were Republican women like Constance Cook, the state assemblywoman who co-wrote the bill that legalized abortion in New York three years before the Roe ruling. Catholic Democrats, meanwhile, were early opponents of abortion; among the holdouts against pre-Roe legalization were heavily Catholic states like Rhode Island and Massachusetts.

It wasn’t until the 1980s that the parties began to realign according to abortion. The GOP, in an effort to win new voters, backed abortion opponents like televangelist Jerry Falwell and his Moral Majority in their bid to pass a constitutional amendment banning abortion. When the proposal failed in 1983, the two groups, instead of ending their partnership, settled on a new one: the quest for a reconfigured Supreme Court that could undo Roe.

By 1987, abortion had become the kind of issue that could make or break a Supreme Court nomination, as in the case of failed nominee Robert Bork. By 1992, Democrats were barring abortion-rights opponents like Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey Sr. from speaking at the national convention. By 2010, opposition to abortion was driving the tea party revolution, as conservative Republicans picked off congressional Democrats who opposed abortion rights but had voted in support of the Affordable Care Act.

There’s a reason that Democrats for Life endorses only three U.S. senators today, down from about 40 in the late 1990s. It’s the same reason that only two Republicans in the chamber still publicly support abortion rights.

The confirmation of conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court last fall only raised the stakes.

Anticipating that Roe may soon be overturned, abortion-rights activists have doubled down on their support for choice. At their urging, Democratic-controlled states like Virginia and New York have passed some of the country’s most expansive abortion-rights laws to date.

Opponents of abortion, who have been at the forefront of state-level restrictions for years, have pressed for the opposite from GOP state lawmakers. Republicans now are not only working to send a case to the high court that could lead to Roe’s repeal, but also preparing to make abortion illegal in certain jurisdictions as soon as the ruling is overturned. On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the “Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,” which would place a federal ban on abortion at 20 weeks, with some exceptions.

It’s a situation ripe for even more ugliness and division – just in time for the 2020 presidential campaign.

“The abortion issue has been an indicator of a larger symptom of our politics of the last 40 years,” says Daniel Williams, a history professor at the University of West Georgia and author of “Defenders of the Unborn: The Pro-Life Movement before Roe v. Wade.” “As long as both sides see it as an inalienable human right, it’s going to be very difficult to find middle ground.”

Nuanced views

The irony is that for decades, polling has found that most Americans don’t see themselves as strictly on one side or the other of the abortion debate. Gallup’s survey data going back to 1975 shows that, on average, about half of Americans think abortion should be legal under some circumstances. Only a quarter say the procedure should be legal under all circumstances, and just under 18 percent say it should be illegal without exception.

Tucked within those figures is even more nuance. Most people are willing to consider factors like whether or not the mother’s life is at risk, how long she’s been pregnant, or if sexual violence was involved.

“There’s this whole range of positions one can have, to the point where the life/choice binary just makes no sense,” says Charles Camosy, an associate professor of ethics at Fordham University and author of “Beyond the Abortion Wars: A Way Forward for a New Generation.”

But when asked to identify as either “pro-choice” or “pro-life” – the most common terms used to frame the debate – Americans split down the middle, at 48 percent each, according to Gallup. The divide is even more stark when political parties are taken into account. Of those who identify as or lean Republican, 69 percent say they are “pro-life” and 29 percent say they are “pro-choice.” The numbers flip among Democrats and those who lean Democratic.

One reason is that binaries – choice versus life, liberal versus conservative, us versus them – work well in both media and politics. A group that can quickly identify its enemy is much easier to mobilize come Election Day. Political candidates love voters who can be convinced on the basis of a single issue, just as the media loves covering conflict – especially if it makes a good headline.

Take the Roe decision, says Professor Ziegler at Florida State. “The pro-life goal is to get rid of Roe, and the choice goal is to save it. It’s easy to understand. It’s easier to generate soundbites and ads. It’s easier to explain to voters who don’t want to think about politics all the time.”

Still, abortion wouldn’t be so politically expedient if a small but vocal group of people didn’t actually feel so strongly about it. To the most ardent supporters of abortion rights, what’s at stake is women’s autonomy and freedom and power over their own bodies.

It’s hard to imagine a more important value than that, Professor Camosy says, “except maybe the very right to life of the most vulnerable.”

“So you have these two wildly important values, at least seemingly in conflict: the well-being of women and the well-being of babies,” he says. “Who wouldn’t be motivated by that?”

Mana Rabiee/Reuters Activists from the Susan B. Anthony List, a leading anti-abortion group, went door to door in Wheeling, West Virginia, asking residents such as Tammie Cusack to urge their Democratic senator to approve Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Aug. 29, 2018.

The link to partisanship

As the parties have diverged, political scientists have found that party affiliation – and the social identity associated with it – is increasingly the top indicator of how a person will vote in any election. That is, voters will often take their party’s position on an issue as opposed to looking substantively at an issue to decide which party suits them best. Very few things have the force to push a voter from one party to another.

But abortion might be one of them. A 2008 study in the journal Political Research Quarterly found that while defections were uncommon, when all else was equal, a “pro-life” Democrat was more than twice as likely to switch parties than the average. A “pro-choice” Republican, over time, was three times as likely to re-identify as a Democrat, the researchers found. “[I]t is difficult to think of many other issues that would rival [abortion] in the capacity to influence partisanship,” they wrote.

Another study, done in 2015 by a pair of scholars for the Centre for Economic Research in London, reported similar findings – and added that once a person had switched parties, his or her other political views often followed suit.

Studies like these raise provocative questions about the extent to which partisanship, and voters’ subsequent political views on a range of issues, might be grounded in beliefs about abortion. Which leads some to ask: Were that not the case, would we be as sharply divided as we are today?

“If it weren’t the deciding issue, people might be freer to think about a variety of issues,” Professor Ziegler says. “It wouldn’t be so coherently about the feminist vote or the religious right, because those people would be breaking down in a much finer-grained way.”

The idea – among some political scientists, anyway – is that if we are to move past the gridlock of partisan polarization, this is the culture war issue we most need to get beyond. It’s the narratives surrounding abortion that are driven by the most extreme elements on each side and where the political discourse is most out of sync with broad public opinion. Tellingly, we don’t even have a shared language or set of facts with which to talk about the experience.

“What happens in pregnancy is so different than anything else that happens in human existence,” says Rebecca Todd Peters, a religious studies professor at Elon University in North Carolina. “If we want to address the public health issues around unplanned pregnancies, we have to diagnose the problem differently.”

One word that frequently comes up in discussions about how to move forward is empathy – for the activists on both sides who are fighting for values they feel are fundamental to humanity, but even more for the women: those who gave up their babies for adoption, those who are raising children they can’t properly care for, and those who chose to end their pregnancies.

“ A minority of Americans on either side [ of the abortion issue ] are strongly energized , while a large number are uncomfortable but flexible , depending on how the question is phrased , ” says Daniel Williams , a professor at the University of West Georgia . “ The majority of Americans , they ’ re highly susceptible to being influenced by the wording of the question . ”
In reporting our series , we encountered many misperceptions and changes in attitudes based on the language used . For example , people had different reactions to a procedure described as “ early termination , as recommended by a doctor ” than they did to “ an abortion due to fetal abnormalities. ” But these statements could describe the exact same situation .
Political rhetoric isn ’ t helping . Last month , at a rally in Green Bay , Wisconsin , President Donald Trump claimed that Democrats are “ aggressively pushing extreme late-term abortion , allowing children to be ripped from their mother ’ s womb right up until the moment of birth. ” He stated that there are situations in which after the baby is born , “ they wrap the baby beautifully , and then the doctor and mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby . ”
PolitiFact rated this claim as false . Though there isn ’ t hard data on the reasons for late-term abortions , we know they are rare . Some are performed due to an immediate threat to the life of the mother , or because the infant has severe abnormalities that make survival outside the womb unlikely . In these cases , the parents and doctors must discuss whether or not to resuscitate the child if it stops breathing – something many have described as a wrenching , emotional decision . But “ executing ” the baby ? That does not happen .
“ The notion that anyone supports executing infants after birth is preposterous , ” Gretchen Ely , an associate professor at the University at Buffalo ’ s School of Social Work and a board member for Social Workers for Reproductive Justice , told PolitiFact .
At the same time , those who support abortion access often portray abortion opponents as hostile to the rights of women . Pennsylvania state Rep. Brian Sims , a Democrat , recently drew attention for videos he posted of himself confronting anti-abortion protesters outside a Planned Parenthood in Philadelphia .
“ They ’ re racist , classist , bigots who NEED & DESERVE our righteous opposition , ” Representative Sims tweeted with his video . In another tweet , he wrote , “ Planned Parenthood protesters are scum ! I ’ ve spent years as a patient escort witnessing firsthand the hate , vitriol , hostility and BLATANT RACISM they spew . ”
Amid the extreme rhetoric on both sides , basic facts about abortion in the U.S. often get lost . This article attempts to cut through some common misperceptions surrounding the issue .
Matt Rourke/AP/File Pennsylvania state Rep. Brian Sims speaks at John F. Kennedy Plaza , also known as Love Park , in Philadelphia on Sept. 25 , 2014 . The Democratic lawmaker has drawn recent criticism for recording himself berating a woman anti-abortion demonstrator at length outside an abortion clinic in Philadelphia , calling her an ‘ old white lady ’ and her protest ‘ grotesque . ’
In the U.S. , overall attitudes surrounding abortion have remained relatively unchanged over the past 20 years . Nearly six in 10 Americans say that abortion should be legal in all or most cases . What has changed is the partisan divide : today , 76 % of Democrats say abortion should be legal in most cases , with only 36 % of Republicans in agreement . In 1995 , 64 % of Democrats favored legal abortion , with 49 % of Republicans in agreement .
Several Democrat-led states have been removing certain restrictions on abortions in cases of serious health concerns . Does this mean a woman can get a voluntary abortion right up until birth in states like Massachusetts and New York ? That ’ s not the case . Forty-three states , including those two , prohibit abortions after a certain point in the pregnancy . The only exceptions are when the health or life of the mother is at risk or because of the viability of the fetus .
At the same time , many Republican-led states are moving to further restrict abortions . At least five states – including Louisiana , Arkansas , and North Dakota – have passed “ trigger ” laws , which will immediately ban abortion in the state if Roe v. Wade were to be overturned . Georgia recently became the fourth state to pass a “ heartbeat bill , ” which would ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected , typically around the sixth week of pregnancy . In Alabama , lawmakers are poised to vote this week on a near-total abortion ban . Most of these legislative efforts are expected to face court challenges .
Some state supreme courts , meanwhile , are issuing rulings based on their own constitutions that will stand even if Roe is overturned . In April , the Kansas Supreme Court ruled that the state ’ s constitution protects a woman ’ s right to terminate her pregnancy . The bipartisan ruling focused on the state ’ s protection of “ personal autonomy ” and the ability of individuals to make their own decisions when it comes to their own bodies .
Is the abortion rate going up in the United States ?
The simple answer ? No . It ’ s actually the lowest it ’ s been since the 1980s .
According to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , from 2006 to 2015 the total number of reported abortions decreased by 24 percent .
So what ’ s driving the reduced abortion rate ? Like many aspects of the conversation , it ’ s complicated .
One factor , depending on the state , is better access to contraceptives and health care . After the passage of the Affordable Care Act , most private health insurers were mandated to provide access to all FDA-approved contraceptives without cost-sharing since 2012 . This , in addition to the expansion of Medicaid , made birth control more accessible and more affordable . According to the Guttmacher Institute , low-income women are more likely to have unintended pregnancies than more affluent women . With more women having access to and using birth control , the need to address an unplanned pregnancy decreases .
But wait , is it possible the abortion rate is decreasing because of more restrictions on abortion ?
Depending on the state , yes . “ A lower abortion rate may be a result of a decrease in abortion access services , ” says Elizabeth Nash , a state policy analyst for the Guttmacher Institute . “ It may be because of access to health care , or it may be because of state restrictions that close abortion clinics . ”
Take Texas , for example . Before 2013 , the state had 42 abortion clinics . After the passage of Texas House Bill 2 , which required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the facility where he or she performs abortions , that number went down to 21 ( as of 2019 ) . With fewer clinics , longer wait times , and less access , there is simply less capacity to provide abortion care in the state .
Globally , however , laws restricting access to abortions have little impact on reducing abortion rates . In fact , abortion rates are slightly higher in countries with more restrictive access to abortion .
Ms. Nash points out that many countries that restrict abortion access develop underground networks for providing illegal abortion services . This has not happened in the U.S. since 1973 , when Roe v. Wade upheld the legality of abortion . In 1965 , illegal abortions accounted for one-sixth of all U.S. pregnancy-related deaths .
“ Highly restrictive laws do not eliminate the practice of abortion , but make those that do occur more likely to be unsafe , ” a 2018 report by the Guttmacher Institute states .
“ It ’ s naive to think that abortion being banned means there would be no abortion . What that means is abortion would be available to those with money and means , and much less available to those with fewer resources , ” Ms. Nash says .
Who is getting abortions ? And when are they getting them ?
Three in four abortion patients are low-income , and one of the most common reasons they cite for seeking an abortion is that they can ’ t afford a child . Most already have children , and most are in their 20s .
Nearly two-thirds of abortions occur within the first eight weeks of pregnancy , with almost all abortions ( 91.1 % ) occurring within the first trimester ( before 13 weeks ) . Some 7.6 % of abortions occur between 14 and 20 weeks ’ gestation , and 1.3 % occur after 21 weeks , which is about halfway through the second trimester .
Medically and legally , there is no definition for late-term abortion . However , when that term is used , it typically means after the 21st week of pregnancy , when the fetus may be viable , or capable of living independently , outside of the womb . Because there is no technical definition , there are a lot of misperceptions around what late-term abortion really means .
The statistics of late-term abortions do only so much to clarify the issue , but they do show that they are rare : 1.3 % . Very little research has been done to show why these abortions take place . In some cases , they take place due to severe medical complications that mean the fetus will not be able to live outside the womb or that risk the life of the mother . There have also been cases where women sought and received abortions later in their pregnancies because they could not get access to an abortion sooner . Statistically speaking , there is little concrete data to show the main cause of late-term abortions . This leaves room for activists on both sides of the issue to create a narrative that fits their purposes .

With more women having access to and using birth control, the need to address an unplanned pregnancy decreases.

But wait, is it possible the abortion rate is decreasing because of more restrictions on abortion?

Depending on the state, yes. “A lower abortion rate may be a result of a decrease in abortion access services,” says Elizabeth Nash, a state policy analyst for the Guttmacher Institute. “It may be because of access to health care, or it may be because of state restrictions that close abortion clinics.”

Take Texas, for example. Before 2013, the state had 42 abortion clinics. After the passage of Texas House Bill 2, which required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the facility where he or she performs abortions, that number went down to 21 (as of 2019). With fewer clinics, longer wait times, and less access, there is simply less capacity to provide abortion care in the state.

Globally, however, laws restricting access to abortions have little impact on reducing abortion rates. In fact, abortion rates are slightly higher in countries with more restrictive access to abortion.

Ms. Nash points out that many countries that restrict abortion access develop underground networks for providing illegal abortion services. This has not happened in the U.S. since 1973, when Roe v. Wade upheld the legality of abortion. In 1965, illegal abortions accounted for one-sixth of all U.S. pregnancy-related deaths.

“Highly restrictive laws do not eliminate the practice of abortion, but make those that do occur more likely to be unsafe,” a 2018 report by the Guttmacher Institute states.

“It’s naive to think that abortion being banned means there would be no abortion. What that means is abortion would be available to those with money and means, and much less available to those with fewer resources,” Ms. Nash says.

Who is getting abortions? And when are they getting them?

Three in four abortion patients are low-income, and one of the most common reasons they cite for seeking an abortion is that they can’t afford a child. Most already have children, and most are in their 20s.

Nearly two-thirds of abortions occur within the first eight weeks of pregnancy, with almost all abortions (91.1%) occurring within the first trimester (before 13 weeks). Some 7.6% of abortions occur between 14 and 20 weeks’ gestation, and 1.3% occur after 21 weeks, which is about halfway through the second trimester.

What about “late-term” abortions?

Medically and legally, there is no definition for late-term abortion. However, when that term is used, it typically means after the 21st week of pregnancy, when the fetus may be viable, or capable of living independently, outside of the womb. Because there is no technical definition, there are a lot of misperceptions around what late-term abortion really means.

The statistics of late-term abortions do only so much to clarify the issue, but they do show that they are rare: 1.3%. Very little research has been done to show why these abortions take place. In some cases, they take place due to severe medical complications that mean the fetus will not be able to live outside the womb or that risk the life of the mother. There have also been cases where women sought and received abortions later in their pregnancies because they could not get access to an abortion sooner. Statistically speaking, there is little concrete data to show the main cause of late-term abortions. This leaves room for activists on both sides of the issue to create a narrative that fits their purposes.

“We don’t have any data about abortions in the third trimester – what are they for, what are the reasons for them?” Ms. Nash says. “Not having information allows people to spread misinformation, because there isn’t solid evidence to rebut it.”

AUSTIN – As Wendy Davis prepares to announce her bid to be Texas’s next governor, Republicans can barely contain their glee. Attorney General Greg Abbott, their likely gubernatorial nominee, will get to match up against the woman conservative blogger Erick Erickson called “Abortion Barbie.” For Davis, the issue that made her famous is widely considered here to be the very one she will have to spend the entire campaign running from.

But a funny thing is happening on the way to this red-state rout: Abbott is the one trying to avoid talking about his position on abortion. By taking a position on abortion that is extreme even in Texas — he’s against exceptions for rape and incest and oddly obscure on the life of the mother — Abbott makes Davis look moderate in comparison and could give her an opening to court the white suburban women who hold the key to victory.

Even in Republican strongholds, Republicans pay heavy prices for opposing rape exceptions for abortion. Last year, Republicans lost Senate seats in Indiana and in Missouri when their nominees parsed whether pregnancies from rape were “ something God intended” or, in the case of Todd Akin, even possible. Akin’s “legitimate rape” quip even drew a rebuke from Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who said Akin was “off-base, insensitive and a distraction from the important issue of protecting life.”

Give Perry credit for knowing that rape can cause pregnancy and for clearly stating that he doesn’t support exceptions for rape and incest but supports one to save the mother’s life. His position makes for lousy policy, but at least he has the guts to say so in unambiguous terms.

We can’t say the same for Abbott, his heir apparent. There’s no question that Abbott opposes abortion rights. Less clear is what exactly that means. When asked what exceptions he supports, Abbott waffles.

“If you’re really pro-life, you want to save every life, but that also includes the mother’s life,” he said this summer. “The life of the mother is just as precious as the life of the child.”

So he supports an exception to save the mother’s life?

And you want to help both the child and the mother,” he said, which, in the context of outlawing specific health-care decisions, means exactly nothing.

I'm still pro-choice, but the left worries me

By Saritha Prabhu

On abortion, extremism rules.

We're increasingly seeing the debate being dominated by the extremists on both sides. We've also seen, in the past few years, the debate shifting on many fronts. The political left has gone from at least paying lip service to the Bill Clinton standard of ""safe, legal and rare"" to increasing comfort with more abortion.

The zeitgeist trend on the liberal side is toward the almost-celebratory, in-your-face tone seen in ""Shout your abortion,"" and also abortion-rights-expanding bills in Virginia, New York and elsewhere.

The right has met this with its own monstrous counterpart: The recent Alabama law is precisely designed to challenge the Supreme Court to take up the case — a ban on abortion except to protect the life of the mother and serious jail time for abortion providers.

What our readers are saying

This is how we do it, folks. Thanks to the Supreme Court upholding part of the Indiana law, we keep chipping away at these pro-abortion laws bit by bit. Eventually, we will prevail in saving human lives from destruction out of inconvenience.

We are relieved that Indiana at least dropped the part of the original bill that required the family to keep the fetus at home, take it on family vacations, and send it to college ... whew. In other words, the government of Indiana did not yet entirely take over all decisions for individuals; not yet.

— Mary Melcher

The Supreme Court delivered a small victory in establishing that an unborn baby is a person who has dignity and autonomy, and deserves a respectful burial.

This is sickening! This is just pushing religious beliefs onto others. God does not judge us; he loves us and understands the decisions we make. Who's making money from the Supreme Court upholding this part of the Indiana law?

""We are called to use our voice to speak the truth on behalf of innocent lives that are sacred and that are worthy of our protection,"" she noted. ""And I can't help but ask and wonder if future generations will ask how did 21st century Americans not see the harms in what they were doing?""

""Halt this bloodlust and work to protect unborn and born babies rather than provide a killing oasis,"" Stanek said.

These legislators are pleading with Americans to contact their representatives in Congress to sign the discharge petition for the Born Alive Protection Act. If that gets 218 signatures, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has to let the bill come to the floor.",www1.cbn.com,right,6kHev8wOHlpEPq94

JACKSON, Miss. - A federal judge Sunday temporarily blocked enforcement of a Mississippi law that could shut down the only abortion clinic in the state.

U.S. District Judge Daniel P. Jordan in Jackson issued a temporary restraining order the day the new law took effect.

He set a July 11 hearing to determine whether to block the law for a longer time.

“Though the debate over abortion continues, there exists legal precedent the court must follow,” Jordan wrote.

The law requires anyone performing abortions at the state’s only clinic to be an OB-GYN with privileges to admit patients to a local hospital. Such privileges can be difficult to obtain, and the clinic contends the mandate is designed to put it out of business. A clinic spokeswoman, Betty Thompson, has said the two physicians who do abortions there are OB-GYNs who travel from other states.

The clinic, Jackson Women’s Health Organization, filed a lawsuit seeking to block it. The suit says the admitting privileges requirement is not medically necessary and is designed to put the clinic out of business.

If Jackson Women’s Health Organization closes, Mississippi would be the only state without an abortion clinic.

Republican Gov. Phil Bryant has said repeatedly he wants Mississippi to be abortion-free. Bryant spokesman Mick Bullock was preparing a response Sunday night to the judge’s decision to issue a temporary restraining order.

In the order, Jordan wrote: “Plaintiffs have offered evidence - including quotes from significant legislative and executive officers - that the Act’s purpose is to eliminate abortions in Mississippi. They likewise submitted evidence that no safety or health concerns motivated its passage. This evidence has not yet been rebutted.”

Jordan also wrote that Jackson Women’s Health Organization is “the only regular provider of abortions in Mississippi, and as of the Act’s effective date, JWHO cannot comply with its requirements.”

The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments Wednesday in a case testing the constitutionality of buffer zones at abortion clinics .
Fourteen years ago , the court upheld Colorado 's 8-foot `` floating '' buffer zones around individuals to protect patients and staff entering and exiting these clinics . Since then , buffer zones have prevented demonstrators from closely approaching patients and staff without permission .
But the issue is back before a different and more conservative Supreme Court .
The Massachusetts law prohibits anyone from standing within 35 feet of the entrance to a reproductive health care facility where abortions take place . That distance , the length of a school bus , takes the average person about 7 seconds to walk . And , according to the law , anyone can walk through it — as long as their purpose is to enter the facility or cross to the other side of the zone .
The zone is marked by a painted yellow line , and anybody who remains standing in it is asked to move outside the line .
Lead plaintiff Eleanor McCullen is a member of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue and a part-time prison chaplain . She looks like a typical cheery grandmother , and has been standing outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Boston every Tuesday and Wednesday for the past 13 years .
As McCullen describes it , she asks women to `` just talk a minute before you rush in . You rush in so quickly , and then you come out in tears . '' She tells women : `` There 's another option other than taking the child , the small boy or girl , from the womb . '' And she says she and other Operation Rescue volunteers have provided housing , medical help , even baby showers to help women who decide not to have an abortion . On her refrigerator , she keeps photos of all of the babies she says she has saved .
But McCullen says the buffer zone violates her First Amendment rights and prevents her from communicating with complete effectiveness . `` It 's America , '' she says . `` I should be able to walk and talk gently , lovingly , anywhere with anybody . ''
Inside the Planned Parenthood Clinic in Boston , officials say 90 percent of their work is primary care , contraception , cancer screening and gynecological services — not abortion . But because of the abortions that are performed , the clinic has considerable security .
And in the building 's atrium stands a stark reminder of the darkest days for Planned Parenthood in Boston : a plaque dedicated to two clinic personnel killed by a gunman , who also wounded five others , in 1994 .
The Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts is led by Marty Walz , a former member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives . In 2007 , while in the state Legislature , she co-sponsored the buffer zone legislation now at issue . She compares the law with other buffer zone laws — in Massachusetts and many other states — enacted to protect people going to funerals , political conventions and polling places .

Supreme Court Considers Legality Of Abortion Clinic Buffer Zones Listen · 7:46 7:46

The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments Wednesday in a case testing the constitutionality of buffer zones at abortion clinics.

Fourteen years ago, the court upheld Colorado's 8-foot ""floating"" buffer zones around individuals to protect patients and staff entering and exiting these clinics. Since then, buffer zones have prevented demonstrators from closely approaching patients and staff without permission.

But the issue is back before a different and more conservative Supreme Court.

The Massachusetts law prohibits anyone from standing within 35 feet of the entrance to a reproductive health care facility where abortions take place. That distance, the length of a school bus, takes the average person about 7 seconds to walk. And, according to the law, anyone can walk through it — as long as their purpose is to enter the facility or cross to the other side of the zone.

'Just Talk A Minute'

The zone is marked by a painted yellow line, and anybody who remains standing in it is asked to move outside the line.

Lead plaintiff Eleanor McCullen is a member of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue and a part-time prison chaplain. She looks like a typical cheery grandmother, and has been standing outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Boston every Tuesday and Wednesday for the past 13 years.

As McCullen describes it, she asks women to ""just talk a minute before you rush in. You rush in so quickly, and then you come out in tears."" She tells women: ""There's another option other than taking the child, the small boy or girl, from the womb."" And she says she and other Operation Rescue volunteers have provided housing, medical help, even baby showers to help women who decide not to have an abortion. On her refrigerator, she keeps photos of all of the babies she says she has saved.

But McCullen says the buffer zone violates her First Amendment rights and prevents her from communicating with complete effectiveness. ""It's America,"" she says. ""I should be able to walk and talk gently, lovingly, anywhere with anybody.""

Inside the Planned Parenthood Clinic in Boston, officials say 90 percent of their work is primary care, contraception, cancer screening and gynecological services — not abortion. But because of the abortions that are performed, the clinic has considerable security.

And in the building's atrium stands a stark reminder of the darkest days for Planned Parenthood in Boston: a plaque dedicated to two clinic personnel killed by a gunman, who also wounded five others, in 1994.

Public Sidewalks And Polling Places

The Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts is led by Marty Walz, a former member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. In 2007, while in the state Legislature, she co-sponsored the buffer zone legislation now at issue. She compares the law with other buffer zone laws — in Massachusetts and many other states — enacted to protect people going to funerals, political conventions and polling places.

She contrasts the 35-foot buffer zone around the clinic with the ""150-foot buffer zone around every polling place"" in Massachusetts on Election Day. At polling places, even those handing out literature have to stay 150 feet from the entrance.

""There's even a buffer zone around the Supreme Court,"" Walz points out. In fact, the U.S. Supreme Court does ban all demonstrations, vigils, picketing and speech-making on its 252-by-98-foot plaza, allowing demonstrations only on the adjacent public sidewalk.

The court has justified its policy by saying the plaza is ""not a traditional public forum,"" according to Catholic University law professor Mark Rienzi, who represents the anti-abortion demonstrators in Massachusetts. Whether or not one agrees with that distinction, he says, in contrast, ""Public sidewalks are places that people are supposed to be free to exchange information and exchange ideas.""

Moreover, if demonstrators are such a threat to people at the clinic, he asks, why were there no prosecutions in the seven years before this law took effect? Massachusetts then had a 6-foot floating buffer zone, a provision similar to the one in Colorado that was upheld in 2000.

'An Issue Of Safety'

Law enforcement authorities and clinic personnel paint a different picture. They say the situation outside the clinic was frequently chaotic, with anti-abortion and pro-abortion rights demonstrators often toe to toe at the entrance, a scene one volunteer who helped escort patients into the clinic likened to linebackers on the 1-yard line.

""On a day-to-day basis there was an issue of safety, of people trying to get in the clinic being approached"" and ""physically harassed,"" says Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley. At clinics outside Boston, she says, demonstrators routinely stuck literature through car windows as they approached, thus endangering both those in the car and the demonstrators themselves.

Not so, asserts Planned Parenthood's Walz. The 35-foot buffer zone is a reasonable time, place and manner regulation of speech — akin to regulating how loud you can play music at night. ""Nothing else in our 30-year history has worked,"" she adds.

Prosecuting people after they've violated criminal statutes doesn't solve anything, Walz says. ""What you want to do,"" she says, ""is create an environment where people can get health care when they need it, when they have an appointment, rather than have them leave because they're afraid or blocked from getting in the door, and then seeking a remedy."" At that point, ""they've been deprived of access to health care.""

The Legal Questions

At the Supreme Court on Wednesday, there are essentially two questions:

First, does the Massachusetts buffer zone law go too far, or is it permissible under the court's 2000 ruling allowing some buffer zones?

Second, should the court reverse that 2000 decision entirely? The vote in that case was 6-to-3, with the majority ruling that in situations like those at abortion clinics, unwilling listeners have some right to be let alone.

The dissenters, however, were furious. Justice Antonin Scalia delivered a rare and blistering oral dissent when the opinion was announced. ""Does the deck seem stacked?"" he thundered. ""You bet.""

He went on to say that ""our longstanding commitment to uninhibited, robust and wide-open debate is miraculously replaced by the power of the state to protect an unheard of right to be let alone on the public streets.""

Scalia and his fellow dissenters are still on the court. But most of the majority justices from 2000 are gone — replaced in some cases by more conservative justices. Most important, Sandra Day O'Connor has retired and been replaced by George W. Bush appointee Samuel Alito, who has a history of being unsympathetic to abortion rights.

For now, though, outside the Boston Planned Parenthood clinic, the scene remains fairly constant. Eleanor McCullen is there every Tuesday and Wednesday, sometimes standing far outside the buffer zone line. When asked why, she replies: ""I go where the Holy Spirit leads me.""

I couldn’t imagine how anyone could watch those videos and still believe abortion wasn’t murder. Yet, millions don’t.

Because if you’re for abortion, you’re for women, and if you’re against it, you’re a religious bigot who wishes to impose your beliefs on all women in society.

It’s easier to just shut up.

I’m thrilled that Pence brought it up in on the national stage where so few have the guts to do it. And (to paraphrase the great Mark Levin) while it can feel like a lost cause sometimes, if we don’t take these messages and make our case, no one will, and it won’t even be on the table for discussion. And since your rights start with your life, all of the rest of it is peripheral—the tax issues, the foreign policy issues, the role of government— it’s all secondary if the right to life is not first secured.

But here’s the core problem: abortion exists and flourishes in this world because people have been convinced that it’s not a life.

So it’s a moot point. No life, no problem. Then it is, as Sen. Kaine touted, a choice that each woman should simply be allowed to make.

And that’s where the debate is quieted, because (particularly in national politics) if it’s not actually a life, then it really does just become about Republicans and “Bible thumpers” sticking their nose into what doesn’t concern them.

Society’s bought into the lie. And I know I’m not alone in my frustration of how to reach people.

That’s key here. We who believe in God know for an irrefutable fact that God is our creator, but the beautiful thing about this world that He created is that His Creation can be explained in scientific terms, too; terms that even people who reject a belief in God have a hard time denying.

Ms. Isabell was pro-choice herself once, and actively helped perform abortions. Today, she uses her extensive understanding of the facts of human biology to explain her position on life. And, “without fail, my students ask me the questions that they hear argued in the media [about the abortion debate],” Isabell recounts.

Her answers are magnificent. Allow me to illustrate her conversations:

When does life begin? (Mary Ramirez)

When can it be considered a human? (Mary Ramirez)

At this point she concludes to her class: “So now we all can agree that we have established that abortion is killing a living human.”

Still, the students have questions. “Why shouldn’t a woman be able to do what she wants with her body?”

Doesn't a woman get to choose? (Mary Ramirez)

For the record, does any of this sound like fluffy religious doctrine to you?

Let’s head back to the Vice Presidential debate for a moment. Remember when Sen. Kaine said he doesn’t believe in mandating the doctrines of any one religion?

White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News that the administration is simply recognizing `` that abortion is not family planning . This is family planning money . ''
An administration official told Fox News that the Department of Health and Human Services officially filed the rule with the Office of Management and Budget on Friday .

President Trump recently took to Twitter to tout his pro-life victories , but there 's something about the tweets that made abortion opponents take a second look .
`` I am strongly pro-life , with the three exceptions rape , incest and protecting the life of the mother - the same position taken by Ronald Reagan , '' Trump tweeted .
As most people know , and for those who would like to know , I am strongly Pro-Life , with the three exceptions - Rape , Incest and protecting the Life of the mother - the same position taken by Ronald Reagan . We have come very far in the last two years with 105 wonderful new ..... — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) May 19 , 2019
He is n't alone , other leading conservatives question if recent laws go too far .
`` I do n't support the Alabama law , I believe there ought to be exceptions , I am pro-life but there ought to be exceptions , '' Sen. Mitt Romney ( R-UT ) told CNN State of the Union .
`` In my whole political career , I also believed in ( exceptions for ) rape , incest , or life of the mother . There was exceptions , that 's exactly what Republicans have voted on in this House , '' said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R-CA ) .
But for some pro-life advocates , the recent laws are merely an opening battle for war at the Supreme Court .

President Trump recently took to Twitter to tout his pro-life victories, but there's something about the tweets that made abortion opponents take a second look.

""I am strongly pro-life, with the three exceptions rape, incest and protecting the life of the mother - the same position taken by Ronald Reagan,"" Trump tweeted.

As most people know, and for those who would like to know, I am strongly Pro-Life, with the three exceptions - Rape, Incest and protecting the Life of the mother - the same position taken by Ronald Reagan. We have come very far in the last two years with 105 wonderful new..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 19, 2019

He isn't alone, other leading conservatives question if recent laws go too far.

""I don't support the Alabama law, I believe there ought to be exceptions, I am pro-life but there ought to be exceptions,"" Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) told CNN State of the Union.

""In my whole political career, I also believed in (exceptions for) rape, incest, or life of the mother. There was exceptions, that's exactly what Republicans have voted on in this House,"" said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).

But for some pro-life advocates, the recent laws are merely an opening battle for war at the Supreme Court.

""Actually, for the future of our country, Roe is destined to become a historical footnote,"" said Kristan Hawkins of Students for Life of America.

""No law is constitutional until the Supreme Court actually revisits Roe v Wade,"" said Alabama state Rep. Terri Collins.

When it comes to the life issue, the Trump administration says nobody has worked harder to fight abortion, appointing conservative judges from the lower courts on the federal level all the way to the US Supreme Court.

""We stand without apology for the sanctity of human life,"" Vice President Mike Pence recently told graduates of Liberty University.

It's a battle they vow to continue and one that Democratic presidential candidates welcome.

Williamson, Bill Corsair, Jason Richwine","Today , tens of thousands of Americans have traveled to Washington , D.C. , for the 45th annual March for Life . They come from all across our nation , and from every walk of life – students of every age , blue-collar workers , people of many backgrounds , mothers and fathers , sons and daughters .
Yet no matter their story , today they will join hands and hearts on the National Mall , and with one voice they will call on the United States of America to rededicate itself to the most fundamental right enshrined in our Declaration of Independence – the unalienable right to life .
Thanks to their courage , and thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump , life is winning in America again .
This year , President Trump will personally address the March for Life from the Rose Garden of the White House – something no president has ever done . It is fitting that he is the first to take such a historic step , because since the outset of this administration , we ’ ve taken historic action to protect the most vulnerable in our society .
In one of his very first acts in office , President Trump reinstated the Mexico City policy , to prevent American foreign aid from going to organizations that promote or perform abortions . Our administration has also broadened this policy to cover nearly $ 9 billion in foreign aid .
We ’ ve stopped U.S. funding for the United Nations Population Fund , so American taxpayers won ’ t have to support abortion in such countries as China .
We ’ ve reversed the last administration ’ s policy and empowered states to defund Planned Parenthood and devote those resources to women ’ s-health providers . It was my great honor to cast the tie-breaking vote for this bill in the United States Senate .
And President Trump has been nominating – and will continue to nominate – strict constructionists to the federal courts at every level , men and women who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution .
And today , when he speaks to the March for Life , President Trump will announce new policies to further protect life and conscience .
In short , life is winning in America again . It ’ s winning because of the policies of our administration , and because of the commitment and compassion of those who gather today in our nation ’ s capital , and in marches , meetings , and homes all across the country .
Life is winning through the steady advance of science that illuminates when life begins .
Life is winning through the generosity of millions of adoptive families , who open their hearts and homes to children in need .
Life is winning through the compassion of caregivers and volunteers at crisis-pregnancy centers and faith-based organizations who bring comfort and care to women , in cities and towns across this country .
And life is winning through the quiet counsel between mothers and daughters , grandmothers and granddaughters , between friends across kitchen tables , and over coffee on college campuses , where the truth is being told , and hope is defeating despair .
When President Trump addresses the March for Life , it will mark the unprecedented progress we have made in the cause of life . Yet for all that we ’ ve accomplished , for all the lives that have been saved , and all the victories that have been won , the harder work still lies ahead .

Today’s March for Life sends a strong message.

Today, tens of thousands of Americans have traveled to Washington, D.C., for the 45th annual March for Life. They come from all across our nation, and from every walk of life – students of every age, blue-collar workers, people of many backgrounds, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters.

Yet no matter their story, today they will join hands and hearts on the National Mall, and with one voice they will call on the United States of America to rededicate itself to the most fundamental right enshrined in our Declaration of Independence – the unalienable right to life.

Thanks to their courage, and thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump, life is winning in America again.

This year, President Trump will personally address the March for Life from the Rose Garden of the White House – something no president has ever done. It is fitting that he is the first to take such a historic step, because since the outset of this administration, we’ve taken historic action to protect the most vulnerable in our society.

In one of his very first acts in office, President Trump reinstated the Mexico City policy, to prevent American foreign aid from going to organizations that promote or perform abortions. Our administration has also broadened this policy to cover nearly $9 billion in foreign aid.

We’ve stopped U.S. funding for the United Nations Population Fund, so American taxpayers won’t have to support abortion in such countries as China.

We’ve reversed the last administration’s policy and empowered states to defund Planned Parenthood and devote those resources to women’s-health providers. It was my great honor to cast the tie-breaking vote for this bill in the United States Senate.

And President Trump has been nominating – and will continue to nominate – strict constructionists to the federal courts at every level, men and women who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution.

And today, when he speaks to the March for Life, President Trump will announce new policies to further protect life and conscience.

In short, life is winning in America again. It’s winning because of the policies of our administration, and because of the commitment and compassion of those who gather today in our nation’s capital, and in marches, meetings, and homes all across the country.

Life is winning through the steady advance of science that illuminates when life begins.

Life is winning through the generosity of millions of adoptive families, who open their hearts and homes to children in need.

Life is winning through the compassion of caregivers and volunteers at crisis-pregnancy centers and faith-based organizations who bring comfort and care to women, in cities and towns across this country.

And life is winning through the quiet counsel between mothers and daughters, grandmothers and granddaughters, between friends across kitchen tables, and over coffee on college campuses, where the truth is being told, and hope is defeating despair.

When President Trump addresses the March for Life, it will mark the unprecedented progress we have made in the cause of life. Yet for all that we’ve accomplished, for all the lives that have been saved, and all the victories that have been won, the harder work still lies ahead.

We must continue to be a movement that embraces all and cares for all out of respect for the dignity and worth of every person. We must recommit ourselves to be a movement of compassion, not confrontation, of generosity, not judgment, and above all else, we must continue to be a movement of love.

This I know we’ll do – because I have faith.

We will restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law.

I have faith in the goodness of the American people. I have faith in the president they elected. And I have that other kind of faith – the faith that moves mountains, and that, even now, stirs all across America.

And with the courage of all who march on this day, with the leadership of President Donald Trump in the White House, and with the guidance and grace of God above, I know that we will restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law – for ourselves, and our posterity.

If so , the Trump administration is here to help !
The US Department of Health and Human Services has created a webinar entitled “ Focusing on Fertility , ” to introduce you to the world of “ fertility awareness , ” a method of natural family planning that involves charting your menstrual cycles , your daily body temperature , and the consistency of your vaginal secretions . An approach once largely the province of the Catholic Church , where the rhythm method reigned supreme , fertility-awareness based methods ( FABM ) are its more sophisticated successor . But now , courtesy of the Trump administration and your tax dollars , anyone can learn how to avoid getting pregnant with natural methods that HHS claims “ are up to 98 percent effective ” at preventing pregnancy .
The president may be a philandering , twice-divorced libertine , but the fertility-awareness webinar is yet another example of how much the religious right is driving his administration ’ s social policy . Alex Azar , an anti-abortion , Orthodox Christian who considers Vice President Mike Pence a mentor , is the head of Trump ’ s HHS . He has stocked the agency with like-minded lieutenants , and together they have reshaped HHS women ’ s health programs to suit the agenda of evangelical Christian and Catholic activists who not only oppose abortion , but also most forms of birth control and comprehensive sex education .
To that end , the agency has gone all in for so-called natural family planning , even as it has been methodically dismantling programs that broaden access to effective contraception . Last year , after imposing draconian anti-abortion rules on the Title X program that led Planned Parenthood to relinquish $ 60 million in funding and drop out , the administration rewrote the criteria for organizations applying to receive Title X family planning grants . The new grants prioritize groups that promote abstinence and FABM , as opposed to contraceptives . This year , HHS awarded a $ 1.7 million , three-year Title X grant to a Catholic nonprofit , Obria , to provide family planning services that only include natural family planning and abstinence counseling but no more conventional methods of birth control—not even condoms .
The FABM webinar , which aired live in June and is now on YouTube , was done in partnership between the Office of Population Affairs , which oversees Title X , and the Center for Faith and Opportunity Initiatives—the religious outreach arm first created by President George W. Bush , which Trump revived at HHS in May 2018 through executive order . The center is run by Shannon Royce , an anti-LGBT and anti-abortion activist who previously worked at the evangelical Family Research Council and who has been instrumental in the Trump administration ’ s rollback of health protections for transgender people .
The webinar ’ s lead presenter is Marguerite Duane , a doctor who runs the non-profit advocacy group FACTS : the Fertility Appreciation Collaborative to Teach the Science . She is trained to teach the Creighton Model , a natural family planning method developed by the Pope Paul VI Institute for the Study of Human Reproduction . Founded in 1985 by a ( male ) Catholic doctor in Nebraska to build “ a culture of life in women ’ s health care , ” the institute is named for the pope who issued Humanae vitae , the controversial 1968 encyclical forbidding Catholic women from using contraception .
An outspoken critic of birth control as harmful to women , Duane is not exactly a dispassionate medical professional . She made some waves in 2017 when she wrote a piece in the conservative periodical The Federalist arguing that the reproductive-rights activists seeking to make contraception more accessible through the Affordable Care Act were ignoring the science about its risks . Indeed , she questioned the premise that birth control was even “ necessary ” for women ’ s health .
“ Government contraceptive programs inevitably change the sex , dating and marriage markets in ways that lead to more empty sex , more non-marital births and more abortions . ”
She is also a member of a grassroots advocacy group called Women Speak for Themselves that was organized in 2012 by a Catholic law professor to fight the ACA ’ s contraception mandate in court and public opinion . According to their website , the group represents the thousands of women who had “ experienced the ways contraception and abortion have immiserated women. ” In 2012 , the group wrote an open letter to President Obama and HHS arguing that “ government contraceptive programs inevitably change the sex , dating and marriage markets in ways that lead to more empty sex , more non-marital births and more abortions . ”
None of this background is conveyed in the HHS webinar , which identifies Duane as a board-certified family practitioner and adjunct associate professor at Georgetown medical school . Katelyn Walls , a special assistant at the HHS Center for Faith and Opportunity Initiatives , kicks off the webinar by noting , for housekeeping purposes , that it is solely educational and “ off-the-record and not intended for press purposes . ”
Walls first introduces Diane Foley , the deputy assistant secretary in charge of the HHS Office of Population Affairs , which oversees Title X. Foley is also a doctor and anti-abortion activist who is morally opposed to birth control . A vocal opponent of comprehensive sex education , she once suggested that showing high school students how to put condoms on bananas could be “ sexually harassing. ” But on the webinar , she shows no such prudishness in welcoming viewers for a graphic online discussion of vaginas , lubrication , menstrual cycles , sperm , and of course , sex .
After explaining that her office has a mandate from Congress to promote natural family planning , Foley introduces Duane . She begins her power-point presentation by stating that despite what people may have heard , “ Modern fertility-based methods are not the rhythm method. ” They are based on science , she insists . Duane guides viewers through the monthly stages of a woman ’ s fertility and describes the changes in cervical mucous that occur throughout the cycle—from “ cold , dry ” to “ moist , fertile , ” according to one slide that poetically compares the cycle to the seasons .
How effective is this method of pregnancy prevention ? “ Effectiveness rates are about the same as the pill and better than condoms , ” Duane asserts . Fertility-awareness based methods , she says , have been proven to result in an unintended pregnancy rate of less than 2 percent a year .
For women familiar with the major pitfalls of rhythm method , i.e . that it doesn ’ t work , 2 percent is a staggering statistic—a figure on par with the most effective forms of implantable contraception like the IUD . It ’ s also wildly misleading . Here ’ s why : Most of the research on the effectiveness of FABM is junk science . In a systematic review published in the medical journal Obstetrics & Gynecology in 2018 , researchers from a wide range of ideological perspectives , including FABM proponents , looked at virtually every study ever done on the effectiveness of fertility awareness methods . They concluded that the vast majority of the 53 studies they identified were of low quality .
Some that focused on Duane ’ s Creighton Model were among the worst , in part because of the unusual way investigators classified pregnancies . If a woman using the Creighton method got pregnant after having sex on a fertile day , the investigators assumed this was “ achieving [ pregnancy ] -related behavior. ” Chelsea Polis , a senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute , a reproductive health organization , and one of the authors of the 2018 systematic review , explains that effectiveness studies for other contraceptive methods would have counted those pregnancies as a contraceptive failure . But investigators on most Creighton studies considered those pregnancies a success . After all , investigators assumed , if a woman got pregnant on a fertile day , she must have intended to do so , and they excluded those pregnancies from the failure rate . “ Excluding these pregnancies could substantially underestimate Creighton failure rates , ” Polis says , “ making estimates for the method look more effective than they may actually be . ”
Even the better studies were flawed . The authors concluded that the effectiveness rate of the various FABMs could vary wildly , from a low of 1.8 or as high as 34 percent—a rate twice as high or higher than some of the least effective forms of birth control such as an old-fashioned diaphragm or condom . In an email , Duane argued that the low-quality studies tended to be older , and very small , and that “ more recent high quality studies demonstrate these methods can be used effectively to prevent pregnancy . ”
Even before the 2018 systematic review , the Centers for Disease Control has long pegged the failure rate for FABMs at a pretty dismal 24 percent , a figure that has irked natural family planning advocates . Critics have argued that the CDC ’ s figure unfairly lumped the rhythm method in with more effective modern biomarker-based fertility awareness methods that use ovulation detectors and other tools . In May 2017 , Duane ’ s FACTS launched a petition drive to demand that the CDC adjust its published failure rate based on newer studies to make FABMs look better compared with other forms of birth control . The petition never garnered many signatures and was never submitted . Nonetheless , this year , the CDC reassessed its public data and now says the failure rates for FABMs vary from 2 to 23 percent . ( HHS launched the fertility webinar in response to that adjustment , according to a spokesperson . )
Despite the CDC ’ s adjustment , Mary Alice Carter , senior advisor to the HHS watchdog group Equity Forward , says HHS is being irresponsible to suggest in the webinar that fertility awareness works as well as contraception . The Trump administration , she says , is “ propagandizing against the pill and other hormonal forms of birth control in favor of these fertility awareness-type methods , even though we know they are not the most effective or the best choice for most people. ” She says that if you look closely at the research , it ’ s clear that achieving a 98 percent effectiveness rate through fertility awareness is extremely difficult . “ The amount of perfection it requires and the amount of steps it requires , ” she says , “ would put it out of reach for most people . ”
There is a reason that fewer than 2 percent of American women use some sort of fertility awareness method to prevent pregnancy—and is likely also the reason that only 118 people signed on to watch the fertility webinar air live . The most effective natural methods aren ’ t particularly useful for impulsive teenagers , for instance , or , say , Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels . They require intensive training , including hours of classes over many months , and dedication to tracking all the various biomarkers—from daily body temperature to cervical mucus to urinary hormone metabolites—not to mention a joint commitment to periodic abstinence . “ It takes a particular kind of relationship and context and user to make these [ methods ] work , ” Polis says .
In the webinar , Duane allows that FAMB is high-maintenance and urges viewers not to simply try using one of the many online apps devoted to tracking fertility without proper instruction from a trained professional like herself . ( The FDA recently approved an app called Natural Cycles as a medical device for contraception . ) Perhaps more importantly , she recognizes that natural family planning requires a cooperative partner . “ These truly are shared methods of family planning , ” she says .
The limitations of FABM , and their distinctly religious foundation , raise the question of whether the fertility webinar is really the best use of HHS resources . Mara Gandal-Powers , director of birth control access at the National Women ’ s Law Center , says FABM has a role to play as one of a wide range of options for women , but the demand is still very small . She thinks it ’ s not something the government would be prioritizing “ if they were being responsive to family planning providers or women . ”
But natural family planning isn ’ t just about preventing pregnancy , Duane assures us in the webinar . It offers wide-ranging health benefits . Once embarked on fertility awareness , women will find these methods can help them deal with PMS , recognize menopause , and even get pregnant , according to the webinar . ( As proof of concept , Duane has four children , whose timing she credited in an email to her line of work . )
After Duane wraps up her spiel with a plug for natural family planning as an antidote to the mainstream medical complex , Lisa Jurski takes over . A physical therapist , Jurski also teaches the Creighton method in Chicago and is here to persuade viewers that spending months trying to accurately work out their fertility window and then giving up sex for 12 days every month is preferable to just getting an IUD or going on the pill .
She admits that “ abstinence is commonly cited in the mainstream medical literature as a disadvantage of FABMs. ” Not to worry , she counters . FABMs have gotten a bad rap . People who use natural methods , she says , in fact find that they have better sex as a result , albeit less frequent . “ Periodic abstinence increases their anticipation , ” she says imparting a secret about the male libido .
Among her other big selling points : Research shows that natural family planning is good for your relationship . Women who use these methods , she says , “ report feeling more respected and less used. ” The divorce rate among couples using fertility awareness methods is only 1 percent , according to one study Jurski cites . It ’ s easy to see why , she explains . “ If you can talk about cervical mucus , you can talk about anything. ” Another likely reason , unstated , is that all those couples who are most committed to using fertility awareness just could be devout Catholics and conservative Christians who are opposed to divorce .
The webinar is not a detailed guide for personal use . For more information and assistance in choosing the right method for you , Jurski directs viewers to the website of a group called Natural Womanhood , a nonprofit opposed to hormonal contraception . It ’ s run by Gerard Migeon .","Ladies, have you ever wanted to learn the fertile secrets hidden in your cervical mucus? If so, the Trump administration is here to help!

In May 2017, Duane’s FACTS launched a petition drive to demand that the CDC adjust its published failure rate based on newer studies to make FABMs look better compared with other forms of birth control. The petition never garnered many signatures and was never submitted. Nonetheless, this year, the CDC reassessed its public data and now says the failure rates for FABMs vary from 2 to 23 percent. (HHS launched the fertility webinar in response to that adjustment, according to a spokesperson.)

Despite the CDC’s adjustment, Mary Alice Carter, senior advisor to the HHS watchdog group Equity Forward, says HHS is being irresponsible to suggest in the webinar that fertility awareness works as well as contraception. The Trump administration, she says, is “propagandizing against the pill and other hormonal forms of birth control in favor of these fertility awareness-type methods, even though we know they are not the most effective or the best choice for most people.” She says that if you look closely at the research, it’s clear that achieving a 98 percent effectiveness rate through fertility awareness is extremely difficult. “The amount of perfection it requires and the amount of steps it requires,” she says, “would put it out of reach for most people.”

There is a reason that fewer than 2 percent of American women use some sort of fertility awareness method to prevent pregnancy—and is likely also the reason that only 118 people signed on to watch the fertility webinar air live. The most effective natural methods aren’t particularly useful for impulsive teenagers, for instance, or, say, Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels. They require intensive training, including hours of classes over many months, and dedication to tracking all the various biomarkers—from daily body temperature to cervical mucus to urinary hormone metabolites—not to mention a joint commitment to periodic abstinence. “It takes a particular kind of relationship and context and user to make these [methods] work,” Polis says.

In the webinar, Duane allows that FAMB is high-maintenance and urges viewers not to simply try using one of the many online apps devoted to tracking fertility without proper instruction from a trained professional like herself. (The FDA recently approved an app called Natural Cycles as a medical device for contraception.) Perhaps more importantly, she recognizes that natural family planning requires a cooperative partner. “These truly are shared methods of family planning,” she says.

“These truly are shared methods of family planning.”

The limitations of FABM, and their distinctly religious foundation, raise the question of whether the fertility webinar is really the best use of HHS resources. Mara Gandal-Powers, director of birth control access at the National Women’s Law Center, says FABM has a role to play as one of a wide range of options for women, but the demand is still very small. She thinks it’s not something the government would be prioritizing “if they were being responsive to family planning providers or women.”

But natural family planning isn’t just about preventing pregnancy, Duane assures us in the webinar. It offers wide-ranging health benefits. Once embarked on fertility awareness, women will find these methods can help them deal with PMS, recognize menopause, and even get pregnant, according to the webinar. (As proof of concept, Duane has four children, whose timing she credited in an email to her line of work.)

After Duane wraps up her spiel with a plug for natural family planning as an antidote to the mainstream medical complex, Lisa Jurski takes over. A physical therapist, Jurski also teaches the Creighton method in Chicago and is here to persuade viewers that spending months trying to accurately work out their fertility window and then giving up sex for 12 days every month is preferable to just getting an IUD or going on the pill.

She admits that “abstinence is commonly cited in the mainstream medical literature as a disadvantage of FABMs.” Not to worry, she counters. FABMs have gotten a bad rap. People who use natural methods, she says, in fact find that they have better sex as a result, albeit less frequent. “Periodic abstinence increases their anticipation,” she says imparting a secret about the male libido.

Among her other big selling points: Research shows that natural family planning is good for your relationship. Women who use these methods, she says, “report feeling more respected and less used.” The divorce rate among couples using fertility awareness methods is only 1 percent, according to one study Jurski cites. It’s easy to see why, she explains. “If you can talk about cervical mucus, you can talk about anything.” Another likely reason, unstated, is that all those couples who are most committed to using fertility awareness just could be devout Catholics and conservative Christians who are opposed to divorce.

The webinar is not a detailed guide for personal use. For more information and assistance in choosing the right method for you, Jurski directs viewers to the website of a group called Natural Womanhood, a nonprofit opposed to hormonal contraception. It’s run by Gerard Migeon.

Population Fund ( UNFPA ) , the wording dispute is “ unfortunate. ” On the whole , the international community agrees that sexual violence in conflict must be stopped , and victims receive care . Finding a silver lining , Mr. Erken says the Trump administration has continued the U.S. priority of saving women ’ s lives and empowering girls , and notes that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with the UNFPA ’ s executive director . “ He actually said there is more that unites us than divides us , ” Mr. Erken says , “ and we feel that is something we can work with . ”
Removing the phrase , code for abortion among conservative groups , set off a caustic debate , revealing deep global fissures over women ’ s rights . Was it an attack on women ’ s health and rights , or the welcome elevation of the sanctity of unborn life on the global stage ?
For the first time , the Trump administration has scored a victory in imposing the language of its staunch anti-abortion position in the international arena . In a Security Council debate over a resolution on sexual violence in conflict , the U.S. ­succeeded in having the words “ sexual and reproductive health ” stripped from a United Nations text .
For some , it ’ s an attack on women ’ s health and rights . For others , it ’ s a welcome and long-overdue elevation of the sanctity of unborn life on the global stage .
After a couple of years of trying , the Trump administration appears to be making headway in its efforts to take its conservative views on reproductive health policies , including a war on abortion , to the United Nations .
But for many of the United States ’ closest allies , from Britain to France and Germany , the initiative signals an alarming shift away from Western values they have long promoted together , including women ’ s rights and gender equality . Instead , they see their traditional friend and leader moving toward the camp of socially conservative countries like Russia , Saudi Arabia , and others that have not been at the forefront of promoting women ’ s issues at the U.N .
Starting early in the Trump presidency , the administration took a series of actions to strip reproductive health allocations from U.S. foreign assistance . Now the Trump administration has scored a victory in imposing the language of its staunch anti-abortion position in the international arena .
In the U.N. Security Council debate late last month over a German-sponsored resolution on sexual violence in conflict , the U.S. succeeded for the first time in having the words “ sexual and reproductive health ” stripped from a U.N. text . The U.S. threatened to use its veto if the offending phrase was not removed , and ultimately it was .
To many , the phrase might seem to offer little to fuss about , but removing it set off a caustic debate , revealing the deep fissures that continue to mark the international community over the issue of women ’ s rights .
For human rights advocates , removal of the words “ sexual and reproductive health ” from a U.N. resolution represents a worrisome setback for women ’ s equality globally , because the words had over the past quarter century become the standard phrasing used to confirm women ’ s rights , in particular access to prenatal care and other features of reproductive health , and to promote women ’ s empowerment .
Making matters worse , these advocates say , is that it is now the U.S. that has “ switched camps ” and is bringing the setbacks that American women ’ s reproductive health is facing domestically to the international stage . The wave of restrictive abortion legislation moving through a growing number of U.S. states and fomenting bitter debates on women ’ s rights is seen moving to the international arena .
Seth Wenig/AP Members of the U.N. Security Council vote on a resolution concerning sexual violence in warfare , at the United Nations headquarters , on April 23 .
“ It ’ s not news to anyone how important this issue is to Trump ’ s base , but the U.S. bringing its culture wars to the Security Council is completely inappropriate when the protection of civilian victims of sexual violence – women and children – is what ’ s at stake , ” says Anne Marie Goetz , a clinical professor at New York University ’ s Center for Global Affairs and an expert in women ’ s empowerment in peace-building .
But to the community of socially conservative organizations and anti-abortion advocates , particularly in the U.S. , the phrase “ sexual and reproductive health ” had become code for abortion . Worse still , its recurring use suggested to these groups a normalization of abortion and its spread into international policy .
For those organizations , the arrival in Washington of a socially conservative administration – both Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are evangelical Christians who have said their faith directs them in everything they do – represented an opportunity to reverse the absence of anti-abortion convictions in U.S. foreign policy .
“ We ’ re seeing this administration elevate the pro-life cause in foreign policy like never before , and we ’ re very grateful for the U.S. position on this [ sexual violence ] resolution , because it tells us things are changing , ” says Stefano Gennarini , vice president for the Center for Legal Studies at the Center for Family and Human Rights , or C-Fam , in New York .
Mr. Gennarini calls accusations that the U.S. is infecting the consensus-driven policymaking at the U.N. with its own cultural battles “ ridiculous ” – but at the same time he insists it would be wrong to conclude that the arrival of a socially conservative administration in Washington means the global fight for “ conservative family values ” is won .
“ Keep in mind that while it ’ s clear the pro-life cause is moving to the forefront of a conservative U.S. foreign policy , ” he says , “ it ’ s also true that the [ abortion rights ] side is more assertive also and is not about to back down . ”
The U.S. position infuriated allies who have relied on American heft on the Security Council to help promote what for decades have been seen as common Western values – including the rights of women – and to ward off backsliding from those values .
As the French ambassador to the U.N. , Francois Delattre , told his council colleagues the day of the resolution vote , “ It is intolerable and incomprehensible that the Security Council is incapable of acknowledging that women and girls who suffered from sexual violence in conflict – and who obviously didn ’ t choose to become pregnant – should have the right to terminate their pregnancy . ”
Some women ’ s rights advocates said the U.S. action was particularly stinging because it comes at a time when sexual violence in conflict is on the rise and has gained global attention . Harrowing examples of victims of sexual violence in conflict – from the Rohingya in Myanmar to the Yazidis and other victims of Islamic State – not getting care and being forced to carry to term the offspring of rape seem to have multiplied in recent years .
U.S. officials said during the debate on the resolution that while the U.S. agrees that more must be done to care for the victims of sexual violence , it could not agree to any language , explicit or implicit , that suggests acceptance of abortion . After the council vote , the White House indicated the adopted resolution was more “ in line ” with U.S. priorities .
Those priorities during the Trump administration have included setting a standard of “ protecting life in global health assistance ” that bars funding for foreign organizations that include abortion information or access among their services , and cutting funding in 2017 for the U.N. Population Fund , or UNFPA , the U.N. ’ s lead agency on sexual and reproductive health issues .
Dr. Goetz , who worked on women ’ s issues at the U.N. for nearly a decade , says the Trump administration has been making increasingly conservative appointments to U.S. government agencies , such as USAID and Health and Human Services , that play important roles in setting international policies on women ’ s health and empowerment .
Those appointees have sought to strike the “ sexual and reproductive health ” language from documents in other U.N. forums , such as the Commission for the Status of Women . But she says the U.S. has been unsuccessful there because other venues , including the U.N. General Assembly , work by consensus . Only in the Security Council does the U.S. have veto power .
U.N. officials are not happy about what the recent debate on the sexual violence resolution may portend for reproductive health globally , but they also suggest that , given a rising global clamor over abortion , and not just in the U.S. , the outcome could have been worse .
“ Of course it ’ s unfortunate that the words ‘ sexual and reproductive health ’ were taken out , but overall it is not a bad resolution , ” says Arthur Erken , director of communications and strategic partnerships at UNFPA in New York . He notes that the resolution includes a reference to boys and men as victims of sexual violence in conflict – a first – and that it “ reaffirms ” the Security Council ’ s commitment to earlier resolutions on the issue in 2009 and 2013 – both of which include the “ sexual and reproductive health ” language .
“ That tells me that even though the specific words may have been taken out , the resolution is still a confirmation of international support for getting vital services to the victims of sexual violence in conflict , ” he says .
Indeed for Mr. Erken it is “ unfortunate ” that the issue of sexual violence in conflict got mired in a debate over wording , since on the whole the international community agrees that the scourge must be stopped , and that when it does occur its victims must receive care .
Noting that on average 830 women die each day during delivery or as a result of complications from pregnancy – 500 of those in conflict zones – he says saving as many of those lives as possible , often with simple provisions of basic maternal care or the presence of a midwife , is something all sides of a festering abortion debate can support .
And that takes Mr. Erken to a view of the evolution in U.S. reproductive health policy that is what he calls “ finding the silver lining . ”
Yes , he regrets the U.S. cutting of funding for UNFPA , but more because the agency values the prestige of American political support than because it needs U.S. dollars . ( Other countries more than made up the gap when the U.S. pulled its funding . )

Population Fund (UNFPA), the wording dispute is “unfortunate.” On the whole, the international community agrees that sexual violence in conflict must be stopped, and victims receive care. Finding a silver lining, Mr. Erken says the Trump administration has continued the U.S. priority of saving women’s lives and empowering girls, and notes that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with the UNFPA’s executive director. “He actually said there is more that unites us than divides us,” Mr. Erken says, “and we feel that is something we can work with.”

Removing the phrase, code for abortion among conservative groups, set off a caustic debate, revealing deep global fissures over women’s rights. Was it an attack on women’s health and rights, or the welcome elevation of the sanctity of unborn life on the global stage?

For the first time, the Trump administration has scored a victory in imposing the language of its staunch anti-abortion position in the international arena. In a Security Council debate over a resolution on sexual violence in conflict, the U.S. ­succeeded in having the words “sexual and reproductive health” stripped from a United Nations text.

For some, it’s an attack on women’s health and rights. For others, it’s a welcome and long-overdue elevation of the sanctity of unborn life on the global stage.

After a couple of years of trying, the Trump administration appears to be making headway in its efforts to take its conservative views on reproductive health policies, including a war on abortion, to the United Nations.

But for many of the United States’ closest allies, from Britain to France and Germany, the initiative signals an alarming shift away from Western values they have long promoted together, including women’s rights and gender equality. Instead, they see their traditional friend and leader moving toward the camp of socially conservative countries like Russia, Saudi Arabia, and others that have not been at the forefront of promoting women’s issues at the U.N.

Starting early in the Trump presidency, the administration took a series of actions to strip reproductive health allocations from U.S. foreign assistance. Now the Trump administration has scored a victory in imposing the language of its staunch anti-abortion position in the international arena.

In the U.N. Security Council debate late last month over a German-sponsored resolution on sexual violence in conflict, the U.S. succeeded for the first time in having the words “sexual and reproductive health” stripped from a U.N. text. The U.S. threatened to use its veto if the offending phrase was not removed, and ultimately it was.

To many, the phrase might seem to offer little to fuss about, but removing it set off a caustic debate, revealing the deep fissures that continue to mark the international community over the issue of women’s rights.

For human rights advocates, removal of the words “sexual and reproductive health” from a U.N. resolution represents a worrisome setback for women’s equality globally, because the words had over the past quarter century become the standard phrasing used to confirm women’s rights, in particular access to prenatal care and other features of reproductive health, and to promote women’s empowerment.

Making matters worse, these advocates say, is that it is now the U.S. that has “switched camps” and is bringing the setbacks that American women’s reproductive health is facing domestically to the international stage. The wave of restrictive abortion legislation moving through a growing number of U.S. states and fomenting bitter debates on women’s rights is seen moving to the international arena.

Seth Wenig/AP Members of the U.N. Security Council vote on a resolution concerning sexual violence in warfare, at the United Nations headquarters, on April 23.

“It’s not news to anyone how important this issue is to Trump’s base, but the U.S. bringing its culture wars to the Security Council is completely inappropriate when the protection of civilian victims of sexual violence – women and children – is what’s at stake,” says Anne Marie Goetz, a clinical professor at New York University’s Center for Global Affairs and an expert in women’s empowerment in peace-building.

But to the community of socially conservative organizations and anti-abortion advocates, particularly in the U.S., the phrase “sexual and reproductive health” had become code for abortion. Worse still, its recurring use suggested to these groups a normalization of abortion and its spread into international policy.

Foreign policy opportunity

For those organizations, the arrival in Washington of a socially conservative administration – both Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are evangelical Christians who have said their faith directs them in everything they do – represented an opportunity to reverse the absence of anti-abortion convictions in U.S. foreign policy.

“We’re seeing this administration elevate the pro-life cause in foreign policy like never before, and we’re very grateful for the U.S. position on this [sexual violence] resolution, because it tells us things are changing,” says Stefano Gennarini, vice president for the Center for Legal Studies at the Center for Family and Human Rights, or C-Fam, in New York.

Mr. Gennarini calls accusations that the U.S. is infecting the consensus-driven policymaking at the U.N. with its own cultural battles “ridiculous” – but at the same time he insists it would be wrong to conclude that the arrival of a socially conservative administration in Washington means the global fight for “conservative family values” is won.

“Keep in mind that while it’s clear the pro-life cause is moving to the forefront of a conservative U.S. foreign policy,” he says, “it’s also true that the [abortion rights] side is more assertive also and is not about to back down.”

The U.S. position infuriated allies who have relied on American heft on the Security Council to help promote what for decades have been seen as common Western values – including the rights of women – and to ward off backsliding from those values.

As the French ambassador to the U.N., Francois Delattre, told his council colleagues the day of the resolution vote, “It is intolerable and incomprehensible that the Security Council is incapable of acknowledging that women and girls who suffered from sexual violence in conflict – and who obviously didn’t choose to become pregnant – should have the right to terminate their pregnancy.”

Some women’s rights advocates said the U.S. action was particularly stinging because it comes at a time when sexual violence in conflict is on the rise and has gained global attention. Harrowing examples of victims of sexual violence in conflict – from the Rohingya in Myanmar to the Yazidis and other victims of Islamic State – not getting care and being forced to carry to term the offspring of rape seem to have multiplied in recent years.

Conservative appointments

U.S. officials said during the debate on the resolution that while the U.S. agrees that more must be done to care for the victims of sexual violence, it could not agree to any language, explicit or implicit, that suggests acceptance of abortion. After the council vote, the White House indicated the adopted resolution was more “in line” with U.S. priorities.

Those priorities during the Trump administration have included setting a standard of “protecting life in global health assistance” that bars funding for foreign organizations that include abortion information or access among their services, and cutting funding in 2017 for the U.N. Population Fund, or UNFPA, the U.N.’s lead agency on sexual and reproductive health issues.

Dr. Goetz, who worked on women’s issues at the U.N. for nearly a decade, says the Trump administration has been making increasingly conservative appointments to U.S. government agencies, such as USAID and Health and Human Services, that play important roles in setting international policies on women’s health and empowerment.

Those appointees have sought to strike the “sexual and reproductive health” language from documents in other U.N. forums, such as the Commission for the Status of Women. But she says the U.S. has been unsuccessful there because other venues, including the U.N. General Assembly, work by consensus. Only in the Security Council does the U.S. have veto power.

U.N. officials are not happy about what the recent debate on the sexual violence resolution may portend for reproductive health globally, but they also suggest that, given a rising global clamor over abortion, and not just in the U.S., the outcome could have been worse.

“Of course it’s unfortunate that the words ‘sexual and reproductive health’ were taken out, but overall it is not a bad resolution,” says Arthur Erken, director of communications and strategic partnerships at UNFPA in New York. He notes that the resolution includes a reference to boys and men as victims of sexual violence in conflict – a first – and that it “reaffirms” the Security Council’s commitment to earlier resolutions on the issue in 2009 and 2013 – both of which include the “sexual and reproductive health” language.

“That tells me that even though the specific words may have been taken out, the resolution is still a confirmation of international support for getting vital services to the victims of sexual violence in conflict,” he says.

‘Finding the silver lining’

Indeed for Mr. Erken it is “unfortunate” that the issue of sexual violence in conflict got mired in a debate over wording, since on the whole the international community agrees that the scourge must be stopped, and that when it does occur its victims must receive care.

Noting that on average 830 women die each day during delivery or as a result of complications from pregnancy – 500 of those in conflict zones – he says saving as many of those lives as possible, often with simple provisions of basic maternal care or the presence of a midwife, is something all sides of a festering abortion debate can support.

And that takes Mr. Erken to a view of the evolution in U.S. reproductive health policy that is what he calls “finding the silver lining.”

Yes, he regrets the U.S. cutting of funding for UNFPA, but more because the agency values the prestige of American political support than because it needs U.S. dollars. (Other countries more than made up the gap when the U.S. pulled its funding.)

The baby abattoir gets plenty of money from private sources, and Congress can redirect the public funds to other health-care centers.

What the government giveth, the government almost never taketh away, and that’s what Planned Parenthood has been counting on.

<!–

Planned Parenthood is an industrial-scale baby abattoir responsible for more than 300,000 American deaths annually and a degradation of human dignity on the order of Josef Mengele, and the urgent issue of the day is whether it should be privately or publicly funded. Democrats are for the latter. Republicans are of the more modest opinion that if you want to slaughter your child in utero, you should have to pay for it yourself. That is what would happen if congressional Republicans succeed in defunding Planned Parenthood, which they currently plan to do as part of the process of dismantling President Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

A Missouri judge has blocked the state's attempt to close down Missouri's last abortion provider.

Missouri Circuit Court Judge Michael Stelzer granted a request to temporarily prevent state officials from revoking the license of a clinic operated by a St. Louis Planned Parenthood chapter, as the state's health department had sought to do.

If the license is not renewed, Missouri will become the first state without a clinic providing abortions since the procedure became legal 46 years ago.

Planned Parenthood, Stelzer wrote in his order, ""demonstrated that immediate and irreparable injury will result"" if Missouri refuses to renew the clinic's license. He added that the temporary restraining order ""is necessary to preserve the status quo and prevent irreparable injury.""

Stelzer issued his ruling Friday, hours before a midnight deadline. The judge set a hearing on the matter for Tuesday.

""This is a victory for women across Missouri, but this fight is far from over. We have seen just how vulnerable access to abortion care is in Missouri — and in the rest of the country,"" said Leana Wen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood.

Anti-abortion-rights groups were dismayed by the decision, echoing the governor's position that there are health and safety concerns at the clinic that need to be investigated.

""Planned Parenthood caused this artificial crisis when they ignored the law and refused to comply with the state of Missouri's very reasonable requests,"" said Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins, who called Stelzer's ruling an example of ""judicial activism in favor of abortion.""

Mike Parson, who recently signed one of the country's most restrictive abortion laws, has maintained that state officials need to complete an investigation into a patient complaint before the clinic's license is renewed. Missouri officials have not revealed details about that complaint.

During a press conference earlier this week, Parson argued that the attempt to not renew the clinic's license is not political.

""This is not an issue about the pro-life issue at all. This is about a standard of care for women in the state of Missouri,"" Parson said. ""Whether it's this clinic or any other clinic or any other hospital, they should have to meet the same standards.""

In March, state officials cited a number of deficiencies in their inspections of the clinic as part of the annual license renewal process. One problem they noted was that not all of the staff had participated in a fire drill. Then in April, Missouri officials announced an investigation of an unspecified complaint from a patient.

State officials asked to interview seven physicians associated with the clinic, some of whom were employed by Washington University Medical School and were not part of the clinic's full-time staff. Because of that relationship, the clinic argues it cannot force the doctors to be interviewed. It also says the state has not revealed the scope of the questioning, which the clinic's legal team says could include criminal referrals.

Legal wrangling ensued over the interviews, with the clinic saying it did everything in its power to make the sessions happen and state officials countering that the clinic was getting in the way of the interviews.

abortion,Reuters,1,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-abortion-missouri/missouri-poised-to-pass-restrictive-abortion-law-days-after-alabama-idUSKCN1SN12N,"Missouri poised to pass restrictive abortion law, days after Alabama",2019-05-18,,"( ███ ) - Missouri lawmakers passed a bill on Friday that prohibits women from seeking an abortion after the eighth week of pregnancy , days after Alabama enacted the most restrictive abortion law in the United States .
The legislation allows for an abortion after the eighth week only in the case of medical emergencies . On Wednesday , Alabama banned abortions at any time , with the same exception .
Similar laws have been proposed in more than a dozen other states as Republican-controlled legislatures push to restrict the rights of women to terminate their pregnancies .
The state ’ s Republican governor , Mike Parson , is expected to sign the bill into law . He has said he would make Missouri “ one of the strongest pro-life states in the country . ”
Missouri ’ s House of Representatives gave its final legislative approval in a 110-44 vote after protesters were removed from the public gallery . Missouri senators overwhelmingly approved the legislation on Thursday .
“ Today , the Missouri House stood for the unborn , ” the speaker of the house , Elijah Haahr , said in a statement . “ The bold legislation we sent to the Governor ’ s desk is the strongest and most comprehensive pro-life bill in the country . ”
Opposing the bill , Dr. Leana Wen , president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund , said it was a “ terrifying time ” for women in America .
“ Planned Parenthood will not sit by and watch as politicians take our rights and freedoms to women ’ s health care away , ” Wen said in a statement . “ We will fight in Missouri , Georgia , Alabama , and everywhere else politicians interfere with medical care , because women ’ s health care is health care and health care is a human right . ”
Renewed efforts to roll back Roe v. Wade , the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide in 1973 , have been emboldened by two judicial appointments by President Donald Trump that have given conservatives a solid majority on the court .
At a time when U.S. rates of abortion have sharply declined , the appointments have put fresh energy into the political struggle between religious conservatives and others who those who believe fetuses should have comparable rights to those of babies after birth , and those who see such restrictions as an infringement on women ’ s rights . The re-energized debate coincides with the run-up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election .
Abortion-rights activists argue that rolling back 45 years of legal precedent to criminalize abortion would endanger women who seek dangerous illegal abortions .
U.S. abortion rights activists have vowed to go to court to block enforcement of the Alabama law , which is scheduled to take effect in six months .
The Missouri bill passed the Senate on Thursday in a party-line vote , with 24 Republicans supporting it and 10 Democrats opposed .
In common with the Alabama bill , it would outlaw abortion even in the case of rape or incest and make violations by doctors punishable by prison sentences .
The measure would not make women who seek out the procedure subject to criminal prosecution , although opponents of the statute said it was ambiguous about the criminal liability of a woman accused of inducing her own miscarriage .
The measure also would ban abortions altogether except for medical emergencies should the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade .
As of May , lawmakers have introduced legislation to restrict abortions in at least 16 states this year . Governors in four have signed bills into law banning the procedure if an embryonic heartbeat can be detected , generally considered to be as early as six weeks .
Some Republicans pushing for abortion restrictions acknowledge they are deliberately doing so to instigate court challenges that will ultimately force the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade .

The legislation allows for an abortion after the eighth week only in the case of medical emergencies. On Wednesday, Alabama banned abortions at any time, with the same exception.

Similar laws have been proposed in more than a dozen other states as Republican-controlled legislatures push to restrict the rights of women to terminate their pregnancies.

The state’s Republican governor, Mike Parson, is expected to sign the bill into law. He has said he would make Missouri “one of the strongest pro-life states in the country.”

Missouri’s House of Representatives gave its final legislative approval in a 110-44 vote after protesters were removed from the public gallery. Missouri senators overwhelmingly approved the legislation on Thursday.

“Today, the Missouri House stood for the unborn,” the speaker of the house, Elijah Haahr, said in a statement. “The bold legislation we sent to the Governor’s desk is the strongest and most comprehensive pro-life bill in the country.”

Opposing the bill, Dr. Leana Wen, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said it was a “terrifying time” for women in America.

“Planned Parenthood will not sit by and watch as politicians take our rights and freedoms to women’s health care away,” Wen said in a statement. “We will fight in Missouri, Georgia, Alabama, and everywhere else politicians interfere with medical care, because women’s health care is health care and health care is a human right.”

Renewed efforts to roll back Roe v. Wade, the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide in 1973, have been emboldened by two judicial appointments by President Donald Trump that have given conservatives a solid majority on the court.

At a time when U.S. rates of abortion have sharply declined, the appointments have put fresh energy into the political struggle between religious conservatives and others who those who believe fetuses should have comparable rights to those of babies after birth, and those who see such restrictions as an infringement on women’s rights. The re-energized debate coincides with the run-up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

Abortion-rights activists argue that rolling back 45 years of legal precedent to criminalize abortion would endanger women who seek dangerous illegal abortions.

HEALTH RISK?

U.S. abortion rights activists have vowed to go to court to block enforcement of the Alabama law, which is scheduled to take effect in six months.

The Missouri bill passed the Senate on Thursday in a party-line vote, with 24 Republicans supporting it and 10 Democrats opposed.

In common with the Alabama bill, it would outlaw abortion even in the case of rape or incest and make violations by doctors punishable by prison sentences.

The measure would not make women who seek out the procedure subject to criminal prosecution, although opponents of the statute said it was ambiguous about the criminal liability of a woman accused of inducing her own miscarriage.

The measure also would ban abortions altogether except for medical emergencies should the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade.

As of May, lawmakers have introduced legislation to restrict abortions in at least 16 states this year. Governors in four have signed bills into law banning the procedure if an embryonic heartbeat can be detected, generally considered to be as early as six weeks.

Some Republicans pushing for abortion restrictions acknowledge they are deliberately doing so to instigate court challenges that will ultimately force the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade.

The ruling held that the due process clause of the 14th Amendment provides a fundamental right to privacy that protects a woman’s right to abortion.

It also allowed states to place restrictions on the procedure from the time a fetus could viably survive outside the womb. The opinion stated that viability is usually placed at about seven months, or 28 weeks, but may occur earlier.",www.reuters.com,center,jNQzUjzqg8yFYdee

District Judge Lee Yeakel ruled Monday that the provision in the bill violates the rights of abortion doctors to do what they think is best for their patients and would unreasonably restrict a woman ’ s access to abortion clinics .
Attorney General Greg Abbott filed an emergency appeal of Yeakel 's order to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans .

Lawyers for Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers brought the lawsuit , arguing that a requirement that doctors have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the abortion clinic would force the closure of a third of the clinics in Texas .

Here’s a short excerpt:

AUSTIN, TX – U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) today submitted testimony for the record in support of Texas Senate Bill 1, which will ban abortions after 20 weeks and raise standards of care at abortion clinics by requiring them to meet the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers. Part of Sen. Cruz’s testimony will be read at the Stand for Life Rally on Monday evening at the Texas State Capitol. “I want to thank the thousands of Texans who are engaging in the legislative process to speak up for the unborn,” Sen. Cruz said. “The horrors exposed during the recent murder trial of abortionist Kermit Gosnell compel us, in Texas and nationally, to take action. Our opponents seem to advocate little to no restrictions on abortion. In the past, such advocates claimed abortion should be ‘safe, legal, and rare.’ Today, their position can fairly be interpreted as ‘anytime, on-demand, and everywhere.’ This extreme embrace of unlimited late-term abortion is indefensible. “Our nation was founded on the principle that we are all created equal and endowed by our Creator with ‘certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.’ America’s founders knew that life comes first. Without life, there is no liberty; without life, there is no pursuit of happiness.”

Over the course of the last week or so I’ve spent some time reflecting on the Founders, the Declaration of Independence, and the concept of natural rights. If anything, the Fourth of July forces us to, not least because the United States is the only enduring nation on earth ever founded explicitly on an idea -- namely, the belief that “all men are created equal.” But since the nation’s earliest days, of course, there have always been those who’ve sought to distort what Jefferson originally meant when he penned those immortal words. After all, pro-slavery factions and their apologists argued for generations that the phrase “all men are created equal” only applied to white male landowners; it took a series of social reform movements and a bloody civil war before women and blacks were finally granted equal status and citizenship rights. We all know that America is not a perfect country. But through the political process, at least we know it can change.

I wrote last week that, according to a recent survey, 71 percent of Americans believe the Founders would be “disappointed” with Americans today. I think they’re right on at least one important score. I don’t presume to speak for them, but it seems safe to conclude that the Founders would find legalized infanticide abhorrent and unconscionable. Indeed, women today can terminate a pregnancy after 20 weeks gestation in many states. Given what we now know about fetal pain, this is highly problematic -- not to mention barbaric -- for a nation ostensibly “conceived in liberty” and “dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal,” as Lincoln so nicely put it at Gettysburg. The bill in Texas pro-lifers are championing is obviously not meant to ""harm ""women; on the contrary, it’s meant to protect the unborn from agony and death.
