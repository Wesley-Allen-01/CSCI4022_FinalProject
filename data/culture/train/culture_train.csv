For many , the experiment crossed an ethical line , while others , like ███ 's Nilay Patel , argued that screwing with your emotions is Facebook 's entire business model anyway ( personally , I just thought the study 's methodology sucked ) .
But Facebook is hardly the only web company to use its power over what users see for the sake of research . In a blog post Monday ( thanks to UNC sociologist Zeynep Tufekci for the link ) , OkCupid 's Christian Rudder laid out three separate experiments the company has run on users .
The first experiment — `` Love is Blind Day '' on January 15 , 2013 — removed photos from everyone 's account for seven hours , and found that while usage plummeted , responses to initial messages soared , conversations `` went deeper , '' other contact information was exchanged more quickly . `` In short , OkCupid worked better , '' Rudder concluded . Surveys of women who actually went on dates with men they contacted during the `` blind date '' period found that they reported having a good time regardless of how much more attractive they were than the men ( as rated by other OkCupid users ) :
The trouble is that when photos went back up , about 2,200 people 's conversations , which started in the blind period , simply ended . In the end , looks still mattered .
The second experiment revived an early feature of OkCupid wherein users could rate each other on both looks and personality ; currently , users can only give each other a single rating . OkCupid found that , under the prior system , the two ratings were extremely well correlated , but it wanted to see if that remained true under experimental conditions . To that end , it took a sample of users and only showed them the profile text of other users half the time , and then compared those users ' ratings of the text-less profiles to ratings from users who saw the profile text . If they correlated well , then the natural conclusion is that ratings , even with text present , are a de facto attractiveness rating , rather than a personality rating . And sure enough , the ratings with and without text were very similar , so it 's no wonder that OkCupid uses the current single-rating as an attractiveness rating in thing like the first experiment :
The third experiment is probably the most troubling . In it , users were told they had different compatibility scores ( on a scale of 0 to 100 ) than they in fact did ; OkCupid then measured what this did both to likelihood of sending messages , and to the likelihood of initial messages turning into conversations . As you 'd expect , users told they were 90 percent matches when they were in fact 30 percent matches were likelier to send messages to each other , with odds increasing from 14.2 percent to 16.9 percent . But they were also likelier to keep talking once contact was established — less likely than if they were true matches according to the site 's algorithm , but more likely than if they had known their true score :
What are we to make of manipulations like these ? The findings are at least interesting . The third experiment appears to confirm that OkCupid 's scores at least measure some aspect of true compatibility . If they did n't , you 'd expect pairs who scored 90 percent and knew it to have conversations at the same rate as pairs were merely told they scored 90 percent , and the fact that the former rate is higher suggests some value in the metric . The first two experiments ' findings are somewhat less surprising — ATTN : PEOPLE ARE SHALLOW , MUST CREDIT ███ — but there 's value in confirming obvious things .
The question is whether the potential damage of the interventions justifies the lack of informed consent outside of OkCupid 's normal terms and conditions . The first experiment is the least troubling on these grounds , since everyone was informed the change was coming , rather than it being rolled out surreptitiously , which enabled people who really did not want a picture-less OkCupid to just not log on in that period ( as many users opted to do ) .
The third experiment is the really concerning one . Users were told their true match scores after the experiment was concluded . What if an actual couple , whose relationship began when they thought they were a 90 percent match , were then informed they were a 30 percent match ? It 's hardly the biggest emotional blow in the world , and if the relationship was really working , it 'd make sense to shrug off the new information . But users can be forgiven for finding the prospect of OkCupid dropping bombs like that on relationships still in their honeymoon phase a tad disturbing .

But Facebook is hardly the only web company to use its power over what users see for the sake of research. In a blog post Monday (thanks to UNC sociologist Zeynep Tufekci for the link), OkCupid's Christian Rudder laid out three separate experiments the company has run on users.

First, delete all the photos

The first experiment — ""Love is Blind Day"" on January 15, 2013 — removed photos from everyone's account for seven hours, and found that while usage plummeted, responses to initial messages soared, conversations ""went deeper,"" other contact information was exchanged more quickly. ""In short, OkCupid worked better,"" Rudder concluded.

Then, delete all the text

The second experiment revived an early feature of OkCupid wherein users could rate each other on both looks and personality; currently, users can only give each other a single rating. OkCupid found that, under the prior system, the two ratings were extremely well correlated, but it wanted to see if that remained true under experimental conditions.

And sure enough, the ratings with and without text were very similar, so it's no wonder that OkCupid uses the current single-rating as an attractiveness rating in thing like the first experiment:

Third, mix up all the match scores

The third experiment is probably the most troubling. In it, users were told they had different compatibility scores (on a scale of 0 to 100) than they in fact did; OkCupid then measured what this did both to likelihood of sending messages, and to the likelihood of initial messages turning into conversations. As you'd expect, users told they were 90 percent matches when they were in fact 30 percent matches were likelier to send messages to each other, with odds increasing from 14.2 percent to 16.9 percent. But they were also likelier to keep talking once contact was established — less likely than if they were true matches according to the site's algorithm, but more likely than if they had known their true score:

Were they justified?

What are we to make of manipulations like these? The findings are at least interesting. The third experiment appears to confirm that OkCupid's scores at least measure some aspect of true compatibility. If they didn't, you'd expect pairs who scored 90 percent and knew it to have conversations at the same rate as pairs were merely told they scored 90 percent, and the fact that the former rate is higher suggests some value in the metric. The first two experiments' findings are somewhat less surprising — ATTN: PEOPLE ARE SHALLOW, MUST CREDIT VOX — but there's value in confirming obvious things.

The question is whether the potential damage of the interventions justifies the lack of informed consent outside of OkCupid's normal terms and conditions. The first experiment is the least troubling on these grounds, since everyone was informed the change was coming, rather than it being rolled out surreptitiously, which enabled people who really did not want a picture-less OkCupid to just not log on in that period (as many users opted to do).

culture,The Intercept,0,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/,The Moral and Strategic Calculus of Voting for Joe Biden to Defeat Trump — or Not,2020-04-20,,"Donald Trump ran for president in 2016 on an often ad-libbed and reactionary campaign of hate , greed , xenophobia , misogyny , and racism . He clearly viewed the fact that a black man had ascended to the presidency as an abomination and rightly assessed that there were a lot of racists in this country who saw the eight years the Obamas spent living in the White House as a crime against the real , white America . Trump already had a brand , realized early on the power of being an outsider in U.S. presidential elections , and focused on some key economic issues , including trade , that would play well with people dissatisfied with the two party system ’ s regular offerings . And he focused on hate . To directly call Trump fascistic is not incorrect , but it also may give him too much credit . He has largely been an incompetent authoritarian , albeit one whose key policies have caused massive suffering and death . What we have seen throughout his career and his three and a half years in power is that Trump is primarily concerned with making money for himself , his family , and his cronies . Literally everything this man does is a racket . His foreign policy has been hawkish and reckless , but aside from his often insane rhetoric and public threats to annihilate various countries , it has not represented a radical departure from that of his predecessors . He acts like an unstable buffoon on the international stage , and he burns bridges with traditional U.S. allies , governments , and international bodies across the globe . Trump openly embraces vile authoritarians and mocks democratic leaders and institutions . All of this is certainly dangerous and unsettling , though some of it is disproportionately offensive to establishment foreign policy elites . Trump ’ s predecessor started his own share of wars , did some regime change , ratcheted up an existing war , downsized another , and greatly expanded the use of weaponized drones and so-called targeted killings . But Barack Obama delivered these policies with an intelligently crafted , though at times absurd , justification wrapped in the notion of inventing a “ smarter ” way to wage war . Liberals ate it up . Obama ’ s policies killed a lot of innocent people .
The few times Trump has signaled his openness to pursue a less militaristic approach to long-existing crises , such as the war in Afghanistan or the conflict with North Korea , he has been ridiculed by leading Democrats and liberal pundits . In terms of Trump ’ s military pursuits , he has proven less murderous than George W. Bush and more of a war criminal than Jimmy Carter . So far . That can certainly change with a second term . Perhaps the gravest threat posed by the unstable narcissist in the White House is that of the use of a first strike nuclear weapon . It has never been beyond the pale to imagine an apocalyptic nuclear scenario that begins with a tweet from a foreign leader Trump hates . The fact that we can even imagine this is nothing to wag a stick at . Trump ’ s monumentally incompetent handling of the coronavirus pandemic hammers home some of the greatest dangers posed by his presidency .

That Trump uses the daily platform of what are supposed to be public health briefings by professionals to pontificate ignorantly , babble incoherently , or to score points politically underscores how little he actually cares about the U.S. public and our lives .

It is the sign of a deeply sick individual that he would effectively make aid conditional on how nice governors are to him . Trump encourages group protests against Democratic governors during a pandemic with scores of people refusing to wear protective gear , while his administration has insisted on testing visitors for coronavirus before meeting with the president or vice president . All of this costs lives , as sure as any military operation .
Perhaps the most devastating dimension of Trump ’ s time in office , on a policy level , is how the Republican establishment brilliantly exploited Trump as a Trojan horse for its extreme agenda . It is unlikely that any of the GOP ’ s preferred candidates could have beaten Hillary Clinton in 2016 . Trump dragged the Republican Party kicking and screaming back into executive power . For them , he was a messiah they chided and scorned when he first appeared , but now they prostrate themselves before him every minute of every day .

More broadly , the real terror of the past three and a half years boils down to this : The consolidation of power by some of the most vile figures and interests in the Republican party . This includes the scores of federal judges named to the bench , the shaping of the Supreme Court , the radical drive toward deregulation , and the canceling of even the most minimal commitments the U.S. has made to try to confront climate change . What the Republicans have managed to accomplish on a policy level in Trump ’ s time in office is profound and terrifying . Out in full view , Trump has presided over the separation of families and the locking up of immigrant children in cages , empowering ICE agents to act as storm troopers .

His threat to fill Guantanamo prison back up still looms , especially in the era of the coronavirus pandemic . Is it so hard to imagine it becoming a disease-ridden black hole for migrants seeking refuge ? Trump ’ s economic policies have enriched corporations and special interest groups beyond their imaginations , while sawing off the already inadequate social programs in this country .

Donald Trump ’ s presidency is not an aberration of U.S. history in substance . His rise to power and the policies he has implemented are , in many ways , the logical product of the U.S. as a failed state , politically and functionally . Trump says the quiet parts about the system out loud , but his agenda is firmly rooted in the bloody history of this republic . And his rise was made possible by the failed two-party system and the corporate dominance of electoral politics in the U.S. Also , let ’ s not pretend that congressional Democrats have not enabled Trump by regularly voting for his obscene military budgets and sweeping surveillance powers while simultaneously calling him the most dangerous president in history . What would happen if Trump wins the election in November ? In practical terms , it would be a nightmare . Trump would emerge emboldened beyond imagination . What minuscule restraints that currently exist would be wiped out entirely . He would almost certainly be in a position to replace Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with yet another atrocious extremist . An ability to further stack the court will have a multigenerational impact on a legion of issues ; among them are voting rights , civil liberties , corporate power , workers ’ rights , civil rights , women ’ s reproductive rights , LGBTQ rights , executive power , and the climate . No one should minimize the dangers of Trump remaining in office . And his reign will hit the most vulnerable the hardest , much like the coronavirus , and the terrors will ricochet for many years to come . Trump encourages and emboldens racists and bigots and embraces far-right ideology and action . Four more years of this will be deadly . It is in contemplating all of the above that the emergence of Joe Biden as the Democratic Party ’ s presumptive choice to take on Trump is a deeply disturbing and risky response to the threats we face . It is easy to underestimate Biden ’ s chance of winning in November . Biden is a terrible candidate in many ways , but it is possible that “ I ’ m not Trump ” combined with Biden having been Obama ’ s vice president will appeal to enough of the population to win not only the popular vote ( a virtual certainty ) but the Electoral College — especially if the party keeps him under wraps until the final stretch , as appears to be the strategy . Still , that seems to be a dangerous gamble given what is at stake . There is also another factor that must not be ignored : Republicans are masters of voter suppression and disenfranchisement . That , combined with Trump ’ s core belief that corruption isn ’ t corrupt if he does it places an ominous cloud over the election ’ s integrity before it even occurs . And we know that the pandemic will cast a long enough shadow over normal life that there will be plenty of opportunities for irregularities . Biden has an abominable public policy record on a wide range of issues . He has a penchant for lying — about his role in the civil rights movement and about being arrested in apartheid South Africa . He continues to lie and mislead about his support for the war in Iraq , the most consequential foreign policy decision of the post-Vietnam era . He has been accused by eight women of misconduct , including one allegation of very serious sexual assault by his former Senate staffer Tara Reade . Biden ’ s cognitive health and mental acuity is , to say the least , questionable , particularly when you compare his current performance with videos from just a few years ago . He frequently rambles without a clear point , forgets what office he is running for , and has to rely on teleprompters and notes to make it through interviews and speeches without saying something embarrassing . In numerous interactions with voters , Biden has poked their chests in an aggressive manner ; told an immigrant rights activist to “ vote for Trump ” ; called voters childish names ; and threatened a union worker in Detroit , telling the man to stop objecting to Biden pointing his finger in his face unless the worker “ want [ s ] to go outside with me. ” Let ’ s not even discuss the tale of his showdown with a rusty razor-wielding “ Corn Pop ” at the pool . Trump ’ s temperament is frightening , but Biden isn ’ t exactly a cool head who exudes competence or confidence . Liberals may poo poo the whole Hunter Biden-Burisma-Ukraine-China attacks from Trump , but this is going to be a problem in the general election . On many of the key issues where Democrats could attack Trump , Biden is going to be virtually incapacitated by his own skeletons . What Sen. Elizabeth Warren did to Mike Bloomberg at a February debate would be impossible for Biden to do to Trump . “ You have more allegations of sexual assault than I do , Donald , ” is not a good line . “ Your sons have profited off the presidency more than my son did off my vice presidency ” — also not a winning zinger . And don ’ t think for a moment that Trump won ’ t hammer away on Biden ’ s Iraq War vote and his trade policies . The Democratic primary is not the general election .
It ’ s always worth remembering that Biden was picked in 2008 to make Obama less threatening to moderates — so we can ’ t even bank on a return to Obama ’ s brand of neoliberalism .
There is no point to going through and listing all of the terrible aspects of Biden ’ s career , his policy record , his mental stamina , or his substantial failures to make himself visible or consistently cogent since securing the presumptive nomination . All of this is going to be put on display for the next six months . The Democratic Party and the voters in the roughly 50 percent of primaries that were held have committed our fate to Biden ’ s candidacy . Obama and other senior party leaders , major news organizations , and a lot of money deployed to attack Sen. Bernie Sanders also played a role in manufacturing this reality . Sanders ending his campaign and vowing to support Biden leaves people with two viable candidates on the ballot . Barring a health crisis or death of one of these older men , the only two candidates with enough public support to win the presidency will be Donald Trump and Joe Biden . What we get with Trump is as clear as it is terrifying . What we get with Biden , in his current form , is less apparent . Biden will have a team of competent ( for better and worse ) technocrats and , in all likelihood , an incredibly influential vice president and an unelected chief of staff running the show . Biden ’ s administration will also include appointments aimed at throwing some bones to progressives and likely other Cabinet appointments that recognize the growing influence of progressive ideas . It will , without a doubt , also be riddled with a disproportionate number of hawkish , corporatist Democratic apparatchiks . It will be an administration that does the bidding of Wall Street , believes in bloated war budgets , and will put a friendlier face on the worst excesses of empire . It ’ s always worth remembering that Biden was picked in 2008 to make Obama less threatening to moderates — so we can ’ t even bank on a return to Obama ’ s brand of neoliberalism . But there will be policy areas where some victories may be possible for a well-organized and militant left willing to take Biden on . Such a dynamic wouldn ’ t be the worst thing in the world and would be better for more people than a second Trump term in virtually every tangible way . Biden isn ’ t great on many issues that motivate young voters . His health care plan keeps the profit-driven system intact , and it will result in millions of Americans remaining uninsured . His policy to confront massive student and consumer debt is anemic . Biden ’ s climate plan is uninspiring and generally milquetoast when weighed against the severity of the crisis the planet faces , though this is an area in which he might be susceptible to pressure from activists . Some of his foreign policy positions are downright disturbing , if not explicitly right-wing . The latest Biden campaign ad is a fearmongering attack on China and an effort to outbid Trump ’ s xenophobic rhetoric . Biden ’ s long record indicates that he could prove more inclined to authorize military interventions than Trump , who has been quite belligerent himself , without following through on most of his threats . Biden is almost certainly going to start and continue wars , impose deadly economic sanctions , and support or enact regime change efforts . There is an abundance of justification to oppose a Biden presidency . And principled people are right to ring loud alarms over Biden ’ s record , policies , and some of his personal conduct . At the same time , it is not honest to imply there would be no difference between a Biden and Trump administration . The Obama-Biden administration ’ s immigration policy has now been dwarfed in awfulness by Trump , but in its own right it operated as a cruel , mass deportation machine that also separated families . During the campaign , Biden has responded to extraordinary activist pressure and eventually began to carefully distance himself from the record of the “ deporter in chief , ” as Obama was labeled by immigrant rights activists . When pressed on the mass deportations under Obama , Biden acknowledged that deporting people without criminal records was a “ big mistake. ” At a Democratic debate , Biden was asked whether he would resume Obama ’ s torrid pace of deportations . “ Absolutely not , ” he said , adding that he was vice president , not president , drawing a rebuke from Julián Castro , who observed accurately that Biden was content to bathe in the glow of his former Obama boss while looking to sidestep responsibility for his more unpopular policies . At the same time , Biden ’ s campaign has made a sweeping series of pledges that he could implement as president that would potentially protect millions of vulnerable people . On immigration , the alternative to that is four more years of Trump adviser Stephen Miller , an extremist nut who shouldn ’ t be allowed within 100 feet of a consequential decision-making process .
We are not actually being asked to vote for Biden as the candidate , because the Biden we see is a shell of his former self . We are being asked to vote for a spin-off of the Obama show .
Biden has pledged to immediately lift the Muslim travel ban , as well as other racist immigration and asylum policies Trump has put in place . It is also worth noting that toward the end of the Obama administration , under pressure from Black Lives Matter activists , Obama placed a dozen city police forces under Department of Justice consent decrees in response to police killings and other abuses . Trump can not be pressured by BLM , but Biden can . Biden has a troubling record on Iran , including his support for deadly sanctions , but he has emphatically said he would reenter the Iran nuclear agreement , which is also no small matter . Similarly , Biden has been politically forced to denounce the genocidal Saudi war against Yemen , despite the fact that it was initiated under the Obama-Biden administration . He has also had to publicly accept that viewing Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as an unsavory murderer is now widely held by many Democrats , including centrist figures . Remarkably , Biden has vowed to turn Saudi Arabia into “ a pariah. ” That ’ s an incredible statement given the long bipartisan love affair with the kingdom ’ s despots and raises all sorts of questions about what that would mean if Biden is elected .
Among the wild cards of a Biden administration will be the issue of whether he has the actual mental stamina to govern , or if he is going to be frequently disoriented and infrequently seen or heard . Setting aside the protestations of people who pretend they don ’ t see exactly what everyone else does when Biden speaks in public , we are not actually being asked to vote for Biden as the candidate , because the Biden we see is a shell of his former self . We are being asked to vote for a spin-off of the Obama show , a cast of familiar characters and a few exciting new additions who would take charge of the executive branch , without the popular star of the original show among the visible cast . The fact that the Democrats have forced through a candidate that many people don ’ t believe is fully functional and will rely on the strength of “ the team ” assembled around him is a pretty grim statement about the state of democracy in the U.S . If Biden is the best the Democrats have to offer in the face of Trump , the system is rotten . So what should people who want Trump gone but can not stand Biden do ? First of all , no one should be shamed for letting their conscience dictate their vote or decision not to vote . ( Full disclosure : I always vote . ) Our system is dominated by corporate influence , big money , and the skewed rules of a default duopoly , and it actively fights to prevent third parties from receiving federal matching funds , joining debates , or gaining ballot access . There is no mandatory voting in the U.S. , roughly 40 percent of Americans do not belong to either major political party , and people have a right to register their dissatisfaction with the entire system by not voting . In an atmosphere where tens of millions of U.S. citizens choose not to vote , shaming the minuscule number of people who vote for the Green Party is a disgrace . There are hundreds of thousands of voters whose principled belief is that breaking the two-party stranglehold on U.S. democracy is the only path to meaningful systemic change . Votes for Jill Stein or Howie Hawkins are not being taken away from corporate Democrats . Those votes belong to the people who cast them and they have a right to vote however they choose , and the candidates they support have a right to run for office . It is also an understandable and morally principled decision to say , “ I believe Tara Reade was sexually assaulted by Joe Biden , and I will not vote for a rapist. ” It is an understandable and morally principled position to say , “ I will not vote for anyone who supported the war against Iraq. ” None of these people ’ s votes belong to Biden or Hillary Clinton or the Democratic Party or Twitter mobs — and they are not votes for Trump .
In an atmosphere where tens of millions of U.S. citizens choose not to vote , shaming the minuscule number of people who vote for the Green Party is a disgrace .
Ultimately , however , given the abomination of our two-party system , progressive voters are forced to make not just a moral but a strategic choice with their votes . Recognizing that Biden is a terrible candidate and being honest about that but voting for him in an effort to prevent Trump from further consolidating his agenda is a strategically sound position . This is ultimately what the majority of Sanders supporters will do , just as they did in 2016 . It certainly has a better chance of improving the country and the world than enthusiastically pledging to vote for Biden while closing your ears to everything that is wrong about him and his record . Voters in swing states , where voting for a candidate other than Biden or not voting at all may help tip the balance to Trump , face a more consequential moral and strategic choice than people in New York or California . In 2004 , the Green Party candidate told his supporters to vote their conscience in swing states , including if they believed they needed to hold their nose and vote for John Kerry to defeat Bush . If you believe that progressives or leftists should be “ bending the knee ” for Biden by promising right this second that they will vote for him in six months and that they will never utter an inconvenient fact about him or express their anger with their meager Election Day options , please show them all of your work fighting for Medicare for All , for ending the carceral state , for serious radical action on climate change , your work opposing the most dangerous aspects of the Obama-Biden administration , including on issues of war , immigration , and , yes , health care . Many of the social and political movements that backed Sanders were populated by people in the crosshairs of the Trump administration . It was an incredibly diverse coalition of supporters and drew millions of primary voters in 2016 and 2020 . Its backbone was young voters , including young African Americans , Latinos , students , immigrants , and independents . These groups and many of Sanders ’ s supporters have spent nearly four years fighting Trump nonstop . Many of them organized against Obama ’ s troubling policies before that . That should be commended not scorned . You want to label these people Trump supporters because they are intensely disturbed by the corporatist candidate you have chosen to take on Trump ? Show them your work on the issues they care about , explain what Biden ’ s policies are on those issues and make the most convincing case you can for why they should vote for him . Better yet , explain to them how you are fighting to make Biden ’ s platform one that even minimally pretends to want their votes . In the bigger picture , Sanders organized the most significant challenge to the Democratic Party ’ s centrist and center-right establishment since Jesse Jackson ran twice for president in the 1980s . Unlike Ralph Nader ’ s independent runs for president , Sanders attempted to deliver sweeping change within the Democratic Party ’ s own framework . He fought against an extremely hostile corporate media environment and some pretty vile smear campaigns , where he was compared to the coronavirus , his supporters were called brown shirts , and his primary victories described as akin to the Nazi invasion of France on liberal TV networks . Despite the powerful chorus of red-baiting and lies , Sanders still came extremely close to pulling off a victory . Biden was usually the frontrunner and always the favorite , even though he came close to being defeated by Sanders early on . The establishment fiercely defended its territory in an effort capped off by the last-minute secret diplomacy from Obama ahead of Super Tuesday to pressure other candidates and the party to coalesce around Biden . Ultimately , the party ’ s primary voters , at the crucial moment , threw their weight behind a name they know and who served as vice president of an administration they trusted . These voters should not be collectively shamed either . Most of them are not party cogs , but people genuinely scared of what four more years of Trump will mean for their survival , particularly older African American voters . The traditional , moderate , and right-wing forces within the Democratic Party united and won the primary battle . Sanders may have surrendered too early , but there is little value to debating that right now or wasting energy attacking Sanders .
Most people on the left who oppose Biden but also view Trump as the gravest danger are going to vote against Trump by voting for Biden . But those who disagree with that strategy do not support Trump .","Photo illustration: The Intercept, Getty Images

Donald Trump ran for president in 2016 on an often ad-libbed and reactionary campaign of hate, greed, xenophobia, misogyny, and racism. He clearly viewed the fact that a black man had ascended to the presidency as an abomination and rightly assessed that there were a lot of racists in this country who saw the eight years the Obamas spent living in the White House as a crime against the real, white America. Trump already had a brand, realized early on the power of being an outsider in U.S. presidential elections, and focused on some key economic issues, including trade, that would play well with people dissatisfied with the two party system’s regular offerings. And he focused on hate. To directly call Trump fascistic is not incorrect, but it also may give him too much credit. He has largely been an incompetent authoritarian, albeit one whose key policies have caused massive suffering and death. What we have seen throughout his career and his three and a half years in power is that Trump is primarily concerned with making money for himself, his family, and his cronies. Literally everything this man does is a racket. His foreign policy has been hawkish and reckless, but aside from his often insane rhetoric and public threats to annihilate various countries, it has not represented a radical departure from that of his predecessors. He acts like an unstable buffoon on the international stage, and he burns bridges with traditional U.S. allies, governments, and international bodies across the globe. Trump openly embraces vile authoritarians and mocks democratic leaders and institutions. All of this is certainly dangerous and unsettling, though some of it is disproportionately offensive to establishment foreign policy elites. Trump’s predecessor started his own share of wars, did some regime change, ratcheted up an existing war, downsized another, and greatly expanded the use of weaponized drones and so-called targeted killings. But Barack Obama delivered these policies with an intelligently crafted, though at times absurd, justification wrapped in the notion of inventing a “smarter” way to wage war. Liberals ate it up. Obama’s policies killed a lot of innocent people.

The few times Trump has signaled his openness to pursue a less militaristic approach to long-existing crises, such as the war in Afghanistan or the conflict with North Korea, he has been ridiculed by leading Democrats and liberal pundits. In terms of Trump’s military pursuits, he has proven less murderous than George W. Bush and more of a war criminal than Jimmy Carter. So far. That can certainly change with a second term. Perhaps the gravest threat posed by the unstable narcissist in the White House is that of the use of a first strike nuclear weapon. It has never been beyond the pale to imagine an apocalyptic nuclear scenario that begins with a tweet from a foreign leader Trump hates. The fact that we can even imagine this is nothing to wag a stick at. Trump’s monumentally incompetent handling of the coronavirus pandemic hammers home some of the greatest dangers posed by his presidency. It has highlighted the extent to which he is motivated not by any sense of duty or concern for his fellow citizens, but by money and his popularity among a fairly small circle of corporations, television hosts, and special interests. That Trump uses the daily platform of what are supposed to be public health briefings by professionals to pontificate ignorantly, babble incoherently, or to score points politically underscores how little he actually cares about the U.S. public and our lives. Instead, he is obsessed with the stock market as an imagined extension of his own ego. It is the sign of a deeply sick individual that he would effectively make aid conditional on how nice governors are to him. Trump encourages group protests against Democratic governors during a pandemic with scores of people refusing to wear protective gear, while his administration has insisted on testing visitors for coronavirus before meeting with the president or vice president. All of this costs lives, as sure as any military operation.

Perhaps the most devastating dimension of Trump’s time in office, on a policy level, is how the Republican establishment brilliantly exploited Trump as a Trojan horse for its extreme agenda. It is unlikely that any of the GOP’s preferred candidates could have beaten Hillary Clinton in 2016. Trump dragged the Republican Party kicking and screaming back into executive power. For them, he was a messiah they chided and scorned when he first appeared, but now they prostrate themselves before him every minute of every day.

The real terror of the past three and a half years boils down to this: the consolidation of power by some of the most vile figures and interests in the Republican party.

The public still does not know the full story of how Mike Pence ended up on the ticket as Trump’s running mate, but when it was announced, it was clear that the professional Republicans and the extremist evangelical lobby had their inside man. With Mitch McConnell running the Senate and Pence babysitting the president, Trump could focus on barking for the crowds in between golf outings and Twitter rants while the political hitmen in Washington dust off every extreme right-wing initiative they’ve cooked up for decades and which they work day and night to methodically ram through. Trump has had his signature moments, but much of his policy has been outsourced to craftier and more sophisticated policymakers. Trump is famously not a fan of reading detailed briefings, but give him a few nuggets of oversimplified policy talking points to pepper throughout his rants, and he’s going to be your gaudy QVC host pitching the crappy product to his base. The bonus is that none of it actually has to be true, it just needs to be acceptable to the right people and truthfully exposed or documented by journalists whom he can then dismiss as the fake news media. More broadly, the real terror of the past three and a half years boils down to this: The consolidation of power by some of the most vile figures and interests in the Republican party. This includes the scores of federal judges named to the bench, the shaping of the Supreme Court, the radical drive toward deregulation, and the canceling of even the most minimal commitments the U.S. has made to try to confront climate change. What the Republicans have managed to accomplish on a policy level in Trump’s time in office is profound and terrifying. Out in full view, Trump has presided over the separation of families and the locking up of immigrant children in cages, empowering ICE agents to act as storm troopers. He has intervened to protect war criminals from accountability, threatened to kill the families of suspected terrorists, sought to ban — and in some ways has succeeded in banning — Muslims from entering the country. His threat to fill Guantanamo prison back up still looms, especially in the era of the coronavirus pandemic. Is it so hard to imagine it becoming a disease-ridden black hole for migrants seeking refuge? Trump’s economic policies have enriched corporations and special interest groups beyond their imaginations, while sawing off the already inadequate social programs in this country. We still have no idea of the extent to which Trump and his family are financially benefiting from his presidency. He talks about women in disgusting ways, including attempting to publicly humiliate the women he is accused of raping and assaulting. And the sick reality is that a significant number of people in the U.S. clearly like these things even if they won’t openly admit it, though a disturbing number of them do feel emboldened to admire it. Trump has offered up an IPO on ignorance and hatred as a source of pride, and a lot of people enthusiastically bought in.

Trump’s rise to power is, in many ways, the logical product of the U.S. as a failed state. Trump says the quiet parts about the system out loud.

Donald Trump’s presidency is not an aberration of U.S. history in substance. His rise to power and the policies he has implemented are, in many ways, the logical product of the U.S. as a failed state, politically and functionally. Trump says the quiet parts about the system out loud, but his agenda is firmly rooted in the bloody history of this republic. And his rise was made possible by the failed two-party system and the corporate dominance of electoral politics in the U.S. Also, let’s not pretend that congressional Democrats have not enabled Trump by regularly voting for his obscene military budgets and sweeping surveillance powers while simultaneously calling him the most dangerous president in history. What would happen if Trump wins the election in November? In practical terms, it would be a nightmare. Trump would emerge emboldened beyond imagination. What minuscule restraints that currently exist would be wiped out entirely. He would almost certainly be in a position to replace Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with yet another atrocious extremist. An ability to further stack the court will have a multigenerational impact on a legion of issues; among them are voting rights, civil liberties, corporate power, workers’ rights, civil rights, women’s reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, executive power, and the climate. No one should minimize the dangers of Trump remaining in office. And his reign will hit the most vulnerable the hardest, much like the coronavirus, and the terrors will ricochet for many years to come. Trump encourages and emboldens racists and bigots and embraces far-right ideology and action. Four more years of this will be deadly. It is in contemplating all of the above that the emergence of Joe Biden as the Democratic Party’s presumptive choice to take on Trump is a deeply disturbing and risky response to the threats we face. It is easy to underestimate Biden’s chance of winning in November. Biden is a terrible candidate in many ways, but it is possible that “I’m not Trump” combined with Biden having been Obama’s vice president will appeal to enough of the population to win not only the popular vote (a virtual certainty) but the Electoral College — especially if the party keeps him under wraps until the final stretch, as appears to be the strategy. Still, that seems to be a dangerous gamble given what is at stake. There is also another factor that must not be ignored: Republicans are masters of voter suppression and disenfranchisement. That, combined with Trump’s core belief that corruption isn’t corrupt if he does it places an ominous cloud over the election’s integrity before it even occurs. And we know that the pandemic will cast a long enough shadow over normal life that there will be plenty of opportunities for irregularities. Biden has an abominable public policy record on a wide range of issues. He has a penchant for lying — about his role in the civil rights movement and about being arrested in apartheid South Africa. He continues to lie and mislead about his support for the war in Iraq, the most consequential foreign policy decision of the post-Vietnam era. He has been accused by eight women of misconduct, including one allegation of very serious sexual assault by his former Senate staffer Tara Reade. Biden’s cognitive health and mental acuity is, to say the least, questionable, particularly when you compare his current performance with videos from just a few years ago. He frequently rambles without a clear point, forgets what office he is running for, and has to rely on teleprompters and notes to make it through interviews and speeches without saying something embarrassing.

Trump’s temperament is frightening, but Biden isn’t exactly a cool head who exudes competence or confidence. Liberals may poo poo the whole Hunter Biden-Burisma-Ukraine-China attacks from Trump, but this is going to be a problem in the general election. On many of the key issues where Democrats could attack Trump, Biden is going to be virtually incapacitated by his own skeletons. What Sen. Elizabeth Warren did to Mike Bloomberg at a February debate would be impossible for Biden to do to Trump. “You have more allegations of sexual assault than I do, Donald,” is not a good line. “Your sons have profited off the presidency more than my son did off my vice presidency” — also not a winning zinger. And don’t think for a moment that Trump won’t hammer away on Biden’s Iraq War vote and his trade policies. The Democratic primary is not the general election.

It’s always worth remembering that Biden was picked in 2008 to make Obama less threatening to moderates — so we can’t even bank on a return to Obama’s brand of neoliberalism. But there will be policy areas where some victories may be possible for a well-organized and militant left willing to take Biden on. Such a dynamic wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world and would be better for more people than a second Trump term in virtually every tangible way. Biden isn’t great on many issues that motivate young voters. His health care plan keeps the profit-driven system intact, and it will result in millions of Americans remaining uninsured. His policy to confront massive student and consumer debt is anemic. Biden’s climate plan is uninspiring and generally milquetoast when weighed against the severity of the crisis the planet faces, though this is an area in which he might be susceptible to pressure from activists. Some of his foreign policy positions are downright disturbing, if not explicitly right-wing. The latest Biden campaign ad is a fearmongering attack on China and an effort to outbid Trump’s xenophobic rhetoric. Biden’s long record indicates that he could prove more inclined to authorize military interventions than Trump, who has been quite belligerent himself, without following through on most of his threats. Biden is almost certainly going to start and continue wars, impose deadly economic sanctions, and support or enact regime change efforts. There is an abundance of justification to oppose a Biden presidency. And principled people are right to ring loud alarms over Biden’s record, policies, and some of his personal conduct. At the same time, it is not honest to imply there would be no difference between a Biden and Trump administration. The Obama-Biden administration’s immigration policy has now been dwarfed in awfulness by Trump, but in its own right it operated as a cruel, mass deportation machine that also separated families. During the campaign, Biden has responded to extraordinary activist pressure and eventually began to carefully distance himself from the record of the “deporter in chief,” as Obama was labeled by immigrant rights activists. When pressed on the mass deportations under Obama, Biden acknowledged that deporting people without criminal records was a “big mistake.” At a Democratic debate, Biden was asked whether he would resume Obama’s torrid pace of deportations. “Absolutely not,” he said, adding that he was vice president, not president, drawing a rebuke from Julián Castro, who observed accurately that Biden was content to bathe in the glow of his former Obama boss while looking to sidestep responsibility for his more unpopular policies. At the same time, Biden’s campaign has made a sweeping series of pledges that he could implement as president that would potentially protect millions of vulnerable people. On immigration, the alternative to that is four more years of Trump adviser Stephen Miller, an extremist nut who shouldn’t be allowed within 100 feet of a consequential decision-making process.

We are not actually being asked to vote for Biden as the candidate, because the Biden we see is a shell of his former self. We are being asked to vote for a spin-off of the Obama show.

Biden has pledged to immediately lift the Muslim travel ban, as well as other racist immigration and asylum policies Trump has put in place. It is also worth noting that toward the end of the Obama administration, under pressure from Black Lives Matter activists, Obama placed a dozen city police forces under Department of Justice consent decrees in response to police killings and other abuses. Trump cannot be pressured by BLM, but Biden can. Biden has a troubling record on Iran, including his support for deadly sanctions, but he has emphatically said he would reenter the Iran nuclear agreement, which is also no small matter. Similarly, Biden has been politically forced to denounce the genocidal Saudi war against Yemen, despite the fact that it was initiated under the Obama-Biden administration. He has also had to publicly accept that viewing Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as an unsavory murderer is now widely held by many Democrats, including centrist figures. Remarkably, Biden has vowed to turn Saudi Arabia into “a pariah.” That’s an incredible statement given the long bipartisan love affair with the kingdom’s despots and raises all sorts of questions about what that would mean if Biden is elected.

Among the wild cards of a Biden administration will be the issue of whether he has the actual mental stamina to govern, or if he is going to be frequently disoriented and infrequently seen or heard. Setting aside the protestations of people who pretend they don’t see exactly what everyone else does when Biden speaks in public, we are not actually being asked to vote for Biden as the candidate, because the Biden we see is a shell of his former self. We are being asked to vote for a spin-off of the Obama show, a cast of familiar characters and a few exciting new additions who would take charge of the executive branch, without the popular star of the original show among the visible cast. The fact that the Democrats have forced through a candidate that many people don’t believe is fully functional and will rely on the strength of “the team” assembled around him is a pretty grim statement about the state of democracy in the U.S. If Biden is the best the Democrats have to offer in the face of Trump, the system is rotten. So what should people who want Trump gone but cannot stand Biden do? First of all, no one should be shamed for letting their conscience dictate their vote or decision not to vote. (Full disclosure: I always vote.) Our system is dominated by corporate influence, big money, and the skewed rules of a default duopoly, and it actively fights to prevent third parties from receiving federal matching funds, joining debates, or gaining ballot access. There is no mandatory voting in the U.S., roughly 40 percent of Americans do not belong to either major political party, and people have a right to register their dissatisfaction with the entire system by not voting. In an atmosphere where tens of millions of U.S. citizens choose not to vote, shaming the minuscule number of people who vote for the Green Party is a disgrace. There are hundreds of thousands of voters whose principled belief is that breaking the two-party stranglehold on U.S. democracy is the only path to meaningful systemic change. Votes for Jill Stein or Howie Hawkins are not being taken away from corporate Democrats. Those votes belong to the people who cast them and they have a right to vote however they choose, and the candidates they support have a right to run for office. It is also an understandable and morally principled decision to say, “I believe Tara Reade was sexually assaulted by Joe Biden, and I will not vote for a rapist.” It is an understandable and morally principled position to say, “I will not vote for anyone who supported the war against Iraq.” None of these people’s votes belong to Biden or Hillary Clinton or the Democratic Party or Twitter mobs — and they are not votes for Trump.

In an atmosphere where tens of millions of U.S. citizens choose not to vote, shaming the minuscule number of people who vote for the Green Party is a disgrace.

Ultimately, however, given the abomination of our two-party system, progressive voters are forced to make not just a moral but a strategic choice with their votes. Recognizing that Biden is a terrible candidate and being honest about that but voting for him in an effort to prevent Trump from further consolidating his agenda is a strategically sound position. This is ultimately what the majority of Sanders supporters will do, just as they did in 2016. It certainly has a better chance of improving the country and the world than enthusiastically pledging to vote for Biden while closing your ears to everything that is wrong about him and his record. Voters in swing states, where voting for a candidate other than Biden or not voting at all may help tip the balance to Trump, face a more consequential moral and strategic choice than people in New York or California. In 2004, the Green Party candidate told his supporters to vote their conscience in swing states, including if they believed they needed to hold their nose and vote for John Kerry to defeat Bush. If you believe that progressives or leftists should be “bending the knee” for Biden by promising right this second that they will vote for him in six months and that they will never utter an inconvenient fact about him or express their anger with their meager Election Day options, please show them all of your work fighting for Medicare for All, for ending the carceral state, for serious radical action on climate change, your work opposing the most dangerous aspects of the Obama-Biden administration, including on issues of war, immigration, and, yes, health care. Many of the social and political movements that backed Sanders were populated by people in the crosshairs of the Trump administration. It was an incredibly diverse coalition of supporters and drew millions of primary voters in 2016 and 2020. Its backbone was young voters, including young African Americans, Latinos, students, immigrants, and independents. These groups and many of Sanders’s supporters have spent nearly four years fighting Trump nonstop. Many of them organized against Obama’s troubling policies before that. That should be commended not scorned. You want to label these people Trump supporters because they are intensely disturbed by the corporatist candidate you have chosen to take on Trump? Show them your work on the issues they care about, explain what Biden’s policies are on those issues and make the most convincing case you can for why they should vote for him. Better yet, explain to them how you are fighting to make Biden’s platform one that even minimally pretends to want their votes. In the bigger picture, Sanders organized the most significant challenge to the Democratic Party’s centrist and center-right establishment since Jesse Jackson ran twice for president in the 1980s. Unlike Ralph Nader’s independent runs for president, Sanders attempted to deliver sweeping change within the Democratic Party’s own framework. He fought against an extremely hostile corporate media environment and some pretty vile smear campaigns, where he was compared to the coronavirus, his supporters were called brown shirts, and his primary victories described as akin to the Nazi invasion of France on liberal TV networks. Despite the powerful chorus of red-baiting and lies, Sanders still came extremely close to pulling off a victory. Biden was usually the frontrunner and always the favorite, even though he came close to being defeated by Sanders early on. The establishment fiercely defended its territory in an effort capped off by the last-minute secret diplomacy from Obama ahead of Super Tuesday to pressure other candidates and the party to coalesce around Biden. Ultimately, the party’s primary voters, at the crucial moment, threw their weight behind a name they know and who served as vice president of an administration they trusted. These voters should not be collectively shamed either. Most of them are not party cogs, but people genuinely scared of what four more years of Trump will mean for their survival, particularly older African American voters. The traditional, moderate, and right-wing forces within the Democratic Party united and won the primary battle. Sanders may have surrendered too early, but there is little value to debating that right now or wasting energy attacking Sanders.

Most people on the left who oppose Biden but also view Trump as the gravest danger are going to vote against Trump by voting for Biden. But those who disagree with that strategy do not support Trump.",www.theintercept.com,left,3pFcWU3dgwVEfsDn

culture,The Dispatch,2,https://thedispatch.com/p/in-the-age-of-coronavirus-who-can,"In the Age of Coronavirus, Whom Can You Trust?",,Declan Garvey,"The 15-second ad sounds like it ’ d fit better in a dystopian science fiction movie than the present-day United States .
“ At Domino ’ s , we pride ourselves on handcrafted pizza , ” a narrator reads . “ But after leaving our 450 degree ovens , the only hands that touch them are yours . … Get them with contactless delivery , from Domino ’ s . ”
The voiceover brims with a cheery aloofness that distinguishes the spot from the scores of somber commercials that have sprung up in recent months . But the subtext is clear : Trust us , you won ’ t contract coronavirus from eating our pizza .
Everything has changed in the months since COVID-19 has reared its ugly head : 80,000 are dead , nearly 1.5 million are confirmed to be infected , and tens of millions are out of work . Schools , workplaces , and community groups have shifted online ; sports seasons , movie premieres , and vacation plans have been put on hold .
But even within our “ new normal ” of sheltering in place , social distancing , and mask-wearing , something else has been evolving : our relationships with one another .
It happened subtly at first . You might have begun opening doors with your shirt sleeve , or ceased shaking hands . You stopped frequenting your favorite coffee shop , or taking public transportation . Eventually , you caved and bought a mask . Trips to the grocery store have become fewer and farther between , and you find yourself recoiling if you turn the corner into a new aisle and see another shopper heading your way . When the elevator ’ s brakes kick into gear , you now cringe , knowing someone else is about to join you in your suddenly too-small metal box .
Nine weeks into the Age of COVID-19 , we ’ ve learned more about the virus , how it spreads , and what it does to our bodies . And we ’ ve evolved into amateur epidemiologists in the process . Date nights have become possible hotspots . Our parents and grandparents are now “ high-risk populations. ” Where we once saw friends and neighbors , we now see potential vectors .
“ When we get Amazon packages in the mail , ” said D.J . Gallant , a loan underwriter who lives just outside of Minneapolis , “ I ’ ll bring the Amazon package in and take a set of wipes—or a rag—and spray it down with some disinfectant , disinfect the whole box , open the box , disinfect whatever ’ s inside . … You ’ re pretty sure everything ’ s okay , but you don ’ t want to take any chances . ”
Gallant ’ s 9-month-old daughter has a compromised immune system—and his wife is a labor and delivery nurse at a local hospital—so he ’ s taking extra precautions . But he ’ s far from alone . In a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll , 73 percent of Americans reported being very or somewhat worried about the possibility that they or someone in their immediate family might catch COVID-19 . Forty-five percent said they were concerned about leaving their homes for groceries or other supplies . And 69 percent in a USA Today/Ipsos survey claimed they stopped attending social events because of the coronavirus outbreak .
The “ invisible enemy , ” as President Trump has grown fond of calling it , spreads primarily from person to person . The Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) says it “ may be possible ” to contract COVID-19 by touching a surface with the virus on it , but concludes that the main driver of transmission is through “ respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs , sneezes , or talks. ” Some studies are finding evidence—inconclusive as of now—that the coronavirus “ may have the potential to be transmitted via aerosols . ”
Dr. Roderick Kramer , a social psychologist at Stanford University , published an article for Harvard Business Review back in 2002 introducing the concept of “ prudent paranoia , ” a heightened sense of vigilance that can prove beneficial—rather than destructive—for the person wielding it . The piece was written against the backdrop of the 9/11 attacks—and focuses primarily on competition in the workplace—but Kramer believes the theory remains relevant in the current climate .
There ’ s “ just a really evident wariness and concern , ” he tells ███ . “ In talking to my kids—who are both 25 and 30 years old—they ’ ve been worried about infecting their parents and other family members . So there is that kind of prudent wariness . ”
Kramer has spent decades studying trust , distrust , and paranoia . Elevated suspicion is common throughout history , but he says it typically exists within an “ in-group out-group context , ” where people make “ sinister ” or “ problematic ” assumptions about another person ’ s motives based on race or nationality . “ Decades of research on ethnocentrism and … intergroup hostility show how easily antipathy , fear , anxiety , and active distrust and suspicion ferment even under minimal informational conditions , ” he said . The FBI ’ s warning in late-March against a surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans is just the most recent example of this phenomenon .
But the pandemic is doing something different : sowing doubt and uncertainty within existing social circles . “ I live on the Stanford campus in a faculty area , so it ’ s all faculty , ” Kramer explained . “ These are our friends . And walking down the street , people look at you , some people seem to be reluctant even to say hello , and they ’ re extremely uncomfortable looking . And you ’ ll see people turn around as you ’ re heading towards them , even though it 's a very wide street . I ’ ve really been shocked . It ’ s almost like a kind of McCarthy-type paranoia . ”
For the economy to “ reopen ” in any meaningful way , political and public health leaders will need to find ways to assuage this paranoia . If you don ’ t have enough faith in your neighbor to say hello , after all , you ’ re probably unlikely to get on an airplane , go to the gym , or order pizza that ’ s been touched by human hands .
The Trump administration seems to understand this , which is why the White House is reportedly looking to message this week that “ the American people can have confidence as they begin to go back out into the public square . ”
That could prove difficult . Only 23 percent of respondents in an Associated Press/NORC Center poll have “ quite a bit ” of trust in information about the coronavirus conveyed by President Trump . State and local governments and public health agencies like the CDC inspire much more confidence among the public , but their outlooks tend to be less rosy . ( The human mind ’ s “ negativity bias ” —or tendency to weight bad news more heavily than good—may provide additional credence to these public health officials in this instance precisely because their outlook tends to be less rosy . )
Infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci , for example , is set to testify on Tuesday before the Senate health committee , where he hopes to convey the “ danger of trying to open the country prematurely. ” In an email to the New York Times , Fauci said that ignoring the coronavirus task force ’ s “ Opening Up America Again ” guidelines risks “ multiple outbreaks throughout the country ” that will “ result in needless suffering and death ” and “ set us back on our quest to return to normal . ”
That ’ s the message that ’ s breaking through in most of the country , where a majority of Americans continue to support lockdown measures to prevent the spread of the virus . “ Even if Trump , or [ Minnesota Gov . Tim ] Walz , or [ Wisconsin Gov . Tony ] Evers came out and said , ‘ Guess what , we ’ re going to open everything up , everything ’ s good to go tomorrow , ’ ” Gallant hypothesized , “ No . … Yeah , it sucks . It ’ s inconvenient . But I do not think I will go about my regular kind of day-to-day until probably next year . ”
As a millennial , Gallant ’ s risk of severe complications resulting from a coronavirus infection are relatively low . The confirmed case fatality rate for 30-39 year olds—based on data from South Korea , Italy , China , and Spain—is likely somewhere between 0.1 percent and 0.3 percent .
But while statistics like those may be reassuring on a macro level , individual Americans don ’ t want to become statistics themselves . “ If my wife were to get infected or somebody were to get infected , ” Gallant said , trailing off . “ Most of the time ... it ’ s fine . But if you end up in that part that needs critical care … you can just straight-up die . ”
“ We had a 5 percent chance of something happening to our daughter with a viral infection she had when she was born , and turns out we hit the odds on that , ” he added . “ I would rather just play it safe . ”","The 15-second ad sounds like it’d fit better in a dystopian science fiction movie than the present-day United States.

Schools, workplaces, and community groups have shifted online; sports seasons, movie premieres, and vacation plans have been put on hold.

But even within our “new normal” of sheltering in place, social distancing, and mask-wearing, something else has been evolving: our relationships with one another.

It happened subtly at first. You might have begun opening doors with your shirt sleeve, or ceased shaking hands. You stopped frequenting your favorite coffee shop, or taking public transportation. Eventually, you caved and bought a mask. Trips to the grocery store have become fewer and farther between, and you find yourself recoiling if you turn the corner into a new aisle and see another shopper heading your way. When the elevator’s brakes kick into gear, you now cringe, knowing someone else is about to join you in your suddenly too-small metal box.

Nine weeks into the Age of COVID-19, we’ve learned more about the virus, how it spreads, and what it does to our bodies. And we’ve evolved into amateur epidemiologists in the process. Date nights have become possible hotspots. Our parents and grandparents are now “high-risk populations.” Where we once saw friends and neighbors, we now see potential vectors.

“When we get Amazon packages in the mail,” said D.J. Gallant, a loan underwriter who lives just outside of Minneapolis, “I’ll bring the Amazon package in and take a set of wipes—or a rag—and spray it down with some disinfectant, disinfect the whole box, open the box, disinfect whatever’s inside. … You’re pretty sure everything’s okay, but you don’t want to take any chances.”

Gallant’s 9-month-old daughter has a compromised immune system—and his wife is a labor and delivery nurse at a local hospital—so he’s taking extra precautions. But he’s far from alone. In a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 73 percent of Americans reported being very or somewhat worried about the possibility that they or someone in their immediate family might catch COVID-19. Forty-five percent said they were concerned about leaving their homes for groceries or other supplies. And 69 percent in a USA Today/Ipsos survey claimed they stopped attending social events because of the coronavirus outbreak.

The “invisible enemy,” as President Trump has grown fond of calling it, spreads primarily from person to person. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says it “may be possible” to contract COVID-19 by touching a surface with the virus on it, but concludes that the main driver of transmission is through “respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.” Some studies are finding evidence—inconclusive as of now—that the coronavirus “may have the potential to be transmitted via aerosols.”

Dr. Roderick Kramer, a social psychologist at Stanford University, published an article for Harvard Business Review back in 2002 introducing the concept of “prudent paranoia,” a heightened sense of vigilance that can prove beneficial—rather than destructive—for the person wielding it. The piece was written against the backdrop of the 9/11 attacks—and focuses primarily on competition in the workplace—but Kramer believes the theory remains relevant in the current climate.

There’s “just a really evident wariness and concern,” he tells The Dispatch. “In talking to my kids—who are both 25 and 30 years old—they’ve been worried about infecting their parents and other family members. So there is that kind of prudent wariness.”

Kramer has spent decades studying trust, distrust, and paranoia. Elevated suspicion is common throughout history, but he says it typically exists within an “in-group out-group context,” where people make “sinister” or “problematic” assumptions about another person’s motives based on race or nationality. “Decades of research on ethnocentrism and … intergroup hostility show how easily antipathy, fear, anxiety, and active distrust and suspicion ferment even under minimal informational conditions,” he said. The FBI’s warning in late-March against a surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans is just the most recent example of this phenomenon.

But the pandemic is doing something different: sowing doubt and uncertainty within existing social circles. “I live on the Stanford campus in a faculty area, so it’s all faculty,” Kramer explained. “These are our friends. And walking down the street, people look at you, some people seem to be reluctant even to say hello, and they’re extremely uncomfortable looking. And you’ll see people turn around as you’re heading towards them, even though it's a very wide street. I’ve really been shocked. It’s almost like a kind of McCarthy-type paranoia.”

For the economy to “reopen” in any meaningful way, political and public health leaders will need to find ways to assuage this paranoia. If you don’t have enough faith in your neighbor to say hello, after all, you’re probably unlikely to get on an airplane, go to the gym, or order pizza that’s been touched by human hands.

The Trump administration seems to understand this, which is why the White House is reportedly looking to message this week that “the American people can have confidence as they begin to go back out into the public square.”

That could prove difficult. Only 23 percent of respondents in an Associated Press/NORC Center poll have “quite a bit” of trust in information about the coronavirus conveyed by President Trump. State and local governments and public health agencies like the CDC inspire much more confidence among the public, but their outlooks tend to be less rosy. (The human mind’s “negativity bias”—or tendency to weight bad news more heavily than good—may provide additional credence to these public health officials in this instance precisely because their outlook tends to be less rosy.)

Infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, for example, is set to testify on Tuesday before the Senate health committee, where he hopes to convey the “danger of trying to open the country prematurely.” In an email to the New York Times, Fauci said that ignoring the coronavirus task force’s “Opening Up America Again” guidelines risks “multiple outbreaks throughout the country” that will “result in needless suffering and death” and “set us back on our quest to return to normal.”

That’s the message that’s breaking through in most of the country, where a majority of Americans continue to support lockdown measures to prevent the spread of the virus. “Even if Trump, or [Minnesota Gov. Tim] Walz, or [Wisconsin Gov. Tony] Evers came out and said, ‘Guess what, we’re going to open everything up, everything’s good to go tomorrow,’” Gallant hypothesized, “No. … Yeah, it sucks. It’s inconvenient. But I do not think I will go about my regular kind of day-to-day until probably next year.”

As a millennial, Gallant’s risk of severe complications resulting from a coronavirus infection are relatively low. The confirmed case fatality rate for 30-39 year olds—based on data from South Korea, Italy, China, and Spain—is likely somewhere between 0.1 percent and 0.3 percent.

But while statistics like those may be reassuring on a macro level, individual Americans don’t want to become statistics themselves. “If my wife were to get infected or somebody were to get infected,” Gallant said, trailing off. “Most of the time ... it’s fine. But if you end up in that part that needs critical care … you can just straight-up die.”

“We had a 5 percent chance of something happening to our daughter with a viral infection she had when she was born, and turns out we hit the odds on that,” he added. “I would rather just play it safe.”

A prolific Twitter user, Moon posts an average of 15 times a day, often sharing photographs with florid captions. Trump “was dancing with the sunset and strong winds when he walked to the Oval Office from the Marine One on the South Lawn,” the copy accompanying the black-and-white shot from Friday reads. And Moon’s thousands of media tweets include photos of the area around the White House, and of nature — especially birds and the moon — around the DC metro area.

There are just too many reasons why we got here to distill into a single explanation . But certainly one reason for Trump ’ s ascendance is television . It ’ s not quite right to say that TV made Trump president , but it is fair to say that TV created the conditions that made Trump ’ s presidency possible .
This , at least , is the thesis of James Poniewozik ’ s new book Audience of One : Donald Trump , Television , and the Fracturing of America . Poniewozik is a TV critic for the New York Times , and his book is an attempt to explain how Trump turned himself into the protagonist of his own TV show and then pulled all of us into it . It ’ s also about what TV has done to our political culture and why Trump is the logical fulfillment of all the media trends of the last two decades or so .
According to Poniewozik , Trump is fundamentally a creature of TV . His whole public persona was shaped by TV and he cleverly used the medium , with shows like The Apprentice , to propel his political career . He also knew exactly what TV media craves — spectacle , drama , and outrage — and capitalized on it throughout his presidential campaign .
“ Donald Trump is not a person , ” Poniewozik writes , “ he ’ s a character that wrote itself , a brand mascot that jumped off the cereal box and entered the world. ” And , of course , he ’ s now entered the White House .
I spoke to Poniewozik about how the road to Trump was paved by TV and how the way we cover and think about politics has been fundamentally transformed by the medium .
Many people think of television as an instrument for covering politics rather than a medium that transforms it . But you suggest that that ’ s wrong and that TV has imposed its own ideology on politics .
I decided to write this book because the guy from The Apprentice got elected president of the United States . I really felt that a lot of the public discussion didn ’ t take that seriously enough — it was a kind of joke . But it ’ s insane that that happened and we need to understand how it was possible in the first place .
As a TV critic , I wanted to know , why this guy ? Why wasn ’ t it Tom Cotton or Ted Cruz or some other conservative firebrand who rode this wave to the White House ? Why is it somebody who was made by television and essentially made himself out of television ? Why was Trump uniquely capable of being able to translate that skill set into this sort of success ?
Well , let ’ s try to answer that . The premise of your book isn ’ t that television made Trump president , but you do argue that Trump ’ s presidency is only possible because of TV . Why is that ?
Well , there are a couple elements to that . One is that Donald Trump ’ s career has been primarily a media career . And I ’ m not just talking about The Apprentice but going all the way back to his tabloid exploits and talk show appearances in the ’ 80s . If Trump were just a businessman , he ’ d be a nonentity . He ’ s only “ Donald Trump ” because of television .
The other part , and I want to be emphatically clear about this because people like to oversimplify things by saying TV makes people dumb or brainwashes gullible people . I think it ’ s more complicated than that . Television is the nervous system of our culture . It ’ s our principal means of gaining information and disseminating it and communicating to one another . And it ’ s the arena , for decades and decades now , through which politics has taken place .
I write about the media theorist Neil Postman in the book because one of his great insights is that television as a visual media promotes a different kind of discourse than text does . It ’ s a visual medium , thus it appeals more to emotion . So that lends itself to a kind of argument and rhetorical combat in which Trump has thrived his entire life . His whole media persona is built on conflict . He ’ s the guy who “ wins ” and that meshes perfectly with television , especially reality television culture .
How exactly did TV prepare us for candidate Trump , for the idea of Trump as president ?
The evolution of the 24-hour cable news format is a big part of the story . The business model of , say , Fox News is to excite and agitate the audience all the time , to give people a reason to tune in even when there isn ’ t news going on .
But over time that model promulgates the idea that the way politics are argued on TV , the buttons that it presses , the way people dunk on each other — that ’ s not just a means toward political ends , but it becomes the action of politics itself . And a huge part of Trump ’ s appeal is that he absolutely embodies this form of politics , or this approach to politics . He creates emotions and conflicts in media format and people saw it and thought , “ Oh yeah , this is what politics looks like . ”
What ’ s so interesting about Trump is that , as you put it , he ’ s achieved a perfect symbiosis with television . He isn ’ t on television — he is television . How does that help us understand Trump the political actor ?
Trump thinks like television . His stock-in-trade is the non-sequitur argument and the provocation . Going back to Postman , he talked about the rhetorical mode of TV news as being “ now this. ” “ Now this ” is like the TV anchor ’ s segue from one topic to an entirely unrelated topic . And Neil Postman , again , was writing in the ’ 80s . He didn ’ t even write about cable television . CNN had barely been founded .
But the cable new era is “ now this ” on steroids . It ’ s just this , this , this , this , this . And that ’ s Trump ’ s mindset and style of speaking . The lashing out , the careening from one subject to another , the seemingly random fights on social media — that ’ s all television gold .
He ’ s just incredibly attuned to the dynamics of our reality TV culture , and he ’ s fully meshed it with politics .
I want to ask you about professional wrestling , something you write about in the book . The thing wrestling does so well is walk that line between fake and real — it plays with that blurriness . Non-wrestling fans miss this when they talk about the “ realness ” of wrestling . The realness of the performance is secondary to the feelings it elicits in the audience . And this , to me , is a perfect way to understand the dynamic between Trump and his supporters .
Yeah , I write a lot about this in the book . There ’ s a concept in wrestling called “ kayfabe , ” which is basically the pretense that the conflicts in the ring are actually real . The wrestlers who fight each other actually hate each other . The backstories are really going on . And in the very early days of pro wrestling , people bought that .
Over time , say by the 1980s when Donald Trump was hosting Wrestlemanias at his casinos , that relationship between fans and the story became more sophisticated . People might believe it ’ s scripted , but it ’ s still kind of real . Maybe these things are staged , but maybe the emotions the wrestlers have are real . You could buy into it at whatever level you wanted to .
I think this is basically how a lot of people view Trumpian politics . It ’ s not so much about being taken in or thinking he ’ s totally honest , it ’ s about this guy who ’ s fighting for your side . And even if there ’ s this level of bullshit and artifice , it ’ s only because he ’ s a clever trickster . And besides , what ’ s most important is how he makes his voters feel .
Politics has become mostly affective anyway . It ’ s about the delivery of emotions . It ’ s about liberal tears . All those feelings are what it ’ s about , not getting some actual deliverable like a bill passed or whatever . For somebody who follows politics through talk radio and Fox News , that ’ s the end of politics .
“ If Trump were just a businessman , he ’ d be a non-entity . He ’ s only ‘ Donald Trump ’ because of television . ”
Do you see Trump ’ s election as some kind of cultural rubicon-crossing moment ? We ’ ve had actor-presidents before , and plenty of politicians are essentially performance artists , but Trump really is something ... different .
People often say , “ Well , isn ’ t this like Ronald Reagan ? He was an actor , too. ” But it ’ s crucial to make a distinction here , beyond pointing out that Reagan was governor of California before being elected president .
Reagan was a movie actor , and a movie actor ’ s job is to cultivate empathy , to imagine yourself in the place of other people , to imagine the inner lives of other people . Trump is a reality TV performer and that means his job is to be an exaggerated version of himself , to play up the most polarizing , attention-getting aspects of himself . That ’ s what wins in the world of reality TV . It ’ s an anti-empathy kind of performance .
And this really is a significant distinction between someone like Trump and Reagan . We ’ re much more in a reality TV world now , and our politics reflects that .
Is there any going back , or are we stuck with reality TV presidents ?
I don ’ t think so . Trump ’ s election was significant in that it proved you could become president even if your only qualification was mastery of the media . But it ’ s still just one way of becoming president , not the only way of becoming president .
There might be a reaction against this , and maybe we get a string of more boring or conventional candidates . But there ’ s no doubt that Trump won ’ t be the last reality TV president . There will be others like him — that ’ s just our reality now . Maybe the next one will be a Fox News host or something like that , someone with a built-in connection to a party ’ s political base who knows how to deliver what they want .
But we have to remember that Trump isn ’ t some alien monster who landed from another planet and transformed the environment . He was uniquely situated to take advantage of politics in this heavily mediated environment . The fragmentation of media , the polarization of political discussion , the rise of Fox News , the emergence of social media — all of this paved the way .
The atmosphere that produced Trump will survive Trump , and we ’ re just stuck with that .","Donald Trump is the show we can’t turn off, the car crash we can’t look away from, the news cycle we can’t escape.

There are just too many reasons why we got here to distill into a single explanation. But certainly one reason for Trump’s ascendance is television. It’s not quite right to say that TV made Trump president, but it is fair to say that TV created the conditions that made Trump’s presidency possible.

This, at least, is the thesis of James Poniewozik’s new book Audience of One: Donald Trump, Television, and the Fracturing of America. Poniewozik is a TV critic for the New York Times, and his book is an attempt to explain how Trump turned himself into the protagonist of his own TV show and then pulled all of us into it. It’s also about what TV has done to our political culture and why Trump is the logical fulfillment of all the media trends of the last two decades or so.

According to Poniewozik, Trump is fundamentally a creature of TV. His whole public persona was shaped by TV and he cleverly used the medium, with shows like The Apprentice, to propel his political career. He also knew exactly what TV media craves — spectacle, drama, and outrage — and capitalized on it throughout his presidential campaign.

“Donald Trump is not a person,” Poniewozik writes, “he’s a character that wrote itself, a brand mascot that jumped off the cereal box and entered the world.” And, of course, he’s now entered the White House.

I spoke to Poniewozik about how the road to Trump was paved by TV and how the way we cover and think about politics has been fundamentally transformed by the medium.

A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.

Sean Illing

Many people think of television as an instrument for covering politics rather than a medium that transforms it. But you suggest that that’s wrong and that TV has imposed its own ideology on politics.

Can you say a bit about that?

James Poniewozik

I decided to write this book because the guy from The Apprentice got elected president of the United States. I really felt that a lot of the public discussion didn’t take that seriously enough — it was a kind of joke. But it’s insane that that happened and we need to understand how it was possible in the first place.

As a TV critic, I wanted to know, why this guy? Why wasn’t it Tom Cotton or Ted Cruz or some other conservative firebrand who rode this wave to the White House? Why is it somebody who was made by television and essentially made himself out of television? Why was Trump uniquely capable of being able to translate that skill set into this sort of success?

Sean Illing

Well, let’s try to answer that. The premise of your book isn’t that television made Trump president, but you do argue that Trump’s presidency is only possible because of TV. Why is that?

James Poniewozik

Well, there are a couple elements to that. One is that Donald Trump’s career has been primarily a media career. And I’m not just talking about The Apprentice but going all the way back to his tabloid exploits and talk show appearances in the ’80s. If Trump were just a businessman, he’d be a nonentity. He’s only “Donald Trump” because of television.

The other part, and I want to be emphatically clear about this because people like to oversimplify things by saying TV makes people dumb or brainwashes gullible people. I think it’s more complicated than that. Television is the nervous system of our culture. It’s our principal means of gaining information and disseminating it and communicating to one another. And it’s the arena, for decades and decades now, through which politics has taken place.

I write about the media theorist Neil Postman in the book because one of his great insights is that television as a visual media promotes a different kind of discourse than text does. It’s a visual medium, thus it appeals more to emotion. So that lends itself to a kind of argument and rhetorical combat in which Trump has thrived his entire life. His whole media persona is built on conflict. He’s the guy who “wins” and that meshes perfectly with television, especially reality television culture.

Sean Illing

How exactly did TV prepare us for candidate Trump, for the idea of Trump as president?

James Poniewozik

The evolution of the 24-hour cable news format is a big part of the story. The business model of, say, Fox News is to excite and agitate the audience all the time, to give people a reason to tune in even when there isn’t news going on.

But over time that model promulgates the idea that the way politics are argued on TV, the buttons that it presses, the way people dunk on each other — that’s not just a means toward political ends, but it becomes the action of politics itself. And a huge part of Trump’s appeal is that he absolutely embodies this form of politics, or this approach to politics. He creates emotions and conflicts in media format and people saw it and thought, “Oh yeah, this is what politics looks like.”

Sean Illing

What’s so interesting about Trump is that, as you put it, he’s achieved a perfect symbiosis with television. He isn’t on television — he is television. How does that help us understand Trump the political actor?

James Poniewozik

Trump thinks like television. His stock-in-trade is the non-sequitur argument and the provocation. Going back to Postman, he talked about the rhetorical mode of TV news as being “now this.” “Now this” is like the TV anchor’s segue from one topic to an entirely unrelated topic. And Neil Postman, again, was writing in the ’80s. He didn’t even write about cable television. CNN had barely been founded.

But the cable new era is “now this” on steroids. It’s just this, this, this, this, this. And that’s Trump’s mindset and style of speaking. The lashing out, the careening from one subject to another, the seemingly random fights on social media — that’s all television gold.

He’s just incredibly attuned to the dynamics of our reality TV culture, and he’s fully meshed it with politics.

Sean Illing

I want to ask you about professional wrestling, something you write about in the book. The thing wrestling does so well is walk that line between fake and real — it plays with that blurriness. Non-wrestling fans miss this when they talk about the “realness” of wrestling. The realness of the performance is secondary to the feelings it elicits in the audience. And this, to me, is a perfect way to understand the dynamic between Trump and his supporters.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this.

James Poniewozik

Yeah, I write a lot about this in the book. There’s a concept in wrestling called “kayfabe,” which is basically the pretense that the conflicts in the ring are actually real. The wrestlers who fight each other actually hate each other. The backstories are really going on. And in the very early days of pro wrestling, people bought that.

Over time, say by the 1980s when Donald Trump was hosting Wrestlemanias at his casinos, that relationship between fans and the story became more sophisticated. People might believe it’s scripted, but it’s still kind of real. Maybe these things are staged, but maybe the emotions the wrestlers have are real. You could buy into it at whatever level you wanted to.

I think this is basically how a lot of people view Trumpian politics. It’s not so much about being taken in or thinking he’s totally honest, it’s about this guy who’s fighting for your side. And even if there’s this level of bullshit and artifice, it’s only because he’s a clever trickster. And besides, what’s most important is how he makes his voters feel.

Politics has become mostly affective anyway. It’s about the delivery of emotions. It’s about liberal tears. All those feelings are what it’s about, not getting some actual deliverable like a bill passed or whatever. For somebody who follows politics through talk radio and Fox News, that’s the end of politics.

“If Trump were just a businessman, he’d be a non-entity. He’s only ‘Donald Trump’ because of television.”

Sean Illing

Do you see Trump’s election as some kind of cultural rubicon-crossing moment? We’ve had actor-presidents before, and plenty of politicians are essentially performance artists, but Trump really is something ... different.

Where do we go from here?

James Poniewozik

People often say, “Well, isn’t this like Ronald Reagan? He was an actor, too.” But it’s crucial to make a distinction here, beyond pointing out that Reagan was governor of California before being elected president.

Reagan was a movie actor, and a movie actor’s job is to cultivate empathy, to imagine yourself in the place of other people, to imagine the inner lives of other people. Trump is a reality TV performer and that means his job is to be an exaggerated version of himself, to play up the most polarizing, attention-getting aspects of himself. That’s what wins in the world of reality TV. It’s an anti-empathy kind of performance.

And this really is a significant distinction between someone like Trump and Reagan. We’re much more in a reality TV world now, and our politics reflects that.

Sean Illing

Is there any going back, or are we stuck with reality TV presidents?

James Poniewozik

I don’t think so. Trump’s election was significant in that it proved you could become president even if your only qualification was mastery of the media. But it’s still just one way of becoming president, not the only way of becoming president.

There might be a reaction against this, and maybe we get a string of more boring or conventional candidates. But there’s no doubt that Trump won’t be the last reality TV president. There will be others like him — that’s just our reality now. Maybe the next one will be a Fox News host or something like that, someone with a built-in connection to a party’s political base who knows how to deliver what they want.

But we have to remember that Trump isn’t some alien monster who landed from another planet and transformed the environment. He was uniquely situated to take advantage of politics in this heavily mediated environment. The fragmentation of media, the polarization of political discussion, the rise of Fox News, the emergence of social media — all of this paved the way.

The atmosphere that produced Trump will survive Trump, and we’re just stuck with that.",www.vox.com,left,OBVf3mDav6ypTIOE

The pandemic will not change the basic direction of history so much as accelerate it , according to Richard Haass , president of the Council on Foreign Relations . The importance of the United States to other nations may decline , while that of China increases ; but that is happening in some form already . Our screen time may skyrocket along with reliance on Zoom , FaceTime , and other video connectors ; but that basic trend preexists . Manufacturers may diversify suppliers to create redundant globalized production chains ; but far-sighted managers have pushed this for some time .

But crises can shake up the status quo . They override tendencies toward inertia , open room for the consideration of new ideas , and push aside past impediments . The ideas for the big government programs that became the New Deal had been bouncing around U.S. politics for years before Franklin Roosevelt became president , says Margaret O ’ Mara , a professor of history at the University of Washington in Seattle . It took the shock of the 1929 stock market crash and the onset of the Great Depression to make them law .
“ Great crises can change the rules of the game and people ’ s attitudes about political possibility really fast , ” Dr. O ’ Mara says .

If there ’ s one thing the COVID-19 pandemic is almost certain to shift into hyperdrive , it ’ s the movement of more and more of our activities online .
The most obvious of these changes are occurring in the midst of the outbreak as tens of millions of people struggle to keep up some semblance of their old routines . Virtual schooling is now part of the curriculum for many of the 124,000-plus U.S. schools affected by a coronavirus shutdown , for instance . In the past , many school systems have resisted widespread online learning or found it difficult to integrate into existing lesson plans . Now they have little choice .
But today ’ s basic diet of Zoom lectures and student show-and-tells don ’ t fully reflect what online education can do , say its advocates . For instance , a more sophisticated integration of virtual and live instruction could help high schools match the achievement gains primary education has made in recent years .
Meanwhile , telemedicine is exploding . Right now , doctors are still struggling with such basic questions as how online health care fits into existing billing practices , but in the future it could allow much greater collaboration among diverse team members and health organizations . And of course , online ordering of everything from soup to bolts is for many people the new normal .
Related to this acceleration of the digital is the increasing importance of big tech to the national welfare . If this moment in history is the moral equivalent of war , are Microsoft , Amazon , Google , Facebook , and Twitter emerging as the new arsenals of democracy , as GM , Ford , and Chrysler did during World War II ?
After all Bill Gates , shed of his corporate responsibilities at Microsoft , is increasingly outspoken about fighting all manner of health crises . Amazon is America ’ s delivery backbone . Facebook is the new radio , the way an isolated society communicates and receives news . President Donald Trump turned to a Google division to construct a website for locating COVID-19 test sites – though that hasn ’ t progressed much so far .
“ The tech companies are really part of this now , ” says Dr. O ’ Mara , author of the recent book “ The Code : Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America . ”
This could mean a significant shift in big tech ’ s image , Dr. O ’ Mara notes . Until recent years Silicon Valley has largely ignored politics as well as any concerns about the more unsavory aspects of its impact on society . Then tech itself became a political headline , with Mark Zuckerberg hauled before Congress to defend Facebook policies on issues such as data sharing and election security .
“ It became very clear that tech was not only not adequate to address some of our most complicated social problems ... but that it was not changing the world in the right way , ” says Dr. O ’ Mara .
Then America was struck by a grave public health threat whose effect on society is unmatched by any crisis since World War II , and perhaps could surpass even that for its sheer breadth . Leadership at the top of government , with some exceptions , has struggled to meet the challenge . The economic fallout will ripple through every sector of the economy , devastating some , such as airlines , hotels , and restaurants .
“ The only sector that may come out of this with more money in the bank is tech , ” says Dr. O ’ Mara .
With their global workforces and global reach , tech firms are uniquely situated to provide moral leadership and a global perspective , she says . Yet their preexisting problems remain : worries about the privacy of personal data and the little-checked spread of false information .
It ’ s also important to remember that a continuing digital revolution will leave many people behind . Laptops and Wi-Fi connections are expensive ; many low-income families can ’ t reliably connect for telework or virtual education . Some 42 million Americans , and a quarter of all rural residents , don ’ t have access to broadband internet , according to a recent report from BroadbandNow Research .
JL/SIPA/AP Jayen , a 13-year-old student in Miramar , Florida , participates in a virtual class from her bedroom . Schools in Florida ’ s Broward County , like elsewhere across the country , are shut down .
Life in American cities may not be the same after the coronavirus recedes . At the least , things probably won ’ t return to anything resembling the old normal for a long time .
Many urban areas have been shrinking for decades as their populations migrate to inner-ring suburbs and more distant areas . It ’ s possible the pandemic will accelerate this movement as people flee to the perceived safety of larger open spaces .
Some wealthy Americans packed up and left New York and other central cities for second homes or hotels in the Hamptons , or the Catskills , or on Cape Cod . A percentage of these may not return if their work and family situations allow . Similar dispersions may happen elsewhere around the globe , say some experts .
“ We may now be witnessing the outlines of a new , and necessary , dispersion of population , not only in the wide open spaces of North America and Australia , but even in the megacities of the developing world , ” wrote Joel Kotkin , executive director of the Urban Reform Institute , in an article in the publication Quillette in late March .
But this may not mean cities per se are set to wither , or that their attributes will become less attractive to people drawn to the pulse of urban life . The terrible flu pandemic of 1918 did not destroy hard-hit cities , after all . Pittsburgh was ravaged , as was Detroit . Both thrived afterward .
“ The point is that no pandemic in history – and many have been worse [ than COVID-19 ] – has been enough to derail the force of urbanization , ” says Richard Florida , an urbanist and professor at the University of Toronto ’ s Rotman School of Management and School of Cities . “ The clustering of people , clustering of ideas , and trading with one another have made the world a more productive and innovative place . ”
What the coronavirus will do is reshape the way people work and interact in cities at a micro level for a midrange period of time , until a vaccine is able to bring it under control , says Dr. Florida . It ’ s hard to anticipate exactly what these changes will be , he says . People may be worried about returning to city offices and taking mass transit , so it ’ s possible they will opt to live in center cities and walk , or resume driving to work , creating more traffic congestion . Small businesses will look different , with restaurant tables placed farther apart , hair salon chairs dispersed or divided from one another , and so forth .
Children will return to very different schools , Dr. Florida predicts , with temperature checks at the door and social distancing in the lunch room . Other changes that he believes will need to take place before cities reopen for business include retrofitting airports , convention centers , and other infrastructure for screenings and personal separation , and financial support for arts and cultural institutions that help provide urban areas with vitality .
“ We have to prepare our communities , our playgrounds , our arenas to get up and running safely , ” Dr. Florida says .
In the post-pandemic world some types of urban areas might do better than others . Los Angeles , a big world-class city built around the concept of sprawling neighborhoods of single-family homes , could benefit from people ’ s desire to insulate themselves in a bit of space . So could smallish cities that offer some cultural amenities but are close enough to bigger places to serve as a type of satellite .
One example of this might be Hudson , New York , up the river from New York City . People can experience different degrees of density , despite living in the same city , based on their relative wealth and class , Dr. Florida says .
About a third of the workforce nationwide is wealthy enough to afford extensive deliveries of food and other staples , and to carry out much of their jobs through telework . Another third is composed of blue-collar workers who stock the produce aisles , drive delivery trucks , and otherwise are at risk on the pandemic front lines . The last third are poor people , who have little choice but to hunker down .
Yes , the richest of the rich can jet to their second or third homes , moving to physically distance themselves from any health threat . But could they actually root themselves in their chalets ? If they have school-age children , they might not find local educational options attractive . In any case , the isolation they see as a buffer might be illusory . Rural health care options are often limited – and rural counties with attractive recreational amenities , such as the ski slopes of Colorado , have had a high per capita incidence of COVID-19 , Dr. Florida points out .
Coronavirus refugees have also sparked fear and resentment among those who live in rural areas full time . In one infamous incident on the Maine island of Vinalhaven , a group of locals cut down a tree on March 27 in an attempt to forcibly barricade several New Jersey residents inside the home they were renting . Dr. Florida says such conflicts could become bitter if they pit states against states . “ One of the things that worries me is these border battles in general , ” he says .

“ Hopefully we ’ ll have maybe a more inclusive sense of patriotism ” after the pandemic , says Mark Lawrence Schrad , an assistant professor of political science at Villanova University and author of “ Vodka Politics : Alcohol , Autocracy , and the Secret History of the Russian State . ”

As America continues to fight the COVID-19 virus it seems increasingly likely that when we look back, the pandemic of 2020 – like 9/11 and the 2008 financial crash – will be a time when the world around us changed in sudden and profound ways. It will affect everything from where we live and work to how we communicate with and relate to others, and even what counts as patriotic service, worthy of the nation’s salute.

That does not mean the post-coronavirus world will be different beyond recognition. The pandemic will not change the basic direction of history so much as accelerate it, according to Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. The importance of the United States to other nations may decline, while that of China increases; but that is happening in some form already. Our screen time may skyrocket along with reliance on Zoom, FaceTime, and other video connectors; but that basic trend preexists. Manufacturers may diversify suppliers to create redundant globalized production chains; but far-sighted managers have pushed this for some time.

Nor are coming changes completely predictable. The influenza epidemic of 1918 turned the world upside down and ravaged the U.S. population. What followed was not a new seriousness of national purpose, but the Roaring ’20s, a free-spending decade remembered today as one of the shallowest eras of American life.

Editor’s note: As a public service, all our coronavirus coverage is free. No paywall.

Life moves online

If there’s one thing the COVID-19 pandemic is almost certain to shift into hyperdrive, it’s the movement of more and more of our activities online.

The most obvious of these changes are occurring in the midst of the outbreak as tens of millions of people struggle to keep up some semblance of their old routines. Virtual schooling is now part of the curriculum for many of the 124,000-plus U.S. schools affected by a coronavirus shutdown, for instance.

Another urban flight?

Life in American cities may not be the same after the coronavirus recedes. At the least, things probably won’t return to anything resembling the old normal for a long time.

Many urban areas have been shrinking for decades as their populations migrate to inner-ring suburbs and more distant areas. It’s possible the pandemic will accelerate this movement as people flee to the perceived safety of larger open spaces.

Valuing real connection

The coronavirus crisis is certainly bringing us closer together, in some ways, but also pushing us apart.

Technology has ensured that everybody remains booked – at least, everybody who has high-speed internet and wants to remain connected to friends and relatives. Zoom this, Zoom that, it’s the book club on Mondays, conversations with grandmother on Tuesdays, then the parents group and the church rummage sale committee. That doesn’t even include all the work-related videoconferencing.

But online meetups can be exhausting. It’s hard to say no – excuses to avoid online chats are more limited than for getting together in real life. And there’s something about them that is just more restrictive. They can’t really duplicate the full experience of personal connection.

And real-life conversation has more to it. There are things you can’t duplicate via video screen. There are subtle pauses, looks, being quiet together without saying anything. Dr. Turkle calls these communication extras “friction.” In this sense, friction refers to the “messiness of politics, of the dinner table, the intimate conversation, the playground, the public square.”

When the pandemic is over, we may come out of it, not hooked on the ease of transferring all our conversations to the infosphere, but missing and honoring the small glitches and unspoken connections that real life entails.

“Empathy requires conversations with friction,” says Dr. Turkle.

Krugman called Uhlig ""another privileged white man who evidently cannot control his urge to belittle the concerns of those less fortunate.""

But that's just a lie. Uhlig wasn't belittling concerns of anyone less fortunate.

""There was nothing racist or discriminatory in how he said it,"" says Reason magazine senior editor Robby Soave, who covers the new ""woke"" protests. ""But because he has some different views from the protesters, he must be a racist.""

Uhlig was placed on leave by the journal he ran.

The new totalitarians demand that no one criticize their view of the world.

The online mob even attacks its fellow Democrats.

David Shor, an analyst at Democratic polling firm Civis Analytics, tweeted a study that concluded, ""race riots reduced Democratic vote share.""

That study was probably accurate. Obviously, rioting alienates voters.

But the mob attacked Shor. ""Come get your boy,"" one tweeted.

His bosses did. Even though Shor issued a groveling apology, he was fired.

Soave points out, ""There's a cruel streak in activism that says, 'If you disagree with me…you have no right to speak.'""

""Why are they winning?"" I ask. ""Their argument is ridiculous.""

""People are afraid to challenge them,"" explains Soave. ""It just takes one employee at one company, to say, 'Here's the law that protects my rights to feel safe and comfortable in this workplace. If you're not making me feel safe and comfortable, I'm going to get you in trouble.'""

So cowardly corporations cave.

A Boeing executive was even forced out for opposing women's service in the military—30 years ago.

A Los Angeles soccer team fired a player because his wife posted racist comments.

Michigan State pushed out a physicist when a twitter mob from its ""Graduate Employees Union"" labeled him a ""scientific racist."" What racist thing had the physicist done? He ""rejects the idea that scientists should categorically exclude the possibility of average genetic differences among groups,"" is how a Wall Street Journal column explained it.

Now ""cancel culture"" has moved abroad.

Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling is being smeared as ""transphobic."" When a tax researcher was fired for saying, ""Identifying as a woman does not make a person a woman,"" Rowling tweeted, incredulously, ""Force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real?""

She said she has nothing against trans people, but she's ""concerned about the huge explosion in young women wishing to transition.""

The Twitter mob claimed her ""hate"" was ""killing trans people.""

Some staff at Hachette, her publisher, refused to work on her next book. Actors in her Harry Potter movies spoke out against her.

But Rowling didn't back down. ""It isn't hate to speak the truth,"" she tweeted.

She also mocked a charity that used the phrase ""people who menstruate"" instead of women, tweeting: ""There used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?""

That further incensed the mob. It claimed her ""hate…leads to trans women, especially teens and black trans women, becoming victims of sexual assault.""

But Rowling is the rare person popular enough to be able to resist the mob. Her publisher spoke up for her, saying, ""Freedom of speech is the cornerstone of publishing.""

And the University of Chicago stood up to the mob, too. The school, after a 10-day investigation, announced there was ""no basis"" for taking away Harold Uhlig's job. He's been reinstated.

That's how these cases should be handled.

""The solution is to challenge these people,"" says Soave. ""We just have to speak up.""

Those of us who can, must.

A roofer from southern Ohio , Rob had recently broken up with Julia , his fiancée and the mother of his two boys . A couple since junior high , they planned to marry once they were financially stable . But what began with flirtatious Facebook messages with “ some rich kid ” ( as Rob described the guy ) ended up with Julia cheating and moving out . Rob wondered whether it was because he didn ’ t have the money to give her the kind of lifestyle she wanted — despite working full-time , he hadn ’ t had a raise in three years . “ Money causes a lot of issues with a relationship , ” he said .
Still , Rob didn ’ t think money was the root of all evil . He thought their problems fundamentally came down to trust . “ I would like to trust her , ” he said , “ but how am I supposed to ? ”
He also didn ’ t trust marriage . “ They say that once you get married , it turns about ten times worse . People ’ s told me , ‘ Hey , don ’ t ever get married. ’ ” Marriage was dangerous ; it carried the risk of divorce . Rob , whose own parents divorced when he was a boy , didn ’ t think kids should have an absent parent , but he resigned himself to it . “ I don ’ t believe in split families and sh * * , but sometimes it just happens . ”
Who or what is to blame for this unraveling of marriage and the complete breakdown of trust in Rob ’ s world , and in the world of so many white , working-class people like him ?
Economic instability is most immediately evident , as it was for Rob and Julia , whose work histories were characterized by the typical challenges : irregular hours and seasonal employment ; lack of paid family leave and sick days ; low wages combined with rising rent . In this regard , Rob ’ s predicament is not particularly unusual : Working-class men ’ s wages have been fairly stagnant since the 1970s even as their spells of unemployment and underemployment have increased .
Less visible but more dramatic is the role of social alienation . At least two generations have now come of age in the aftermath of the divorce revolution , and whatever the original causes — was it economic change or cultural change that mattered more ? — the trauma that generations of children in fragmented families have experienced has become a main factor explaining the great unraveling . “ Trust issues ” run rampant .

Love is just a word . It ’ s just fake . ”
It ’ s also the case that in the proliferation of trauma and family chaos — high rates of children born outside of marriage , the opioid epidemic — marriage sometimes becomes about filling loneliness and healing broken selves : two emotionally needy people seeking solace and loading marriage with expectations that it can ’ t possibly fulfill . “ Some people are looking just to immediately fall into a relationship . Some people are looking just to escape loneliness , ” said Adam , a young married Ohioan who later became addicted to heroin and divorced .
Further , social alienation has left a vacuum in which many working-class young people are even more vulnerable to ( misleading ) cultural cues about relationships and marriage . In the absence of in-the-flesh marriage models , what entertainers and educators say has unmitigated power .
Particularly damaging is the popular story about love , because it is foundational for all else — choosing a partner , the timing of sex , the meaning and purpose of marriage , the bounds of family . For instance , if love is primarily a feeling that just happens to you , then finding a spouse is less an active process of discernment and more an “ aha ” moment . You can fall in love , and out of it . Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck contrasts this “ fixed mindset ” with a “ growth mindset ” about love , which expects feelings to ebb and flow with the circumstances of life and sees that it takes effort to overcome inevitable differences and create lasting love .
Whereas even ten years ago the public conversation about the marriage gap — that is , the divergence of marriage trends across class lines — felt relatively one-sided depending on a person ’ s ideology , today it ’ s common to acknowledge the multifaceted nature of the marriage retreat . There is a growing awareness that it ’ s not simply about bad choices or malignant forces . There is no one thing killing marriage . Instead , a dizzying array of economic , social , and cultural causes are intersecting with people ’ s free choices . Conservatives , in particular , need to recognize the role that economics has played in marriage ’ s retreat among the working class .
To recognize it is to appreciate the shaping power of those mediating institutions that lie between the individual and the state : the family , the neighborhood , churches , schools , and , yes , businesses , too . What those civil-society institutions say and do mediates beliefs , and either supports or fails families . The televangelist who proclaims unceasingly that you should live your best life now sows the seeds of marital unhappiness . The neighborhood that becomes a silent war zone of opioids and other drugs feeds distrust rather than trust . And the big business that celebrates abortion but fails to offer paid family leave for its workers sends the not-so-subtle message that work is more important than family .
To adopt an analogy from the natural world , marriage lives in an environment — in neighborhoods and families of origin , in places of work and places of worship , and in the world of ideas and beliefs and attitudes that make up a culture . Pollute that environment , and you endanger marriage . In working-class neighborhoods , marriage is endangered because the marriage ecosystem — social , economic , and cultural — has become toxic . The culture that tells individuals to prioritize their short-term happiness above all else also tells business leaders to prioritize shareholder profits above workers . In both cases , the divorces are hemorrhaging trust .
That ’ s decisive , because the loss of social trust , the oxygen of marriage , is the most insidious danger of the toxic ecosystem . The task then is to both repair the ecosystem and rebuild the trust upon which it is sustained . This involves everyone from policymaker to next-door neighbor .
If you ’ re a business leader , what can you do to make it easier for your workers to get and stay married ? Offering a couple of weeks of paid family leave is an obvious way to help . So is paying a living wage . We can learn from conservative leaders such as Seattle businessman Gellert Dornay , who reports that instituting profit-sharing plans has benefited his company and his employees ’ families . Dornay , the founder of Axia Home Loans , is part of a network of business leaders advancing what they call “ shared capitalism , ” which challenges the notion that businesses should exist primarily to maximize shareholder profit . “ Instead of profits being siphoned to a small group of outside shareholders who are already financially secure , ” Dornay wrote in an article for the Institute for Family Studies ( an organization with which we are involved ) , “ shared capitalism emphasizes a wider participation in the profits by including workers , not just shareholders , in the success of a company. ” We need conservative business leaders , in particular , who can model and articulate how business is not a separate sphere from civil society but a vital part of it , and therefore a vital part of the marriage ecosystem .
If you ’ re an active member of your religious congregation , what can your congregation do to become a friend of marriage ? Many churches have formal marriage-preparation programs and are in need of mentors and trained facilitators . In the absence of that , invite a dating or engaged couple over for dinner . Cross-class and intergenerational friendships can help to address both social alienation and deceptive cultural cues .
A pro-worker , pro-family coalition of policymakers could eliminate the marriage penalties associated with programs such as Medicaid and food stamps , which discourage all too many working-class couples from tying the knot , or they could introduce a wage subsidy to reduce the kind of financial stress that can tear couples like Rob and Julia apart .
Finally , conservatives should welcome potential progressive allies . For instance , social conservatives have spent the last 50 years resisting the culture of sexual objectification , arguing against everything from porn to sexually degrading television commercials . But in 2019 the loudest movement protesting sexual objectification is Me Too . There are excesses to avoid with the movement , but there are also opportunities for common ground and new arguments to make about why sexual libertarianism has been terrible for marriages and social trust . Amid the wreckage , conservatives can propose a new culture of sexual restraint and a “ theology of the body ” that tells a positive and holistic story about love and sex .
When it comes to marriage , the task is less to conceive new programs dedicated explicitly to strengthening marriage ( though such programs have their place ) , and more to repair the marriage ecosystem and replenish the collective reserve of social trust upon which it depends .
Rob and Julia eventually reunited after Rob found roofing work at a new company , where he earned raises and promotions along with a new truck and smartphone , tokens of reclaimed dignity . When his mom died from an overdose , it prompted soul-searching and renewed grit : He wanted to leave a legacy his family could be proud of . Mildred , the religious old woman Rob credits with straightening him out when he was an unruly young man , was as ever his model , her lifelong marriage an inspiration . Rob still had trust issues but built enough trust to buy a fixer-upper with Julia and tie the marriage knot .
Not without struggle , Rob and Julia are finding their way . It takes an ecosystem to sustain a marriage .

Social trust is its oxygen

‘My stress levels are up to here,” said Rob, pointing above his head. A roofer from southern Ohio, Rob had recently broken up with Julia, his fiancée and the mother of his two boys. A couple since junior high, they planned to marry once they were financially stable. But what began with flirtatious Facebook messages with “some rich kid” (as Rob described the guy) ended up with Julia cheating and moving out. Rob wondered whether it was because he didn’t have the money to give her the kind of lifestyle she wanted — despite working full-time, he hadn’t had a raise in three years. “Money causes a lot of issues with a relationship,” he said.

Still, Rob didn’t think money was the root of all evil. He thought their problems fundamentally came down to trust. “I would like to trust her,” he said, “but how am I supposed to?”

He also didn’t trust marriage. “They say that once you get married, it turns about ten times worse. People’s told me, ‘Hey, don’t ever get married.’” Marriage was dangerous; it carried the risk of divorce. Rob, whose own parents divorced when he was a boy, didn’t think kids should have an absent parent, but he resigned himself to it. “I don’t believe in split families and sh**, but sometimes it just happens.”

Who or what is to blame for this unraveling of marriage and the complete breakdown of trust in Rob’s world, and in the world of so many white, working-class people like him?

It’s also the case that in the proliferation of trauma and family chaos — high rates of children born outside of marriage, the opioid epidemic — marriage sometimes becomes about filling loneliness and healing broken selves: two emotionally needy people seeking solace and loading marriage with expectations that it can’t possibly fulfill. “Some people are looking just to immediately fall into a relationship. Some people are looking just to escape loneliness,” said Adam, a young married Ohioan who later became addicted to heroin and divorced.

What those civil-society institutions say and do mediates beliefs, and either supports or fails families. The televangelist who proclaims unceasingly that you should live your best life now sows the seeds of marital unhappiness. The neighborhood that becomes a silent war zone of opioids and other drugs feeds distrust rather than trust. And the big business that celebrates abortion but fails to offer paid family leave for its workers sends the not-so-subtle message that work is more important than family.

To adopt an analogy from the natural world, marriage lives in an environment — in neighborhoods and families of origin, in places of work and places of worship, and in the world of ideas and beliefs and attitudes that make up a culture. Pollute that environment, and you endanger marriage. In working-class neighborhoods, marriage is endangered because the marriage ecosystem — social, economic, and cultural — has become toxic. The culture that tells individuals to prioritize their short-term happiness above all else also tells business leaders to prioritize shareholder profits above workers. In both cases, the divorces are hemorrhaging trust.

That’s decisive, because the loss of social trust, the oxygen of marriage, is the most insidious danger of the toxic ecosystem. The task then is to both repair the ecosystem and rebuild the trust upon which it is sustained. This involves everyone from policymaker to next-door neighbor.

If you’re a business leader, what can you do to make it easier for your workers to get and stay married? Offering a couple of weeks of paid family leave is an obvious way to help. So is paying a living wage. We can learn from conservative leaders such as Seattle businessman Gellert Dornay, who reports that instituting profit-sharing plans has benefited his company and his employees’ families. Dornay, the founder of Axia Home Loans, is part of a network of business leaders advancing what they call “shared capitalism,” which challenges the notion that businesses should exist primarily to maximize shareholder profit. “Instead of profits being siphoned to a small group of outside shareholders who are already financially secure,” Dornay wrote in an article for the Institute for Family Studies (an organization with which we are involved), “shared capitalism emphasizes a wider participation in the profits by including workers, not just shareholders, in the success of a company.” We need conservative business leaders, in particular, who can model and articulate how business is not a separate sphere from civil society but a vital part of it, and therefore a vital part of the marriage ecosystem.

If you’re an active member of your religious congregation, what can your congregation do to become a friend of marriage? Many churches have formal marriage-preparation programs and are in need of mentors and trained facilitators. In the absence of that, invite a dating or engaged couple over for dinner. Cross-class and intergenerational friendships can help to address both social alienation and deceptive cultural cues.

A pro-worker, pro-family coalition of policymakers could eliminate the marriage penalties associated with programs such as Medicaid and food stamps, which discourage all too many working-class couples from tying the knot, or they could introduce a wage subsidy to reduce the kind of financial stress that can tear couples like Rob and Julia apart.

Finally, conservatives should welcome potential progressive allies. For instance, social conservatives have spent the last 50 years resisting the culture of sexual objectification, arguing against everything from porn to sexually degrading television commercials. But in 2019 the loudest movement protesting sexual objectification is Me Too. There are excesses to avoid with the movement, but there are also opportunities for common ground and new arguments to make about why sexual libertarianism has been terrible for marriages and social trust. Amid the wreckage, conservatives can propose a new culture of sexual restraint and a “theology of the body” that tells a positive and holistic story about love and sex.

When it comes to marriage, the task is less to conceive new programs dedicated explicitly to strengthening marriage (though such programs have their place), and more to repair the marriage ecosystem and replenish the collective reserve of social trust upon which it depends.

Rob and Julia eventually reunited after Rob found roofing work at a new company, where he earned raises and promotions along with a new truck and smartphone, tokens of reclaimed dignity. When his mom died from an overdose, it prompted soul-searching and renewed grit: He wanted to leave a legacy his family could be proud of. Mildred, the religious old woman Rob credits with straightening him out when he was an unruly young man, was as ever his model, her lifelong marriage an inspiration. Rob still had trust issues but built enough trust to buy a fixer-upper with Julia and tie the marriage knot.

Not without struggle, Rob and Julia are finding their way. It takes an ecosystem to sustain a marriage.

It’s no wonder that with more than 40 million watching in the United States last year and hundreds million more around the world, many can’t turn down that chance.

And at Sunday’s 87th Academy Awards ceremony honoring the best films of 2014, there will be no shortage of political topics. Edward Snowden, the man responsible for the most audacious national security leak ever, is the subject of a film up for best documentary feature, while more than 1,300 miles away from Hollywood, the closely watched trial of the man accused of killing the real “American Sniper,” up for best picture, goes on.

Will there be any big political moments this year?

The Oscars were mostly quiet affairs, politically speaking — until Jane Fonda won best actress for “Klute” in 1972.

Three months before her infamous trip to Hanoi, the outspoken Vietnam War opponent surprised many when she kept quiet about her politics on the show, but sounded off on U.S. foreign policy in southeast Asia to reporters backstage.

“I was thinking that, while we’re all sitting there giving out awards, which are very important awards, there are murders being committed in our name in Indochina,” she told the press. “And I think everyone out there is aware of it as I am, and I think that everyone out there wants it to end as much as I do. And I didn’t think I needed to say it. I think we have had it. I really do. I think everyone feels that way. And I just didn’t think it needed to be said.”

In 1975, when the anti-Vietnam War film “Hearts and Minds” won best documentary, producer Bert Schneider used his acceptance speech to read a cable from Viet Cong official Dinh Ba Thi. Co-host Frank Sinatra was not pleased.

“It is ironic that we are here at a time just before Vietnam is about to be liberated,” Schneider said before reading the message, weeks before the fall of Saigon.

“Please transmit to all our friends in America our recognition of all that they have done on behalf of peace and for the application of the Paris Accords on Vietnam,” Schneider read. “These actions serve the legitimate interest of the American people and the Vietnamese people. Greetings of friendship to all the American people.”

Later in the show, Sinatra read aloud a note, purportedly from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences: “I’ve been asked by the academy to make the following statement regarding a statement that was made by a winner. ‘We are not responsible for any political references made on the program, and we are sorry they had to take place this evening.’”

The statement, however, was not from the academy but from co-host Bob Hope. Hope, who performed for U.S. troops for 50 years, scribbled out his own message and handed it to Sinatra, who was presenting the next award.

Other presenters since haven’t felt the same way.

Presenters Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins drew the ire of the academy in 1993 when they departed from their script to address the U.S. government’s detention, at Guantanamo Bay, of HIV-positive Haitians fleeing a coup d’état. During the same show, Richard Gere expressed his hope that Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was watching so he could address human rights violations in Tibet.

We’re getting rid of a market that’s not just financial, but that actually owns any assets. You have to have a mechanism for allocating capital that isn’t based on where should it go to get its highest return. You might want to allocate it so that firms that aren’t doing well get more capital so they can catch up to everybody else. You want workers visiting other plants to see how they do things.

How do you figure out a way of allocating capital so it deals with social issues, which region of the country you want it in — how do you do this in a way which strengthens equality rather than undermines it? Then it’s a similar point with labor.

One issue is this question of sectoral councils. In a sector — whether it’s a hospital, education, car manufacturing, or resource sector — you’d actually have an institution where, instead of firms competing like they do under capitalism, you have workers from the firms in that sector electing people to a sectoral council where they could make plans for that sector as a whole that fit into the larger social plan. Then they could distribute capital within that sector to meet the overall plans, but do it in a way that raises the productivity and the quality of every firm in that sector.

In addition to trying to establish equality across a sector and having centralized research and development so that everybody can access it — it means that you’ve got another layer of planning that’s separate from the central planning board. You can have planning centrally that does certain things, you can have layers sectorally that do certain things, you can have layers regionally that do certain things. A sector might be plugged into regional councils or urban councils, and then you have a lot of planning at the firm itself.

One of the arguments that Hayek made is that only capitalism can actually get latent information from people because it’s not obvious, for example, what people actually want to buy. They don’t sit down at the beginning of January and say, “I know what I want,” and give it to the central planners. His question is about how you find out what people want, and how you find out what skills people really have without private property and private incentives. He said that’s only something that capitalism can do through markets. It reveals capacities and information through competition.

It’s a serious argument, and my response is that first, markets — as they are under capitalism —actually systematically hide information because it benefits private property and competition. Socialism opens up the door to sharing information.

Hayek is right about the capacities of capitalism, but he’s thinking of the capacities of entrepreneurs. Workers are just commodities to him. The point of socialism is to see the potential capacities of ordinary people. If you gave workers factories right now, they wouldn’t know what to do with them. There’s nothing about capitalism that teaches you how to run things, never mind how to actually coordinate all this complexity. Socialism is actually concerned with not just the capacities of entrepreneurs, but the capacity of learners.

When you look at productivity growth in capitalism, it’s at 1 or 2 percent. The argument is that capitalism has incentives for higher productivity. Well, it’s not hard to imagine workers on a job coming up with ideas about how to do it better that could match this productivity.

Life is pretty good—right?

It’s the middle of the night, and your kids are asleep. Your spouse is sleeping beside you. You should be asleep, too, but you’re tossing and turning because you’re worried.

It started with something so silly; you read the other day that the Seattle school district is “planning to infuse all K–12 math classes with ethnic-studies questions that encourage students to explore how math has been ‘appropriated’ by Western culture and used in systems of power and oppression.” One more big-city school board making some sort of idiotic change in the name of political correctness, while dodging the much more important question of whether the kids are learning math in the first place.

You hated math as a kid, but you see now why you needed to learn it. These days, cashiers can’t calculate the right change without the register, people can’t figure out how many miles they can get on a full tank of gas, nobody knows how to calculate the tip, and nobody can calculate the cost of carpeting a room per square foot.

You don’t live in Seattle, and you like your child’s elementary-school teacher. She hasn’t infused math class with oppression studies. But that doesn’t mean you don’t wonder if the school is preparing your children for the challenges they’ll face later on in life.

Despite taking heavy flak from some critics , led by left-wing director Michael Moore , the film earned a jaw-dropping $ 247 million in its first two weeks , exposing a chasm between the Hollywood and political elite and moviegoing public not seen since the release of “ The Passion of the Christ ” in 2004 .
Bloomberg Politics called “ American Sniper ” the “ official Oscar nominee of the culture wars . ”
“ You ’ re seeing the same kind of astonishment that Hollywood reacted with when ‘ Passion of Christ ’ went well , ” said Los Angeles talk-radio host Larry Elder . “ The fact is , most Americans feel pretty good about their country , most Americans are very patriotic about their country , most Americans support the military , and even if they feel the mission may not be a good mission , they still support the military . And I just don ’ t think Hollywood gets that . ”
The latest high-profile skirmish came Monday when actor Gary Sinise blasted former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean ’ s declaration that ticket-buyers flocking to see the film are “ very angry ” tea party types .
“ I bet you if you looked at a cross-section of the tea party and the people who go see this movie , there ’ s a lot of intersection , ” said Mr. Dean on HBO ’ s “ Real Time with Bill Maher . ”
SEE ALSO : Gary Sinise to Howard Dean on ‘ American Sniper ’ diss : ‘ What the hell are you talking about ? ’
Mr. Sinise , an active supporter of veterans , swung back with a post on WhoSay informing Mr. Dean that he had seen the movie and “ would not consider myself to be an angry person . ”
“ You certainly have a right to make stupid blanket statements , suggesting that all people who see this film are angry , but how is that helpful sir ? ” said Mr. Sinise , who stars in “ CSI : New York . ”
The movie , which tells the story of the late Navy SEAL Chris Kyle , a highly decorated sniper who served four tours of duty in Iraq , may actually be benefiting from the constant crossfire , said movie critic Christian Toto of the website Hollywood in Toto .
“ I think you ’ ve got great word of mouth , and I think you ’ ve got a terrific film , ” Mr. Toto said . “ I think now it ’ s also going to have people , mostly on the right , who are going to say , ‘ You know what ? To heck with those Michael Moore types , I want to go see this movie and support it because it speaks to my values . ’ ”
Shortly after the film ’ s release , Mr. Moore blasted military snipers as “ cowards , ” while Mr. Maher described the movie ’ s hero as “ a psychopath patriot and we love him. ” Actor Seth Rogen said on Twitter that the film reminded him of the Nazi propaganda film in “ Inglourious Basterds , ” but after the ensuing backlash released a statement saying he had not intended to offend anyone .
Those leaping to the film ’ s defense include country singers Craig Morgan and Blake Shelton , Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain and former Alaska Gov . Sarah Palin .
“ Michael Moore should spend a few weeks with ISIS and Boko Haram . Then he might appreciate @ AmericanSniper . I am proud of our defenders , ” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich on Twitter .
Ironically , the movie is hardly the propaganda fest its foes decry and some of its champions hype .
Director Clint Eastwood says “ American Sniper ” makes “ the biggest anti-war statement any film ” can make by showing “ what [ war ] does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did , ” according to the Hollywood Reporter .
While Mr. Eastwood became one of the world ’ s biggest stars playing “ spaghetti Western ” gunfighters and “ Dirty Harry ” Callahan , some of his other films — the Oscar winners “ Unforgiven ” and “ Million Dollar Baby , ” for example — are also about how killing burdens a man ’ s conscience .
“ I don ’ t think the film is as black and white or as blunt as some of the ideological fighting suggests it is , ” Mr. Toto said . “ I think it does have a strong anti-war message , that war is hell , and that people are changed from it , and even a proud patriotic man like Chris Kyle comes home a different person and has to reclaim who he is , his family and his marriage . ”
The notoriety of “ American Sniper ” could either help or harm its odds of winning an Oscar . The film has been nominated for six awards , including Best Picture , but “ the Academy consists of a bunch of people who think like Seth Rogen and Michael Moore , ” said Mr. Elder .
“ [ They ] are instinctively anti-war , anti-Republican , and have real uneasy feelings about flag waving movies , and I think all of that is going to hurt the chances of ‘ American Sniper , ’ ” Mr. Elder said .
On the other hand , that could change if the movie continues to smash box-office records . A Reuters/Ipsos poll released Friday found that 22 percent of those surveyed wanted to see “ American Sniper ” win Best Picture at the Feb. 22 awards show . Coming in second was “ Selma ” with 8 percent .
“ My gut says ‘ Boyhood ’ will win Best Picture , that ‘ Selma ’ will just miss and that ‘ American Sniper ’ will miss as well . But if the ‘ American Sniper ’ juggernaut keeps on going , I kind of think things are up for grabs , ” Mr. Toto said . “ I have a sense that if the culture continues to be blazing with this movie and the box office stays really strong for a few more weeks , it could sneak up and win Best Picture . ”","The blockbuster “American Sniper” has opened up another front in the culture war, triggering a media firefight between liberals who have denounced the film as glorifying killing or whitewashing the Iraq war and conservatives who have embraced its patriotic hero.

Who : “ Empire ” actor Jussie Smollett , two brothers questioned in his attack , the Chicago police and the rapt public following every beat of this strange case as it continues to unravel .
What : Smollett , who is black and gay , reported that he was attacked by two men and claimed his assailants made racial and homophobic slurs , put a rope around his neck , doused him in bleach and referenced “ MAGA country ” — suggesting they were supporters of President Trump . Law enforcement labeled the attack a hate crime , and celebrities , human rights groups , politicians and fans rallied to support Smollett . Presidential hopefuls Sens . Kamala Harris and Cory Booker called the attack “ an attempted modern-day lynching . ”
Since those initial reports , things have gotten complicated . Police took two brothers into custody as suspects , then released them amid reports that they claimed the attack was a hoax and that Smollett had hired them to stage the assault . Smollett released statements via lawyers refuting the hoax narrative and maintained that he is the victim . He admitted he knows the brothers , and employed one as a personal trainer , but denied their involvement in the attack .
Where : The alleged assault occurred in the downtown Chicago neighborhood of Streeterville .
When : According to Smollett , the attack occurred around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 . Reports suggesting that it was a hoax began within days , and the full details of the incident are still not known .
Why : Unclear . Early reports suggested Smollett staged the attack because his character was set to be written off “ Empire. ” Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television , which produces the show , called those reports “ patently ridiculous . ”

Who: “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, two brothers questioned in his attack, the Chicago police and the rapt public following every beat of this strange case as it continues to unravel.

What: Smollett, who is black and gay, reported that he was attacked by two men and claimed his assailants made racial and homophobic slurs, put a rope around his neck, doused him in bleach and referenced “MAGA country” — suggesting they were supporters of President Trump. Law enforcement labeled the attack a hate crime, and celebrities, human rights groups, politicians and fans rallied to support Smollett. Presidential hopefuls Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker called the attack “an attempted modern-day lynching.”

Since those initial reports, things have gotten complicated. Police took two brothers into custody as suspects, then released them amid reports that they claimed the attack was a hoax and that Smollett had hired them to stage the assault. Smollett released statements via lawyers refuting the hoax narrative and maintained that he is the victim. He admitted he knows the brothers, and employed one as a personal trainer, but denied their involvement in the attack.

Where: The alleged assault occurred in the downtown Chicago neighborhood of Streeterville.

When: According to Smollett, the attack occurred around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29. Reports suggesting that it was a hoax began within days, and the full details of the incident are still not known.

Why: Unclear. Early reports suggested Smollett staged the attack because his character was set to be written off “Empire.” Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television, which produces the show, called those reports “patently ridiculous.”

What’s next: Police say they hope to interview Smollett further to either corroborate or debunk details of the investigation. His spokeswoman said Smollett had no plans for further meetings. Law enforcement officials also revealed that the case could be headed toward a grand jury.

Backlash against the star, his doubters, police and the internet mob is growing. Smollett’s supporters feel betrayed that he may have fabricated the story to boost his career. Critics of the Chicago Police Department’s history of dealing with racially motivated violence are casting doubt on its handling of the case. Cultural critics are warning of the dangers of making snap judgments based on personal bias in the divisive Trump era. And … much more.

Perspectives

If the attack is a hoax — that’s the worst-case scenario.

“If Smollett’s story is found to be untrue, it will cause irreparable damage to the communities most affected. Smollett would be the first example skeptics cite when they say we should be dubious of victims who step forward to share their experiences of racist hate crimes or sexual violence. The incident would be touted as proof that there is a leftist conspiracy to cast Trump supporters as violent, murderous racists.

The damage done would be too deep and long-lasting.” — Nana Efua Mumford, Washington Post

Trump supporters are routinely, and unfairly, villainized.

“If the way the Jussie Smollett fiasco was handled by national media is any indication, due process is becoming a foreign concept in a profession in which one is increasingly considered guilty until proven innocent. … The characters change but the story remains the same: If Trump or a Trump supporter is involved in an incident, guilt is assumed. Due process be damned.” — Joe Concha, The Hill

As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to upend American life, social lives are vanishing. Coffee shop dates have been traded for quarantines, face-to-face meetings exchanged for physical distance. Real conversations and opportunities for social connection outside of the immediate family are scarce.

Connecting online seems like the logical solution, but has often been an ineffective alternative. Internet communication can easily be dominated by division and tribalism, and as a pandemic and a divisive election year converge, many fear division will only worsen.

“Some people are feeling a little trapped right now,” added Joan Blades, the organization's founder. “The guides provide a way to expand.”

Online tools combat social isolation

The need for expansion amid isolation is leading people to tools like Mismatch, a video conference service that enables discourse between classrooms across the country. Combined with conversation guides from Living Room Conversations, Mismatch uses AllSides Connect to let anyone host face-to-face, topic-driven discussions online.

“In this environment of anxiety, uncertainty and fear, there is a risk that people will feel alone,” said Kristin Hansen, director of Mismatch.org. “This is designed as an antidote to forces that pull at our social fabric.”

“During a crisis, we need to come together — with friends, family, even estranged family, even people we disagree with,” AllSides President John Gable said. “Integrating technology with expertise from psychologists and professional mediators, we are building even stronger relationships than we had before.”

It’s not just about continuing a meeting cycle, but using those meetings to foster real connections. As social distancing becomes normal, the need to maintain and improve our social fabric is made more apparent.

Movements like #InThisTogether and #WeavingCommunity have sprung up on social media, promoting unity and shared progress in response to an unprecedented threat.

“Our need for social connection is hard-wired in all of us,” said Pearce Godwin, executive director of National Conversation Project, which is helping lead #WeavingCommunity. “It may be that we needed this kind of shock to our communities to regain a stronger appreciation of each other and our shared humanity.”

The National Conversation Project, the Aspen Institute’s Weave project and the #ListenFirst coalition are helping lead Weaving2020.org to highlight social bridging movements. Their efforts, Godwin hopes, will produce a stronger national community — even after the pandemic subsides.

Church attracts more people online

For organizations such as First Congregational United Church of Christ in Boulder, Colorado, one challenge is to keep older members of the congregation connected during a shelter-in-place order. Yet, the transition to all-online events has been smooth.

“On our first live stream service, we had about 500 people join, twice what we have normally,” said Pedro Silva, an associate minister. “For a lot of our people, church is their lifeline, their community, it’s what keeps them getting up during the week …a lot of people have been very grateful.”

National initiatives are also capitalizing on ways of meeting productively online. The upcoming Future 500 summit at EarthX, an annual solutions-oriented conference of hundreds of executives and environmental leaders, is considering using AllSides Connect and other conferencing tools such as Zoom as the event moves completely online — a change that may produce both social and technical advantages.

“We now have an opportunity to exceed the effectiveness of in-person gatherings,” said Bill Shireman, president and CEO of Future 500. “With digital, you can have an unlimited number of people participating, at extremely low marginal costs, and an immediacy that allows meetings without a significant amount of planning.”

Tech and human intuition are combining to make online relationship-building more intimate and effective than ever — at a time when humans have never needed it more. In this era of shared isolation, it’s time to embrace the tools that unite us in spite of our differences. When the dust settles, we’ll be better for it.

But this year , the leaders of Women ’ s March Inc. — one of the organizations that grew out of the original march , and the most visible public face of the march today — are facing calls to step down . The reasons include criticisms of their association with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and allegations that they made anti-Semitic remarks in planning meetings .

Women ’ s March Inc. is a national organization led by four activists from New York City — Tamika Mallory , Linda Sarsour , Carmen Perez , and Bob Bland — who helped organize the first march in Washington , DC , in 2017 . The group also has local chapters that are planning marches in cities around the country this year , though other local marches are not affiliated with Women ’ s March Inc .
The controversy has contributed to the cancellation of at least one city march , and a number of progressive groups , including the Southern Poverty Law Center , have dropped their partnerships with the Women ’ s March , according to the Jewish News Syndicate .
Meanwhile , the Democratic National Committee appears to have been removed from a list of partners on the Women ’ s March website .
Women ’ s March Inc. co-chairs Tamika Mallory and Bob Bland denied allegations of anti-Semitism in an appearance on The View on Monday . Asked by co-host Meghan McCain why she would publicly associate with Farrakhan , given his anti-Semitic remarks , Mallory said , “ I don ’ t agree with many of Minister Farrakhan ’ s statements . ”
She also resisted calls to step down . “ I am willing to lead until my term at Women ’ s March is up , ” she said .
“ Women ’ s March exists to fight all forms of oppression and bigotry , including anti-Semitism , misogyny , homophobia , transphobia , racism , white supremacy , ableism , xenophobia , Islamophobia , classism , and ageism , ” Women ’ s March Inc. said in a statement to ███ , in response to a question about groups dropping partnerships . “ That work continues with the release of our Women ’ s Agenda and lobby day this week in Washington , and our anniversary Marches happening all over the country this Saturday . ”
No matter what happens at those marches , the influence of the Women ’ s March on American feminism — and on the left more broadly — is undeniable . And a groundswell of women ’ s activism in the wake of the 2016 election has led to an unprecedented number of women in the halls of political power ; earlier this month , a record 117 women were sworn into Congress .
The future of Women ’ s March Inc. , and of women ’ s marches around the country , may be in doubt . But the impact of the Women ’ s March as a broader movement on American politics endures .
The controversies have caused some to distance themselves from the Women ’ s March
Women ’ s March Inc. is no stranger to controversy , having weathered debates over representation of women of color and the inclusion ( or exclusion ) of a variety of groups from its official platform . But criticism of the group intensified in March 2018 when Mallory attended a Nation of Islam event at which Farrakhan made anti-Semitic remarks . In November , as controversy grew over the issue , Teresa Shook , whose 2016 Facebook post kicked off the first march , called on Mallory and the other co-chairs of Women ’ s March Inc. to step down .
Then in December , Leah McSweeney and Jacob Siegel at Tablet reported that , according to others involved in planning the march , Mallory and fellow Women ’ s March Inc. co-chair Carmen Perez had made anti-Semitic comments themselves . At a meeting to plan the first Women ’ s March , Mallory and Perez “ asserted that Jewish people bore a special collective responsibility as exploiters of black and brown people , ” sources told Tablet .
Mallory and the Women ’ s March have denied these allegations . But the Tablet report , as well as Mallory ’ s association with Farrakhan , has led some groups to drop their affiliation with Women ’ s March Inc .
In December , the Washington state chapter of the Women ’ s March announced that it would disband and affiliate with a different progressive group , Smart Politics . Organizers in Spokane , Washington , still plan to hold a march .
Meanwhile , earlier this month , organizers of the New Orleans Women ’ s March announced they were canceling this Saturday ’ s event .
“ Many of the sister marches have asked the leaders of Women ’ s March Inc. to resign but as of today , they have yet to do so , ” said the National Organization for Women ’ s Baton Rouge chapter , which organized the New Orleans march . “ The controversy is dampening efforts of sister marches to fundraise , enlist involvement , [ and ] find sponsors , and attendee numbers have drastically declined this year . New Orleans is no exception . ”
A number of progressive organizations , from the SPLC to Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense , have dropped their affiliations with Women ’ s March Inc. over concerns about anti-Semitism , according to the Jewish News Syndicate .
“ Moms Demand Action isn ’ t an official sponsor of the Women ’ s March , but plenty of chapters have chosen to participate in the locally organized events , ” Taylor Maxwell , a spokesperson for Moms Demand Action , told ███ . The SPLC has not responded to ███ ’ s request for comment .
The DNC , once listed as a march sponsor on the Women ’ s March Inc. website , no longer appears there , according to CNN .
“ The DNC stands in solidarity with all those fighting for women ’ s rights and holding the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers across the country accountable , ” said DNC deputy communications director Sabrina Singh in a statement to ███ . “ Women are on the front lines of fighting back against this administration and are the core of our Democratic Party . ”
Asked if the relationship between the DNC and the Women ’ s March had changed from last year to this year , a DNC official declined to comment further .
Women ’ s March Inc. has been working to repair relationships with the Jewish community . According to the Washington Post , since anti-Semitism charges were first leveled at the organization , it has added three Jewish women to its steering committee and updated its platform to include a message of support for Jewish women .
It remains to be seen whether this will be enough to convince those concerned about the anti-Semitism allegations to turn out to march on Saturday . Sociology professor Dana R. Fisher , who studies protest movements , told the Post that turnout in Washington , DC , will probably number in the tens of thousands , far fewer than the estimated 470,000 people who attended the first Women ’ s March following the inauguration of President Trump in 2017 .
But those who marched in 2017 may also be engaging in other forms of activism . Instead of a march on Saturday , Women ’ s March Chicago has organized Operation Activation , which encourages women and their allies to participate in community actions like neighborhood cleanups and postcard-writing campaigns advocating for progressive legislation . The decision to hold a day of action instead of a march wasn ’ t inspired by controversy around Women ’ s March Inc. , according to a Women ’ s March Chicago fact sheet provided to ███ . Rather , the Chicago group chose to hold a march in October 2018 to mobilize voters for the midterm elections , and decided not to host two marches back to back . The group plans to march again in 2020 .
And in addition to the march on Saturday , Women ’ s March Inc. is releasing a federal policy platform called the Women ’ s Agenda and organizing a day of lobbying on Capitol Hill on Friday in support of Medicare-for-all .
Through their platform , their marches , and their Women ’ s Convention in October 2017 in Detroit , the Women ’ s March organizers changed the mainstream conversation around feminism and left-wing politics in America , prompting a wider swath of women than ever before to think about women ’ s rights as part of a larger set of civil rights , including racial and economic justice .
That conversation will no doubt continue at marches on Saturday . But it will also continue at community actions and other events throughout the year — and in the halls of Congress , where more women than ever before now have the opportunity to craft legislation that affects all Americans .
Whatever happens in the streets on Saturday , the legacy of the women who marched all over the world in 2017 will persist for a long time to come .","On Saturday, women and their allies will take to the streets in cities around the world for the third annual Women’s March.

“Women’s March exists to fight all forms of oppression and bigotry, including anti-Semitism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, racism, white supremacy, ableism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, classism, and ageism,” Women’s March Inc. said in a statement to Vox, in response to a question about groups dropping partnerships. “That work continues with the release of our Women’s Agenda and lobby day this week in Washington, and our anniversary Marches happening all over the country this Saturday.”

No matter what happens at those marches, the influence of the Women’s March on American feminism — and on the left more broadly — is undeniable. And a groundswell of women’s activism in the wake of the 2016 election has led to an unprecedented number of women in the halls of political power; earlier this month, a record 117 women were sworn into Congress.

The future of Women’s March Inc., and of women’s marches around the country, may be in doubt. But the impact of the Women’s March as a broader movement on American politics endures.

The controversies have caused some to distance themselves from the Women’s March

Women’s March Inc. is no stranger to controversy, having weathered debates over representation of women of color and the inclusion (or exclusion) of a variety of groups from its official platform. But criticism of the group intensified in March 2018 when Mallory attended a Nation of Islam event at which Farrakhan made anti-Semitic remarks. In November, as controversy grew over the issue, Teresa Shook, whose 2016 Facebook post kicked off the first march, called on Mallory and the other co-chairs of Women’s March Inc. to step down.

Then in December, Leah McSweeney and Jacob Siegel at Tablet reported that, according to others involved in planning the march, Mallory and fellow Women’s March Inc. co-chair Carmen Perez had made anti-Semitic comments themselves. At a meeting to plan the first Women’s March, Mallory and Perez “asserted that Jewish people bore a special collective responsibility as exploiters of black and brown people,” sources told Tablet.

Mallory and the Women’s March have denied these allegations. But the Tablet report, as well as Mallory’s association with Farrakhan, has led some groups to drop their affiliation with Women’s March Inc.

In December, the Washington state chapter of the Women’s March announced that it would disband and affiliate with a different progressive group, Smart Politics. Organizers in Spokane, Washington, still plan to hold a march.

Meanwhile, earlier this month, organizers of the New Orleans Women’s March announced they were canceling this Saturday’s event.

“Many of the sister marches have asked the leaders of Women’s March Inc. to resign but as of today, they have yet to do so,” said the National Organization for Women’s Baton Rouge chapter, which organized the New Orleans march. “The controversy is dampening efforts of sister marches to fundraise, enlist involvement, [and] find sponsors, and attendee numbers have drastically declined this year. New Orleans is no exception.”

A number of progressive organizations, from the SPLC to Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense, have dropped their affiliations with Women’s March Inc. over concerns about anti-Semitism, according to the Jewish News Syndicate.

“Moms Demand Action isn’t an official sponsor of the Women’s March, but plenty of chapters have chosen to participate in the locally organized events,” Taylor Maxwell, a spokesperson for Moms Demand Action, told Vox. The SPLC has not responded to Vox’s request for comment.

The DNC, once listed as a march sponsor on the Women’s March Inc. website, no longer appears there, according to CNN.

“The DNC stands in solidarity with all those fighting for women’s rights and holding the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers across the country accountable,” said DNC deputy communications director Sabrina Singh in a statement to Vox. “Women are on the front lines of fighting back against this administration and are the core of our Democratic Party.”

Asked if the relationship between the DNC and the Women’s March had changed from last year to this year, a DNC official declined to comment further.

Women’s activism today is about more than marches

Women’s March Inc. has been working to repair relationships with the Jewish community. According to the Washington Post, since anti-Semitism charges were first leveled at the organization, it has added three Jewish women to its steering committee and updated its platform to include a message of support for Jewish women.

It remains to be seen whether this will be enough to convince those concerned about the anti-Semitism allegations to turn out to march on Saturday. Sociology professor Dana R. Fisher, who studies protest movements, told the Post that turnout in Washington, DC, will probably number in the tens of thousands, far fewer than the estimated 470,000 people who attended the first Women’s March following the inauguration of President Trump in 2017.

But those who marched in 2017 may also be engaging in other forms of activism. Instead of a march on Saturday, Women’s March Chicago has organized Operation Activation, which encourages women and their allies to participate in community actions like neighborhood cleanups and postcard-writing campaigns advocating for progressive legislation. The decision to hold a day of action instead of a march wasn’t inspired by controversy around Women’s March Inc., according to a Women’s March Chicago fact sheet provided to Vox. Rather, the Chicago group chose to hold a march in October 2018 to mobilize voters for the midterm elections, and decided not to host two marches back to back. The group plans to march again in 2020.

And in addition to the march on Saturday, Women’s March Inc. is releasing a federal policy platform called the Women’s Agenda and organizing a day of lobbying on Capitol Hill on Friday in support of Medicare-for-all.

Through their platform, their marches, and their Women’s Convention in October 2017 in Detroit, the Women’s March organizers changed the mainstream conversation around feminism and left-wing politics in America, prompting a wider swath of women than ever before to think about women’s rights as part of a larger set of civil rights, including racial and economic justice.

That conversation will no doubt continue at marches on Saturday. But it will also continue at community actions and other events throughout the year — and in the halls of Congress, where more women than ever before now have the opportunity to craft legislation that affects all Americans.

Whatever happens in the streets on Saturday, the legacy of the women who marched all over the world in 2017 will persist for a long time to come.",www.vox.com,left,iHrLN3myGXipKjEZ

Thunberg was far from the first to sound the alarm on climate change and environmental degradation ; indigenous activists of all ages , like those who protested the building of the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock reservation in 2016 , have been doing so for generations .

As much as Thunberg has won adulation from liberals , she ’ s also been attacked by Trump and other Republicans .

The treatment — high praise combined with intense vitriol — was likely familiar to many women who came to prominence in America in their teens or 20s . Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , who became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress in 2018 at the age of 29 , certainly experienced it .

About those protests

CNN's Jeff Zeleny is the rare person who has traveled lately. Here's what he had to say about the protest:

What set this rally apart

ZW: First and most important, the thing that struck me most in your story was this apparent backlash to social distance in the form of a protest that could literally be heard from the governor's office. Did that feel different to you than a normal partisan disagreement? Was it more grassroots or groundswell?

JZ: The protest was large, but the thing that struck me the most is that it went on and on, with honking horns, blaring music and raucous jeers for more than five hours. It was protest-by-parade — definitely not organic, considering it was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition, but the anger was absolutely real. It had the feel of a Trump rally from 2016 and a Tea Party rally from 2010 — back at a time when rallies were the norm.

What was striking was dozens upon dozens of people who stood on steps of the Capitol and the surrounding sidewalk, defying not only the strict stay-at-home orders, but also blatantly ignoring basic medical common sense.

There's no question the economic pain is real in Michigan, with about one-quarter of the state's eligible workforce seeking some type of unemployment help. But the Village People's ""YMCA,"" which blasted from a Trump trailer that's often seen at the President's campaign rallies, seemed oddly discordant on a day that the state's death toll hovered around 2,000 people.

Traveling during Covid-19

ZW: Second, you're the first person I've talked to recently that has been away from their house. What was it like in an airport? In a hotel? Or did you avoid both?

JZ: I flew from Reagan National in Washington to the Detroit Metro Airport, both of which were virtually empty. The biggest inconvenience: No coffee for my 6 a.m. flight on Wednesday, since all restaurants were closed. And only bottled water, with a side of Biscotti and Purell wipes served in a plastic bag, on the plane. But I'm certainly not complaining, given the janitorial staff and airline workers still on duty as before.

I travel often — or I did before the pandemic — but I don't believe I've ever stayed in an entirely empty hotel. The front desk manager told me only one other room was occupied, which was for my colleague Jake Carpenter, a CNN photojournalist. I limited my trip to one night and ordered pizza and salad from a nearby restaurant in East Lansing.

Hertz rental? Open and easy.

Coronavirus journalism

ZW: Third, how do you interview people in person and social distance?

JZ: I mainly just observed people at the rally, having conversations with only a couple people from a respectable distance. Their hand-made signs made their opinions easily known.

The Detroit airport on April 16.

I traveled to Lansing to interview the governor, which we did from six feet away in two chairs, with two cameras. I spent time in her office, where I also stayed at a safe distance.

And this is what the Detroit airport looks like as I fly back to Washington. The only person you can see in this picture is President Trump on the television.

Heading toward a new normal, or dystopia?

It sounds like science fiction. But this is real. CNN's Ray Sanchez tried to envision what life will be like in the near term. What was most striking was his description of how contact tracing -- tracking whether you've come into contact with the disease -- could work in practice.

Forget about privacy. The tracing of people with regard to coronavirus is underway in China and some other places. In China, the use of a color-coded badge on your phone dictates where you can go. So the question for the US and other countries is whether people will have to prove their health to return to normal ways of life.

Don't trust. Verify. Want to eat in a restaurant? You'll essentially have to prove that you're clean. Want to get on a plane? You might have to take a test.

This is Orwell come to life. It's a Philip K. Dick-level societal shift. Is that person walking next to you infected? Do you have a right to know? I'd take an online philosophy course on the future of privacy.

It's like the movie "" Gattaca ,"" where Ethan Hawke's character buys blood from Jude Law so that he can deceive authorities about his genetic deficiency and take part in society.

Low-tech alternatives -- Sanchez, borrowing from some reports and suggestions, includes these ideas for the near term:

Staggered school days and smaller class sizes

Disposable menus and masked servers

Empty stadiums and concert halls

Tracking of location and other personal information

Who got it right?

Every country has experienced coronavirus somewhat differently, but some have escaped much of the death, as well as the social and economic upheaval, that has characterized the US experience. CNN looked at what Taiwan, Germany, Iceland and South Korea did differently. This is a long story and worth reading . But the 12 key lessons appear to be:

What are the relevant motives?

Children want to see their parents. Parents want to see their children. Grandparents want to see their grandchildren. People who haven't yet started families want to go on in-person dates.

Business owners want to make money. They've invested labor, capital, and reputation in stores, restaurants, factories, and offices that are now empty or idle. The profit motive is a strong motive.

Texas is full of charming small towns with colorful names on the banks of the state ’ s picturesque rivers . Those towns also are home to some of the best people and food you will find anywhere .
So out I drove , into the hills and away from the city that brags about how weird it is . Day tripping wasn ’ t really meant to be cathartic , but given how awful this year has been , nearly anything that isn ’ t terrible now feels great . Taking small things for granted feels very 2019 now .
Along the way I couldn ’ t help noticing something . The farther I got from the city , the more American and Texas flags I saw . They were everywhere along the country highway , in full bloom , with the odd Trump sign here and there too ( and zero Biden ) .
I passed through several little towns and finally stopped in one to sit down for some lunch . Everyone was observing social distance and wearing masks just like they do in the city , but other than that the vibe was entirely different . All signs of hostility remained back in Austin . Texans of several races — I noted white , Hispanic and black in this joint — sat at picnic tables smiling and laughing and enjoying barbecue so good it ’ s life-changing . Brisket that melts in your mouth . Ribs so big they look like the butchers cut them from a dinosaur .
No one here seemed to have any issue with anyone else . A couple of local cops came in and everyone just went about their business , other than to smile or say howdy if they happened to interact with the officers . It was all just so normal , so much the America we seem to have lost these past few months . So yes , cathartic is a good word for it .

Texas is full of charming small towns with colorful names on the banks of the state’s picturesque rivers. Those towns also are home to some of the best people and food you will find anywhere.

So out I drove, into the hills and away from the city that brags about how weird it is. Day tripping wasn’t really meant to be cathartic, but given how awful this year has been, nearly anything that isn’t terrible now feels great. Taking small things for granted feels very 2019 now.

Along the way I couldn’t help noticing something. The farther I got from the city, the more American and Texas flags I saw. They were everywhere along the country highway, in full bloom, with the odd Trump sign here and there too (and zero Biden).

I passed through several little towns and finally stopped in one to sit down for some lunch. Everyone was observing social distance and wearing masks just like they do in the city, but other than that the vibe was entirely different. All signs of hostility remained back in Austin. Texans of several races — I noted white, Hispanic and black in this joint — sat at picnic tables smiling and laughing and enjoying barbecue so good it’s life-changing. Brisket that melts in your mouth. Ribs so big they look like the butchers cut them from a dinosaur.

No one here seemed to have any issue with anyone else. A couple of local cops came in and everyone just went about their business, other than to smile or say howdy if they happened to interact with the officers. It was all just so normal, so much the America we seem to have lost these past few months. So yes, cathartic is a good word for it. The sun didn’t actually shine any brighter out in the country but it felt like it did. I came back home happy both for the spirit of the town and the unbelievable food.

That America is still there. Even amid the temporary violent Maoist takeover of part of Seattle, the ongoing violent uprising in Portland, and infantile city councils from Austin to Minneapolis slicing and gutting their police department budgets, which will lead inevitably to more violence on their streets, normal lives on. People put signs in their yards saying “Support the Police” or some variation and no one defaces or steals them.

Helena, MT has a similar campaign going.

My colleague Tyler O’Neil wrote about a black Georgia Democrat who is standing with police, and incidentally with President Trump, and firmly against the forces of chaos and mayhem.

Are you hearing from liberals whispering about being “red-pilled” because their party is unleashing destructive anarchy? I am.

Even in the cities, which day after day feel more like they’ve been captured by some hostile foreign power, Americans of all backgrounds are recognizing that we need normal back. We need the police to bring it back. We need public safety and sanity restored.

There have been pro-police rallies in Brooklyn and Queens.

In Minneapolis, the misruled city where the latest unrest started an eternity ago, black residents are calling on the city to bring the police back. As they are witnessing, it takes years to get crime under control, but civilization can break down in minutes. It has there and New York and so many of our cities now. Decades of hard work, undone by fools, and endangering millions. Residents want the blue to return and bring order back with them. And that’s not too much to ask. Black people are overwhelmingly the victims of lawless cities, yet city councils signal time and time again that they do not care one whit.

There’s not even a tingle in the toes.

President Obama’s media supporters are abandoning him. Even the liberal culture seems to be abandoning him. And as he slips into the low 40s in two recent polls, it’s hard to see how he recasts his once-glittering image.

This is the kind of sea change that goes beyond polling numbers. The very mass culture that celebrated Barack Obama, that turned him into an international icon, is now migrating toward the darker side of his legacy, perhaps fueled by a sense of frustration and disappointment.

On the pundit front, the president’s self-description on his Asia trip as a man trying to hit singles and doubles, along with the occasional homer, drew a stinging rebuke from Maureen Dowd. The New York Times columnist’s message: Stop whining.

“You are the American president. And the American president should not perpetually use the word ‘eventually.’ And he should not set a tone of resignation with references to this being a relay race and say he’s willing to take ‘a quarter of a loaf or half a loaf,’ and muse that things may not come ‘to full fruition on your timetable.’

“An American president should never say, as you did to the New Yorker editor, David Remnick, about presidents through history: ‘We’re part of a long-running story. We just try to get our paragraph right.’

“Mr. President, I am just trying to get my paragraph right. You need to think bigger…

“Especially now that we have this scary World War III vibe with the Russians, we expect the president, especially one who ran as Babe Ruth, to hit home runs.”

This comes after her Times colleague David Brooks questioned Obama’s manhood in the Middle East, and Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank called the president’s Asia trip aimless and said he didn’t project much of anything.

But it’s not just the Beltway types who have soured on the president.

Now Obama also has Captain America against him. A New York Times piece says the new movie is set against the backdrop of an infiltrated U.S. government with evil assassins and killer drones--inspired, the director says, by ""the same sort of questions Barack Obama has to address.""

""What many screenwriters, novelists and visual artists have seized on is not an inspirational story of the first black president. Instead they have found more compelling story lines in the bleaker, morally fraught parts of Mr. Obama’s legacy.""

The piece adds that ""the public relations machinery of the White House assiduously tries to control Mr. Obama’s image and legacy, but there is nothing it can do to stop artistic interpretation of his policies.""

Many artists are independent, and these portrayals change over time. But there's no doubt that the Hollywood and Broadway cultures portrayed Obama as an inspiring figure in the wake of his groundbreaking 2008 election and early Nobel Peace Prize. That he is now also seen as the man behind massive NSA surveillance and lethal drone attacks is a measure of how governing is far more difficult than campaigning.

And in the second term, Obama has had no major victories--no killing of Usama bin Laden--to balance the setbacks and morally ambiguous policies.

The president is, at best, hitting singles--the kind of small ball that drew such disdain from Dowd.

Sure will!

Has this happened before?

Yup.

Hell, just four years ago, before the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, Zika virus fears were strong enough that some athletes didn’t attend the games. But still, in the end, the games went on and it was relatively normal. Igel told VICE that to find something in recent memory that maps similarly to this—with events being cancelled or postponed with no idea of what is going to happen—you would have to go back to the 9/11 attacks.

Joe Hall, a Hall of Fame defenseman for the Canadians, would die of complications from the flu four days after the last game was played.

Could my favorite player get it?

Oh yeah, they’re only human after all.

As mentioned earlier, salvia is one of the key ways this virus spreads. So, if you think of what playing sports typically entails you know how easily your spit could inadvertently end up on another player. Furthermore, once a player gets it and decides to fight through the sniffles to play, it could easily rip through a team and potentially, a league.

“It's hard to imagine that you could play something like good defense in basketball, or something like that, and not have some exposure in practices and games,” said Dr. Harrison. “Once it gets on a team, it will probably spread quickly.”

Is this the end of sports this year?

Probably not. There’s too much money at stake for leagues not to figure this out.

But if that’s the case, then we have larger problems than the Edmonton Oilers wasting their relatively strong year in a weak NHL Pacific Division.

During a recorded conversation about race in America on Sunday , Passion City Church Pastor Louie Giglio said that the phrase `` white privilege '' sometimes ignited backlash and suggested that the words be altered to `` white blessing .

He also noted that white people understand that slavery was a curse, but added that ""we miss the blessing of slavery, that it actually built up the framework for the world that white people live in.”

In the days and weeks that follow, people will share their stories about Notre Dame. Here’s mine. On March 9, 1996, I walked into the great cathedral on the morning of my wedding day. The gravity of the moment was starting to sink in, and I wanted a place to pray. We Protestants are accustomed to thinking of the great cathedrals of Europe mainly as tourist attractions — as beautiful historical buildings and not as actual, living churches. That morning changed my heart.

It was too early for most tourists to arrive, so I walked past other worshipers, men and women on their knees before the Lord. I knelt also. I asked God’s blessing on my wedding, on my marriage, and on the children we hoped to have. In that moment, I felt the presence of God, but I also felt something else — for a moment I was staggered at the thought of the sheer number of people who’d knelt in this same spot and asked God for these same good things. I felt more connected to the larger body of Christ than I’d ever felt before.

The Notre Dame I visited wasn’t just a beautiful building. It wasn’t just a marvel of medieval architecture. And it wasn’t just the center of the French nation — the place where kings and emperors were crowned. It was a symbol of an enduring church and God’s enduring presence. France will feel its loss more than it now understands. We all will.

The lucrative room-letting business has inspired a new way of housing ex-inmates as the United States tests a raft of innovations to ease prisoner release , when a place to call home is a top priority yet often the hardest thing to find .
Ex-prisoners say the freedom and security they get from a room of their own is a huge turnaround after a decade-plus of bunking up in crowded jails , and an opportunity to start afresh .
“ I had my own room , for the first time in over 10 years , ” said KC Matthews , among the first to benefit from the Airbnb-style , post-prison program .
“ It provided me a safe space , my own space , and provided me stability … to do the other things I needed to do , ” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone .
Since August 2018 , the Homecoming Project has been matching people due to leave prison with local hosts with spare space in Alameda County , outside San Francisco .
Researchers , advocates and policymakers increasingly say that safe and stable housing is critical to helping prisoners adapt to life in the outside world – and to staying there .
Traditionally , prisoners fended for themselves on release – a challenge that pushes many back into jail – or enrolled in transitional housing programs with heavy restrictions .
Now different cities are trying new ways to help inmates slot back into life , and housing is one of their key tools .
For Mr. Matthews , a transgender man who had lived on the streets and in foster care for much of his life , his anxiety grew ever more acute as his release date neared .
“ Is there a place that will accept me and where I will be comfortable ? ” said Mr. Matthews , 51 . `` This was weighing me down at a time I should have been happy – I was getting out of prison ! ”
It paired Mr. Matthews with a potential host , then gave them opportunities to talk by phone before his release .
When he got out , Mr. Matthews said he was able to apply immediately for a driving license , Social Security card and other necessities – critical errands that he said would have taken him a month under traditional transitional housing rules .
He was also able to ease back into the rhythms of life out of prison – re-learning how to shop for food and more – while his temporary home offered a safe haven as he adjusted .
“ That was one less thing on my plate – housing and safety , ” he said .
The Homecoming Project works only with people jailed for at least a decade , said Terah Lawyer , project coordinator at Impact Justice , a nonprofit that runs the initiative .
`` If you ’ re gone for 10 years , you come back completely a ghost , ” she said , referring to inmates whose driving license , credit history , and identity papers get erased .
“ It was inspired by the Airbnb model and realizing that … anyone who has the money can stay at an Airbnb without anyone checking their record , but getting their own housing is complicated , ” she said .
By placing ex-prisoners with community hosts and mentors for six months , the pilot project bypasses the tight restrictions of state transitional housing and helps inmates re-integrate .
“ The community hosts are going to be role-modeling what life is like in the community for participants , ” Ms. Lawyer said .

Money aside , she said , inmates need new ID , as well as find a landlord who will accept tenants with a criminal record , and a place that meets their own often onerous parole requirements .
Those who have spent a single stint in prison are seven times more likely to experience homelessness than the rest of the U.S. population , and those who have been jailed multiple times are 13 times more likely to be homeless , according to a first-ever national estimate that PPI put out last year .
There is no national data , Ms. Bertram said , but recognition of the issue has broken into the 2020 presidential campaign .
Former vice president Joe Biden , now a top-polling candidate for president , has said that if elected he will “ set a national goal of ensuring 100 % of formerly incarcerated individuals have housing upon re-entry ” from prison .
There is also a fledgling legal push underway to scrap rule-bound screening processes that can deny would-be tenants any shot at renting a home if they carry a criminal record , even prohibiting stays with family members .
Since the federal government highlighted the issue in 2016 , 10 municipalities have enacted what are known as “ Fair Chance ” policies , said Deborah Thrope , supervising attorney with the National Housing Law Project , a legal advocacy group .
“ This is the first time people are really taking a hard look at screening policies , especially around affordable housing , ” said Ms. Thrope .
Another 2020 presidential candidate , Sen. Kamala Harris of California , has floated a proposal that would make local Fair Chance strategies apply to federal housing policies .
It would mark a major change from the old ways , experts say .
“ What generally happened when we released in Georgia historically is you ’ d get $ 25 and a bus ticket to wherever you came from , ” said Tom McElhenney , director of transitional services for the Georgia Department of Corrections .
Those released in such a way “ go into survival mode and go back to what they can do to survive , which is usually dealing drugs and other illegal ” activity , Mr. McElhenney told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone . “ We want to break that cycle . ”
Last year , the state prison system started a project in Atlanta to do just that – the Metro Reentry Facility .

Home Sweet Home

“Is there a place that will accept me and where I will be comfortable?” said Mr. Matthews, 51. ""This was weighing me down at a time I should have been happy – I was getting out of prison!”

Which is where Homecoming came in.

It paired Mr. Matthews with a potential host, then gave them opportunities to talk by phone before his release.

It worked.

When he got out, Mr. Matthews said he was able to apply immediately for a driving license, Social Security card and other necessities – critical errands that he said would have taken him a month under traditional transitional housing rules.

Our culture’s default mode of ‘All Politics, All The Time’ is tedious. We can do better.

These days, when people ask me what I do, I tend to brace myself a bit, battening down the proverbial mental hatches. “Oh, I’m a writer,” I’ll say cheerily, warily scanning my new friend’s eyes, especially if that person is my doctor or an Uber driver or a hairdresser or someone else who happens to temporarily hold my life in their hands. “What’s that? What do I write about? Oh . . . ” — here’s the part where I scan the room for an escape hatch, and inevitably fail — “I write about politics.”

SJW anti-free-speech scolds . We know the drill now -- we ’ ve heard it from comedians like Seinfeld and Patton Oswalt and , to a lesser degree , Louis C.K . and Chris Rock . We ’ ve heard it packaged in a different format from Very Serious media commentators like Jonathan Chait , Laura Kipnis and , most recently , an anonymous white male adjunct professor whose left-wing students “ terrify ” him .
It ’ s a familiar , tired drill . Point to instances of creeping overreaction by angry left-wing young people in the classroom , at protests and especially on Tumblr or Twitter . Portray these forces as a terrifying , swelling horde of enforcers with the power to totally destroy the lives of good old hardworking members of the chattering class like yourself . Talk about how this army of Social Justice Stormtroopers has successfully create a stifling Orwellian monoculture , especially on the Internet , where all of us live in constant fear of saying anything the least bit “ offensive ” lest our lives be ruined and as a result all online discourse has been stripped down to the level of catchphrase-spewing party apparatchiks seeking to avoid Stalinist purges .
This is clearly an extremely compelling narrative when it comes to a lot of people ’ s personal fears , because it ’ s a narrative they spin out of comparatively little evidence . It ’ s not that there ’ s no such thing as a left-wing witch hunt or that people haven ’ t been harmed by them -- it ’ s that , for something that ’ s so scary that it warrants trend piece after trend piece on a biweekly basis , it seems pretty hard for these pundits to come up with actual examples of harm to themselves .
Daniel Tosh , whose nasty rape joke at an audience member spurred the comedy world to rally around him waving flags with apocryphal Voltaire quotes -- yeah , he got a lot of mean tweets , and got analyzed in a bunch of think pieces , and got a really unkind ( but hilarious ) Onion article written about him .
And … that was it . His stand-up career is still going fine . He ’ s still on Twitter . He still has a damn top-rated show on Comedy Central , which makes him better off than 99.9 percent of all stand-up comedians in the country . ( A show , by the way , which derives a lot of its humor from mocking people who are already being mercilessly made fun of or criticized on the Internet , which adds a little bit of irony to this whole “ lynch mob ” thing . )
Jonathan Chait combs through years of outraged viral right-wing posts on Facebook about left-wing atrocities but only comes up with one story of significant material harm , a kid being fired from a college newspaper , after Chait himself has gotten embroiled in controversy for trying to get journalists fired from newspapers for doing their job wrong . ( As always , it ’ s actually about ethics in journalism . )
Laura Kipnis has a stronger argument for having been mistreated , even though the Title IX system she criticizes did , in fact , end up letting her completely off the hook -- and even though the actual reason for the complaint against her wasn ’ t her “ wrong opinion ” but her spreading untruths about a student embroiled in a sexual harassment claim against a professor , which pretty much every “ political correctness gone mad ” pundit talking about the Kipnis case has ignored .
The professor who hides behind the pseudonym “ Edward Schlosser ” has , by his own account , never actually been targeted by left-wing students at all . He has only ever received one formal complaint against his teaching , from a right-wing student who accused him of being a communist -- but his whole thesis is his left-wing students are scarier because his personal intuition is that they might come after him worse than that right-wing student did and it might be worse for him if and when they do .
He claims the troubling “ The customer is always right ” attitude universities increasingly adopt toward their students unilaterally empowers the angry p.c . left-wing radicals , and gets gently schooled by a black female professor who points out how she gets challenged by students for being too radical all the time , how progressive academics like Steven Salaita get silenced by institutions regularly .
And , with the most staggering lack of self-awareness I ’ ve yet seen in a hand-wringing think piece , “ Edward Schlosser , ” who has taken as many steps as possible to shield himself from any possible negative social consequences for an unpopular opinion , takes time out of his article to name-and-shame an online activist for having an unpopular opinion . As a result , conservative media made her the Hippie-Punching Target of the Week , she got the usual tidal wave of harassment and death threats women online get for unpopular opinions , and Vox was forced to edit Schlosser ’ s piece and put in an apology . Whether Schlosser ’ s take on who the real victims of “ outrage culture ” are was affected at all by this remains unknown .
And then there ’ s this most recent Seinfeld thing . What ’ s Jerry Seinfeld ’ s clincher for how political correctness is ruining comedy ? What ’ s his vivid example to let us visualize how the New Left McCarthyism is destroying art ?
The fact that he did a really dumb , obnoxious , middle-school-level joke about how the scrolling gesture built into the touchscreen user interface of smartphones makes you look kinda gay , and people didn ’ t laugh .
That ’ s it . Not that there was a vitriolic # CancelSeinfeld campaign on Twitter because of that joke , not that anyone actually confronted Seinfeld after his set expressing their displeasure ( something he speculated might happen , but in fact did not ) . Hell , it doesn ’ t seem like anyone from that night even remembered that joke or publicly talked about it until Seinfeld brought it up with Seth Meyers , but the fact that he could “ feel ” the opinion in the room shift against him because of it is what he calls “ chilling . ”
Yes , a stand-up comedian is crying political oppression because people didn ’ t laugh at his joke , and because his infallible comic intuition tells him the joke , in a world undistorted by politically correct brainwashing , would be objectively hilarious .
The best part is this is exactly the kind of navel-gazing self-generated persecution complex that the fictionalized Jerry Seinfeld was always spiraling into on Seinfeld . It makes me once again wonder what Larry David thinks about all this , and if the whole concept behind Seinfeld wasn ’ t one big joke at the real Jerry Seinfeld ’ s expense that he apparently missed .
Maybe the reason I have a hard time taking any of this seriously is that I ’ m , as I ’ ve said before , from the Internet , and people who really think the Internet is one perpetual , ever-vigilant left-wing outrage machine that clamps down hard on the faintest sign of offensiveness are talking completely out of their ass .
Jon Ronson of `` So You ’ ve Been Publicly Shamed '' fame has argued that it ’ s the social justice left who are the “ merciless ” ones in the world of public shaming , perhaps because he ’ s not into video games and didn ’ t see the hundreds of thousands of personal attacks Anita Sarkeesian got just for launching a Kickstarter to look at sexism in gaming in 2012 and that has only intensified in the years since then . Ronson ’ s book went to press before August 2014 , so he couldn ’ t include a section about the permanent hate mob camped out on Twitter that will do their best to drive you out of the public sphere with sustained harassment for criticizing a game they like or just for mentioning their name in a negative context .
Yes , what happened to Justine Sacco was horrible , a perfect storm of factors that made opportunistically piling onto the world ’ s biggest pile-on nearly irresistible . But part of why it was horrible is that it was so arbitrary - -that because Sacco was a P.R . executive for a major Internet brand who made her bad tweet just before getting on an international flight , she became a lightning rod for anti-racist anger -- when there are thousands of people saying way more racist things every single day on Twitter with no reaction . ( You can see for yourself just by typing an actual racist slur into Twitter ’ s search box . ) The whole reason Ronson sees “ outrage events ” like Sacco ’ s experience as a newsworthy topic is that when something like this happens it ’ s headline news .
Meanwhile , women like Lindy West get a low-level version of this kind of abuse ( by “ low-level ” I mean hundreds of nasty messages per day rather than tens of thousands ) on a continuous basis , and it only makes the news when one of the trolls actually publicly apologizes and stops .
I can ’ t help feeling it ’ s like white male academics complaining about social forces that make them far more likely than black female academics to be publicly shamed for racism while ignoring the social forces that make them far more likely than black female academics to be hired in the first place . Or how a cop being shot by a black suspect was always a headline story in the local paper but , until recently , black suspects being shot by cops was generally not news at all .
To paraphrase an Internet meme that paraphrases an evil clown , social exclusion , toxicity and shaming are fine as long as they ’ re business as usual , “ part of the plan ” -- but flip the script and have people who aren ’ t used to experiencing social consequences suddenly face them and “ Everyone loses their minds . ”
As I said in my original response to Chait ’ s piece , sure , blame the Internet for making things worse , but what the Internet is really doing is amplifying everyone ’ s voice , removing the filters that keep the worst people in every political or social faction ( of which there are dozens ) from being heard . Yes , that means there are feminists or anti-racists or queer activists who go too far and upset people like Jonathan Chait because in his mind that discredits the entire Respectable Left .
But it also means that those supposedly harmless little gay jokes or fat jokes or racial stereotype jokes that people like Seinfeld trade in also , nowadays , “ go too far ” ; in fact they reach an indisputable “ too far ” point almost instantly nowadays .
Seinfeld got a lot of cred back in the day for “ going there ” by popularizing using the term “ Nazi ” for someone he didn ’ t like enforcing supposedly unfair rules in his own private business , which back in 1995 was “ edgy ” and therefore hilarious . Nowadays it happens at the drop of a hat , en masse , through hundreds of spammed memes Photoshopping people ’ s faces into images of actual historical atrocities , and if only by sheer repetition it ’ s not funny at all anymore .
Take a look at the most recent person to get called a “ Nazi. ” Would Seinfeld consider it “ creepy ” and overly “ p.c. ” if a stand-up comic whose act revolved around holding up photos of fat people and straight-up calling them disgusting and hideous and encouraging people to leave them mean notes on Facebook got banned from a club ? Is that the absolute kind of “ free speech ” he defends in the comedy world ? Would Seinfeld stand by his friend Michael Richards if Richards hadn ’ t just used a racial slur against a heckler but then started a comedy routine based on quoting black people in a stereotypical , insulting accent and then calling them racial slurs repeatedly ?
Because that ’ s the premise of two of the subreddits ( r/fatpeoplehate and r/shitn * * * * * ssay ) that just got banned on Reddit -- after years of these subreddits being active , and weeks of r/fatpeoplehate repeatedly getting voted onto Reddit ’ s front page . This is what business as usual on the Internet has been like . When I first went viral I hadn ’ t heard a certain anti-Asian slur in person in years , only to see it a dozen times within the first few hours of becoming “ Twitter famous . ”
If people seem more thin-skinned than before , maybe it ’ s because they ’ ve been getting jabbed with ever-increasing ferocity and viciousness by a record number of pricks . If there seems to be a constant escalation of offendedness by activists on Twitter , maybe it ’ s in response to a constant escalation of offensiveness by trolls .
The massive shitstorm on Reddit calling for CEO Ellen Pao ’ s ouster and creating hundreds of clones of r/fatpeoplehate daring Reddit to delete them and generally claiming that anti-harassment policies somehow violate the First Amendment ? They ’ re approvingly linking to Jerry Seinfeld ’ s Seth Meyers interview right now , claiming that Seinfeld ’ s flubbed “ gay French king ” joke is equivalent to their daily hobby of telling fat people on Facebook they deserve to die , claiming that Seinfeld ’ s discomfort with “ creepy ” p.c . culture means their twisted sociopathic subculture Seinfeld has probably never heard of has mainstream support .
And earnest , liberal white guys like Seinfeld and Jonathan Chait keep feeding this narrative . Because it hurts when you work really hard on a joke about how smartphones make you look prissy and the crowd doesn ’ t laugh when you know they should . All the bullying of fat teenagers to suicide and all the broad-spectrum blasting of racial slurs in the world is worth it , to keep that from happening again .
There was a Seinfeld episode I liked about Jerry getting increasingly upset that people don ’ t find his random jokes making fun of dentists particularly funny , only for him to double down on his right to make such jokes no matter what dentists think of them , and to find out that as a result he ’ s been socially ostracized as an “ anti-dentite . ”
Jerry finds solace with a girl on the rebound from a recent breakup who laughs at his dentist jokes , shares some of her own , and then , just when they start to develop a rapport , moves on to jokes about “ Jews and blacks ” and excuses herself to “ go get her head shaved. ” Jerry reacts with his signature awkward exit .
The moral of that episode was pretty clear to me -- stand up for your free speech because you think your offensive jokes and comments are no big deal , fine , but don ’ t complain when you end up disgusted by who you find yourself standing next to .
Maybe the real Jerry Seinfeld could look around him right now and take that to heart .","Jerry Seinfeld is the latest brave middle-aged white man to weigh in on the “creepy” ascendance of humorless p.c.

Because that’s the premise of two of the subreddits (r/fatpeoplehate and r/shitn*****ssay) that just got banned on Reddit -- after years of these subreddits being active, and weeks of r/fatpeoplehate repeatedly getting voted onto Reddit’s front page. This is what business as usual on the Internet has been like. When I first went viral I hadn’t heard a certain anti-Asian slur in person in years, only to see it a dozen times within the first few hours of becoming “Twitter famous.”

If people seem more thin-skinned than before, maybe it’s because they’ve been getting jabbed with ever-increasing ferocity and viciousness by a record number of pricks. If there seems to be a constant escalation of offendedness by activists on Twitter, maybe it’s in response to a constant escalation of offensiveness by trolls.

The massive shitstorm on Reddit calling for CEO Ellen Pao’s ouster and creating hundreds of clones of r/fatpeoplehate daring Reddit to delete them and generally claiming that anti-harassment policies somehow violate the First Amendment? They’re approvingly linking to Jerry Seinfeld’s Seth Meyers interview right now, claiming that Seinfeld’s flubbed “gay French king” joke is equivalent to their daily hobby of telling fat people on Facebook they deserve to die, claiming that Seinfeld’s discomfort with “creepy” p.c. culture means their twisted sociopathic subculture Seinfeld has probably never heard of has mainstream support.

And earnest, liberal white guys like Seinfeld and Jonathan Chait keep feeding this narrative. Because it hurts when you work really hard on a joke about how smartphones make you look prissy and the crowd doesn’t laugh when you know they should. All the bullying of fat teenagers to suicide and all the broad-spectrum blasting of racial slurs in the world is worth it, to keep that from happening again.

There was a Seinfeld episode I liked about Jerry getting increasingly upset that people don’t find his random jokes making fun of dentists particularly funny, only for him to double down on his right to make such jokes no matter what dentists think of them, and to find out that as a result he’s been socially ostracized as an “anti-dentite.”

Jerry finds solace with a girl on the rebound from a recent breakup who laughs at his dentist jokes, shares some of her own, and then, just when they start to develop a rapport, moves on to jokes about “Jews and blacks” and excuses herself to “go get her head shaved.” Jerry reacts with his signature awkward exit.

The moral of that episode was pretty clear to me -- stand up for your free speech because you think your offensive jokes and comments are no big deal, fine, but don’t complain when you end up disgusted by who you find yourself standing next to.

Maybe the real Jerry Seinfeld could look around him right now and take that to heart.",www.salon.com,left,knYEwtSsp5PMn4zi

What’s happening

The ritual of playing the national anthem at American sporting events has been a source of intense controversy ever since then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began kneeling to protest against police violence in 2016.

As major sports leagues look to return from a months-long hiatus caused by the coronavirus pandemic, a new debate around the anthem is emerging: Should it be performed before games at all?

Major League Soccer announced it will not be playing the anthem before games when it returns next week because fans won't be in the stands. One of the league’s most prominent coaches argued for permanently eliminating the pregame ritual, which he called “inappropriate.” A semipro soccer team in Tulsa, Okla., recently announced it will instead play Woody Guthrie’s “This Land Is Your Land” before its home matches.

The tradition of playing “The Star-Spangled Banner” at sporting events dates back to the 1918 World Series, when it was used to enliven a somber crowd in Chicago during World War I. It was played at other ballparks on special occasions for the next few decades. The NFL became the first league to require it be performed before every game around the end of World War II. The other leagues soon followed, cementing a tradition that endures today.

Why there’s debate

Many of the arguments for ending the ritual of playing the anthem before games echo Kaepernick’s rationale for kneeling. While the song may be a source of pride for many, others see it a symbol of an unbalanced system that harms people of color. “The Star-Spangled Banner” was written by Francis Scott Key in 1814. Key was a slave owner, and the song’s complete lyrics include a verse that refers to the deaths of slaves during the War of 1812. To critics of the anthem, these racist roots exemplify the false promise of equality that the American system was founded upon.

Others argue that the anthem puts athletes in an unfair position, in which any action they take — standing, kneeling or something else — will be scrutinized as a political statement when that may not be their intention. Overusing the song can also dilute its meaning, some say.

Advocates for keeping the anthem at sporting events say it creates an opportunity for unity among divided groups of people. The country may not have achieved true freedom and equality, but the pursuit of those ideals is worth celebrating, they argue. Others say the controversy around anthem protests is the reason why the tradition should continue, since it would be difficult for an athlete to draw the same level of attention to their cause.

What’s next

For now, Major League Soccer is the only North American sports league to announce it won’t be playing the anthem before games. The NFL is reportedly planning add a performance of “Lift Ev'ry Voice And Sing,” a song commonly known as the Black national anthem, to its pregame events during the first week of its season.

Perspectives

For many, the anthem represents a racist system

“The truth some people don’t want to accept is that the flag and the anthem can’t mean the same thing for everyone if America’s institutions don’t protect everyone the same way.” — Caitlin Murray, Yahoo Sports

The anthem is a celebration of America’s accomplishments

“I know what this song stands for. I know it doesn’t discriminate or oppress, in fact, it inspires us to fight against those things. The feeling I get in my heart, the chill on my neck, that brief moment acknowledging generationally shared sacrifice at a ball game or any other indulgence of American prosperity matters.” — Johnny Jones, Fox News

Playing the anthem puts players in a tough spot

“For the players, it would also ease the pressure on them coming into this season. They can just be themselves and do what they want without worrying about other people’s reactions.” — Rob Parker, Deadspin

It provides a chance for athletes to make themselves heard

“Unlike many of my media brethren, I support continuing to play our national anthem before sporting events.

Even though it was a sunny afternoon , Father Corey Bassett-Tirrell was shocked to see the line of cars in the parking lot of St. Mary Church in Chelmsford , Massachusetts , waiting to participate in the parish ’ s first ever drive-through confessional .
A week earlier , before the pandemic upended the religious traditions of communities throughout the world , forcing many to forgo physical gatherings for prayer and worship , the newly ordained priest had heard only a single confession in the booth within St. Mary ’ s sanctuary .
As he sat dressed in his white-laced surplice on a chair surrounded by orange traffic cones , Mr. Bassett-Tirrell offered the sacrament of reconciliation to 17 drive-through penitents in just over two hours .
“ Never in all my days did I ever think that I would be unable to celebrate my first Holy Week as a priest , ” says Mr. Bassett-Tirrell , who was ordained last year and is now the parochial vicar at the Chelmsford Catholic Collaborative , which includes the parish of St. John the Evangelist . “ When the Lenten fast came upon us on Ash Wednesday in February , we had no idea that in two or three weeks ’ time , we ’ d be in a Eucharistic fast as well . ”
Like so many places of worship across the U.S. , the two Roman Catholic churches that comprise this pastoral collaborative in the Archdiocese of Boston have suspended all physical gatherings – including the celebration of the Mass , the central act of worship for Catholics culminating with the sacrament of the Eucharist .
And while the collaborative is well-prepared to livestream services and sermons , having had in place robust social media options for those unable to attend in person , Mr. Bassett-Tirrell says these technologies are not substitutes for the essential physical and embodied practices of Catholic worship .
“ But I see this as a great opportunity – though a difficult one , ” he continues . One of the purposes of fasting during Lent is to rediscover life ’ s everyday joys through a period of self-reflection and abstinence .
“ So my hope and my prayer is that people will come back to the altar at a time when it ’ s safe again , and have a deeper understanding of what it is that we are receiving , ” he says .

Two weeks ago , as the scope and seriousness of the coronavirus epidemic was beginning to unfold in the U.S. , Muslim communities throughout New York and New Jersey were “ pulling their hair out , ” Mr. Maksut says , as the community tried to decide on Thursday whether or not to cancel prayer services , the primary day of worship that Muslims call jumu ’ ah . It is a religious requirement for all adult Muslim men .
“ The conversation was , well , how about we just have the sermon on Facebook so everyone can observe from home ? ” continues Mr. Maksut , executive director of the New Jersey chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations . “ But the scholars came to their collective opinion that this wouldn ’ t qualify as jumu ’ ah . Jumu ’ ah is essentially a congregational thing . You can ’ t check the box and say , ‘ OK , today I went to jumu ’ ah because I listened to the sermon online. ’ You might be listening at home , but you ’ re really not participating in the essential physical , collective , and group effort . ”
Friday services are also part of the social rhythms of American Muslim communities , a time and place to gather to discuss politics , business , and other aspects of life .
Still , in Muslim theology , Mr. Maksut and others say , the preservation of human life is paramount and supersedes all other religious obligations .
“ It is our moral duty as Muslims that we take all steps necessary to safeguard ourselves and others around us from this terrible disease , ” said the Fiqh Council of North America in a joint statement with organizations including The Islamic Medical Association of North America and the Islamic Society of North America . “ One ’ s personal desire to do obligatory prayers at the masjid or fulfill other religious duties comes secondary to ensuring the common health of the larger community . ”
Last Friday , the Conservative synagogue Temple Beth O ’ r Beth Torah in Clark , New Jersey , welcomed Shabbat as a congregation using Zoom . Cantor Steven Stern began the service with the traditional song “ Shalom Aleichem , ” or “ Peace Be with You . ”
“ We ’ re a small congregation , and people are just trying to get accustomed to the technology , ” says Mr. Stern , who ’ s also planning group meetings on the platform to discuss texts from the Torah and Talmud . “ But we ’ re hoping to combine elements of the service together with an opportunity where we can actually see each other and hear each other , ask questions and answer questions , and to really , in that way , connect and feel part of the community . ”
COVID-19 has in many ways thrust long-simmering theological questions about religion and the nature of community in the digital age into stark relief , says the Rev . Paul Brandeis Raushenbush , a Baptist minister who has spent a significant part of his nearly 25 years as an ordained minister in online communities .
“ I always start with the question , when two or three are gathered online , is Christ there ? And then , if 10 Jews are on a Zoom call , is that a minyan ? ” says Mr. Raushenbush , now a senior adviser for public affairs and innovation at the Interfaith Youth Core , which fosters interfaith cooperation in U.S. colleges .
“ The truth is , we are in touch with one another much more because of technology than we were before , not less , ” he says . “ My Facebook page feels like a prayer circle , and people are reaching out to one another and people are showing up for one another in new and unprecedented ways that are allowing for a sense of deep community . ”
Last Sunday , Mr. Raushenbush helped lead a spiritual gathering using the virtual reality environment Altspace . Using avatars in a virtual grass field surrounded by hills during a rising full moon , the virtual minister led about two dozen people in a guided 10-minute meditation before asking them to gather with him on a large rock in the middle of the field .
He asked how they were holding up , and as many of those gathered responded , others could virtually express their emotions with VR versions of “ emoticons. ” As avatars were speaking , others were releasing cascades of hearts that bubbled above their heads to express their connection to the speaker ’ s words .
“ We are less inhibited online , which , yes , can be bad , ” says Mr. Raushenbush , who lives in Brooklyn . “ But it can also be good . We can actually say things to one another and show up for one another in ways that can be deeply loving , and show our vulnerability and be present to one another in a way that sometimes face-to-face meetings do not allow . ”
In some ways , something similar happened at the drive-through confessional in St. Mary ’ s parking lot .
“ I had a few of the penitents tell me – and thank us for offering the sacrament this way – because they said they had been away from the church for quite some time , but they thought this might be a less intimidating medium in which to receive the sacrament of reconciliation , ” says Mr. Bassett-Tirrell .
Still , many are longing for the time when they can renew the forms of worship that are central to the faith .
Both St. Mary and St. John the Evangelist remain open for individuals to come to pray , as they follow CDC guidelines for social distancing . And priests still say the Mass and bless the elements of the Eucharist and then partake themselves – which is then livestreamed .
But one of the staff was helping with the altar linens last week , and she asked the priest if he would give her Holy Communion as well .
“ And it just broke my heart , because I couldn ’ t , because we ’ re not allowed to , ” he says . But it ’ s precisely this kind of longing during a time of fasting and absence from physical communion that makes him hope that when the crisis passes , it could usher in a time of renewal – just as the season of Lent culminates in the joy of Easter .

Forget the bizarre and evil concept of national original sin that is the malignant idea that America is built upon “ systemic racism . '' America ’ s true systemic flaw , arising at the time of those miserable progressives of yesteryear and continuing up through the miserable progressives of this rotten year , is what we now call “ liberalism . ”
Oh , it ’ s not classical liberalism , with its concern for expanding economic and personal rights – you know , individual liberty . The current inverted mutation of liberalism is all about constricting economic and personal rights and forcing individuals into collective boxes where their individuality is subsumed into an easily exploited and manipulated conformist whole . Want to test out this hypothesis ? Look through the endless woke tweets of your favorite hack journalist , pinko pol , or Hollywood half-wit , or even go up to some self-described liberal in your own life , and see if you can find one iota of deviation from any of the approved liberal dogma . Good luck . You won ’ t find a smidgeon of nonconformity . You won ’ t detect a molecule of dissent . These people are the Borg , if the Borg worked in a giant space coffee house , had Bernie stickers on their spaceships , and could not do a push-up . You can ’ t reason with them – appealing to reason is futile .
Systemic liberalism is the real poison in America ’ s veins , not the fanciful notion pushed by bigots , charlatans , and demagogues , that the American enterprise is dedicated to invidious discrimination on the basis of race .
Only a country so prosperous , so free , and secure could be so frivolous as to indulge an elite that eager to embrace such a manifestly ridiculous conceit . And only academics are dumb enough to come up with it in the first place . If you needed more incentive , beyond its greed and incompetence , to figuratively burn our college and university system to the ground , look no further than the critical race theory nonsense it spawned .
It ’ s the phrenology of political theories , except dumber and more malicious .
Systemic liberalism infects all aspects of our society , and the society they want will be built upon its leprous foundation . In the government , you have mayors , governors , congressjerks , and senators cheering on political violence . Public property is destroyed and citizens are imperiled and they demand that you disarm and not leave your house without sporting a piehole thong .
Even institutions we thought were solid are wavering . Too many cops kneel or stand back as spectators to the chaos .

Forget the bizarre and evil concept of national original sin that is the malignant idea that America is built upon “systemic racism."" America’s true systemic flaw, arising at the time of those miserable progressives of yesteryear and continuing up through the miserable progressives of this rotten year, is what we now call “liberalism.”

Oh, it’s not classical liberalism, with its concern for expanding economic and personal rights – you know, individual liberty. The current inverted mutation of liberalism is all about constricting economic and personal rights and forcing individuals into collective boxes where their individuality is subsumed into an easily exploited and manipulated conformist whole. Want to test out this hypothesis? Look through the endless woke tweets of your favorite hack journalist, pinko pol, or Hollywood half-wit, or even go up to some self-described liberal in your own life, and see if you can find one iota of deviation from any of the approved liberal dogma. Good luck. You won’t find a smidgeon of nonconformity. You won’t detect a molecule of dissent. These people are the Borg, if the Borg worked in a giant space coffee house, had Bernie stickers on their spaceships, and could not do a push-up. You can’t reason with them – appealing to reason is futile.

Systemic liberalism is the real poison in America’s veins, not the fanciful notion pushed by bigots, charlatans, and demagogues, that the American enterprise is dedicated to invidious discrimination on the basis of race.

It’s all a lie and a scam.

Only a country so prosperous, so free, and secure could be so frivolous as to indulge an elite that eager to embrace such a manifestly ridiculous conceit. And only academics are dumb enough to come up with it in the first place. If you needed more incentive, beyond its greed and incompetence, to figuratively burn our college and university system to the ground, look no further than the critical race theory nonsense it spawned.

It’s the phrenology of political theories, except dumber and more malicious.

Systemic liberalism infects all aspects of our society, and the society they want will be built upon its leprous foundation. In the government, you have mayors, governors, congressjerks, and senators cheering on political violence. Public property is destroyed and citizens are imperiled and they demand that you disarm and not leave your house without sporting a piehole thong.

Even institutions we thought were solid are wavering. Too many cops kneel or stand back as spectators to the chaos. The military is bombarding the troops with memos from generals competing for victory in the Battle of Woke Island. Sadly, the harassed warriors whose combat training is pushed aside for ever more diversity tail-chasing will look back on that bombardment wistfully when the Red Chinese, who have a serious military, bombard them with actual munitions.

In the courts, we see Hawaiian judges and the double standard that entrapped Mike Flynn. Our FBI is corrupt and unable to find its moral footing.

Much more presentable than I am . In a breakout session on relations between Western democracies and China , the participants kept saying that we should emphasize our values .

If someone argues that Trump ’ s speech was fine but in his mouth comes across as blasphemy , I ’ d have trouble arguing with them . But that ’ s not the argument that most people are making .
Some have said that the speech would have passed muster if it weren ’ t for the context of Poland itself . They blame Poland ’ s “ ultra-nationalism ” and “ retreat from democracy. ” These writers , usually entirely ignorant of Polish politics , can never quite describe the machinations of the ruling Law and Justice party on the state-run media or on the Constitutional Court . Nor could they describe with any specificity the state of those institutions in the hands of the previous ruling party , but all they need to know is that Poland opposes becoming a destination for Islamic migrants . Case closed . Never mind that all Eastern European governments , whether right-wing Hungary or left-wing Slovakia , oppose this migration . Their citizens see the results in Western Europe : social division , armed guards around monuments , and a decrease of liberty under rising surveillance . And they think , No thank you .
Some point out , as evidence of Trump ’ s sinister intent , that he did not mention Polish failures or historic Polish crimes and complicity . I don ’ t know why people think U.S. presidents on a diplomatic tour in Poland should bring up the fact that some Poles collaborated with Nazis . We do not do this every time we go to France . Our presidents don ’ t even do this when we go to Germany . But for some reason , Poles deserve it .

America is a country in which people of different races bleed the “ same blood . ”
But Beinart prefers a different vocabulary from “ Western. ” He praises earlier speeches in Poland by President George W.

It is not a tribe. We can’t separate universal values from the West.

A few months ago I spent a weekend at a rather ritzy and high-toned political confab. There were sessions on all the problems, including Russia and China, that confront “the West.” Most of the attendees were center-right and center-left, members of good standing in polite society.

Now, in the mouth of Trump, the words “the West” are taken as menacing. A code for white supremacy and racial conflict. And in some ways that’s understandable. Trump is a crude man, and if he embodies something Western, it is that civilization’s defects, its arrogance and avarice. People genuinely fear Trump, and naturally everything he says becomes an occasion for expressing new dimensions of that fear. If someone argues that Trump’s speech was fine but in his mouth comes across as blasphemy, I’d have trouble arguing with them. But that’s not the argument that most people are making.

Case closed. Never mind that all Eastern European governments, whether right-wing Hungary or left-wing Slovakia, oppose this migration. Their citizens see the results in Western Europe: social division, armed guards around monuments, and a decrease of liberty under rising surveillance. And they think, No thank you.

That anxiety runs between the religious and the post-religious, between liberals and conservatives, and between what David Goodhart calls “the somewheres” and the “anywheres.” We increasingly suspect that “their” first-person plural does not include us. And we do so because we have trouble imagining that ours includes them. A voice comes: “Thankfully,” it says, “they are not America.”

The West is a capacious and contradictory thing, but it is identifiable. When I was in Cairo, I knew I was outside of it. The West comes from Jerusalem, Athens, and Rome. Having inherited a religious revelation that bursts into recorded history, sub Pontio Pilato, the West is deeply historically conscious. It says with Constantine, “In this sign, conquer.” At the same time, it has a distinguishing impulse to revere, and even adore, the weak and the outcast, urging, “Whatsoever you do to the least of these, you do unto me.” It has the Roman belief in administration as a form of power, and a peculiar romance for rebellion.

Like every other great civilization, it is filled with hypocrisy, and nobility. Capable of monstrous cruelty, and great beauty.

And I’m happy to have the West as an inheritance, blessing and curse that it is. I’m proud that it is the civilization that the Islamic jurist Muhammad Abduh looked upon and paid it the highest compliment he could: “I went to the West and saw Islam, but no Muslims; I got back to the East and saw Muslims, but not Islam.” Even as someone who believes that the pace of migration into Western Europe must slow down, I’m delighted to live in a civilization that people want to enter rather than leave, and I’m delighted that its great conversations and its inner turmoil are understood and shared by people from Puerto Santa Cruz to Minsk, from California to Kinshasa to Auckland. Even if I disagree with Trump about the seriousness of some external threats to our common civilization, I believe that Western civilization is undergoing a deep crisis in its spirit, that it suffers from having lost its faith and also all the hope it had placed in the ideas and ideologies that it used as substitutes for faith.

culture,New York Post,2,https://nypost.com/2019/08/17/luxury-beliefs-are-the-latest-status-symbol-for-rich-americans/,‘Luxury beliefs’ are the latest status symbol for rich Americans,2019-08-17,,"A former classmate from Yale recently told me “ monogamy is kind of outdated ” and not good for society . So I asked her what her background is and if she planned to marry .
She said she comes from an affluent family and works at a well-known technology company . Yes , she personally intends to have a monogamous marriage — but quickly added that marriage shouldn ’ t have to be for everyone .
She was raised by a traditional family . She planned on having a traditional family . But she maintained that traditional families are old-fashioned and society should “ evolve ” beyond them .
In the past , upper-class Americans used to display their social status with luxury goods . Today , they do it with luxury beliefs .
People care a lot about social status . In fact , research indicates that respect and admiration from our peers are even more important than money for our sense of well-being .
We feel pressure to display our status in new ways . This is why fashionable clothing always changes . But as trendy clothes and other products become more accessible and affordable , there is increasingly less status attached to luxury goods .
The upper classes have found a clever solution to this problem : luxury beliefs . These are ideas and opinions that confer status on the rich at very little cost , while taking a toll on the lower class .
One example of luxury belief is that all family structures are equal . This is not true . Evidence is clear that families with two married parents are the most beneficial for young children . And yet , affluent , educated people raised by two married parents are more likely than others to believe monogamy is outdated , marriage is a sham or that all families are the same .
‘ Upper-class people don a luxury belief to separate themselves from the lower class ’
Relaxed attitudes about marriage trickle down to the working class and the poor . In the 1960s , marriage rates between upper-class and lower-class Americans were nearly identical . But during this time , affluent Americans loosened social norms , expressing skepticism about marriage and monogamy .

Rob Henderson ( @ robkhenderson ) , who served in the Air Force , is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Cambridge .","A former classmate from Yale recently told me “monogamy is kind of outdated” and not good for society. So I asked her what her background is and if she planned to marry.

She said she comes from an affluent family and works at a well-known technology company. Yes, she personally intends to have a monogamous marriage — but quickly added that marriage shouldn’t have to be for everyone.

She was raised by a traditional family. She planned on having a traditional family. But she maintained that traditional families are old-fashioned and society should “evolve” beyond them.

What could explain this?

In the past, upper-class Americans used to display their social status with luxury goods. Today, they do it with luxury beliefs.

People care a lot about social status. In fact, research indicates that respect and admiration from our peers are even more important than money for our sense of well-being.

We feel pressure to display our status in new ways. This is why fashionable clothing always changes. But as trendy clothes and other products become more accessible and affordable, there is increasingly less status attached to luxury goods.

The upper classes have found a clever solution to this problem: luxury beliefs. These are ideas and opinions that confer status on the rich at very little cost, while taking a toll on the lower class.

One example of luxury belief is that all family structures are equal. This is not true. Evidence is clear that families with two married parents are the most beneficial for young children. And yet, affluent, educated people raised by two married parents are more likely than others to believe monogamy is outdated, marriage is a sham or that all families are the same.

‘Upper-class people don a luxury belief to separate themselves from the lower class’

Relaxed attitudes about marriage trickle down to the working class and the poor. In the 1960s, marriage rates between upper-class and lower-class Americans were nearly identical. But during this time, affluent Americans loosened social norms, expressing skepticism about marriage and monogamy.

This luxury belief contributed to the erosion of the family. Today, the marriage rates of affluent Americans are nearly the same as they were in the 1960s. But working-class people are far less likely to get married. Furthermore, out-of-wedlock birthrates are more than 10 times higher than they were in 1960, mostly among the poor and working class. Affluent people seldom have kids out of wedlock but are more likely than others to express the luxury belief that doing so is of no consequence.

Another luxury belief is that religion is irrational or harmful. Members of the upper class are most likely to be atheists or non-religious. But they have the resources and access to thrive without the unifying social edifice of religion.

Places of worship are often essential for the social fabric of poor communities. Denigrating the importance of religion harms the poor. While affluent people often find meaning in their work, most Americans do not have the luxury of a “profession.” They have jobs. They clock in, they clock out. Without a family or community to care for, such a job can feel meaningless.

Then there’s the luxury belief that individual decisions don’t matter much compared to random social forces, including luck. This belief is more common among many of my peers at Yale and Cambridge than the kids I grew up with in foster care or the women and men I served with in the military. The key message is that the outcomes of your life are beyond your control. This idea works to the benefit of the upper class and harms ordinary people.

It is common to see students at prestigious universities work ceaselessly and then downplay the importance of tenacity. They perform an “aw, shucks” routine to suggest they just got lucky rather than accept credit for their efforts. This message is damaging. If disadvantaged people believe random chance is the key factor for success, they will be less likely to strive.

culture,Christian Science Monitor,1,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/2020/0713/In-a-post-COVID-19-world-the-choice-to-regress-reform-or-reset,"In a post-COVID-19 world, the choice to regress, reform, or reset",2020-07-13,Ned Temko,"The direction that the post-pandemic world takes – whether we will see a reset or a return to our old ways – will depend largely on governments , businesses , and international organizations . But the landscape in which they will be working has changed . People power , in one form or another , seems here to stay .
One recurring theme in the series has been the way in which ordinary citizens , from the Persian Gulf to America ’ s Midwest , have risen up to press for solutions to their problems . They have defied a widespread loss of trust in the authorities and asserted their sense of agency , their faith that they can make a difference .
But the catastrophic spread of the coronavirus has brought to a head many of the issues we had already intended to consider . It has freeze-framed the world , forcing citizens to confront challenges ranging from climate change to inequality , race relations , and global governance . And it has raised new voices .
When The ███ launched its “ Navigating uncertainty ” series in February , exploring the ways in which the world seemed to have come unmoored from its traditional political , economic , and social tethers , we did not dream of the global COVID-19 pandemic .
On one side , a lawnmower ; on the other , a leaf blower . There ’ s an electric fan and a space heater . And a laptop , on which to write or WhatsApp or Zoom . And in the age of COVID-19 , I ’ m constantly aware that I am one of the very luckiest ones . I ’ m healthy . Unlike millions around the world , I ’ m able to self-isolate . I can work remotely . So can my wife . We have running water , electricity , Wi-Fi . A home of our own .
Yet even so , our life has changed beyond recognition . And the whole world has been thrown into flux – not just by the pandemic , but by a cacophony of social , political , and economic crosscurrents – at a time when the old post-World War II order and institutions were already under unprecedented pressure .
I wonder how many of the changes in my own life will prove lasting . And far more importantly for the world , how many of the COVID-induced changes , in public health and education , in race-relations and climate change , will persist ? Could the recent trend toward populism and narrow nationalism give way to some form of resurgent international cooperation ?
And will today ’ s single most important international rivalry – between a United States that has been in diplomatic retreat and an increasingly assertive China – become more starkly adversarial in the wake of heightened public sparring over the coronavirus ?
Odd though this may seem , given the enormous number of lives and jobs tragically lost to COVID-19 , an issue-by-issue look into the post-pandemic future offers reason , if not for unbridled optimism , at least for cautious hope .
Many of these potentially hopeful strands emerged in a Monitor series , beginning early this year and concluding with this article , called “ Navigating uncertainty. ” Planned well before the first coronavirus cases emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan , it drew on our writers from around the globe and sought to delve into the ways that , even before COVID-19 , our world had become untethered from decades-old institutions and alliances , and from basic life assumptions .
The series explored the many forces pulling nations , and sometimes citizens , apart from each other . It covered the growing ambitions abroad , and authoritarianism at home , of China under leader Xi Jinping . It looked into the appeal of strongman populist leaders like Brazil ’ s Jair Bolsonaro , and at the way technology and social media have become powerful tools for right-wing extremism .
But it also told another story , one that seems especially relevant and hopeful in a world that was changing dramatically as the series unfolded , influenced by COVID-19 and by the international wave of popular protest in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in the U.S .
That other story was one of remarkable human resilience . It was about individuals and communities taking ownership of problems they faced and pressing for their resolution . And it was all the more striking because it seemed at odds with a powerful trend that has fed polarization and populism in many countries : a loss of trust in government and a loss of the sense of agency that anything they could do as individuals could really change the course of events .
A number of examples in the Monitor series stood out . There were the “ citizens ’ juries ” discussing and debating , learning and listening , and recommending policies at local or national level to confront climate change . The extraordinary determination of human-rights activists in Egypt and Gulf states to keep pushing , at potential risk to their liberty or even their lives , for the values that inspired the Arab Spring a decade ago .
There were major business figures trying to refashion and reform a capitalist economic system that is increasingly favoring shareholders and top executives over the interests of employees , customers , and society as a whole .
And there was a whole country , or an almost-country . Somaliland split itself off from Somalia in 1991 during that country ’ s civil war . It remains desperately poor .
Yet in the decades since declaring itself a state , it has established and maintained peace . It has built a working democracy . Through assiduous efforts to secure financial support from diaspora Somalilanders in the U.S. , Europe , and elsewhere , it is staying afloat . And all of this without international recognition as a country – or , crucially , the access to international aid funds that such recognition would bring .
It might well be said , of course , that the prospect of any of this leading to real change remains daunting . Progress on climate change is still going to require international action , not to mention short-term costs that may prove particularly unappealing amid the economic downturn from the pandemic . The Arab Spring has given way to an Arab winter , with old-style authoritarian rulers back in command .
For business leaders , talking about reform is easier than actually changing the way they see their bottom line . And the prospect of international recognition for Somaliland remains roughly zero : The international community is wary about setting a precedent for other potential breakaway states .
Still , the context for these examples of resilience , of human agency in action , has changed dramatically over recent months .
One reason is the pandemic itself . It has put governments worldwide through an unprecedented stress test , and revealed a lack of any coherent , truly international response . It has shone a glaring spotlight on issues like climate change and gaping economic inequalities . Most significantly , it has interrupted life-as-usual for millions upon millions of people ; it has freeze-framed our world , forcing us to stop and look afresh .
Jacquelyn Martin/AP Demonstrators protest near the White House in Washington June 6 , 2020 , over the killing of George Floyd as he was detained by police in Minneapolis . In the wake of George Floyd ’ s death , polling shows dramatic movement in Americans ’ opinions on police brutality and racial injustice .
The wave of protest against racism and police violence following George Floyd ’ s killing is more than just a rekindling of human agency . With at least some policy changes at local or state level already announced , it has validated and vindicated it . The protests have also served as a reminder that the power of social media can be put to work by anybody , not only far-right political parties or populist politicians . It is an indispensable communications tool for individuals or communities on all sides of an argument .
Ultimately , though , any major political change will require action by governments or other established institutions . On that score , the prognosis so far is mixed .
While COVID-19 and economic shutdowns have heightened awareness of climate change and of the human causes of carbon emissions , it ’ s not yet clear whether the world will adopt new , greener investment strategies wholesale .
The European Union does seem committed to a “ green new deal ” ; Britain has announced new investment in green infrastructure . But other countries , including the U.S. , Russia , Canada , and France , are devoting more of their economic recovery budgets to the fossil fuel sector than to renewable energy sources .
In business , the signs are more positive . A number of major American companies have embraced the anti-racism message of the protests that followed George Floyd ’ s death . Some have even taken a step unthinkable just a few months ago : They ’ ve paused advertising on Facebook , the most powerful social media platform on earth , to protest its handling of hate-speech and conspiracy theories .
Geopolitically , it ’ s too early to say whether the enormous human cost of the world ’ s failure to coordinate its response to COVID-19 will prompt governments to breathe new life into international institutions and alliances .
But in Europe , at least , a shift appears underway . Initially , European countries abandoned ideas of continental solidarity , and each followed its own policies . Now , though , the European Union is poised to bridge a longstanding divide between wealthy , fiscally conservative northern states and its more indebted , harder-pressed southern members . Germany , the largest EU economy , is leading efforts to raise financing for a single , central fund to support all member states in their recovery from the economic effects of the pandemic .
It ’ s also conceivable that the COVID crisis could prompt some voters to rethink their support for populist , strongman leaders . The two leading exemplars , President Donald Trump in the U.S. and Brazil ’ s President Bolsonaro , who have both played down the seriousness of the pandemic , preside over the two nations that top the death toll rankings .
Still , with politics across the world still in unprecedented flux , the exact shape of a post-pandemic world can only be guessed at .
Come back to my garden shed . Since my wife and I are both of an age that qualifies us as “ COVID-vulnerable , ” we ’ ve been in self-isolation for months , since before Britain declared its formal lockdown in late March . Within days , all across London a group of younger people formed and got in touch to volunteer their help with whatever “ self-isolators ” like us might need .
One young woman had been helping us for weeks , picking things up from local shops – sometimes at scandalously short notice – when I texted her to say that I hoped my wife and I would be able to take her out for a post-pandemic dinner to convey the depth of our gratitude . Her answer : “ Not at all ! It ’ s not a big deal for me , and while I can do it , I like to help people in your position . ”
Our shared shut-in experience has also led to a new , closer relationship with our neighbors , who ’ ve always been friendly enough , but who now draw less deeply on their well of English reserve .
This may all sound trivial . But it seems to me part of a genuine rekindling of simple human connections that I fully expect to outlast COVID-19 .
And another social change with far wider implications – the rekindling of individual agency , of engagement across different communities and countries , races and age-groups , to promote change by tackling shared problems – seems likely to last as well . COVID-19 has amplified social problems and accelerated political movements ; people are readier to confront and talk bluntly about race , climate change , corporate responsibility , and other issues of our age .
Grassroots activism alone will not solve the major domestic and international challenges that confront us . It can not , by itself , disentangle the “ uncertainties ” mapped out and investigated in our Monitor series .

But it has profoundly changed the landscape in which established institutions – governments , businesses , and international organizations – will have to address them .
And whatever else may settle back into the old normal once the worst of COVID-19 has passed , “ people power , ” in one form or another , seems here to stay .","The direction that the post-pandemic world takes – whether we will see a reset or a return to our old ways – will depend largely on governments, businesses, and international organizations.

When The Christian Science Monitor launched its “Navigating uncertainty” series in February, exploring the ways in which the world seemed to have come unmoored from its traditional political, economic, and social tethers, we did not dream of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Welcome to my office. Actually, my garden shed.

On one side, a lawnmower; on the other, a leaf blower. There’s an electric fan and a space heater. And a laptop, on which to write or WhatsApp or Zoom. And in the age of COVID-19, I’m constantly aware that I am one of the very luckiest ones. I’m healthy. Unlike millions around the world, I’m able to self-isolate. I can work remotely. So can my wife. We have running water, electricity, Wi-Fi. A home of our own.

Yet even so, our life has changed beyond recognition. And the whole world has been thrown into flux – not just by the pandemic, but by a cacophony of social, political, and economic crosscurrents – at a time when the old post-World War II order and institutions were already under unprecedented pressure.

I wonder how many of the changes in my own life will prove lasting. And far more importantly for the world, how many of the COVID-induced changes, in public health and education, in race-relations and climate change, will persist? Could the recent trend toward populism and narrow nationalism give way to some form of resurgent international cooperation?

And will today’s single most important international rivalry – between a United States that has been in diplomatic retreat and an increasingly assertive China – become more starkly adversarial in the wake of heightened public sparring over the coronavirus?

Odd though this may seem, given the enormous number of lives and jobs tragically lost to COVID-19, an issue-by-issue look into the post-pandemic future offers reason, if not for unbridled optimism, at least for cautious hope.

Many of these potentially hopeful strands emerged in a Monitor series, beginning early this year and concluding with this article, called “Navigating uncertainty.” Planned well before the first coronavirus cases emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, it drew on our writers from around the globe and sought to delve into the ways that, even before COVID-19, our world had become untethered from decades-old institutions and alliances, and from basic life assumptions.

The series explored the many forces pulling nations, and sometimes citizens, apart from each other. It covered the growing ambitions abroad, and authoritarianism at home, of China under leader Xi Jinping. It looked into the appeal of strongman populist leaders like Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, and at the way technology and social media have become powerful tools for right-wing extremism.

But it also told another story, one that seems especially relevant and hopeful in a world that was changing dramatically as the series unfolded, influenced by COVID-19 and by the international wave of popular protest in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in the U.S.

That other story was one of remarkable human resilience. It was about individuals and communities taking ownership of problems they faced and pressing for their resolution. And it was all the more striking because it seemed at odds with a powerful trend that has fed polarization and populism in many countries: a loss of trust in government and a loss of the sense of agency that anything they could do as individuals could really change the course of events.

A number of examples in the Monitor series stood out. There were the “citizens’ juries” discussing and debating, learning and listening, and recommending policies at local or national level to confront climate change. The extraordinary determination of human-rights activists in Egypt and Gulf states to keep pushing, at potential risk to their liberty or even their lives, for the values that inspired the Arab Spring a decade ago.

There were major business figures trying to refashion and reform a capitalist economic system that is increasingly favoring shareholders and top executives over the interests of employees, customers, and society as a whole.

And there was a whole country, or an almost-country. Somaliland split itself off from Somalia in 1991 during that country’s civil war. It remains desperately poor.

Yet in the decades since declaring itself a state, it has established and maintained peace. It has built a working democracy. Through assiduous efforts to secure financial support from diaspora Somalilanders in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere, it is staying afloat. And all of this without international recognition as a country – or, crucially, the access to international aid funds that such recognition would bring.

It might well be said, of course, that the prospect of any of this leading to real change remains daunting. Progress on climate change is still going to require international action, not to mention short-term costs that may prove particularly unappealing amid the economic downturn from the pandemic. The Arab Spring has given way to an Arab winter, with old-style authoritarian rulers back in command.

For business leaders, talking about reform is easier than actually changing the way they see their bottom line. And the prospect of international recognition for Somaliland remains roughly zero: The international community is wary about setting a precedent for other potential breakaway states.

A changed context

Still, the context for these examples of resilience, of human agency in action, has changed dramatically over recent months.

One reason is the pandemic itself. It has put governments worldwide through an unprecedented stress test, and revealed a lack of any coherent, truly international response. It has shone a glaring spotlight on issues like climate change and gaping economic inequalities. Most significantly, it has interrupted life-as-usual for millions upon millions of people; it has freeze-framed our world, forcing us to stop and look afresh.

Jacquelyn Martin/AP Demonstrators protest near the White House in Washington June 6, 2020, over the killing of George Floyd as he was detained by police in Minneapolis. In the wake of George Floyd’s death, polling shows dramatic movement in Americans’ opinions on police brutality and racial injustice.

The wave of protest against racism and police violence following George Floyd’s killing is more than just a rekindling of human agency. With at least some policy changes at local or state level already announced, it has validated and vindicated it. The protests have also served as a reminder that the power of social media can be put to work by anybody, not only far-right political parties or populist politicians. It is an indispensable communications tool for individuals or communities on all sides of an argument.

Ultimately, though, any major political change will require action by governments or other established institutions. On that score, the prognosis so far is mixed.

While COVID-19 and economic shutdowns have heightened awareness of climate change and of the human causes of carbon emissions, it’s not yet clear whether the world will adopt new, greener investment strategies wholesale.

The European Union does seem committed to a “green new deal”; Britain has announced new investment in green infrastructure. But other countries, including the U.S., Russia, Canada, and France, are devoting more of their economic recovery budgets to the fossil fuel sector than to renewable energy sources.

In business, the signs are more positive. A number of major American companies have embraced the anti-racism message of the protests that followed George Floyd’s death. Some have even taken a step unthinkable just a few months ago: They’ve paused advertising on Facebook, the most powerful social media platform on earth, to protest its handling of hate-speech and conspiracy theories.

International connections

Geopolitically, it’s too early to say whether the enormous human cost of the world’s failure to coordinate its response to COVID-19 will prompt governments to breathe new life into international institutions and alliances.

But in Europe, at least, a shift appears underway. Initially, European countries abandoned ideas of continental solidarity, and each followed its own policies. Now, though, the European Union is poised to bridge a longstanding divide between wealthy, fiscally conservative northern states and its more indebted, harder-pressed southern members. Germany, the largest EU economy, is leading efforts to raise financing for a single, central fund to support all member states in their recovery from the economic effects of the pandemic.

It’s also conceivable that the COVID crisis could prompt some voters to rethink their support for populist, strongman leaders. The two leading exemplars, President Donald Trump in the U.S. and Brazil’s President Bolsonaro, who have both played down the seriousness of the pandemic, preside over the two nations that top the death toll rankings.

Still, with politics across the world still in unprecedented flux, the exact shape of a post-pandemic world can only be guessed at.

So why the cautious hope?

Come back to my garden shed. Since my wife and I are both of an age that qualifies us as “COVID-vulnerable,” we’ve been in self-isolation for months, since before Britain declared its formal lockdown in late March. Within days, all across London a group of younger people formed and got in touch to volunteer their help with whatever “self-isolators” like us might need.

One young woman had been helping us for weeks, picking things up from local shops – sometimes at scandalously short notice – when I texted her to say that I hoped my wife and I would be able to take her out for a post-pandemic dinner to convey the depth of our gratitude. Her answer: “Not at all! It’s not a big deal for me, and while I can do it, I like to help people in your position.”

Our shared shut-in experience has also led to a new, closer relationship with our neighbors, who’ve always been friendly enough, but who now draw less deeply on their well of English reserve.

This may all sound trivial. But it seems to me part of a genuine rekindling of simple human connections that I fully expect to outlast COVID-19.

And another social change with far wider implications – the rekindling of individual agency, of engagement across different communities and countries, races and age-groups, to promote change by tackling shared problems – seems likely to last as well. COVID-19 has amplified social problems and accelerated political movements; people are readier to confront and talk bluntly about race, climate change, corporate responsibility, and other issues of our age.

Grassroots activism alone will not solve the major domestic and international challenges that confront us. It cannot, by itself, disentangle the “uncertainties” mapped out and investigated in our Monitor series.

But it has profoundly changed the landscape in which established institutions – governments, businesses, and international organizations – will have to address them.

And whatever else may settle back into the old normal once the worst of COVID-19 has passed, “people power,” in one form or another, seems here to stay.",www.csmonitor.com,center,8sgaWr7PuTH3K5ad

culture,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/culture/2017/1/20/14289476/barack-obama-president-pop-culture-late-night,Barack Obama was the perfect pop culture president — for better or worse,2017-01-20,"Emily Todd Vanderwerff, Umair Irfan, Nicole Narea, Terry Nguyen, German Lopez, Alissa Wilkinson, Constance Grady","Make him president , and he ’ ll seem presidential . Make him a law professor , and he ’ ll seem professorial . In some other universe , there ’ s probably some alternate version of Obama who became a novelist and is widely regarded as one of America ’ s foremost men of letters .
This is not to say Obama is multitalented — though he is — but rather that he boasts the chameleon-like ability to make himself seem like a natural fit for wherever he ends up . I ’ m sure some of that skill can be attributed to his DNA and his upbringing , a biracial child being raised by his white grandparents . ( He ’ s made that argument himself in both of his memoirs . )
But just as much has to do with his confident , observational demeanor . Obama is great at hanging back , then delivering exactly the right quip at exactly the right moment . It ’ s easy to imagine him as the guy at the edge of the room , offering trenchant commentary about everybody dancing at its center . He belongs everywhere and nowhere all at once , and that can be disarming .
As Obama told the Atlantic ’ s Ta-Nehisi Coates of his days on the campaign trail :
If I walked into a room and it ’ s a bunch of white farmers , trade unionists , middle age — I ’ m not walking in thinking , Man , I ’ ve got to show them that I ’ m normal . I walk in there , I think , with a set of assumptions : like , these people look just like my grandparents . And I see the same Jell‑O mold that my grandmother served , and they ’ ve got the same , you know , little stuff on their mantelpieces . And so I am maybe disarming them by just assuming that we ’ re okay .
This made Obama a pop culture president unlike any other . Bill Clinton was known for turning his considerable charm on anybody he met — talk show host and voting citizen alike . Meanwhile , George W. Bush often seemed like something of an awkward uncle , laughing at people ’ s jokes but not getting them .
But Obama was as comfortable on Fox News as he was on The Daily Show or reading mean tweets on Kimmel . He could play games with Jimmy Fallon or talk policy with journalists , and act demonstrably different with both . It often seemed like he truly understood pop culture , particularly hip-hop and prestige TV , the two most dominant cultural forms of his era . It was like he chose a persona for each occasion — goofy but proud dad , cool guy , serious wonk — and then stepped into it .
In this way , as in so many others , the man who is replacing him is his exact opposite . Barack Obama wears many hats . But Donald Trump is always Donald Trump , for better or worse .
Obama was roundly praised for his pop culture acumen . But was that acumen as useful as it was assumed to be ?
It might seem hard to believe now , but when Obama appeared on Jay Leno ’ s Tonight Show early in his presidency in 2009 , it was the first ever appearance from a sitting president on a late-night talk show . And he followed it up with appearances on every major late-night show that aired during his administration . Throw in Michelle Obama ’ s appearances on a host of other programs , and the Obamas ’ casual domination of pop culture seems either calculated or effortless depending on the color of the lenses you choose to wear . ( It doesn ’ t hurt that both halves of the couple are natural-born joke tellers , a skill that few presidents or first ladies possess . )
I ’ m speaking as if Obama purposefully leaned into whatever TV show he was appearing on ( even the news ) , but that ’ s not strictly accurate . Sure , he chose which modes and tones to use in each situation , but he always had a certain sense of gravity to him , even when he was slow-jamming the news . Obama ’ s strength was in finding a way to move toward the center of the pop culture solar system but also pull it toward him , so they met in the middle , instead of awkwardly waving at each other across a wide gap .
Obama also curated the pop culture he consumed in a way that made him seem populist but still pretty cool . He watched Homeland when it was new and buzzworthy , and was the only person in the world to receive Game of Thrones season six screeners from HBO before the episodes aired on television . He liked Hamilton before it was cool .
Where Ronald Reagan had regularly hosted film screenings at the White House to swells of publicity ( fitting for a former film actor and Screen Actors Guild president ) , Obama seemed to understand that his cultural moment coincided with a cultural moment for hip-hop and prestige television — and adjusted his viewing patterns and guest lists accordingly .
I don ’ t mean to sound cynical . Obama has been performing this sort of softshoe his whole political life . It ’ s why he rarely says something truly incendiary , but also why his supporters so often wish he would . To be Obama — to be black , but also have white heritage , but also participate in power structures still primarily designed for white men — is to tread carefully to a fault . He possessed immense power but often carried himself as an outsider , which is basically a description for every mega-celebrity ever .
Hollywood responded in kind , providing him with copious public support while also giving some Americans the sense that Obama was increasingly “ out of touch ” or didn ’ t understand the plight of those who didn ’ t regularly pal around with Beyoncé or Lin-Manuel Miranda .
I have always bristled at the idea that Obama ’ s pop culture savvy is genius , or central to his appeal , or something similar . I think it might be central to his appeal to his most fervent supporters . Indeed , I ’ ve loved a great many of his TV appearances . But I ’ ve also often wondered if they worked against him , chipped away at some of what made him relatable .
Look at other presidents when they would intersect with pop culture , and you can see the flop sweat . Clinton was better at it than Bush , but only in the sense that there was something weirdly charming about Clinton when he was trying too hard . Watch his famous 1992 appearance on The Arsenio Hall Show , and you can see how much effort he ’ s investing to make everybody love him . ( Whenever Bush crossed over into pop culture , he usually seemed like he was terrified he might forget his lines . )
Obama never lets you see any uncertainty . And when you consider that his primary outreach to the average American — especially in his second term — has come from appearances on TV shows , the picture becomes more complicated .
In 2008 , Obama ran on a campaign of understanding people ’ s pain , if maybe not feeling it . He and his wife had just paid off their student loans a few years prior ! They shopped at Target ! They weren ’ t like you and me anymore — it would be hard for a US senator to not become part of the system — but they were close enough to those days to remember .
Trace Obama ’ s pop culture encounters throughout his two terms , however , and you see a guy who increasingly seems almost more at home amid the laughter and lights of the Hollywood stage . Mind you , I don ’ t think that ’ s literally true — Obama ’ s talent , again , is making you think he ’ s comfortable in pretty much any situation . But if you were a very particular sort of voter , one who thought the “ coastal elite ” had forgotten about the little guy , Obama ’ s looseness on late night played into a very old , very persistent criticism , one from the earliest days of his political career .
Donald Trump is a pop culture wrecking ball . That makes him easier to relate to .
One of the right ’ s most persistent slurs against Obama during the 2008 election cycle was that he was running solely for his own ego , to become famous ( as if the campaign itself hadn ’ t already made him famous ) .
To many on the left , this suggestion seemed ridiculous ; Obama clearly had a whole platform he wanted to enact . But his level of fame and celebrity — and celebrity support — caused many on the right to see Obama as a vacuum . He came to stand for essentially any policy or program they could think of that they disagreed with , to the point that when Obama ’ s plans were inevitably more moderate or even right-leaning than they expected , it almost didn ’ t matter . The person selling them was a symbol of a coastal elitism they feared would leave them behind . ( I should note here that Obama ’ s race also played a role , though I will come back to that . )
The cottage industry of easily disproved rumors that sprang up around the Obamas ( like one declaring Michelle Obama to be a trans woman ) makes more sense in this context . Yes , the right had done something similar to the Clintons by , say , suggesting they had murdered former deputy White House counsel Vince Foster , but the Clinton family ’ s seeming hatred of the press and transparency provided fertile soil for rumors . Paradoxically , because the Obamas ’ frequent TV appearances made them seem more open — but also like characters on a show — even the most ridiculous rumors could take root .
To be sure , much of this was because Obama is black , and thus an unusual or even threatening figure to some . But Obama was also Hollywood , and that status brought with it an additional set of cultural assumptions and signifiers . Hollywood was a place of empty vacuousness and deep debauchery . It was the last place a president should seem so cozy in .
It ’ s ironic that for as much as conservatives lament the left ’ s supposed love of celebrity , the two presidents who have actual show business backgrounds are both Republicans : Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump . This strikes many on the left , including me , as bizarre — a kind of projection onto the left of the thing many on the right apparently want ( a celebrity president ) . But looking at Trump ’ s rise actually explains why this sort of candidate is so compelling to Republican voters .
Contrast any random Trump late-night appearance from throughout his decades of celebrity with any random Obama late-night appearance . Obama gently takes control of the show , while Trump just seems a little desperate to be liked , to fit in . Showbiz was never Trump ’ s natural home , but he wished it could be . That desire to be liked meant hosts could mock him endlessly and he would take it .
I ’ ve known Donald Trump for a long time and I always thought he was exactly what New York City needed to have : the big , blowhard billionaire . “ By God , I ’ m Donald Trump and I date models and I put up buildings , and everything is gold. ” Nobody took him seriously , and people loved him when he would come on the show . I would make fun of his hair , I would call him a slumlord , I would make fun of his ties . And he could just take a punch like nothing . He was the perfect guest .
With that quote in mind , watch Obama ’ s 2011 White House Correspondents ’ Association Dinner evisceration of Trump ’ s pursuit of Obama ’ s “ long-form birth certificate. ” Trump laughs along , but you can visibly see , even from very far away , how uncomfortable he is . Even Obama ’ s milder zingers are clearly rattling him .
Trump is happy to be humiliated , but usually only on his terms . ( See also : the list of topics that were off limits for his Comedy Central roast . ) Now he was being mocked when he didn ’ t expect to be , and savagely so . If you can put yourself in Trump ’ s shoes , even for a second , it ’ s easier to understand just how his supporters gravitated toward him as an exemplar of their many grievances , of the way the world seemed less attuned to them than ever before .
In a way , Trump and Obama ’ s TV personas perfectly exemplify their approaches to politics . Obama uses his wit as a tool . He can take it , and dish it out , and that makes him feel at home . But above all , he has to keep smiling . A lifetime of being a black man in America has made him understand that , if nothing else . You can only commandeer the stage if you don ’ t seem too threatening .
Trump , however , is a boulder . You can land punch after punch after punch on him , and nothing will happen , until he abruptly rolls forward a couple of seconds later and crushes you . Donald Trump has been the butt of the joke — from late-night comedians , from regular people , from presidents even — for decades now , and even after an election he won , he ’ s spent an inordinate amount of time on Twitter trying to get people to stop making fun of him . Maybe all those years of grinning and bearing snipes and snide remarks were preparation for rolling forward , just a few inches .
No matter what situation he ’ s in , Trump will never be talented enough to tell jokes or keep his cool during interviews or spar with the hosts , but he ’ s somehow more interesting for that , because he keeps trying . ( See Emily Nussbaum for more on Trump ’ s standup-esque delivery . ) He ’ s always been a very rich white man in a country that bends itself to the whims of very rich white men . Why appear on TV at all ? Because he likes the attention .
If I were to zero in on Trump ’ s Achilles ’ heel , it would be that he needs our love , and especially needs our love if we ’ re famous people . It drives him a little nuts when he can ’ t get it . There ’ s a reason he rarely passed up a media opportunity in the early days of The Apprentice , back when nobody could get enough Trump . Watch how he lights up in a room full of applause . As his approval ratings sink , it ’ s not hard to imagine that neediness driving him into some sort of endless circle of self-destruction .
And yet if I ’ m being honest , it ’ s far easier to identify with that need to be liked than it is to identify with Obama ’ s outsider cool . Barack Obama ’ s pop culture persona was the guy you maybe wanted to be someday when you grew up ; Donald Trump ’ s is the guy most of us already know we are , flailing and fumbling and as likely to hold on to petty grudges as anything .
Do I want that man to be president ? Not particularly — but I ’ d be lying if I said I didn ’ t see something of myself in him .","Barack Obama fills whatever space you put him in.

Make him president, and he’ll seem presidential. Make him a law professor, and he’ll seem professorial. In some other universe, there’s probably some alternate version of Obama who became a novelist and is widely regarded as one of America’s foremost men of letters.

This is not to say Obama is multitalented — though he is — but rather that he boasts the chameleon-like ability to make himself seem like a natural fit for wherever he ends up. I’m sure some of that skill can be attributed to his DNA and his upbringing, a biracial child being raised by his white grandparents. (He’s made that argument himself in both of his memoirs.)

But just as much has to do with his confident, observational demeanor. Obama is great at hanging back, then delivering exactly the right quip at exactly the right moment. It’s easy to imagine him as the guy at the edge of the room, offering trenchant commentary about everybody dancing at its center. He belongs everywhere and nowhere all at once, and that can be disarming.

As Obama told the Atlantic’s Ta-Nehisi Coates of his days on the campaign trail:

If I walked into a room and it’s a bunch of white farmers, trade unionists, middle age — I’m not walking in thinking, Man, I’ve got to show them that I’m normal. I walk in there, I think, with a set of assumptions: like, these people look just like my grandparents. And I see the same Jell‑O mold that my grandmother served, and they’ve got the same, you know, little stuff on their mantelpieces. And so I am maybe disarming them by just assuming that we’re okay.

This made Obama a pop culture president unlike any other. Bill Clinton was known for turning his considerable charm on anybody he met — talk show host and voting citizen alike. Meanwhile, George W. Bush often seemed like something of an awkward uncle, laughing at people’s jokes but not getting them.

But Obama was as comfortable on Fox News as he was on The Daily Show or reading mean tweets on Kimmel. He could play games with Jimmy Fallon or talk policy with journalists, and act demonstrably different with both. It often seemed like he truly understood pop culture, particularly hip-hop and prestige TV, the two most dominant cultural forms of his era. It was like he chose a persona for each occasion — goofy but proud dad, cool guy, serious wonk — and then stepped into it.

In this way, as in so many others, the man who is replacing him is his exact opposite. Barack Obama wears many hats. But Donald Trump is always Donald Trump, for better or worse.

Obama was roundly praised for his pop culture acumen. But was that acumen as useful as it was assumed to be?

It might seem hard to believe now, but when Obama appeared on Jay Leno’s Tonight Show early in his presidency in 2009, it was the first ever appearance from a sitting president on a late-night talk show. And he followed it up with appearances on every major late-night show that aired during his administration. Throw in Michelle Obama’s appearances on a host of other programs, and the Obamas’ casual domination of pop culture seems either calculated or effortless depending on the color of the lenses you choose to wear. (It doesn’t hurt that both halves of the couple are natural-born joke tellers, a skill that few presidents or first ladies possess.)

I’m speaking as if Obama purposefully leaned into whatever TV show he was appearing on (even the news), but that’s not strictly accurate. Sure, he chose which modes and tones to use in each situation, but he always had a certain sense of gravity to him, even when he was slow-jamming the news. Obama’s strength was in finding a way to move toward the center of the pop culture solar system but also pull it toward him, so they met in the middle, instead of awkwardly waving at each other across a wide gap.

Obama also curated the pop culture he consumed in a way that made him seem populist but still pretty cool. He watched Homeland when it was new and buzzworthy, and was the only person in the world to receive Game of Thrones season six screeners from HBO before the episodes aired on television. He liked Hamilton before it was cool.

Where Ronald Reagan had regularly hosted film screenings at the White House to swells of publicity (fitting for a former film actor and Screen Actors Guild president), Obama seemed to understand that his cultural moment coincided with a cultural moment for hip-hop and prestige television — and adjusted his viewing patterns and guest lists accordingly.

I don’t mean to sound cynical. Obama has been performing this sort of softshoe his whole political life. It’s why he rarely says something truly incendiary, but also why his supporters so often wish he would. To be Obama — to be black, but also have white heritage, but also participate in power structures still primarily designed for white men — is to tread carefully to a fault. He possessed immense power but often carried himself as an outsider, which is basically a description for every mega-celebrity ever.

Hollywood responded in kind, providing him with copious public support while also giving some Americans the sense that Obama was increasingly “out of touch” or didn’t understand the plight of those who didn’t regularly pal around with Beyoncé or Lin-Manuel Miranda.

I have always bristled at the idea that Obama’s pop culture savvy is genius, or central to his appeal, or something similar. I think it might be central to his appeal to his most fervent supporters. Indeed, I’ve loved a great many of his TV appearances. But I’ve also often wondered if they worked against him, chipped away at some of what made him relatable.

Look at other presidents when they would intersect with pop culture, and you can see the flop sweat. Clinton was better at it than Bush, but only in the sense that there was something weirdly charming about Clinton when he was trying too hard. Watch his famous 1992 appearance on The Arsenio Hall Show, and you can see how much effort he’s investing to make everybody love him. (Whenever Bush crossed over into pop culture, he usually seemed like he was terrified he might forget his lines.)

Obama never lets you see any uncertainty. And when you consider that his primary outreach to the average American — especially in his second term — has come from appearances on TV shows, the picture becomes more complicated.

In 2008, Obama ran on a campaign of understanding people’s pain, if maybe not feeling it. He and his wife had just paid off their student loans a few years prior! They shopped at Target! They weren’t like you and me anymore — it would be hard for a US senator to not become part of the system — but they were close enough to those days to remember.

Trace Obama’s pop culture encounters throughout his two terms, however, and you see a guy who increasingly seems almost more at home amid the laughter and lights of the Hollywood stage. Mind you, I don’t think that’s literally true — Obama’s talent, again, is making you think he’s comfortable in pretty much any situation. But if you were a very particular sort of voter, one who thought the “coastal elite” had forgotten about the little guy, Obama’s looseness on late night played into a very old, very persistent criticism, one from the earliest days of his political career.

Donald Trump is a pop culture wrecking ball. That makes him easier to relate to.

One of the right’s most persistent slurs against Obama during the 2008 election cycle was that he was running solely for his own ego, to become famous (as if the campaign itself hadn’t already made him famous).

To many on the left, this suggestion seemed ridiculous; Obama clearly had a whole platform he wanted to enact. But his level of fame and celebrity — and celebrity support — caused many on the right to see Obama as a vacuum. He came to stand for essentially any policy or program they could think of that they disagreed with, to the point that when Obama’s plans were inevitably more moderate or even right-leaning than they expected, it almost didn’t matter. The person selling them was a symbol of a coastal elitism they feared would leave them behind. (I should note here that Obama’s race also played a role, though I will come back to that.)

The cottage industry of easily disproved rumors that sprang up around the Obamas (like one declaring Michelle Obama to be a trans woman) makes more sense in this context. Yes, the right had done something similar to the Clintons by, say, suggesting they had murdered former deputy White House counsel Vince Foster, but the Clinton family’s seeming hatred of the press and transparency provided fertile soil for rumors. Paradoxically, because the Obamas’ frequent TV appearances made them seem more open — but also like characters on a show — even the most ridiculous rumors could take root.

To be sure, much of this was because Obama is black, and thus an unusual or even threatening figure to some. But Obama was also Hollywood, and that status brought with it an additional set of cultural assumptions and signifiers. Hollywood was a place of empty vacuousness and deep debauchery. It was the last place a president should seem so cozy in.

It’s ironic that for as much as conservatives lament the left’s supposed love of celebrity, the two presidents who have actual show business backgrounds are both Republicans: Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump. This strikes many on the left, including me, as bizarre — a kind of projection onto the left of the thing many on the right apparently want (a celebrity president). But looking at Trump’s rise actually explains why this sort of candidate is so compelling to Republican voters.

Contrast any random Trump late-night appearance from throughout his decades of celebrity with any random Obama late-night appearance. Obama gently takes control of the show, while Trump just seems a little desperate to be liked, to fit in. Showbiz was never Trump’s natural home, but he wished it could be. That desire to be liked meant hosts could mock him endlessly and he would take it.

Here’s David Letterman, speaking to the New York Times:

I’ve known Donald Trump for a long time and I always thought he was exactly what New York City needed to have: the big, blowhard billionaire. “By God, I’m Donald Trump and I date models and I put up buildings, and everything is gold.” Nobody took him seriously, and people loved him when he would come on the show. I would make fun of his hair, I would call him a slumlord, I would make fun of his ties. And he could just take a punch like nothing. He was the perfect guest.

With that quote in mind, watch Obama’s 2011 White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner evisceration of Trump’s pursuit of Obama’s “long-form birth certificate.” Trump laughs along, but you can visibly see, even from very far away, how uncomfortable he is. Even Obama’s milder zingers are clearly rattling him.

Trump is happy to be humiliated, but usually only on his terms. (See also: the list of topics that were off limits for his Comedy Central roast.) Now he was being mocked when he didn’t expect to be, and savagely so. If you can put yourself in Trump’s shoes, even for a second, it’s easier to understand just how his supporters gravitated toward him as an exemplar of their many grievances, of the way the world seemed less attuned to them than ever before.

In a way, Trump and Obama’s TV personas perfectly exemplify their approaches to politics. Obama uses his wit as a tool. He can take it, and dish it out, and that makes him feel at home. But above all, he has to keep smiling. A lifetime of being a black man in America has made him understand that, if nothing else. You can only commandeer the stage if you don’t seem too threatening.

Trump, however, is a boulder. You can land punch after punch after punch on him, and nothing will happen, until he abruptly rolls forward a couple of seconds later and crushes you. Donald Trump has been the butt of the joke — from late-night comedians, from regular people, from presidents even — for decades now, and even after an election he won, he’s spent an inordinate amount of time on Twitter trying to get people to stop making fun of him. Maybe all those years of grinning and bearing snipes and snide remarks were preparation for rolling forward, just a few inches.

No matter what situation he’s in, Trump will never be talented enough to tell jokes or keep his cool during interviews or spar with the hosts, but he’s somehow more interesting for that, because he keeps trying. (See Emily Nussbaum for more on Trump’s standup-esque delivery.) He’s always been a very rich white man in a country that bends itself to the whims of very rich white men. Why appear on TV at all? Because he likes the attention.

If I were to zero in on Trump’s Achilles’ heel, it would be that he needs our love, and especially needs our love if we’re famous people. It drives him a little nuts when he can’t get it. There’s a reason he rarely passed up a media opportunity in the early days of The Apprentice, back when nobody could get enough Trump. Watch how he lights up in a room full of applause. As his approval ratings sink, it’s not hard to imagine that neediness driving him into some sort of endless circle of self-destruction.

And yet if I’m being honest, it’s far easier to identify with that need to be liked than it is to identify with Obama’s outsider cool. Barack Obama’s pop culture persona was the guy you maybe wanted to be someday when you grew up; Donald Trump’s is the guy most of us already know we are, flailing and fumbling and as likely to hold on to petty grudges as anything.

Conservatives excoriate such politics as politically opportunistic theater , the acting out of coddled “ snowflake ” students . Liberals and progressives put forth an opposing grievance-first narrative , arguing that identity politics emanates from authentic wounds .
But what if both contenders have a piece of the truth ? What if many identity-firsters today are claiming to be victims because they and their societies are victims—only not so much of the abstract “ isms ” they denounce , but of something else that till now has eluded description ?
Let ’ s try a new theory : Our macro-politics have become a mania about identity because our micropolitics are no longer familial . This , above all , is what happened during the decades in which identity politics went from being a phrase in an obscure quasi-radical document to a way of being that has gone on to transform academia , law , media , culture and government .
Yes , racism , sexism and other forms of cruelty exist , and are always to be deplored and countered . At the same time , the timeline of identity politics suggest another source . Up until the middle of the twentieth century ( and barring the frequent foreshortening of life by disease or nature ) human expectations remained largely the same throughout the ages : that one would grow up to have children and a family ; that parents and siblings and extended family would remain one ’ s primal community ; and that , conversely , it was a tragedy not to be part of a family . The post-1960s order of sexual consumerism has upended every one of these expectations .
Who am I ? is a universal human question . It becomes harder to answer if other basic questions are problematic or out of reach . Who is my brother ? Who is my father ? Where , if anywhere , are my cousins , grandparents , nieces , nephews and the rest of the organic connections through which humanity up until now channeled everyday existence ? Every one of the assumptions that our forebears could take for granted is now negotiable .
The panic over identity , in short , is being driven by the fact that the human animal has been selected for familial forms of socialization that for many people no longer exist . Let ’ s test this theory , here dubbed the “ Great Scattering , ” via some evidence from social science , anthropology and pop culture .
Just how attenuated have family ties become ? Consider a few examples .
When sociologists first began mapping the post-revolutionary empirical world beginning a little over half a century ago , they looked first , naturally enough , to the terrain that was easiest to see and measure : fatherlessness and its correlates . In his 1965 report , The Negro Family : The Case for National Action , future U.S. senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan argued that black poverty was tied fundamentally to the implosion of the black family , and worried over the rate of out-of-wedlock births—which was then around 25 percent , much higher than that of whites . That rate would continue to rise for both whites and blacks during the decades to come , and academics began connecting dots to show what was happening to children and adolescents in the new social order .
In 1997 , one of the most eminent social scientists of the twentieth century , James Q. Wilson , summarized many of these findings succinctly in a speech that was later published as an essay . He identified the root of America ’ s fracturing in the dissolution of the family , and described what he called “ the two nations ” of America . The dividing line between these cleft territories was no longer one of income or social class , he argued . Instead , it had become all about the hearth .
“ It is not money , ” Wilson documented , “ but the family that is the foundation of public life . As it has become weaker , every structure built upon that foundation has become weaker. ” He pointed to the library that social science had been building for decades , filled with books and studies about the correlations between crumbling family structure and various adverse results . Kinship composition , as Wilson ’ s work among others demonstrated , had become more important to positive outcomes than race , income , or one ’ s station at birth .
Absent fathers have been only the most visible and measurable of the new family lacunae . In a landmark 2000 book called Between Two Worlds : The Inner Lives of Children of Divorce , Elizabeth Marquardt , working with sociologist Norval Glenn , reported on a study into the long-term effects of parental breakup into adulthood . She administered a lengthy questionnaire to 1,500 young adults , half of whose parents had split up by the time the children turned fourteen , and documented differences between children of divorce , and those who came from intact families .
At times , the two groups exhibited starkly opposed concepts of identity . For example , children of divorce were almost three times as likely to “ strongly agree ” with the statement , “ I felt like a different person with each of my parents. ” They were also twice as likely to “ strongly agree ” with the statement , “ I always felt like an adult , even when I was a little kid ” —a particularly poignant expression of confusion about the question “ Who am I ? ” Almost two-thirds of the respondents of divorced homes also “ agreed ” with the following statement , which similarly expresses the division of oneself : “ I felt like I had two families . ”
This is evocative evidence , again , of the unsteady sense of self that many people , adult and child alike , now experience as the givens of life . It expresses the division of one into more than one—of selves torn , as in the book ’ s title , between worlds . And though these researchers limited their study to children of divorce only , their findings would also appear to apply to any home where two parents play a role in a child ’ s life from different locations .
Pop culture weighs in , too . In a 2004 Policy Review essay called Eminem Is Right , I documented how family rupture , family anarchy and family breakup had become the signature themes of Generation-X and Generation-Y pop . If yesterday ’ s rock was the music of abandon , today ’ s is that of abandonment . The odd truth about contemporary teenage music—the characteristic that most separates it from what has gone before—is its compulsive insistence on the damage wrought by broken homes , family dysfunction , checked-out parents , and ( especially ) absent fathers . Papa Roach , Everclear , Blink-182 , Good Charlotte , Snoop Doggy Dogg—these and others have their own generational answer to what ails the modern teenager . That answer is : dysfunctional childhood . During the same years in which progressive-minded and politically correct adults have been excoriating Ozzie and Harriet as artifacts of 1950s-style oppression , millions of American teenagers have enshrined a new generation of music idols whose shared signature in song after song is to rage about what not having had a nuclear family had done to them .
In 2004 , identity politics was not the omnipresent headline subject it is today . Even so , the effect of family decline on the sense of self already was appearing writ large across popular music . Tupac Shakur rapped about life with a single mother and no male parent , including in his 1993 Papa ’ z Song , about a boy who has to play catch by himself . Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam and Kurt Cobain of Nirvana , both towering figures in 1990s rock , were children of divorce , and both referred back to that event repeatedly in their songs and interviews .
Above all , there is the fiery emotional connection that generations of teenagers have found in rap superstar Eminem . It exists not only on account of his extraordinary facility with language , but also , surely , for his signature themes : absent father , inattentive mother , protectiveness toward a sibling , and rage . Eminem is the Greek chorus of family dysfunction . And long before today ’ s brand of identity panics , a lot of young America already was stumbling over how to answer the question “ Who am I ? ” Just listening to what they were driving up the charts proved the point .
Another demographic factor of note has been the shrinkage of most Western families , whether split or intact—one of whose consequences has been the diminishing number of people who grow up with siblings . It is now much more common for American mothers to have one or two children , rather than three or more , as was the case in the early 1960s . Singleton children have become the norm across much of Europe and parts of Asia , and the numbers are increasing in the United States . Many contemporary children and adolescents not only lack a parent—typically , a male parent . Many also have no siblings , or no sibling of either the same or the opposite sex .
Why might this matter ? Because diverse findings show that being accompanied through early life by non-parental contemporaneous others ( i.e. , siblings ) gives children and teenagers a leg up on socialization—in other words , knowing who they are in the social order .
A Canadian study published in 2018 suggests that siblings learn empathy from one another , independent of birth order . Another study has found that the likelihood of divorce later in life can be predicted by the number of siblings one has ; the higher that number , the lower the likelihood of divorce . As with other analyses of the benefits of having brothers and sisters , the authors conjecture that the necessity of sharing resources prepares siblings for essential social skills later in life , such as bargaining and taking turns . One more study that made headlines recently showed that growing up with an opposite-sex sibling makes teenagers and young adults more confident and successful in the romance market , because they have had the opportunity to observe and interact at close range with a contemporaneous member of the opposite sex .
Such findings also are consonant with similar observations made from inquiries into animal behavior . One paper reviewing research into a variety of primates , including rhesus monkeys , baboons and macaques , concludes : “ The bulk of the available evidence suggests that during childhood the nonhuman primates who grow up in the presence of siblings ( or maternal half-sibs ) will develop childhood social relationships with others in their social group earlier ; and that these relationships will be of a more extensive nature than those formed by infants who grow up in the absence of siblings ( or maternal half-sibs ) . ”
Finally , another body of evidence that also speaks to our familial dislocation and isolation can be found in one of sociology ’ s hottest and fastest-growing stocks : loneliness studies .
Substantial numbers of men and women are suffering from what social scientists and medical professionals in their stricken societies call an “ epidemic ” of loneliness . Over half a century after the embrace of the sexual revolution , the paradox emerges that the materially better-off countries of the planet are also the most emotionally impoverished for many citizens , particularly though not only the elderly . Google any Western European or other advanced country followed by “ loneliness , ” and the same results appear : an outpouring of research on the new isolation .
This loneliness is a unique form of human poverty , abounding in societies awash in material wealth—places where , by the 1970s , divorce rates were rising , marriage rates were falling , and cradles were rapidly emptying .
Loneliness is no mere adolescent affectation . Social isolation on the scale found throughout the countries of the West is now exacting serious health costs that can be expected to rise as the Baby Boom generation enters its final years . Yet while senior citizens are the most visible objects of concern , they are not the only people so affected . One national survey conducted by health-service company Cigna , whose results were released in May , 2018 , found that nearly half of all Americans report “ sometimes or always ” feeling alone , and that Generation Z—born between 1995 and 2010—is the loneliest generation of all .
Big Health takes an interest in social atomization for sound reasons . In their 2008 book , Loneliness : Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection , scientists John T. Cacioppo and William Patrick summarized evidence linking atomization to health risks , including a literature review in Science indicating that social isolation is a risk factor for illness and death whose effects are comparable to other , more familiar ones : high blood pressure , obesity , lack of exercise and smoking .
Wherever one stands in matters of the “ culture wars ” is immaterial . The plain fact is that the relative stability of yesterday ’ s familial identity could not help but answer the question at the heart of identity politics—Who am I ? —in ways that now eludes many . The diminution and rupture of the family and the rise of identity politics can not be understood apart from one another .
Anthropological evidence from every culture and era verifies that human beings , by their nature , live in families—just as coyotes and elephants and other mammals live in families , not just in random collections of individuals of the same species . Apart from the outlier that is the contemporary West , family has been an integral , unbidden demand of our kind , everywhere that human beings have been found . Its relational structure has provided the default ways of answering the question , Who am I ? And now many people , deprived of a robust family life by post-1960s trends , can no longer figure out how to answer that question .
No wonder the flight to collective identities based on gender , ethnicity , and all the rest has become so impassioned . For more and more people , Narcissus can no longer find himself anywhere else .

Conservatives excoriate such politics as politically opportunistic theater, the acting out of coddled “snowflake” students. Liberals and progressives put forth an opposing grievance-first narrative, arguing that identity politics emanates from authentic wounds.

But what if both contenders have a piece of the truth? What if many identity-firsters today are claiming to be victims because they and their societies are victims—only not so much of the abstract “isms” they denounce, but of something else that till now has eluded description?

Let’s try a new theory: Our macro-politics have become a mania about identity because our micropolitics are no longer familial. This, above all, is what happened during the decades in which identity politics went from being a phrase in an obscure quasi-radical document to a way of being that has gone on to transform academia, law, media, culture and government.

Yes, racism, sexism and other forms of cruelty exist, and are always to be deplored and countered. At the same time, the timeline of identity politics suggest another source. Up until the middle of the twentieth century (and barring the frequent foreshortening of life by disease or nature) human expectations remained largely the same throughout the ages: that one would grow up to have children and a family; that parents and siblings and extended family would remain one’s primal community; and that, conversely, it was a tragedy not to be part of a family. The post-1960s order of sexual consumerism has upended every one of these expectations.

Who am I? is a universal human question. It becomes harder to answer if other basic questions are problematic or out of reach. Who is my brother? Who is my father? Where, if anywhere, are my cousins, grandparents, nieces, nephews and the rest of the organic connections through which humanity up until now channeled everyday existence? Every one of the assumptions that our forebears could take for granted is now negotiable.

The panic over identity, in short, is being driven by the fact that the human animal has been selected for familial forms of socialization that for many people no longer exist. Let’s test this theory, here dubbed the “Great Scattering,” via some evidence from social science, anthropology and pop culture.

From Palmyra — remember , in Syria ? —simply because they could . ”
In the wake of the U.S. killing of Iranian Maj. Gen.

” I don ’ t care about Iranian cultural sites , and I ’ ll tell you why , ” Pete Hegseth said Monday night . “ If you understand the Islamic Republic of Iran , of Islamists , if they could come , if they had the power , they would destroy every single one of our cultural sites and build a mosque on top of it . ”

Finally , the Islamic extremism espoused by Soleimani , as well as any other kind of extremist ideology , is dangerous and odious not just because of its indiscriminate violence , but because it attempts to erode and erase entire cultures .

TORONTO ( AP ) — Don Cherry , Canada ’ s most polarizing , flamboyant and opinionated hockey commentator , was fired Monday for calling immigrants “ you people ” in a television rant in which he said new immigrants are not honoring the country ’ s fallen soldiers .
Rogers Sportsnet President Bart Yabsley announced the decision following discussions with the 85-year-old broadcaster .
“ It has been decided it is the right time for him to immediately step down , ” Yabsley said in a statement . “ During the broadcast , he made divisive remarks that do not represent our values or what we stand for . ”
Cherry derided immigrants by saying Saturday night , “ You people ... you love our way of life , you love our milk and honey , at least you can pay a couple bucks for a poppy or something like that . These guys paid for your way of life that you enjoy in Canada , these guys paid the biggest price . ”
The tradition of wearing poppies in Canada honors the country ’ s war dead on Remembrance Day , which was observed Monday .
Cherry has provided commentary following the first intermission of “ Hockey Night in Canada ” for more than three decades .
“ I know what I said and I meant it . Still do . Everybody in Canada should wear a poppy to honor our fallen soldiers , ” Cherry told The Canadian Press .
“ I did not say minorities , I did not say immigrants . If you watch ‘ Coach ’ s Corner , ’ I did not say that . I said ‘ everybody. ’ And I said ‘ you people , ’ ” Cherry said .
“ Irish , Scotch , anybody that ’ s newcomers to Canada , and they should wear a poppy to honor our dead from the past , whether they ’ re Scotch or Irish or English , or where they come from . ”
Cherry added he could have stayed on “ if I had turned into a tame robot who nobody would recognize . ”

TORONTO (AP) — Don Cherry, Canada’s most polarizing, flamboyant and opinionated hockey commentator, was fired Monday for calling immigrants “you people” in a television rant in which he said new immigrants are not honoring the country’s fallen soldiers.

Rogers Sportsnet President Bart Yabsley announced the decision following discussions with the 85-year-old broadcaster.

“It has been decided it is the right time for him to immediately step down,” Yabsley said in a statement. “During the broadcast, he made divisive remarks that do not represent our values or what we stand for.”

Cherry derided immigrants by saying Saturday night, “You people ... you love our way of life, you love our milk and honey, at least you can pay a couple bucks for a poppy or something like that. These guys paid for your way of life that you enjoy in Canada, these guys paid the biggest price.”

The tradition of wearing poppies in Canada honors the country’s war dead on Remembrance Day, which was observed Monday.

Cherry has provided commentary following the first intermission of “Hockey Night in Canada” for more than three decades.

He said late Monday he would not be apologizing.

“I know what I said and I meant it. Still do. Everybody in Canada should wear a poppy to honor our fallen soldiers,” Cherry told The Canadian Press.

Cherry denies he was singling out visible minorities.

“I did not say minorities, I did not say immigrants. If you watch ‘Coach’s Corner,’ I did not say that. I said ‘everybody.’ And I said ‘you people,’” Cherry said.

“Irish, Scotch, anybody that’s newcomers to Canada, and they should wear a poppy to honor our dead from the past, whether they’re Scotch or Irish or English, or where they come from.”

Cherry added he could have stayed on “if I had turned into a tame robot who nobody would recognize.”

“I can’t do that after 38 years,” he said

Known for his outlandish suits, Cherry often mangled the names of foreign-born players over the years and occasionally weighed in with thoughts on politics. He has been a part of the Hockey Night broadcast since 1980.

“Don is synonymous with hockey and has played an integral role in growing the game,” Yabsley said. “We would like to thank Don for his contributions to hockey and sports broadcasting in Canada.”

MacLean didn’t object to Cherry’s remarks Saturday and gave Cherry a thumbs-up during the broadcast.

In his remarks, Cherry complained that in downtown Toronto “nobody wears a poppy” and in small cities they do.

The point was instead that Trump likely could not have gotten away with any of that in his first two years . And that fact was known to Trump — given media coverage that was more than 90 percent negative , a hostile administrative state , and a censorious culture .
The exact opposite geography characterized the governance of his predecessor — and it showed , from Benghazi to the 2016 systematic subterfuge of the Trump campaign and transition .
In the past three weeks , we ’ ve seen an epidemic of all sorts of progressive exemption .
Christopher Steele , Fusion GPS , Perkins Coie , the Democratic National Committee , the Hillary Clinton campaign , and Hillary Clinton herself all assumed that a likely soon-to-be president Hillary Clinton , a 90+ percent obsequiously loyal press , and their own smug moral superiority could trump facts : To allege that Trump was a treasonous Russian stooge was to prove that he was , and thus such allegations need not be convincing or even sane .
I emphasize “ sane ” because anyone with a laptop , an Internet connection , and a high-school diploma in three days could have mastered the intelligence lingo and the scare capitals of Christopher ’ s Steele ’ s silly dossier format . An eighth-grader could have googled all sorts of Russian names , collated social-media conspiratorial websites , and come up with something far better . “ Dossier ” is a euphemism for Steele ’ s collected adolescent farces .
That is , an amateur sleuth at home in the basement in his proverbial pajamas would probably at least have double-checked to make sure that Michael Cohen ’ s wife was Ukrainian not Russian , or would not have claimed that her father ( who apparently visited Russia once ) was a mysterious leading property developer in Moscow .
In any make-believe scenario , certainly I would not have claimed that Carter Page was in line for a huge multimillion-dollar Russian commission — allegedly a 19 percent stake in Russia ’ s state oil company . Steele did not need to exhaust all the ways to make up titles and names to authenticate gossip and fabrications , given that within a few pages his anonymous tropes grow monotonous : “ former top Russian intelligence officer , ” “ trusted compatriot , ” “ a number of Russian figures , ” “ Trump associate , ” “ Source E , ” “ source close to , ” “ an official close to , ’ ’ “ Kremlin insider , ” etc .
Still , Steele ’ s sinister genius was in knowing that the more outrageously sensational his dossier , the more likely it would be read by the influential — as a titillated Clapper and Brennan knew when they first briefed Obama on the crude and salacious details . And in turn , the more daring Steele became in disguising his legends as fact , the less chance his liberal enablers would ever call him to account . And he was right , from his allegations of naked prostitutes to the golden showers desecrating Obama ’ s former hotel bed .
The former directors of the FBI , the CIA , and National Intelligence , top-ranking officials at the Department of Justice , FISA justices , all the media networks , CNN and MSNBC , and newspapers swallowed Steele ’ s pseudo–Mission Impossible grammarese and page footers in the mumbo-jumbo capital letters “ CONFIDENTIAL/SENSITIVE SOURCE ” because 1 ) they saw his clownish product as useful in ridding themselves of the hated Trump , and 2 ) they knew there would be no downside to being wrong .
They too were all correct , at least for three years and notwithstanding a lot of damage done to the country . When former Obama official John Brennan swore in May 2017 that before the election he ’ d had no direct knowledge of the Steele dossier , he knew that he was lying under oath to Congress , as he had in the past , and also that , as in the past , there would be no consequences for his perfidy . Do not underestimate the power of the current apologies that amount more or less to : “ Okay , you finally exposed our con . Sorry — so can we now move on to the next one ? ”
Consequences ? Not much . Perhaps the walls will close in on James Clapper ’ s cable-television gig . Or a contrite John Brennan might make one last televised accusation that his confidential , top-secret , oh-so-covert source misled him .
Would the right-wing doppelgänger of Jussie Smollett in 2019 Chicago even have tried to pull off a commensurate victimhood caper ?
In a bizarro world , imagine a diminutive , white , straight , MAGA-hatted Trump supporter who was a minor actor in the reality show Ice Road Truckers who was by chance out walking in his MAGA-friendly , left-wing Chicago neighborhood on a frigid night at 2 a.m .
In such an alternative scenario , he would claim that by accident he suddenly encountered two large , gay , black , Farrakhan-hatted toughs , themselves out prowling in search of just such an obnoxious , white , straight , Trump-MAGA-hatted actor .
So of course , on their nocturnal hunting for white prey , the Farrakhan toughs came readily equipped with black shoe polish and a spare hoodie — to both hurt and humiliate our straight , white hero . They naturally attacked , in furious and instant recognition of the “ hit ” show ’ s actor , our twangy Alaskan semi-driver so popular in the black community — yelling something like “ F * * * you , honkey ‘ Ice Road Trucker . ’ ”
But they had no idea of the mettle of our heroic small , white ice-trucking actor , who bravely fought off the gay black racists . And he did so while recording his heroics on his cellphone and without disturbing his sandwich — though he struggled back , bruised , to his apartment with the humiliating hoodie still wrapped around his neck and a few drops of the shoe polish staining his coat .
Perhaps in 1960 , in To Kill a Mockingbird fashion , such a white “ victim ” might well have gotten away with so surreal a con job , the same way that Smollett assumed he most surely would in 2019 , given the left-wing ideological deterrence that shields lying , conning , and fabricating . So Smollett calculated that his wealthy-gay-black privilege would conquer all — and he was right , as he assumed all the indulgences that prior biases had earned in the past . The Kavanaugh hearings , the Covington kids , and the Smollett fraud offer us lessons : The fake victim not only gets off and will always get off , but he usually translates the concoction into profit and sympathetic victimhood .
By any liberal definition , the Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) had long been a fraud . It targeted mainstream conservative “ hate ” groups and non-liberals who did not hate anyone , in a systematic half-century effort to “ make hate pay ” in a country where the number of would-be victims now vastly outnumbers the diminishing number of the truly victimized . Think of old Jimmy Swaggart shakedowns on Sunday mornings , with secular “ virtue ” substituted for God .
SPLC ’ s co-founder Morris Dees and his team rightly understood that once you rail loudly against poverty and racism , especially in the assumed Neanderthal South , where it is “ brave ” to be so progressive , then almost any self-interested act is condoned in the name of higher morality and rationalized ethics — even if that anything includes office harassment , endemic sexism , racial condescension and bias , cronyism , and defrauding millions of liberal small donors in the North into thinking that their donations to Mr. Dees and his operatives serve the poor and the national good and their own sense of virtuous inner selves .
The wonder is not that at last even the embarrassed liberal media called for an accounting of the SPLC , but that it took so long . After all , the fraudulent nature of Dees ’ s hate knock-off industry and the damage it has done to innocent Americans were widely known . But then again , who is not against the old South ? Who does not wish to stamp out Poverty ? Who does not want to use the Law to go after evil ? And who would not wish to focus such efforts in a Center ? Add it all up and we get a half-century-old quite profitable nonprofit : SPLC .
The subtext of the nationwide college-admission scandal was that mostly wealthy white liberals wanted their children to be eventually branded with degrees from liberal elite and near-elite colleges , whose admissions standards they had not met on their own merits . The miscreants did not have either the $ 5 million to $ 10 million or the sort of acceptable grades and test scores to buy their kids admission through the front door , so they did it on the down-low and on the cheap . The assumption was also that it was all an in-house affair of good progressives simply being properly matched up with good progressive universities . Surely such noble ends justify occasionally ignoble ends to achieve them . Why should white liberals in the trenches of social-justice warfare not enjoy the same sort of fast-tracking as upper-middle-class minorities ?
There was certainly no concern by diversity-memo-writing deans that a deplorable truck driver ’ s son in Reno without white privilege but with superior grades and test scores might have lost a meritocratic slot to a rich liberal family ’ s real white privilege . By now , we know that those enjoying such privilege virtue-signal against those who do not enjoy it , either as a psychological mechanism of justifying their own elitism or as a crasser careerist effort to solidify their left-wing fides — or both .
The Steeles , Smolletts , and Dees of the world will continue to con their way to fame and riches while damaging the country — until it no longer pays . And it will no longer pay when we have the collective courage to accurately and matter-of-factly label Steele a pathological liar and fraud ; and Smollett for what he is , a racist con artist ; and Dees for what he has become , a virtue-signaling grifter ; and our elite college system for what it has descended to , a non-meritocratic , cattle-branding operation that fast-tracks its chosen herd into green careerist pastures .

Virtue-signaling is now the refuge of scoundrels.

An eighth-grader could have googled all sorts of Russian names, collated social-media conspiratorial websites, and come up with something far better. “Dossier” is a euphemism for Steele’s collected adolescent farces.

That is, an amateur sleuth at home in the basement in his proverbial pajamas would probably at least have double-checked to make sure that Michael Cohen’s wife was Ukrainian not Russian, or would not have claimed that her father (who apparently visited Russia once) was a mysterious leading property developer in Moscow.

In any make-believe scenario, certainly I would not have claimed that Carter Page was in line for a huge multimillion-dollar Russian commission — allegedly a 19 percent stake in Russia’s state oil company. Steele did not need to exhaust all the ways to make up titles and names to authenticate gossip and fabrications, given that within a few pages his anonymous tropes grow monotonous: “former top Russian intelligence officer,” “trusted compatriot,” “a number of Russian figures,” “Trump associate,” “Source E,” “source close to,” “an official close to,’’ “Kremlin insider,” etc.

Still, Steele’s sinister genius was in knowing that the more outrageously sensational his dossier, the more likely it would be read by the influential — as a titillated Clapper and Brennan knew when they first briefed Obama on the crude and salacious details. And in turn, the more daring Steele became in disguising his legends as fact, the less chance his liberal enablers would ever call him to account. And he was right, from his allegations of naked prostitutes to the golden showers desecrating Obama’s former hotel bed.

The former directors of the FBI, the CIA, and National Intelligence, top-ranking officials at the Department of Justice, FISA justices, all the media networks, CNN and MSNBC, and newspapers swallowed Steele’s pseudo–Mission Impossible grammarese and page footers in the mumbo-jumbo capital letters “CONFIDENTIAL/SENSITIVE SOURCE” because 1) they saw his clownish product as useful in ridding themselves of the hated Trump, and 2) they knew there would be no downside to being wrong.

They too were all correct, at least for three years and notwithstanding a lot of damage done to the country. When former Obama official John Brennan swore in May 2017 that before the election he’d had no direct knowledge of the Steele dossier, he knew that he was lying under oath to Congress, as he had in the past, and also that, as in the past, there would be no consequences for his perfidy. Do not underestimate the power of the current apologies that amount more or less to: “Okay, you finally exposed our con. Sorry — so can we now move on to the next one?”

Consequences? Not much. Perhaps the walls will close in on James Clapper’s cable-television gig. Or a contrite John Brennan might make one last televised accusation that his confidential, top-secret, oh-so-covert source misled him.

Jussie

Would the right-wing doppelgänger of Jussie Smollett in 2019 Chicago even have tried to pull off a commensurate victimhood caper?

In a bizarro world, imagine a diminutive, white, straight, MAGA-hatted Trump supporter who was a minor actor in the reality show Ice Road Truckers who was by chance out walking in his MAGA-friendly, left-wing Chicago neighborhood on a frigid night at 2 a.m.

In such an alternative scenario, he would claim that by accident he suddenly encountered two large, gay, black, Farrakhan-hatted toughs, themselves out prowling in search of just such an obnoxious, white, straight, Trump-MAGA-hatted actor.

So of course, on their nocturnal hunting for white prey, the Farrakhan toughs came readily equipped with black shoe polish and a spare hoodie — to both hurt and humiliate our straight, white hero. They naturally attacked, in furious and instant recognition of the “hit” show’s actor, our twangy Alaskan semi-driver so popular in the black community — yelling something like “F*** you, honkey ‘Ice Road Trucker.’”

But they had no idea of the mettle of our heroic small, white ice-trucking actor, who bravely fought off the gay black racists. And he did so while recording his heroics on his cellphone and without disturbing his sandwich — though he struggled back, bruised, to his apartment with the humiliating hoodie still wrapped around his neck and a few drops of the shoe polish staining his coat.

Perhaps in 1960, in To Kill a Mockingbird fashion, such a white “victim” might well have gotten away with so surreal a con job, the same way that Smollett assumed he most surely would in 2019, given the left-wing ideological deterrence that shields lying, conning, and fabricating. So Smollett calculated that his wealthy-gay-black privilege would conquer all — and he was right, as he assumed all the indulgences that prior biases had earned in the past. The Kavanaugh hearings, the Covington kids, and the Smollett fraud offer us lessons: The fake victim not only gets off and will always get off, but he usually translates the concoction into profit and sympathetic victimhood.

Southern. Poverty. Law. Center.

By any liberal definition, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) had long been a fraud. It targeted mainstream conservative “hate” groups and non-liberals who did not hate anyone, in a systematic half-century effort to “make hate pay” in a country where the number of would-be victims now vastly outnumbers the diminishing number of the truly victimized. Think of old Jimmy Swaggart shakedowns on Sunday mornings, with secular “virtue” substituted for God.

SPLC’s co-founder Morris Dees and his team rightly understood that once you rail loudly against poverty and racism, especially in the assumed Neanderthal South, where it is “brave” to be so progressive, then almost any self-interested act is condoned in the name of higher morality and rationalized ethics — even if that anything includes office harassment, endemic sexism, racial condescension and bias, cronyism, and defrauding millions of liberal small donors in the North into thinking that their donations to Mr. Dees and his operatives serve the poor and the national good and their own sense of virtuous inner selves.

The wonder is not that at last even the embarrassed liberal media called for an accounting of the SPLC, but that it took so long. After all, the fraudulent nature of Dees’s hate knock-off industry and the damage it has done to innocent Americans were widely known. But then again, who is not against the old South? Who does not wish to stamp out Poverty? Who does not want to use the Law to go after evil? And who would not wish to focus such efforts in a Center? Add it all up and we get a half-century-old quite profitable nonprofit: SPLC.

Virtuous Money Instead of SATs

The subtext of the nationwide college-admission scandal was that mostly wealthy white liberals wanted their children to be eventually branded with degrees from liberal elite and near-elite colleges, whose admissions standards they had not met on their own merits. The miscreants did not have either the $5 million to $10 million or the sort of acceptable grades and test scores to buy their kids admission through the front door, so they did it on the down-low and on the cheap. The assumption was also that it was all an in-house affair of good progressives simply being properly matched up with good progressive universities. Surely such noble ends justify occasionally ignoble ends to achieve them. Why should white liberals in the trenches of social-justice warfare not enjoy the same sort of fast-tracking as upper-middle-class minorities?

There was certainly no concern by diversity-memo-writing deans that a deplorable truck driver’s son in Reno without white privilege but with superior grades and test scores might have lost a meritocratic slot to a rich liberal family’s real white privilege. By now, we know that those enjoying such privilege virtue-signal against those who do not enjoy it, either as a psychological mechanism of justifying their own elitism or as a crasser careerist effort to solidify their left-wing fides — or both.

The Steeles, Smolletts, and Dees of the world will continue to con their way to fame and riches while damaging the country — until it no longer pays. And it will no longer pay when we have the collective courage to accurately and matter-of-factly label Steele a pathological liar and fraud; and Smollett for what he is, a racist con artist; and Dees for what he has become, a virtue-signaling grifter; and our elite college system for what it has descended to, a non-meritocratic, cattle-branding operation that fast-tracks its chosen herd into green careerist pastures.

culture,MarketWatch,2,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/census-day-is-wednesday-coronavirus-means-college-towns-will-be-undercounted-2020-03-31,Census Day is Wednesday; coronavirus means college towns will be undercounted,2020-03-31,Dudley L. Poston,"At college dormitories and student apartments across the U.S. , census forms will be piling up — but many run the risk of not being filled in .
The spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. has coincided with the start of data collection for the 2020 census .
This may not affect the process for most people who are self-isolating at home . But for students , it could well affect where and if they are counted – and that could have big implications .
The rapid spread of the virus has meant that most colleges have by now closed their classrooms . Many universities have extended the usual weeklong spring break into a second week . At Texas A & M University , where I am an emeritus professor , online instruction will begin after the spring break and continue through the end of the semester in late April . It is a similar story elsewhere .
As a result , many students may not be returning to their campus residences any time soon .
Census data collected from college students are pretty much the same as for the non-student population . The census questions ask about sex , age , race and Hispanic origin .
Students living off campus also answer questions about whether their household is rented or owned and about their relationships to those living with them .
Census Day is April 1 , but the collection effort has already started . On March 12 , households began receiving mailed invitations from the Census Bureau with instructions about how to respond . This will be followed up by four more reminder letters , through April 27 .
For those who still haven ’ t responded by then , nonresponse follow-ups start on May 13 and continue until July 31 , when census takers visit households they haven ’ t yet heard back from . However , Wilbur Ross , who as Commerce Secretary oversees the Census Bureau , has warned that the dates may change as a result of coronavirus .
Since 1950 , college students have been counted at their “ usual residence ” as of census day . Most attend college away from their family homes and live on or near their campuses , so are not counted at their parents ’ homes .
In private colleges , almost two-thirds live on campus , 20 % off campus and 17 % at home with their parents . In public colleges , around 40 % live on campus , 40 % off campus and 20 % with their parents .
Students living off campus in apartments or other housing may have already received a mailed census form . Those living in on-campus dormitories or housing owned by their university are classified as living in “ group quarters ” — this is similar to residents of nursing homes , seminaries , prisons , hospitals and vocational training facilities .
The on-campus students are counted in one of three different ways . Either a university official completes a single form for all students in the dormitory based on administrative data — the Census Bureau estimates that around 55 % of on-campus students will be counted this way — or students answer the census questions themselves by filling in forms or , in rarer cases , via face-to-face interviews with census workers on April 1 .
So how will the coronavirus impact the collection of census data for college students ?
Just over half of those listed as living in “ group quarters ” do not need to be present when university administrators fill in the forms , so are less likely to be affected .

Dudley L. Poston , Jr. is a sociology professor at Texas A & M University in College Station . This was first published on The Conversation — “ Students could be undercounted in the census as coronavirus closes colleges — here ’ s why that matters ”","At college dormitories and student apartments across the U.S., census forms will be piling up — but many run the risk of not being filled in.

The spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. has coincided with the start of data collection for the 2020 census.

This may not affect the process for most people who are self-isolating at home. But for students, it could well affect where and if they are counted – and that could have big implications.

The rapid spread of the virus has meant that most colleges have by now closed their classrooms. Many universities have extended the usual weeklong spring break into a second week. At Texas A&M University, where I am an emeritus professor, online instruction will begin after the spring break and continue through the end of the semester in late April. It is a similar story elsewhere.

As a result, many students may not be returning to their campus residences any time soon.

Usual residence

Census data collected from college students are pretty much the same as for the non-student population. The census questions ask about sex, age, race and Hispanic origin.

Students living off campus also answer questions about whether their household is rented or owned and about their relationships to those living with them.

Census Day is April 1, but the collection effort has already started. On March 12, households began receiving mailed invitations from the Census Bureau with instructions about how to respond. This will be followed up by four more reminder letters, through April 27.

For those who still haven’t responded by then, nonresponse follow-ups start on May 13 and continue until July 31, when census takers visit households they haven’t yet heard back from. However, Wilbur Ross, who as Commerce Secretary oversees the Census Bureau, has warned that the dates may change as a result of coronavirus.

Since 1950, college students have been counted at their “usual residence” as of census day. Most attend college away from their family homes and live on or near their campuses, so are not counted at their parents’ homes.

In private colleges, almost two-thirds live on campus, 20% off campus and 17% at home with their parents. In public colleges, around 40% live on campus, 40% off campus and 20% with their parents.

Dorm closures

Students living off campus in apartments or other housing may have already received a mailed census form. Those living in on-campus dormitories or housing owned by their university are classified as living in “group quarters” — this is similar to residents of nursing homes, seminaries, prisons, hospitals and vocational training facilities.

The on-campus students are counted in one of three different ways. Either a university official completes a single form for all students in the dormitory based on administrative data — the Census Bureau estimates that around 55% of on-campus students will be counted this way — or students answer the census questions themselves by filling in forms or, in rarer cases, via face-to-face interviews with census workers on April 1.

So how will the coronavirus impact the collection of census data for college students?

Just over half of those listed as living in “group quarters” do not need to be present when university administrators fill in the forms, so are less likely to be affected. But around a third of on-campus students would have been expected to answer the four census questions themselves. Many will no longer be in their dorms — indeed in some universities, dorms will have been closed due to coranavirus before the end of the spring semester. I believe this could affect as many as 2 million full-time students who risk being undercounted in the census.

As for those living off campus, a good number will be staying at their parents’ homes and will not be responding to the census invitations sent to their student address. By the time the “nonresponse follow-ups” begin, the spring semester will be over. As such, the usual window for census responses from students attending classes will be lost owing to the emergence and spread of the COVID-19 disease.

Around a third of the 12 million full-time college students in the U.S. live off campus, adding, perhaps, another 4 million names to the pool of students who could be undercounted as a result of the virus. The fear is many will end up simply not being counted at all, while others will be counted at their parents address.

This undercount of both on-campus and off-campus students could run into several million and have big implications.

Many universities are not located in large metropolitan areas. Texas A&M, where I taught, has an enrollment of over 60,000 students in Brazos County – more than a quarter of the county’s total population of just over 226,000.

College students overwhelm the demography of Brazos County, as they do at many other large universities not located in large metro areas, such as Penn State, Indiana University, University of Kansas, Virginia Tech University, Cornell University, Utah State University, University of Missouri, University of Illinois, University of Michigan and University of Florida.

Funding concerns

Counties with large universities depend heavily on student responses to the decennial census, because the census counts determine the levels of federal funding communities receive.

Every year, the federal government allocates over $1.5 trillion dollars to states, counties, cities and households, based solely on their population counts. The state of Texas alone receives over $100 billion each year based on the size of its population.

The more people counted in a state, the more money received by the state and its counties and cities. Federal funds distributed on the basis of census data include money for medical resources, poverty alleviation, infrastructure projects and emergency relief.

A county with a large university, such as Brazos County with Texas A&M University, especially benefits owing to the large proportion of college students living in the county.

This student advantage could be wiped out as a result of student undercounts, proving a costly setback for university towns entirely and solely resulting from the recent emergence and spread of the COVID-19 disease.

To which I say: R.I.P.-C. (Rest in Political Correctness).

In case you hadn’t seen or heard: Parent company Procter & Gamble launched a Gillette ad campaign blanket-demonizing men as ogres and bullies. Guilt-ridden actors gaze ruefully at their reflections in the mirror — not because they’ve neglected their hygiene, but simply because they’re men. Various scenarios of boys being boors and males being monsters flash across the screen before woke interlocutors show how “real” men behave in nonaggressive, conciliatory, and apologetic ways.

At home and at work, in the boardroom, on the playground, and even while barbecuing in the backyard, Gillette sees nothing but testosterone-driven trouble. Message: Y chromosomes are toxic. The “best a man can get” can no longer be attained without first renouncing oppressive manliness.

Self-improvement must begin with self-flagellation.

A Gillette company statement explained that after “taking a hard look at our past” and “reflecting on the types of men and behaviors we want to celebrate,” officials decided to “actively challenge the stereotypes and expectations of what it means to be a man everywhere you see Gillette.”

But Proctor & Gamble, which bought Gillette in 2005 for $57 billion, doesn’t spell out which part exactly of the 118-year-old company’s past it now rejects.

Or perhaps the mau-mauing marketers have adopted the radical-feminist position that shaving itself is sexist. Is the ultimate goal to undermine the very raison d’être of the $15 billion shave-care industry?

I ask only half in jest. How else to explain this latest suicidal episode of collective consumer-shaming? Gillette’s two-minute, man-bashing missive may have racked up 7 million views on YouTube, but the “dislikes” outnumber “likes” by 4 to 1.

And the reviews are brutal:

“How to destroy your company in 1 minute 48 seconds.”

“Companies attempting to make profit should stick to that.”

“The single male is the most attacked maligned ridiculed and forgotten person in today’s society.”

“You can buy High Quality Razors that are NOT Gillette at the 99 Cents Store with NO lecturing on how to be a Man.”

“I’ll buy P&G products again when I see them release an equivalent ad targeting negative female traits: toxic femininity/paternity fraud/fake accusations . . . doubt that’s going to happen any time soon!”

“So now Gillette thinks that it is the arbiter of what all men should think, say, and watch. Screw Gillette, bought their products for almost 50 years, I will never buy another Gillette product. NEVER!!!”

“Thank you Gillette, I purchased your razors and chopped off my testicles with it. No more toxic masculinity!”

Ouch.

You may remember that P&G, which I unfondly refer to Protest & Grumble, has dipped its sanctimonious toe into social-justice waters before. In 2017, the company tackled identity politics with a video called “The Talk.” The preachy ad stoked fear and hatred of police and perpetuated racial stereotypes of officers lurking around every corner waiting to pounce on innocent black children and teenagers — alienating law-enforcement families across the country and insulting every minority cop to boot.

In our natural environment , humans form coalitions . Coalitions are slightly different from tribes , families , or nations in that those are all groups we are involuntarily born into . Coalitions are the teams we join .
“ Coalitions , ” Tooby explained , “ are sets of individuals interpreted by their members and/or by others as sharing a common abstract identity. ” The coalition instinct is a bundle of “ programs ” that “ enable us and induce us to form , maintain , join , support , recognize , defend , defect from , factionalize , exploit , resist , subordinate , distrust , dislike , oppose and attack coalitions. ” Most animals don ’ t have this instinct , and none have it as finely honed as humans do .
Because coalitions are formed to protect the interests of their members , we have a remarkable ability to forgive behavior when it is done by our teammates and condemn similar behavior when it is done by members of a rival coalition . “ This , ” Tooby said , “ is why group beliefs are free to be so weird . ”
And that brings me to last week . Kanye West , a legendarily skilled self-promoter , had some kind words for Candace Owens , a young African-American conservative activist . “ I love the way Candace Owens thinks , ” the rap mogul tweeted . He then doubled down and praised President Trump .
Many liberals reacted with unbridled moral horror and a seething sense of betrayal . Meanwhile , many avowed conservatives — particularly those who are most ostentatiously in the Trump coalition , and who had spent years ridiculing West — suddenly embraced him as a free-thinking hero .
On one level , this is just another example of the hypocrisy and opportunism that saturates so much of our politics today . But hypocrisy can be an underappreciated sin , because it illuminates a principle : Without a standard to violate , there ’ s no hypocrisy .
The challenge of the coalition instinct is that it blinds us to the violations of our own team while exaggerating the violations of rival coalitions . As George W. Bush once put it , “ Too often , we judge other groups by their worst examples while judging ourselves by our best intentions . ”
Over the weekend , Trump held a rally at the same time as the White House Correspondents ’ Association Dinner . CNN ran a graphic from the latter event ’ s red carpet : “ Trump Skips Event Honoring First Amendment to Rally His Base . ”

It’s more than simple hypocrisy.

Last year, John Tooby, a founder of evolutionary psychology, was asked by the website Edge.org what scientific concept should be more widely known. He argued for something called the “coalition instinct.”

In our natural environment, humans form coalitions. Coalitions are slightly different from tribes, families, or nations in that those are all groups we are involuntarily born into. Coalitions are the teams we join.

“Coalitions,” Tooby explained, “are sets of individuals interpreted by their members and/or by others as sharing a common abstract identity.” The coalition instinct is a bundle of “programs” that “enable us and induce us to form, maintain, join, support, recognize, defend, defect from, factionalize, exploit, resist, subordinate, distrust, dislike, oppose and attack coalitions.” Most animals don’t have this instinct, and none have it as finely honed as humans do.

Because coalitions are formed to protect the interests of their members, we have a remarkable ability to forgive behavior when it is done by our teammates and condemn similar behavior when it is done by members of a rival coalition. “This,” Tooby said, “is why group beliefs are free to be so weird.”

And that brings me to last week. Kanye West, a legendarily skilled self-promoter, had some kind words for Candace Owens, a young African-American conservative activist. “I love the way Candace Owens thinks,” the rap mogul tweeted. He then doubled down and praised President Trump.

Many liberals reacted with unbridled moral horror and a seething sense of betrayal. Meanwhile, many avowed conservatives — particularly those who are most ostentatiously in the Trump coalition, and who had spent years ridiculing West — suddenly embraced him as a free-thinking hero.

On one level, this is just another example of the hypocrisy and opportunism that saturates so much of our politics today. But hypocrisy can be an underappreciated sin, because it illuminates a principle: Without a standard to violate, there’s no hypocrisy.

Indeed, Sanders’ father, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, is understandably angered by the attacks on his daughter. But he is also apparently oblivious to the fact that he routinely denounces “snowflakes” who can’t take a joke (or what he passes off as jokes).

Rather than simple blindness to our hypocritical violations of standards, we’re declaring war on the standards themselves. If this trend continues, we may get less hypocrisy and more open war between coalitions.

Terminated less than two hours after publishing the invective , Ms. Jane was castigated by online commenters and pundits as just another example of a spoiled generation whose sky-high expectations are out of tune with reality .
A study recently released by the polling firm Gallup suggests the episode could be a microcosm of a fundamental divide between the purpose millennials expect to derive from their labor compared to their predecessors .
Conflicts between established firms and recently minted college graduates can be mitigated , the study contends , with a few alterations in how bosses interact with new hires .
One of the survey ’ s most notable findings is workers in the up-and-coming generation are less engaged in their jobs than previous generations , with 55 percent of millennials reporting they are “ checked out ” and lack passion and energy for their work .
Just 29 percent report active engagement in their jobs , the lowest figure among the four generations tracked in the survey , which includes Gen Xers , baby boomers and traditionalists .
The study attributes well-documented job-hopping among millennials to the younger generation ’ s emphasis on finding fulfilling work rather than just high-paying jobs . And their search for meaning at work comes at a cost — about $ 30.5 billion annually to the U.S. economy , according to the Gallup analysis .
Millennials placed opportunities to learn and grow , quality of management , interest in type of work and opportunities for advancement above income when looking for a new job . Eighty-seven percent said personal development is an important characteristic in a job , and fewer millennials than other generations said they would pursue a different line of work for a raise .
At a 21 percent turnover rate last year , millennials were three times more likely than nonmillennials to report changing jobs , and 60 percent said they were currently open to a change in employment , more than 15 points higher than nonmillennials .
What ’ s more , millennials apparently thrive on constant communication and interaction . About 44 percent who said they meet with their manager on a regular basis reported being engaged in their work , compared to a 20 percent engagement rate for those who said they do not meet regularly with their manager .
The increased emphasis on jobs with meaning and the potential for personal development comes as the younger generation eschews conventional societal institutions , such as family and the church , which previously have imparted purpose .
The Gallup survey found just 27 percent of millennials are married , compared to 36 percent of Gen Xers , 48 percent of baby boomers and 65 percent of traditionalists who were married at that stage in their lives .
Additionally , the survey notes that just 55 percent of millennials report having interest in religion , compared to 65 percent of Gen Xers , 70 percent of baby boomers and 75 percent of traditionalists . Twenty-four percent of young people report seldom attending church , and 27 percent never , compared to 27 percent who said they attend once per week .
Greg Jao , vice president of campus engagement for InterVarsity Christian Fellowship , said the capricious employment habits of young people entering the workforce can be interpreted as a winding search for meaning — and the desire for bosses who double as life coaches , the search for a mentor .
“ I don ’ t think , as a generation , they ’ re apathetic or disengaged ; I think they ’ re looking for people who help provide meaning and coherence to what they ’ re experiencing , ” Mr. Jao said . “ And I think if millennials find a job where the goal is just to make a profit for your corporation or have a good paycheck , that ’ s not satisfying to them .
“ When they ’ re connected to a sense of purpose , when someone is investing in their development and engaging with them , they have a high level of engagement , ” he said . “ It makes sense . ”
