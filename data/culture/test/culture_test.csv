Cultivating an indoor plant is thought to have positive effects on mental health and wellbeing, and a snap of a succulent is a sure way to get some Instagram likes. But just how green are your fingers?

From cutting down on ""plant miles"" to reusing plastic pots, British gardeners, botanists and environmental campaigners have shared ways to keep your horticultural hobby sustainable.

Houseplants are on the rise, according to the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), which says average sales in the second half of last year were up 60% on the previous year.

But being a sustainable houseplant buyer is not just about keeping tabs on how a plant is delivered - it is also about what it is grown in.

The main problem for botanist Dr Trevor Dines is the use of peat in composts.

But hang on, don't houseplants clean the air?

Because plants take in CO2 and emit oxygen, it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that they offset any environmental damage by cleaning the air.

PhD research carried out by Curtis Gubb, an environmental consultant, found that plants can remove ""significant amounts"" of CO2 in a room - but how much depends on the type of plant, how many there are, how light the room is and how much water is in the soil.

Probably not . In the 19th century general paresis was one of the most commonly diagnosed mental disorders . Its symptoms included odd social behaviors , impaired judgment , depressed mood and difficulty concentrating . Around the turn of the 20th century , though , we figured what it really was—a form of late-stage syphilis infecting the brain and disrupting its function . A few decades later we discovered a highly effective treatment : penicillin .
Although general paresis is now very rare , its example is still instructive . Any honest researcher will tell you we don ’ t currently have good explanations for most mental disorders . Depression , obsessive-compulsive disorder , schizophrenia—we don ’ t really know how these patterns of disrupted thought , behavior and emotion develop or why they stick around .
Yet the hope remains that , much like with general paresis , we may soon discover the root causes of these illnesses , and this knowledge may tell us how to treat them . An example of this hope can be seen in the popular notion that a “ chemical imbalance ” causes depression . This might turn out to be true , but the truth is we don ’ t know .
Some researchers are starting to think that for many mental disorders , such hope might be based on incorrect assumptions . Instead of having one root cause , as general paresis did , mental disorders might be caused by many mechanisms acting together . These mechanisms might be situated in the brain , but they could also be located in the body and even in the external environment , interacting with one another in a network to create the patterns of distress and dysfunction we currently recognize and label as varieties of mental illness . In this more complex view , patterns such as depression and generalized anxiety arise as tendencies in the human brain-body-environment system . Once the patterns are established , they are hard to change because the network continues to maintain them .
If the causal structures of many mental disorders are complex , how should we seek to illuminate them ? I think recognizing the complexity should push us to rethink how mental illness is studied .
For a start , we should no longer be looking for just one nugget of truth . Rather than a moment of discovery—Alexander Fleming noticing that a mold seemed lethal to bacteria or Archimedes leaping from his bath yelling , “ Eureka ! ” —we should expect a more gradual process of knowledge gathering . Instead of one paradigm-defining discovery , coming to understand mental disorders will probably be much more like a team of paleontologists slowly brushing away dirt to reveal a set of fossils and developing ideas about how all the bones fit together to form a complete dinosaur .
Instead of a single theory—the X theory of depression—we will likely need multiple explanations that each focus on different mechanisms in the network . As hypothetical examples , theories might emerge at a neurological level showing how difficulty experiencing pleasure relates to difficulty sleeping , and at a psychological and ecological level explaining how changes that depressed people make to their environments contribute to the perpetuation of their mood ( the latter example is inspired by this paper ) .
In the paper this essay is loosely based on , which will be published in the journal Theory & Psychology , my Ph.D. supervisor and I propose a structure to help researchers organize the process of discovery . We call it relational analysis of phenomena , or RAP . In RAP , researchers break down disorders into meaningful parts and richly describe these parts at multiple scales of analysis : What is going on in people ’ s brains and bodies ? How does it feel ? What do they do ? How does it change their environment ? How do others react to it ?
Only after this rigorous description process does the investigator try to explain the relationship between some of the parts . The overarching intention is to slowly uncover the mechanisms of the disorder in people ’ s lives . Once we understand enough of the causes at play , we may begin to understand how the dysfunctional pattern of behavior is maintained and how best to effect positive change .
Ultimately some mental disorders might turn out to be like general paresis , with one well- defined cause in the brain . Others might turn out to be distortions in thought , behavior and emotion supported by a network of mechanisms . Most disorders are probably somewhere in the middle , with one or more dominant causes and a plethora of less dominant ones . Because we don ’ t really know , investing in multiple explanatory strategies seems the optimal way forward . The alternative—assuming that mental disorders are all brain disorders—places all our eggs in one basket .
We must develop effective treatments for mental disorders as rapidly as possible . But to do so we first need to be able to explain what is going on .

""Well, they are putting their own interests above the health and welfare of their fellow Americans. That's why we have laws in this country. That's why we have drunk driving laws. That's why we require that people vaccinate their children. Hello?"" she said.

""We have no smoking in restaurants. We have no smoking in hospitals or on airplanes. These are laws to protect not just you, but other people. You really can't depend on people to do the right thing. They have to be forced to do it. It's interesting. Americans are screaming about their independence -- we want our independence, and yet we are a complete nation of sheep. That's why advertising works so well. That's why campaign ads work so well,"" she added.

SOUTH DAKOTA GOV. NOEM VOWS 'WE WON'T BE SOCIAL DISTANCING' AT TRUMP MOUNT RUSHMORE EVENT

Her comments came after South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said she wouldn't force people to wear masks or social distance during President Trump's Fourth of July event at Mount Rushmore.

""In South Dakota, we've told people to focus on personal responsibility,"" she said. ""Every one of them has the opportunity to make a decision that they're comfortable with. So, we will be having celebrations of American independence.""

""We told those folks that have concerns that they can stay home. But those who want to come and join us, we'll be giving out free face masks, if they choose to wear one. But we won't be social distancing.""

Behar suggested that governments should fine people for not wearing masks.

""In West Hollywood, you are now going to be fined $300 if you are walking on the street without a mask. So money talks, and everything else walks, OK? So, maybe that's the way they have to start doing it. Hit people in their pocketbook. If you see people walking around without a mask, you're going to get a fine, just like if you pass a red light -- endangering other people,"" she said.",www.foxnews.com,right,siM2J59fnF1Hx4CA

In an unceremonious execution , MediaDC , the magazine ’ s owner , instructed staff to clear out their desks by the end of the day . According to co-founder John Podhoretz , MediaDC chose to kill the outlet so it could strip-mine its assets and subscriber list . The shuttering of the flagship conservative publication is a deeply unfortunate development in an era when right-leaning media is increasingly obsequious toward Donald Trump and hesitant to criticize his abuses of power . No critic of the president should cheer the Weekly Standard ’ s demise .
To many progressives , Friday ’ s news may seem to be just desserts for a magazine that has long espoused what the left views as noxious policy proposals . And there is no doubt that the Weekly Standard has published more than its share of dubious , specious , and offensive articles . The magazine was closely aligned with the George W. Bush administration and , notoriously , vigorously promoted the catastrophic war in Iraq . Its LGBTQ coverage is reliably atrocious—recall this 2009 classic titled “ The Worst Thing About Gay Marriage , ” which claims without evidence that the “ most profound aspect of marriage ” is “ protecting and controlling the sexuality of the child-bearing sex . ”
I could go on . The magazine is vehemently anti-abortion and anti-trans , pushing offensive falsehoods to mock and degrade transgender people . It has asserted that gay people , like me , who sought the right to marry will demand polyamory next . Writers routinely peddle climate change skepticism and denialism . These articles are dangerous and irresponsible .
There is obviously much to criticize here , and I do not expect liberals to praise a magazine that has derided their beliefs for more than two decades . But there is still nothing to celebrate about its untimely death . Over the last few years , the Weekly Standard has emerged as one of the very few conservative outlets to resist Trumpism , to defend a vision of conservatism that rejects Trump ’ s lawlessness , his authoritarian impulses , and his grotesque embrace of white nationalism . Even if the Never Trump movement represents a small segment of the Republican Party , it remains an important counter to the broader opportunistic conservative embrace of the president . And the Weekly Standard ’ s dissolution will only encourage other right-wing outlets to publish more irresponsible pro-Trump garbage .
That is not to say that every other conservative publication has entirely jettisoned its principles to defend Trump . If you ’ re interested in a reasonable take on , say , the Robert Mueller investigation or Trump ’ s trade wars , you can read David French in National Review or Gabriel Malor in the Federalist . But these voices are ever rarer and lonelier . As I write , the top story on National Review is an absurd defense of Michael Cohen ’ s crimes , which argues that prosecutors are “ twisting campaign-finance law ” to secure his conviction . Its purpose is not to defend Cohen himself , but the criminal acts to which he has confessed and in which he has implicated Trump . The Federalist has posted a similar article , as well as a dark warning that the FBI is “ hiding the truth ” about Michael Flynn , replete with a baseless intimation that Mueller ’ s team might be destroying documents that could exonerate Flynn .
The Federalist appears to be the new model for conservative media , a truly depressing development given its almost unrelenting dishonesty . In May , the Week ’ s Damon Linker wrote a devastating critique of the magazine ’ s many lies about the FBI . The Federalist , Linker wrote , “ is a leading disseminator of pro-Trump conspiracies and up-is-down , funhouse-mirror distortions of Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation into Russian election meddling and potential Trump involvement. ” If anything , that ’ s an understatement . The Federalist led the push to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , who long oversaw the probe . It has claimed , over and over again , that Mueller is leading a partisan “ witch hunt. ” Its authors have decried his “ obsessive pursuit ” of the president and condemned Mueller as “ the clown prince of federal law enforcement. ” At every turn , the Federalist seeks to reinforce Trump ’ s claim that the Mueller probe is illegitimate , if not illegal .
The Weekly Standard , by contrast , has remained profoundly skeptical toward Trump .
Click over to National Review and you ’ ll find a more mixed bag ; French , for instance , writes eloquently and accurately about the investigation and its achievements . But his work is countered by Andrew McCarthy , a fantasist who describes Rosenstein as a “ weasel , ” declared that Mueller “ stacked his staff with partisans , ” wrote that Paul Manafort ’ s conviction was “ good news for President Trump , ” claimed Mueller set up Trump for a “ perjury trap , ” and indicated that the FBI is corrupt . McCarthy also champions the narrative that the Steele dossier “ was the driving force behind the Trump–Russia investigation , ” which is false .
There are plenty more examples . Byron York at the Washington Examiner humiliates himself by lying to help Trump and spreading conspiracy theories about the FBI . Kimberley Strassel , a member of the Wall Street Journal ’ s editorial board , writes toxic pro-Trump nonsense that sometimes contradicts the paper ’ s excellent reporting . I am sure that there are reasonable people at the Examiner and the Journal who are embarrassed by this drivel and wish their outlet did not publish it . But publish they do , aiding Trump ’ s effort to assault the integrity of Mueller , Rosenstein , and the FBI .
The Weekly Standard , by contrast , has remained profoundly skeptical toward Trump . Its reporting on the latest developments in the Russia probe are truthful and perceptive . One of its very last articles , published Friday , celebrates Trump ’ s inability to impede the investigation . There are exceptions—its executive editor , Fred Barnes , has penned some very silly criticisms of the special counsel . But the magazine has not slipped into the Federalist ’ s fever dream . It does not often carry water for the president and does not hesitate to condemn his dumbest ideas . The Weekly Standard is , in short , a conservative magazine rooted in reality .
Those are now in short supply . And while it is apparently untrue that the Weekly Standard bled readers because of its Never Trump stance—its web traffic has reportedly increased—other conservative outlets may view its death as a warning : Stray too far from the Trump party line , and readers will abandon you . We will see more writers like Byron York and Kimberley Strassel , and fewer like Weekly Standard star Haley Byrd , one of the finest congressional reporters working today .
It is healthy to have a magazine that challenges both Democrats and Republicans in good faith—a conservative outlet that progressives can not simply write off as an asinine pro-Trump propaganda machine . And it is encouraging to know that the entire conservative movement has not latched itself to Trump ’ s cult of personality . American conservatism will always be with us , but Trump will not .

The Weekly Standard shut down on Friday after 23 years of publication. In an unceremonious execution, MediaDC, the magazine’s owner, instructed staff to clear out their desks by the end of the day. According to co-founder John Podhoretz, MediaDC chose to kill the outlet so it could strip-mine its assets and subscriber list. The shuttering of the flagship conservative publication is a deeply unfortunate development in an era when right-leaning media is increasingly obsequious toward Donald Trump and hesitant to criticize his abuses of power. No critic of the president should cheer the Weekly Standard’s demise.

To many progressives, Friday’s news may seem to be just desserts for a magazine that has long espoused what the left views as noxious policy proposals. And there is no doubt that the Weekly Standard has published more than its share of dubious, specious, and offensive articles. The magazine was closely aligned with the George W. Bush administration and, notoriously, vigorously promoted the catastrophic war in Iraq. Its LGBTQ coverage is reliably atrocious—recall this 2009 classic titled “The Worst Thing About Gay Marriage,” which claims without evidence that the “most profound aspect of marriage” is “protecting and controlling the sexuality of the child-bearing sex.”

I could go on. The magazine is vehemently anti-abortion and anti-trans, pushing offensive falsehoods to mock and degrade transgender people. It has asserted that gay people, like me, who sought the right to marry will demand polyamory next. Writers routinely peddle climate change skepticism and denialism. These articles are dangerous and irresponsible.

There is obviously much to criticize here, and I do not expect liberals to praise a magazine that has derided their beliefs for more than two decades. But there is still nothing to celebrate about its untimely death. Over the last few years, the Weekly Standard has emerged as one of the very few conservative outlets to resist Trumpism, to defend a vision of conservatism that rejects Trump’s lawlessness, his authoritarian impulses, and his grotesque embrace of white nationalism. Even if the Never Trump movement represents a small segment of the Republican Party, it remains an important counter to the broader opportunistic conservative embrace of the president. And the Weekly Standard’s dissolution will only encourage other right-wing outlets to publish more irresponsible pro-Trump garbage.

That is not to say that every other conservative publication has entirely jettisoned its principles to defend Trump. If you’re interested in a reasonable take on, say, the Robert Mueller investigation or Trump’s trade wars, you can read David French in National Review or Gabriel Malor in the Federalist. But these voices are ever rarer and lonelier. As I write, the top story on National Review is an absurd defense of Michael Cohen’s crimes, which argues that prosecutors are “twisting campaign-finance law” to secure his conviction. Its purpose is not to defend Cohen himself, but the criminal acts to which he has confessed and in which he has implicated Trump. The Federalist has posted a similar article, as well as a dark warning that the FBI is “hiding the truth” about Michael Flynn, replete with a baseless intimation that Mueller’s team might be destroying documents that could exonerate Flynn.

The Federalist appears to be the new model for conservative media, a truly depressing development given its almost unrelenting dishonesty. In May, the Week’s Damon Linker wrote a devastating critique of the magazine’s many lies about the FBI. The Federalist, Linker wrote, “is a leading disseminator of pro-Trump conspiracies and up-is-down, funhouse-mirror distortions of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election meddling and potential Trump involvement.” If anything, that’s an understatement. The Federalist led the push to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who long oversaw the probe. It has claimed, over and over again, that Mueller is leading a partisan “witch hunt.” Its authors have decried his “obsessive pursuit” of the president and condemned Mueller as “the clown prince of federal law enforcement.” At every turn, the Federalist seeks to reinforce Trump’s claim that the Mueller probe is illegitimate, if not illegal.

The Weekly Standard, by contrast, has remained profoundly skeptical toward Trump.

Click over to National Review and you’ll find a more mixed bag; French, for instance, writes eloquently and accurately about the investigation and its achievements. But his work is countered by Andrew McCarthy, a fantasist who describes Rosenstein as a “weasel,” declared that Mueller “stacked his staff with partisans,” wrote that Paul Manafort’s conviction was “good news for President Trump,” claimed Mueller set up Trump for a “perjury trap,” and indicated that the FBI is corrupt. McCarthy also champions the narrative that the Steele dossier “was the driving force behind the Trump–Russia investigation,” which is false.

There are plenty more examples. Byron York at the Washington Examiner humiliates himself by lying to help Trump and spreading conspiracy theories about the FBI. Kimberley Strassel, a member of the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board, writes toxic pro-Trump nonsense that sometimes contradicts the paper’s excellent reporting. I am sure that there are reasonable people at the Examiner and the Journal who are embarrassed by this drivel and wish their outlet did not publish it. But publish they do, aiding Trump’s effort to assault the integrity of Mueller, Rosenstein, and the FBI.

The Weekly Standard, by contrast, has remained profoundly skeptical toward Trump. Its reporting on the latest developments in the Russia probe are truthful and perceptive. One of its very last articles, published Friday, celebrates Trump’s inability to impede the investigation. There are exceptions—its executive editor, Fred Barnes, has penned some very silly criticisms of the special counsel. But the magazine has not slipped into the Federalist’s fever dream. It does not often carry water for the president and does not hesitate to condemn his dumbest ideas. The Weekly Standard is, in short, a conservative magazine rooted in reality.

Those are now in short supply. And while it is apparently untrue that the Weekly Standard bled readers because of its Never Trump stance—its web traffic has reportedly increased—other conservative outlets may view its death as a warning: Stray too far from the Trump party line, and readers will abandon you. We will see more writers like Byron York and Kimberley Strassel, and fewer like Weekly Standard star Haley Byrd, one of the finest congressional reporters working today.

It is healthy to have a magazine that challenges both Democrats and Republicans in good faith—a conservative outlet that progressives cannot simply write off as an asinine pro-Trump propaganda machine. And it is encouraging to know that the entire conservative movement has not latched itself to Trump’s cult of personality. American conservatism will always be with us, but Trump will not. What happens after he is gone? Will the Republican Party indefinitely adopt his cruelty, his know-nothingism, his contempt for the law? Or will a saner faction assert dominance in the GOP? The Weekly Standard made me optimistic for the latter possibility. Its demise suggests that the Trumpists will win out.",www.slate.com,left,01siLGUAxjHtoFED

Sawhill","The COVID-19 pandemic is , among other things , a massive experiment in telecommuting . Up to half of American workers are currently working from home , more than double the fraction who worked from home ( at least occasionally ) in 2017-18 .
Of course , some jobs simply can ’ t be done at home . But the outbreak is accelerating the trend toward telecommuting , possibly for the long term . Until now , telecommuting has been slower to take hold than many predicted when remote work technology first emerged . This inertia probably reflects sticky work cultures as well as a lack of interest from employers in investing in the technology and management practices necessary to operate a tele-workforce .
But the pandemic is forcing these investments in industries where telework is possible , with more people learning how to use remote technology . As a result , we may see a more permanent shift toward telecommuting . As the economist Susan Athey recently told the Washington Post , “ People will change their habits , and some of these habits will stick . There ’ s a lot of things where people are just slowly shifting , and this will accelerate that . ”
There are pros and cons to more telecommuting . On the plus side , workers tend to prefer working from home , it reduces emissions and office costs , and it helps people ( especially women ) balance work and family roles . It may even make us more productive . The downsides : managing a telecommuting staff can be difficult , professional isolation can have negative effects on well-being and career development , and the effects on productivity over the long run and in a scaled-up system are uncertain .
Just under one-third of all workers over the age of 15 say they can work from home , according to Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates from the 2017-18 American Time Use Survey . Many of those who worked from home did not have an official work-from-home arrangement but were instead taking work home with them ( such as at night or over the weekend ) . Only 20 % said they were occasionally paid to work from home , and just 12 % worked from home at least one full day per month .
Those who can telecommute tend to be higher-paid professionals . Just under half of working Americans in the top 25 % of the earnings distribution did any paid work from home in 2017 and 2018 , compared to 4 % in the bottom quartile . About a third of people in the top quartile worked from home at least once a month ; the equivalent number for the bottom quartile was too small a sample to meet BLS ’ s reporting standards .
Telecommuting has skyrocketed this month as many workers across the country have been compelled to stay home , though disparities remain . The following chart , reproduced from a report by our colleagues Richard Reeves and Jonathan Rothwell , shows that higher-income workers are much more likely to be working from home during the pandemic and much less likely to be unable to work at all than lower-income workers .
Overall , these numbers suggest that about half of employed adults are currently working from home , though a recent paper estimates that only a third of jobs can be done entirely from home . Either way , this is a massive shift . Between 2005 and 2015 , the fraction of workers who regularly worked from home increased by only about 2 to 3 percentage points , according to Mas and Pallais ( 2020 ) . Even at that growth rate , telecommuting has been the fastest-growing method of commuting over the last several years . If our new telecommuting culture sticks , the pandemic will have accelerated this trend dramatically . Already , nearly one in five chief financial officers surveyed last week said they planned to keep at least 20 % of their workforce working remotely to cut costs .
Thanks to a few recent experimental studies , we now have good evidence that job applicants place high value on the option to work from home . Mas and Pallais ( 2017 ) gave jobseekers at a U.S. call center the choice of either a standard on-site job or a randomly selected alternative , such as flexible scheduling or the ability to work from home . Among all possible employee-friendly alternatives , working from home was the most valued : the average applicant was willing to take an 8 % hourly wage cut in order to work from home . Similarly , He et al . ( 2019 ) found that jobseekers in China were more likely to apply for , and willing to accept lower pay , for positions that offered remote work .
This isn ’ t the first time a crisis has required a shift toward telecommuting , though it is at an unprecedented scale . In the U.S. , interest in telework spiked following the events of 9/11 and the anthrax attacks that soon followed , which forced several key government offices to close . In a 2004 committee hearing on The Heightened Need for Telework Opportunities in the Post-9/11 World , Congressman Tom Davis stated , “ [ W ] e now realize that telework needs to be an essential component of any continuity of operations plan . Something we once considered advantageous and beneficial has evolved into a cornerstone of emergency preparedness. ” The federal government became a leader in telework under the Obama administration with the Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 , which required federal agencies to develop a telework plan and encourage employees to use it ; however , many federal agencies have rolled back their remote work policies in the last few years .
Many workplaces in Christchurch , New Zealand transitioned to telework after worksites closed during a series of earthquakes between 2010 and 2012 . In a case study of a government agency that transitioned entirely to home-based telework , staff saw many benefits from telework , such as greater motivation to return to work and better work-family balance . As in the COVID-19 outbreak , access to childcare and schools was limited during the disaster , leaving many doing double duty as parents and workers .
Technological limitations could be a barrier to the development of an American tele-workforce . Although Pew estimates that three-quarters of American adults now have high-speed broadband internet service at home , up dramatically from just 1 % in 2000 , many rural areas have been left out of the broadband revolution , and around 14 % of households in urban areas are still digitally disconnected . If there is one piece of critical infrastructure that will provide jobs to those in left-behind places , it is high-speed broadband .
What can we expect from a more permanent shift to telecommuting ? For one thing , it would save money on office space and reduce the time employees spend commuting . Cutting commuting is good both for environmental reasons and because it is one of the least enjoyable activities that many adults engage in on a daily basis .
We may also be more productive working from home . An experiment at a large Chinese travel agency found that call center employees who were randomly assigned to work from home for nine months saw a 13 % performance improvement , partly because they took more calls per minute , but mostly because they took fewer breaks and days off . The agency also saved on office costs . Similarly , when a sample of workers at a large Italian multi-utility company were randomly assigned to set their own place and time of work one day per week for nine months , they were more productive and took fewer leave days than their office-bound coworkers .
These benefits may not scale up outside of a trial , or at least not in all workplaces . Successful telework experiments have generally taken place in workplaces that have had time to prepare for a switch to remote work and where performance is based on clear , measurable outputs , such as calls per minute . This requires a different management approach from what many companies are used to . Managers can ’ t measure teleworkers ’ performance by how much time they spend in the office—though this is not a great performance metric for other employees , either .
Another concern is that employees differ greatly in how well they adapt to working from home , so this will not be the best option for all employees . Providing a mix of home- and office-based work options could lead to better outcomes . After the telework experiment at the Chinese travel agency , the company allowed employees to sort themselves into either home or office work . The measured performance gains for the work-from-home group nearly doubled under self-sorting . This was primarily because employees who had not worked well at home self-sorted back into the office , while the most productive teleworkers stayed home .
Some research has also found that switching to remote work improves retention , consistent with other evidence that people who work from home have higher job satisfaction on average . This is good from both an employer and an employee perspective , since greater retention saves on hiring and training costs . For employees , working from home can reduce work-family conflict , especially for women . An analysis of the German Socio-Economic Panel found that working from home reduces the gender gap in working hours and monthly earnings because teleworking mothers are able to increase their work hours .
Productivity boosts aren ’ t guaranteed , especially if employee performance is difficult to monitor . Using the staggered rollout of the U.S. Patent Office ’ s telework program as a natural experiment , one study found a spike in procrastination among patent examiners who were assigned to telework , resulting in more rushed reviews that required greater revisions later on . A few high-profile companies , such as Yahoo and Reddit , have publicly moved away from remote work .
Many of the downsides of remote work apply to extensive rather than occasional telecommuting . Professional isolation from telecommuting can have a negative impact on well-being . After the earthquakes in Christchurch , many employees reported that they combatted isolation by occasionally teleworking in the same location as co-workers . Co-working from home is obviously at odds with the current need for social distancing to slow the spread of the coronavirus , but under more normal circumstances , telework appears to be most successful when alternated with face-to-face contact . For instance , face-to-face groups perform better than virtual groups in creative teamwork tasks , but working away from the office can improve focus on individualized tasks .
It can be a problem when some members of an organization or a team can telework and others can not . Having more coworkers who telework can result in lower performance , higher absenteeism , and higher turnover among those who do not telework , particularly if team members have very limited face-to-face time . This suggests that telework may create some additional work for onsite workers ( for instance , if they have to serve as liaisons for their teleworking colleagues ) , or that social interaction at work is important for morale . ( We should note that the experiment at the Chinese travel agency did not find evidence of such spillover effects . )
Finally , telecommuting may have a negative impact on employees ’ career development . In the experiment at the Chinese travel agency , teleworkers were less likely to be promoted than equally productive employees who worked in the office . This is probably because managers have better perceptions of employees who are present in the office . In the Christchurch case study , team leaders tended to think that employees were less productive under telework , in contrast to employees ’ self-reports that telework enhanced their concentration , motivation , and productivity .
A new study of employees at a U.S. technology services company found that extensive telecommuting is associated with fewer promotions and lower salary growth , but that telecommuters who have face-to-face time with managers or who perform supplemental work outside of normal hours have better outcomes . Supplemental work signals dedication to the job but also blurs the boundary between work and home life , contributing to pressure to be “ always on . ”
COVID-19 may permanently change the way many of us work . At present , shifting as many people as possible to home-based telework is a necessary response to a terrible crisis . In the post-pandemic world , it may stay with us as a popular practice that , if done well , can improve job satisfaction , raise productivity , reduce emissions , and spread work to more remote regions .","The COVID-19 pandemic is, among other things, a massive experiment in telecommuting.

Telework in a disaster

This isn’t the first time a crisis has required a shift toward telecommuting, though it is at an unprecedented scale.

The need for speed: more broadband

Technological limitations could be a barrier to the development of an American tele-workforce. Although Pew estimates that three-quarters of American adults now have high-speed broadband internet service at home, up dramatically from just 1% in 2000, many rural areas have been left out of the broadband revolution, and around 14% of households in urban areas are still digitally disconnected.

More telework: the pros…

Williamson, David Harsanyi, Zachary Evans, Robert Verbruggen","The presidency has become the biggest prize in the culture war , and that doesn ’ t lead to unity .
‘ For many years , ” Donald Trump tweeted Sunday afternoon , “ our country has been divided , angry and untrusting . Many say it will never change , the hatred is too deep . IT WILL CHANGE ! ! ! ! ”
As persuasive as the ALL CAPS are , I have my doubts .
Put aside Trump ’ s specific shortcomings for the moment . The presidency has become ill-suited to the task of unifying the country , because the presidency has become the biggest prize and totem in the culture war . Like the religious wars between Catholics and Protestants in England , if one side controls the throne , it is seen as an insult and threat to the other . And whoever holds the throne is seen as a kind of personal Protector of the Realm .
The political parties have been utterly complicit in the process . Exploiting social media and other technologies , Republicans and Democrats shape their messages around the assumption that they — and they alone — have legitimate ownership of America ’ s authentic best self . That ’ s why whichever party is out of power promises to “ take back America ” — as if the other side were foreign invaders .
Barack Obama was elected in 2008 in no small part to fulfill the promise of his 2004 Democratic Convention keynote address : to banish the slicing and dicing of America into Red States and Blue States .
The colors of the electoral map may have been smudged and scrambled over the last eight years , but the underlying polarization Obama inherited from George W. Bush only intensified on his watch . Trump will be the third president in a row to promise to unite the country , and he will almost certainly be the third in a row to fail .
The ugly squabble between the president-elect and Representative John Lewis ( D. , Ga. ) over the weekend offers a glimpse into how bad things will get .
Lewis earned his icon status on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody Sunday in Selma , Ala . But over the years , he ’ s traded some of his moral capital for partisan chips , insinuating that only the Democratic party has ownership of the civil-rights era and its victories , despite the fact that a higher share of Republicans voted for the Civil Rights Act than Democrats . Indeed , the goons who cracked Lewis ’ s skull on the Edmund Pettus Bridge were acting at the behest of a Democratic governor and Democratic local officials . Even the bridge was named after a Democrat .
In 2008 , Lewis saw nothing wrong with comparing Senator John McCain ( R. , Ariz. ) to the segregationist Alabama governor George Wallace , adding : “ Senator McCain and Governor Palin are sowing the seeds of hatred and division. ” He did it again in 2012 , insinuating that voting for Mitt Romney might lead America to “ go back ” to the days of fire hoses , police dogs , and church bombings .
This was not idealism , but poisonous cynicism , and it helped contribute to the feelings of resentment that were so essential to Trump ’ s victory . Now , Lewis is going further still , refusing to attend Trump ’ s inauguration and arguing that Trump can not be a legitimate president because of Russian meddling in the election . Lewis may have reason to believe that Trump did not win fair and square , but questioning Trump ’ s legitimacy is exactly what the Russians probably wanted from the beginning : to undermine Western and American faith and confidence in democracy . ( It ’ s a sign of Lewis ’ s partisanship that he also boycotted George W. Bush ’ s first inauguration because he didn ’ t think Bush was legitimate either . )
The Democrats will stop baiting Trump when he shows he can refuse the bait .
Of course , Trump made things worse . He attacked Lewis , saying the congressman “ should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. ” instead of “ falsely complaining about the election results. ” Predictably , Democrats rallied behind Lewis , who ’ s basically the party ’ s living saint , and they ’ re already fundraising off the spectacle .
The Democrats will stop baiting Trump when he shows he can refuse the bait . Which means they won ’ t stop .
There ’ s an almost literary quality to Trump ’ s insecurities ; he craves respect more than almost anything else , and yet respect remains agonizingly elusive — in part because he takes everything too personally .

The presidency has become the biggest prize in the culture war, and that doesn’t lead to unity.

‘For many years,” Donald Trump tweeted Sunday afternoon, “our country has been divided, angry and untrusting. Many say it will never change, the hatred is too deep. IT WILL CHANGE!!!!”

As persuasive as the ALL CAPS are, I have my doubts.

Put aside Trump’s specific shortcomings for the moment. The presidency has become ill-suited to the task of unifying the country, because the presidency has become the biggest prize and totem in the culture war. Like the religious wars between Catholics and Protestants in England, if one side controls the throne, it is seen as an insult and threat to the other. And whoever holds the throne is seen as a kind of personal Protector of the Realm.

The political parties have been utterly complicit in the process. Exploiting social media and other technologies, Republicans and Democrats shape their messages around the assumption that they — and they alone — have legitimate ownership of America’s authentic best self. That’s why whichever party is out of power promises to “take back America” — as if the other side were foreign invaders.

Barack Obama was elected in 2008 in no small part to fulfill the promise of his 2004 Democratic Convention keynote address: to banish the slicing and dicing of America into Red States and Blue States.

The colors of the electoral map may have been smudged and scrambled over the last eight years, but the underlying polarization Obama inherited from George W. Bush only intensified on his watch. Trump will be the third president in a row to promise to unite the country, and he will almost certainly be the third in a row to fail.

The ugly squabble between the president-elect and Representative John Lewis (D., Ga.) over the weekend offers a glimpse into how bad things will get.

Lewis earned his icon status on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody Sunday in Selma, Ala. But over the years, he’s traded some of his moral capital for partisan chips, insinuating that only the Democratic party has ownership of the civil-rights era and its victories, despite the fact that a higher share of Republicans voted for the Civil Rights Act than Democrats. Indeed, the goons who cracked Lewis’s skull on the Edmund Pettus Bridge were acting at the behest of a Democratic governor and Democratic local officials. Even the bridge was named after a Democrat.

In 2008, Lewis saw nothing wrong with comparing Senator John McCain (R., Ariz.) to the segregationist Alabama governor George Wallace, adding: “Senator McCain and Governor Palin are sowing the seeds of hatred and division.” He did it again in 2012, insinuating that voting for Mitt Romney might lead America to “go back” to the days of fire hoses, police dogs, and church bombings.

This was not idealism, but poisonous cynicism, and it helped contribute to the feelings of resentment that were so essential to Trump’s victory. Now, Lewis is going further still, refusing to attend Trump’s inauguration and arguing that Trump cannot be a legitimate president because of Russian meddling in the election. Lewis may have reason to believe that Trump did not win fair and square, but questioning Trump’s legitimacy is exactly what the Russians probably wanted from the beginning: to undermine Western and American faith and confidence in democracy. (It’s a sign of Lewis’s partisanship that he also boycotted George W. Bush’s first inauguration because he didn’t think Bush was legitimate either.)

The Democrats will stop baiting Trump when he shows he can refuse the bait.

Of course, Trump made things worse. He attacked Lewis, saying the congressman “should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S.” instead of “falsely complaining about the election results.” Predictably, Democrats rallied behind Lewis, who’s basically the party’s living saint, and they’re already fundraising off the spectacle.

The Democrats will stop baiting Trump when he shows he can refuse the bait. Which means they won’t stop.

There’s an almost literary quality to Trump’s insecurities; he craves respect more than almost anything else, and yet respect remains agonizingly elusive — in part because he takes everything too personally.

The environmentalist 's apology : how Michael Shellenberger unsettled some of his prominent supporters
Few things engage a particular subset of conservative media more than an environmentalist having an apparent change of heart and dumping all over the “ climate scare ” .

The environmentalist's apology: how Michael Shellenberger unsettled some of his prominent supporters

`` There are studies showing that strong emotional reactions are the biggest motivating force for people to share content online , and that anger is the most motivating emotion , more than any positive emotion , '' says Joel Penney , an assistant professor at the school of communications and media at Montclair State University .
Penney studies the relationship between people 's use of social media and their own social and political advocacy .
`` I would n't say that [ sharing outrage is ] necessarily different from sharing what you agree with , '' he told me . `` Often , people are sharing their collective outrage , particularly when circulating partisan news coverage about these incidents that essentially say , 'Here 's something we should all get outraged about . ' ''
Our need to share parts of ourselves and define our identities makes outrage appealing to us . Sharing something we disagree with — and stating as much — is one of the easiest ways to prove we are n't racist or bigoted or sexist or whatever ; we do n't even have to explain ourselves . Clicking on that Facebook thumb is all we need to do .
How the internet makes it easy for outrage to proliferate
It 's not like the ideas of outrage and backlash are new , but social media has given everyone with a smartphone a platform to share information and broadcast their opinions online . In the pre-internet age , you needed to talk to people face to face ( or at least on the phone ) to tell them about some news story that was bothering you . You had to read a newspaper to find out about a racist Star Wars boycott or a controversy over disposable coffee cups . But the internet has closed the spaces between us , making it easier to find and share news and ideas , for better and for worse .
The Star Wars boycott or Starbucks ' red cup of anti-Christmas were delivered right to our phones and fingertips . They originated with extreme racists and extreme Christian evangelists — people who might not necessarily be in our social circles . Social media compressed the gaps between their world and ours , making their calls to action more urgent , more immediate , and our responses just as quick . Their outrage provided an opportunity to for us to feel outrage as well .
The media gets a huge payoff by fueling outrage , whether it 's authentic or not
The shameful truth of journalism is that every news outlet thrives on clicks . In recent years , those clicks have dovetailed with the prominence of social media — especially Facebook — so most news outlets ( ███.com included ) began to regularly cover stuff that people will want to share on those platforms . Part of that strategy means fueling outrage , because it 's so powerful .
It 's why the outlets that covered # BoycottStarWarsVII made it seem a lot larger than the handful of individuals who got the hashtag trending , and why the outlets that covered the Starbucks red cup story made it seem like Christians all over the country were angry when really it was only evangelical fundamentalists who were actually mad . Both of those stories gained the majority of their momentum because people disagreed with them and wanted to say so publicly , and the media jumped at the chance to cover their dismay .
In November , writer Parker Molloy published a startling ( albeit slightly entertaining ) post on Medium about how she 'd tweeted something snarky about a lipstick called `` Underage Red '' — and with some unsolicited help from the media , her tweet eventually ballooned into a corporate complaint .
Went shopping for some makeup . How on earth is this a lipstick color ? pic.twitter.com/mJanAVKlAd — Parker Molloy ( @ ParkerMolloy ) March 15 , 2015
`` One outlet picks it up ( in this case , it was Business Insider ) … by the time it ’ s picked up by another outlet ( in this case , Fortune ) , the classification has been upped from 'disgusted ' to 'outraged , ' '' Molloy wrote , detailing the media centipede that gobbled up her story , digested it , and then vomited out another version — and then another and another .
These outlets saw someone `` upset '' over a shade of lipstick and decided to put a searing spotlight on the `` conflict . '' It did n't matter that Molloy herself insisted she was n't offended ; what mattered was that the story could be spun as controversial , as something that people could fight about , making it a story that people would likely click on and share online . Eventually the story grew so big that Kat Von D , the woman who owns the lipstick company that makes `` Underage Red , '' released an official comment in response to the `` outrage . ''
`` In other words , they are putting out these 'outrage ' pieces because they know that they will get a lot of attention , which is key for advertising revenue , '' Penney told me . `` Twitter is typically the target because it 's a very public site compared to other social media platforms — you do n't have to be a part of a user 's network in order to see their tweets , so it 's very common for activists and bloggers to mine Twitter feeds for ammunition , for something to use against the other side. ``
Penney explains that it 's actually a savvy thing to do . `` I would n't necessarily label this a cynical business strategy , '' he says . `` The people who own and operate these partisan news outlets seem to be ideologically in line with what they 're putting out , so they probably see what they 're doing as helping their cause , while raking in online advertising dollars in the process . ''
Whether it 's about race in Star Wars or the way Christianity is portrayed by the media , not everything is easily settled by shouting and sharing . Unfortunately , this mentality is creeping into cultural criticism , because the types of reviews that people tend to gravitate toward are the ones that either lionize a piece of art beyond recognition or mercilessly destroy it ( Hocus Pocus is still awful though ) . The idea of liking something just fine or finding something mildly disagreeable does n't really fit into the schematics of online outrage . And here 's an even scarier thought : If artists are taking their cues from the criticism and reactions they read online , they risk flattening their art to match a profile they know will elicit strong reactions , at all costs .
Therein is the most disheartening aspect of our rush to proclaim that we 're Good by denouncing something as Bad . We often do n't care about the fixing the wrong or adding to the conversation ; all we see is an opportunity to affirm some version of ourselves by taking a side and making a scene . And in doing so , we 've figured out a way to dismantle complex ideas into simplistic , easily digestible things that , in the end , are ultimately disposable — until the next fight comes around .","When #BoycottStarWarsVII began trending on Twitter in October, Lord Humungus (@DarklyEnlighten, before the account was suspended) was smiling in some deep pocket of the internet. Humungus created #BoycottStarWarsVII to bemoan the number of nonwhite actors with roles in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the latest installment of the franchise.

""Reverse outrage"" is the righteous internet backlash against an initial statement or display of outrage — think a boycott or a call to action — however founded or unfounded it may be. It works like a tsunami, starting with an initial shock that's followed by quiet as the bluster and bombast retreats like a low tide, then returns in a megaton surge, often aided by the media.

Social media has given us an avenue to prove our worthiness. And we've turned it into an express lane.

In Humungus's case, he created his hashtag with fellow Twitter user @genophilia. Their idiotic, racist stuff looked like other idiotic, racist stuff on the internet. But with a little persistence, #BoycottStarWarVII eventually began popping up on sites like Reddit and trending in people's Twitter timelines. Then, with some reinforcement from the media, this tsunami became inescapable.

""Racists Urge Boycott of ‘Star Wars: Episode VII’ Over Black Lead, and Most of Them Love Trump,"" the Daily Beast reported.

Even though the #BoycottStarWarsVII hashtag was the work of just a few racist, ignorant trolls, there were exponentially more people who were quick to show how good they were by pounding their chests into the vast abyss of the internet.

This behavior wasn't limited to the Star Wars boycott. In 2015, controversy erupted over Starbucks' holiday cups because a few people declared the cups were anti-Christian.

There was also a group of students at Duke who didn't want to read Fun Home because they found it pornographic.

The only reason we heard about these fights was reverse outrage. And in 2015, reverse outrage became a new reality of our online lives.

Reverse outrage is powerful because it helps define us

The entire basis of Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter is the idea that every little thing we share defines us — both to the people following our accounts and to ourselves. When we share something, it's because we want people to know that we like Rihanna, or that we think we look pretty good in a particular photo. Each of us curates what we post so that everything falls in line with whatever image or reputation we're trying to uphold. This also applies to outrage; the stuff that makes us angry — racists, bigots, SeaWorld, eggplant — is as telling as the stuff that makes us happy.

""There are studies showing that strong emotional reactions are the biggest motivating force for people to share content online, and that anger is the most motivating emotion, more than any positive emotion,"" says Joel Penney, an assistant professor at the school of communications and media at Montclair State University.

Penney studies the relationship between people's use of social media and their own social and political advocacy.

""I wouldn't say that [sharing outrage is] necessarily different from sharing what you agree with,"" he told me. ""Often, people are sharing their collective outrage, particularly when circulating partisan news coverage about these incidents that essentially say, 'Here's something we should all get outraged about.'""

Our need to share parts of ourselves and define our identities makes outrage appealing to us. Sharing something we disagree with — and stating as much — is one of the easiest ways to prove we aren't racist or bigoted or sexist or whatever; we don't even have to explain ourselves. Clicking on that Facebook thumb is all we need to do.

How the internet makes it easy for outrage to proliferate

It's not like the ideas of outrage and backlash are new, but social media has given everyone with a smartphone a platform to share information and broadcast their opinions online. In the pre-internet age, you needed to talk to people face to face (or at least on the phone) to tell them about some news story that was bothering you. You had to read a newspaper to find out about a racist Star Wars boycott or a controversy over disposable coffee cups. But the internet has closed the spaces between us, making it easier to find and share news and ideas, for better and for worse.

The Star Wars boycott or Starbucks' red cup of anti-Christmas were delivered right to our phones and fingertips. They originated with extreme racists and extreme Christian evangelists — people who might not necessarily be in our social circles. Social media compressed the gaps between their world and ours, making their calls to action more urgent, more immediate, and our responses just as quick. Their outrage provided an opportunity to for us to feel outrage as well.

The media gets a huge payoff by fueling outrage, whether it's authentic or not

The shameful truth of journalism is that every news outlet thrives on clicks. In recent years, those clicks have dovetailed with the prominence of social media — especially Facebook — so most news outlets (Vox.com included) began to regularly cover stuff that people will want to share on those platforms. Part of that strategy means fueling outrage, because it's so powerful.

It's why the outlets that covered #BoycottStarWarsVII made it seem a lot larger than the handful of individuals who got the hashtag trending, and why the outlets that covered the Starbucks red cup story made it seem like Christians all over the country were angry when really it was only evangelical fundamentalists who were actually mad. Both of those stories gained the majority of their momentum because people disagreed with them and wanted to say so publicly, and the media jumped at the chance to cover their dismay.

In November, writer Parker Molloy published a startling (albeit slightly entertaining) post on Medium about how she'd tweeted something snarky about a lipstick called ""Underage Red"" — and with some unsolicited help from the media, her tweet eventually ballooned into a corporate complaint.

Went shopping for some makeup. How on earth is this a lipstick color? pic.twitter.com/mJanAVKlAd — Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) March 15, 2015

""One outlet picks it up (in this case, it was Business Insider) … by the time it’s picked up by another outlet (in this case, Fortune), the classification has been upped from 'disgusted' to 'outraged,'"" Molloy wrote, detailing the media centipede that gobbled up her story, digested it, and then vomited out another version — and then another and another.

These outlets saw someone ""upset"" over a shade of lipstick and decided to put a searing spotlight on the ""conflict."" It didn't matter that Molloy herself insisted she wasn't offended; what mattered was that the story could be spun as controversial, as something that people could fight about, making it a story that people would likely click on and share online. Eventually the story grew so big that Kat Von D, the woman who owns the lipstick company that makes ""Underage Red,"" released an official comment in response to the ""outrage.""

""In other words, they are putting out these 'outrage' pieces because they know that they will get a lot of attention, which is key for advertising revenue,"" Penney told me. ""Twitter is typically the target because it's a very public site compared to other social media platforms — you don't have to be a part of a user's network in order to see their tweets, so it's very common for activists and bloggers to mine Twitter feeds for ammunition, for something to use against the other side. ""

Penney explains that it's actually a savvy thing to do. ""I wouldn't necessarily label this a cynical business strategy,"" he says. ""The people who own and operate these partisan news outlets seem to be ideologically in line with what they're putting out, so they probably see what they're doing as helping their cause, while raking in online advertising dollars in the process.""

Outrage is easy — and dangerous

Whether it's about race in Star Wars or the way Christianity is portrayed by the media, not everything is easily settled by shouting and sharing. Unfortunately, this mentality is creeping into cultural criticism, because the types of reviews that people tend to gravitate toward are the ones that either lionize a piece of art beyond recognition or mercilessly destroy it (Hocus Pocus is still awful though). The idea of liking something just fine or finding something mildly disagreeable doesn't really fit into the schematics of online outrage. And here's an even scarier thought: If artists are taking their cues from the criticism and reactions they read online, they risk flattening their art to match a profile they know will elicit strong reactions, at all costs.

Therein is the most disheartening aspect of our rush to proclaim that we're Good by denouncing something as Bad. We often don't care about the fixing the wrong or adding to the conversation; all we see is an opportunity to affirm some version of ourselves by taking a side and making a scene. And in doing so, we've figured out a way to dismantle complex ideas into simplistic, easily digestible things that, in the end, are ultimately disposable — until the next fight comes around.",www.vox.com,left,BZczBgGObI1qbwvJ

Or it was the gothic malcontent with the switchblade and the swagger . Either way , what made these high-status alphas so terrifying was that they came at you in numbers . They travelled in packs . This has been our narrative , in the stories we tell—from Henry Bowers in Stephen King ’ s It , to Biff Tannen in Back to the Future , to Billy Hargrove in Stranger Things , central-casting bullies attracted followers . They belonged .
As any grade eight schoolgirl who ’ s been bullied off Instagram can attest , this stereotype still holds . But when it comes to the most dangerous and sociopathic actors , the opposite is true . All three of the young mass shooters who terrorized the United States in recent nationally reported scenes of carnage—Connor Betts in Dayton , Ohio ; Patrick Crusius in El Paso , Texas ; and Santino William Legan in Gilroy , California—acted alone . The old image of the bully as locker-room alpha or goth leader now seems passé . Often , it is the kid who used to be the fictional protagonist , the social outcast , the member of the Losers Club from It , whose face now appears on our screens with a nightmarish empty stare .
These recent shooters fit a similar profile . They were outsiders , all seemingly socially awkward , who became emboldened through fringe online communities that act as mutual-support societies for violent malcontents . This phenomenon is fuelled by hate , guns , mental illness and ideological extremism . But there is another factor at play here , too . Before a youth makes the decision to murder , before the gun is stashed in his backpack , before his state of mental health is so deteriorated that he commits the unthinkable , what has happened to him ? It ’ s important to remember that these murders are also , in most cases , suicides .
In his 2008 article School Shooting as a Culturally Enforced Way of Expressing Suicidal Hostile Intentions , psychiatrist Antonio Preti summarized existing research on school shootings to the effect that “ suicidal intent was found in most cases for which there was detailed information on the assailants. ” The research also indicated that “ among students , homicide perpetrators were more than twice as likely as their victims to have been bullied by their peers , and also were described as loners and poorly integrated into school activities…In most of the ascertained cases , perpetrators prepared a well-organized plan , and often communicated details about it to acquaintances or friends , who failed to report threats because they did not consider them serious or were embarrassed or ignorant of where to go for help . The most antisocial peers sometimes approved the plan , sharing the same anger against the stated target of violence . ”
Preti ’ s article predated the rise of some of the most notorious web sites—including 8chan , which was shut down this week after several mass shootings were linked to its users . But the nihilistic phenomenon these killers represent predates modern social-media culture . Indeed , it predates digital communication , and even broadcast media more generally .
In 1897 , French sociologist Émile Durkheim noted that suicides overall were increasing in society . But there were differences among the affected populations , he noticed . Men were more likely than women to commit suicide—though the chances decreased if the man was married and had children . Durkheim observed that social groups that were more religious exhibited lower suicide rates . ( Catholics were less likely to commit suicide than Protestants , for instance . ) Durkheim also noted that many people who killed themselves were young , and that the prevalence of such suicides was linked to their level of social integration : When a person felt little sense of connection or belonging , he could be led to question the value of his existence and end his life .
Durkheim labelled this form of suicide as “ anomic ” ( others being “ egoistic , ” “ altruistic ” and “ fatalistic ” ) . Durkheim believed that these feelings of anomie assert themselves with special force at moments when society is undergoing social , political or economic upheaval—especially if such upheavals result in immediate and severe changes to everyday life .
Durkheim came from a long line of devout Jews . His father , grandfather and great grandfather had all been rabbis . And so even though he chose to pursue an academic career , his experiences taught him to respect the mental and psychological support that religious communities supplied to their members , as well as the role that ritual plays in the regulation of social behavior . In the absence of such regulation , he believed , individuals and even whole societies were at risk of falling into a state of anomie , whereby common values and meanings fall by the wayside . The resulting void doesn ’ t provide people with a sense of freedom , but rather rootlessness and despair .
Durkheim ’ s thesis has largely stood the test of time , though other scholars have reformulated it for modern audiences . In his 1955 book The Sane Society , for instance , Erich Fromm wrote that , “ in the nineteenth century , the problem was that God is dead . In the twentieth century , the problem is that man is dead. ” He described the twentieth century as a period of “ schizoid-self alienation , ” and worried that men would destroy “ their world and themselves because they can not stand any longer the boredom of a meaningless life . ”
In her 2004 book Rampage : The Social Roots of School Shootings , Katherine Newman described findings gleaned from over 100 interviews in Arkansas and Kentucky . The male adolescent shooters at the center of her study , she concluded , “ shared a belief that demonstrating strength by planned attacks on their respective institutions with ( too ) easily available guns would somehow mitigate their unbearable feelings of inadequacy as males and bring longed-for respect from peers. ” Ten years later , in a 2014 article titled The Socioemotional Foundations of Suicide : A Microsociological View of Durkheim ’ s Suicide , sociologists Seth Abrutyn and Anna Mueller set out to update Durkheim ’ s theory about how social integration and moral regulation affect suicidality . “ The greater degree to which individuals feel they have failed to meet expectations and others fail to ‘ reintegrate ’ them , the greater the feelings of shame and , therefore , anomie , ” they concluded . “ The risk of suicidal thoughts , attempts , and completions , in addition to violent aggression toward specific or random others , is a positive function of the intensity , persistence , and pervasiveness of identity , role , or status-based shame and anomie . ”
Writing in the 1890s , Durkheim was highly conscious of all the ways that industrial capitalism corroded traditional forms of social regulation in society , often at the expense of religious—and even governmental—authorities . ( “ Depuis un siècle , en effet , le progrès économique a principalement consisté à affranchir les relations industrielles de toute réglementation . Jusqu ’ à des temps récents , tout un système de pouvoirs moraux avait pour fonction de les discipliner…En effet , la religion a perdu la plus grande partie de son Empire . Le pouvoir gouvernemental , au lieu d ’ être le régulateur de la vie économique , en est devenu l ’ instrument et le serviteur. ” ) But if he were to visit us in 2019 , Durkheim would be surprised at the extent to which once-dominant ideas with no connection to economics have been marginalized as regressive and hateful—such as nationalism , patriotism and even masculinity .
This is one reason why so many people now feel unmoored . As Canadian science fiction writer Donald Kingsbury eloquently put it in his novel Courtship Rite , “ Tradition is a set of solutions for which we have forgotten the problems . Throw away the solution and you get the problem back. ” Faith in god , country and manhood might be seen as regressive by modern lights . But insofar as they were holding back male anomie , we perhaps neglected to consider what damage would be done if we discredited those ideas before finding replacements .
In the history of our species , there has never been ( to the knowledge of modern scholars ) a human society that did not express belief in some sort of supernatural force—which suggests that we are programmed by a need to believe in something bigger than ourselves . Sociologist Max Weber warned in 1919 that “ science deals with facts . It can ’ t tell us what to do or what ’ s important. ” This is to say that while the scientific revolution did a good job of helping us explain and harness the natural world , it did nothing to fill the god-shaped hole that Blaise Pascal identified in the 17th-century : “ What else does this craving , and this helplessness , proclaim but that there was once in man a true happiness , of which all that now remains is the empty print and trace ? This he tries in vain to fill with everything around him , seeking in things that are not there the help he can not find in those that are , though none can help , since this infinite abyss can be filled only with an infinite and immutable object ; in other words by God himself . ”
If we are to resign ourselves to the fact that “ God himself ” isn ’ t going to intercede any time soon , then we are left with the ordinary tools of policy , such as Robert Putnam outlined in his famous 2000 book , Bowling Alone : The Collapse and Revival of the American Community , in which he pointed to the value of “ the connections among individuals ’ social networks and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from them. ” These connections could be strengthened , Putnam argued , through improved civics education , more extra-curricular activities for youth , smaller schools , family-oriented workplaces , a more enlightened approach to urbanism , technology that reinforces rather than replaces face-to-face interaction , as well as a decentralization of political power . These recommendations were written 19 years ago , before Facebook , Twitter or 4chan existed . It would be interesting to know how he would revise his recommendations now that we have a better appreciation for the massive effects of digital culture on our social dynamics .
In a 2017 article I wrote , titled Towards a Theory of Virtual Sentiments , I argued that real-time empathy generation often requires some degree of eye contact—which is hard to generate through online interaction . Moreover , it is shockingly easy to get worked up into a rage when you are interacting with an online avatar of a person you have never met . Simply put , the more we physically see each other , the less likely we are to be awful to each other . As Louis CK said in an interview about youth and technology , “ They don ’ t look at people when they talk to them and they don ’ t build empathy . You know , kids are mean , and it ’ s cause they ’ re trying it out . They look at a kid and they go , ‘ You ’ re fat , ’ and then they see the kid ’ s face scrunch up and they go , ‘ Oh , that doesn ’ t feel good to make a person do that. ’ But when they write ‘ You ’ re fat ’ [ online ] then they just go , ‘ Mmm , that was fun , I like that. ’ ” Even putting aside the extreme cases of forums that cater to homicidal shooters , I remain unconvinced that any community that exists primarily in online form can be a force for long-term good . Perhaps more time offline is a good start for anyone seeking to enhance “ the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness . ”
Do we need a new nationalism ? A new religion ? What common human project can we collectively embrace that gives a sense of mission to everyone , regardless of skin color , religion , economic class or ideology ? It would be presumptuous for me to suggest I have the answers . All I know is that men who see human life as meaningless are symptoms of a larger sense of anomie that , in less dramatic and destructive form , increasingly grips us all .

The male adolescent shooters at the center of her study, she concluded, “shared a belief that demonstrating strength by planned attacks on their respective institutions with (too) easily available guns would somehow mitigate their unbearable feelings of inadequacy as males and bring longed-for respect from peers.” Ten years later, in a 2014 article titled The Socioemotional Foundations of Suicide: A Microsociological View of Durkheim’s Suicide, sociologists Seth Abrutyn and Anna Mueller set out to update Durkheim’s theory about how social integration and moral regulation affect suicidality. “The greater degree to which individuals feel they have failed to meet expectations and others fail to ‘reintegrate’ them, the greater the feelings of shame and, therefore, anomie,” they concluded. “The risk of suicidal thoughts, attempts, and completions, in addition to violent aggression toward specific or random others, is a positive function of the intensity, persistence, and pervasiveness of identity, role, or status-based shame and anomie.”

Writing in the 1890s, Durkheim was highly conscious of all the ways that industrial capitalism corroded traditional forms of social regulation in society, often at the expense of religious—and even governmental—authorities. (“Depuis un siècle, en effet, le progrès économique a principalement consisté à affranchir les relations industrielles de toute réglementation. Jusqu’à des temps récents, tout un système de pouvoirs moraux avait pour fonction de les discipliner…En effet, la religion a perdu la plus grande partie de son Empire. Le pouvoir gouvernemental, au lieu d’être le régulateur de la vie économique, en est devenu l’instrument et le serviteur.”) But if he were to visit us in 2019, Durkheim would be surprised at the extent to which once-dominant ideas with no connection to economics have been marginalized as regressive and hateful—such as nationalism, patriotism and even masculinity.

This is one reason why so many people now feel unmoored. As Canadian science fiction writer Donald Kingsbury eloquently put it in his novel Courtship Rite, “Tradition is a set of solutions for which we have forgotten the problems. Throw away the solution and you get the problem back.” Faith in god, country and manhood might be seen as regressive by modern lights. But insofar as they were holding back male anomie, we perhaps neglected to consider what damage would be done if we discredited those ideas before finding replacements.

In the history of our species, there has never been (to the knowledge of modern scholars) a human society that did not express belief in some sort of supernatural force—which suggests that we are programmed by a need to believe in something bigger than ourselves. Sociologist Max Weber warned in 1919 that “science deals with facts. It can’t tell us what to do or what’s important.” This is to say that while the scientific revolution did a good job of helping us explain and harness the natural world, it did nothing to fill the god-shaped hole that Blaise Pascal identified in the 17th-century: “What else does this craving, and this helplessness, proclaim but that there was once in man a true happiness, of which all that now remains is the empty print and trace? This he tries in vain to fill with everything around him, seeking in things that are not there the help he cannot find in those that are, though none can help, since this infinite abyss can be filled only with an infinite and immutable object; in other words by God himself.”

If we are to resign ourselves to the fact that “God himself” isn’t going to intercede any time soon, then we are left with the ordinary tools of policy, such as Robert Putnam outlined in his famous 2000 book, Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of the American Community, in which he pointed to the value of “the connections among individuals’ social networks and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from them.” These connections could be strengthened, Putnam argued, through improved civics education, more extra-curricular activities for youth, smaller schools, family-oriented workplaces, a more enlightened approach to urbanism, technology that reinforces rather than replaces face-to-face interaction, as well as a decentralization of political power. These recommendations were written 19 years ago, before Facebook, Twitter or 4chan existed. It would be interesting to know how he would revise his recommendations now that we have a better appreciation for the massive effects of digital culture on our social dynamics.

In a 2017 article I wrote, titled Towards a Theory of Virtual Sentiments, I argued that real-time empathy generation often requires some degree of eye contact—which is hard to generate through online interaction. Moreover, it is shockingly easy to get worked up into a rage when you are interacting with an online avatar of a person you have never met. Simply put, the more we physically see each other, the less likely we are to be awful to each other. As Louis CK said in an interview about youth and technology, “They don’t look at people when they talk to them and they don’t build empathy. You know, kids are mean, and it’s cause they’re trying it out. They look at a kid and they go, ‘You’re fat,’ and then they see the kid’s face scrunch up and they go, ‘Oh, that doesn’t feel good to make a person do that.’ But when they write ‘You’re fat’ [online] then they just go, ‘Mmm, that was fun, I like that.’” Even putting aside the extreme cases of forums that cater to homicidal shooters, I remain unconvinced that any community that exists primarily in online form can be a force for long-term good. Perhaps more time offline is a good start for anyone seeking to enhance “the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness.”

Do we need a new nationalism? A new religion? What common human project can we collectively embrace that gives a sense of mission to everyone, regardless of skin color, religion, economic class or ideology? It would be presumptuous for me to suggest I have the answers. All I know is that men who see human life as meaningless are symptoms of a larger sense of anomie that, in less dramatic and destructive form, increasingly grips us all.

We’re in a fight over basic values.

It is time that our society acknowledge a sad truth: America is currently fighting its Second Civil War.

In fact, with the obvious and enormous exception of attitudes toward slavery, Americans are more divided morally, ideologically, and politically today than they were during the Civil War. For that reason, just as the Great War came to be known as the First World War once there was a Second World War, the Civil War will become known as the First Civil War when more Americans come to regard the current battle as the Second Civil War.

This Second Civil War, fortunately, differs in one other critically important way: It has thus far been largely non-violent. But given the increasing left-wing violence such as riots, the violent taking over of college presidents’ offices, and the illegal occupation of state capitols, non-violence is not guaranteed to be a permanent characteristic of the Second Civil War.

There are those on both the left and the right who call for American “unity.” But these calls are either naïve or disingenuous. Unity was possible between the Right and liberals, but not between the Right and the Left.

Liberalism – which was anti-Left, pro-American, and deeply committed to the Judeo-Christian foundations of America, regarded the melting pot as the American ideal, fought for free speech for its opponents, regarded Western civilization as the greatest moral and artistic human achievement, and viewed the celebration of racial identity as racism – is now affirmed almost exclusively on the right and among a handful of people who don’t call themselves conservative.

The Left, however, is opposed to every one of those core principles of liberalism.

Like the Left in every other country, the Left in America sees America as essentially a racist, xenophobic, colonialist, imperialist, war-mongering, money-worshipping, moronically religious nation.

Just as in Western Europe, the Left in America seeks to erase America’s Judeo-Christian foundations. The melting pot is regarded as nothing more than an anti-black, anti-Muslim, anti-Hispanic meme. The Left suppresses free speech, wherever possible, for those who oppose it, labeling all non-Left speech “hate speech.” To cite only one example, if you think Shakespeare was the greatest playwright, or Bach the greatest composer, you are a proponent of Dead White European Males and therefore racist.

Without any important value held in common, how can there be unity between Left and non-Left? Obviously, there cannot.

Helicopter and now “snowplow” parenting. Enough. Here’s a case for free-range childhood.

Now we have “snowplow parents,” who rush ahead of their children and clear out all obstacles in their paths. It’s an article of the “How We Live Now” genre that exists so that New York Times readers can deplore each other and themselves.

The article touched on the now infamous college-admissions scandal, in which parents were caught Photoshopping their useless offspring’s faces onto stock photos of student athletes. Others were found to be paying off admissions consultants and proctors to doctor school records or feed their kids answers to test questions.

But the practice extended into the earliest days of childhood, in which parents intervened constantly. And this left their children crippled.

I’ve had doubts about free-range childhood, at least where I live, though. And they are only intensifying as my kids get closer to the age when they should be put outside. Skenazy has encouraged me to overcome the doubts and send my kids on little missions around their neighborhood. That will come, but will anyone else allow them to be out there?

Government has a role in dealing with the challenges of globalization and automation, but these movements cannot fill the holes in our souls.

America is sick. Just about everybody recognizes it, and we didn’t need two more mass shootings to convince anybody of anything. Most Americans think the country is on the wrong track, despite a roaring economy. You can blame Donald Trump, but Americans have been unsatisfied with the country’s direction for most of the last two decades.

Amazingly, given the level of partisan animosity in this country, both sides see the problem much the same way: The country is disordered by selfishness, alienation, variously defined bigotries, inequality, and a lack of social solidarity. Even more bizarre, both the Right and the Left have very similar solutions in mind.

Both are very wrong.

On the right, a growing number of intellectuals see nationalism as the cure for what ails us. The Hudson Institute’s Christopher DeMuth argues that nationalism is an idea whose time has come (again) because it reminds us “of our dependence on one another.” He likens it to the religious “Great Awakenings” of the past. Catholic writer Sohrab Ahmari wants an awakening that delivers “order,” “social cohesion,” and policies aimed at the “Highest Good” — in the classical philosophic sense (summum bonum).

On the left, listen closely to the proselytizers of the new socialist awakening. You’ll notice that it has less to do with economics than a yearning for more a cooperative and egalitarian alternative to selfish capitalism, driven not by nationalism but government — which is “the only thing we all belong to” as a video at the 2012 Democratic Convention asserted.

The vocabulary they use is different, but the underlying indictment of the status quo is remarkably similar. Nationalism is an obscenity to the Left, and socialism is anathema for the Right, but a nationalizing or centralizing spirit suffuses both sides.

Team Trump’s “economic nationalism,” has echoes of the “economic patriotism” of Senator Elizabeth Warren, who speaks with an almost Trumpian passion when she talks about how the “system is rigged.” A slew of wannabe GOP successors to Trump, with Senator Josh Hawley in the lead, seem desperate to craft a new “daddy state” industrial policy for right-wingers.

One of the reasons social media is so toxic is that it is a nationalizing force; it makes us feel as if strangers thousands of miles away are neighbors — and we get mad when neighbors are living the “wrong” way. Cable news does the same thing, just with better production values, plucking anecdotal stories and making them part of a “national conversation.” The problem is that there’s no such thing as an actual national conversation.

What we need are communities, and the idea of national community is a myth. Conversation is done face to face and person to person, and so is community.

The nationalization of culture drives centralized government, and centralized government saps communities of mutual dependence. It renders the rich ecosystem between the individual and the state obsolete, yet it is that habitat where humans actually live and find meaning.

The nationalizing movements aim to fill the void left by the decline or disappearance not just of industrial jobs, but of the healthy communities that grew up around the factories.

Government has a role in dealing with the challenges of globalization and automation, but these movements cannot fill the holes in our souls. And the prospect that either side is eager to try only raises the stakes for the other. This is how nationalization fuels winner-take-all polarization. When each tribe seeks to impose a one-size-fits-all “Highest Good” on all Americans, the paranoid belief that “all we hold dear” is at stake at the ballot box metastasizes for many.

And, for a few, ballots give way to bullets.

President Trump on Friday approved a spending bill that would , among other provisions , increase the minimum legal age for tobacco purchases from 18 to 21 . The bill also covers e-cigarette products , which have received great scrutiny amid a youth vaping epidemic and an outbreak of vaping-related lung illnesses linked to an additive in some THC products .
President Trump approved a spending bill that would , among other provisions , increase the minimum legal age for tobacco purchases from 18 to 21 .
Among people born between 2000 and 2019 , boosting the tobacco minimum age of legal access ( MLA ) to 21 nationwide would yield about 50,000 fewer lung-cancer deaths , 223,000 fewer premature deaths and 4.2 million fewer lost years of life , the report projected . These results likely won ’ t be observed for at least 30 years , the authors added , “ assuming that the MLA increase occurs now . ”
Research supports the potential public-health benefits of raising this age threshold , at least for traditional tobacco products . A 2015 Institute of Medicine report sponsored by the Food and Drug Administration estimated that raising tobacco products ’ MLA to 21 would result in a 12 % drop in tobacco-use prevalence by the time teenagers at that time were adults , though its models didn ’ t account for e-cigarette use .
Raising the minimum age to 21 “ will begin to change access to tobacco products from social sources , ” the report suggested , making folks who can legally buy tobacco less likely to be in high-school students ’ social networks . Almost nine in 10 cigarette smokers had their first cigarette by age 18 , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Nineteen states and Washington , D.C. , have increased their minimum tobacco age to 21 , says the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids , a nonprofit advocacy organization . Some 530 localities have done the same . Needham , Mass. , which raised its tobacco legal age to 21 in 2005 , saw a bigger drop in youth smoking between 2006 and 2010 than there was in surrounding communities without such a restriction , according to a 2015 study published in the journal Tobacco Control .

The law “ will not bring about meaningful change , but will lead to the tobacco companies falsely claiming that the youth e-cigarette problem has been solved even as it continues to grow worse every day , ” he said .
Indeed , some health experts have suggested that tobacco companies backing the new law did so to avoid future scrutiny and regulation of their industry , NPR reported .
Juul , which controls about 75 % of the American e-cigarette market , did not immediately return a ███ request for comment on this criticism . The company last month stopped selling its popular mint-flavored products ; it had earlier halted sales of its fruit-flavored e-cigarettes .
E-cigarette use among high schoolers increased by 78 % between 2017 and 2018 , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and increased by 48 % among middle schoolers .

The law “will not bring about meaningful change, but will lead to the tobacco companies falsely claiming that the youth e-cigarette problem has been solved even as it continues to grow worse every day,” he said.

Indeed, some health experts have suggested that tobacco companies backing the new law did so to avoid future scrutiny and regulation of their industry, NPR reported.

Juul, which controls about 75% of the American e-cigarette market, did not immediately return a MarketWatch request for comment on this criticism. The company last month stopped selling its popular mint-flavored products; it had earlier halted sales of its fruit-flavored e-cigarettes.

E-cigarette use among high schoolers increased by 78% between 2017 and 2018, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and increased by 48% among middle schoolers. Recent e-cigarette use has driven the overall increases in youth tobacco use, the CDC says.",www.marketwatch.com,right,y33kjk3OaclK4Stk

Today, there are legal questions, as before: campaign-finance violations, for example. But also the underlying facts: a president who pays off porn stars and Playboy bunnies, and lies and lies.

Where is a sense of shame? Where is a sense of honor? In late 1995, Colin Powell gave some remarks, explaining why he wasn’t running for president. In the course of those remarks, he made some points about America — including a certain lack of shame. Shame needed to be brought back to our society, Powell said.

This thrilled a lot of us conservatives, back then.

Did you see this news article from earlier this week? “Four Japanese basketball players on Monday apologized for bringing ‘disgrace’ to their nation after they were kicked out of the Asian Games for paying prostitutes for sex.”

One of the players said, “I deeply apologize for our careless act that has brought disgrace not only on basketball fans but also on all of the Japanese people.” The head of the delegation said, “I just feel a sense of shame.”

Smollett , a 36-year-old black , openly gay actor on the hip-hop TV drama “ Empire , ” ignited a firestorm on social media by telling police on Jan. 29 that two apparent supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump struck him , put a noose around his neck and poured bleach over him .
“ Felony criminal charges have been approved by @ CookCountySAO against Jussie Smollett for Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report . Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest , ” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter .
The New York Times , citing unnamed law enforcement sources , said Smollett had been indicted by an Illinois grand jury that found probable cause that he had staged the attack .
“ Like any other citizen , Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence , particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information , both true and false , has been repeatedly leaked .

Smollett, a 36-year-old black, openly gay actor on the hip-hop TV drama “Empire,” ignited a firestorm on social media by telling police on Jan. 29 that two apparent supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump struck him, put a noose around his neck and poured bleach over him.

“Felony criminal charges have been approved by @CookCountySAO against Jussie Smollett for Disorderly Conduct / Filing a False Police Report. Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter.

The New York Times, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, said Smollett had been indicted by an Illinois grand jury that found probable cause that he had staged the attack.

“Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense,” Smollett’s attorneys, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, said in a written statement.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, which produces “Empire,” declined comment when told earlier on Wednesday that Smollett had been formally named a suspect in the case.

Earlier in the day, the studio said: “Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional on set and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show.”

‘MAGA COUNTRY’

Smollett has stood by his account even as police failed to find any evidence of an assault and suspicions grew on social media that it was a hoax.

Last week, Chicago police questioned two Nigerian brothers recognized from surveillance footage near the scene of the supposed attack, but released them two days later, without charge, in light of what investigators said was new evidence.

TV station CBS Chicago on Wednesday released a videotape it had obtained showing the two brothers buying a red hat and ski masks from a hardware store days before the alleged attack.

The brainchild of Lakshmi , who moved to the United States from India at the age of four , Taste the Nation has the stated premise of being a show about immigrants : from the Mexican American community in El Paso , Texas ; to the Gullah Geechee people of South Carolina ; to the Indian immigrants who 've created the Little India in Jackson Heights , Queens ; to the German descendents in Milwaukee ; to the Peruvian enclave of Paterson , New Jersey ; and more .

Perhaps the most heavy-handed suggestion of food 's ability to unite comes in the first episode of Taste the Nation . Lakshmi sits with the owner of a restaurant in El Paso , Texas as Border Patrol helicopters circle overhead . His restaurant has long been staffed by workers who cross from Juarez daily , but he supports President Trump . Lakshmi refrains from pushing back too hard on his politics , which means that their conversation does n't go far past acknowledging how much the restaurant needs these workers and their food .

Shows like Taste the Nation , which use food to go deeper into migration , colonization , and assimilation , prompt people to think more deeply about the ways our cultural histories shape what we eat .

`` Go home , Jane ! '' yelled Bernice Lauredan , 28 , an activist with Tampa Dream Defenders . `` You are not welcome here . ''
More than a thousand miles away , Dennis Maurice Dumpson has been helping to organize strategy sessions with activists in Philadelphia , a city where Democrats hope protests will ignite massive voter turnout and propel presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden to victory in battleground Pennsylvania . But Dumpson , 36 , has no intention of mobilizing his growing list of followers to help Biden or any other politician . The most he intends to do for the Democrats , if anything , is cast a reluctant vote .
`` We 've seen enough to know how this goes and how this plays out , '' Dumpson said . `` I 'm tired of going into the same old room with the same old council member and the same state representative who have the same old mind-set . It 's why we keep getting the same old stuff . ''
Floyd ’ s killing in Minneapolis last month ignited protests in more than 750 U.S. cities , an avalanche of outrage that echoes the moral overtones of the 1960s civil rights movement , with the added power of drawing support from participants of all races in every corner of the country .
The uprising is also a potential boon for Democrats , inspiring thousands of new grass-roots organizers , many in their 20s and 30s and new to activism , just as the party seeks to mobilize young voters and other core liberals to defeat President Trump and retake the Senate . Many of the country ’ s top Democrats , including former president Barack Obama , have exhorted the activists to channel their energy toward the election .
But the Democrats have so far failed to tap into the newly emerging protest movement , even turning off some activists who see early outreach efforts as hollow gestures , according to interviews with more than a dozen organizers who have been leading protests across the country in recent weeks . Many said they remain deeply skeptical of the traditional political system and the Democratic Party , which they said has a history of promising change and falling short .
Although the activists agreed that Trump is a racist who should be defeated , many said they think neither party is equipped to address the roots of the fury in America ’ s streets . That , they said , would require a willingness to embrace changes that have historically been deemed too radical by many mainstream politicians , such as defunding police forces that routinely target black communities and rolling back drug laws that lead to mass incarceration . Biden and Democratic lawmakers have said they don ’ t support defunding police , though they have backed redirecting funding for public safety programs .
“ I don ’ t believe just having a ‘ D ’ by your name immediately makes you the savior , ” said Lauredan , the organizer who shouted down the Tampa mayor . “ And I would say that for every Democrat I know , we have to look at solutions that are really going to invest in our communities . . . . We need to change not just the surface-level issues . ”
Organizers noted that while some Democrats have made their presence known at various protests , activists are wary of political leaders who seek to capitalize on the outrage without giving a full hearing to their message .
“ [ Politicians are ] kneeling but not meeting with the organizations that are responsible for moving voters on the ground , ” said Alicia Garza , principal for Black Futures Lab and co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement . “ When October comes along , they ’ re going to say can we have you on our [ Instagram ] live ? Can we have you come to this fundraiser ? And October is too late to start courting people . October is the time to begin capitalizing on the relationships you ’ ve made — not to start building them . ”
Obama took note of the emerging tension between activists and Democratic political leaders earlier this month , when he urged protesters to get involved in politics .
“ I ’ ve been hearing a little bit of chatter in the Internet about voting versus protest , politics and participation versus civil disobedience and direct action , ” Obama said . “ This is not an either-or — this is a both-and . To bring about real change , we both have to highlight a problem and make people in power uncomfortable . ”
But so far , efforts by some leading Democrats have done little to bring the movement into the political fold .
Some activists , for instance , were turned off by the rollout last week of the Justice in Policing Act . Co-sponsored by more than 200 Democrats in both houses of Congress , the bill would ban neck restraints like the one that killed Floyd and no-knock warrants like the one that led to the death of Breonna Taylor . It also would make it easier to hold officers accountable for misconduct in civil and criminal courts .
But Abdul-Aliy Muhammad , a Philadelphia-based activist , had trouble seeing past the kente cloth . The Democratic leadership walked out in stoles made of the brightly colored fabric of Ghanaian origin . They also knelt for 8 minutes , 46 seconds — the amount of time Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin spent with his knee on Floyd ’ s neck .
Muhammad saw it as a performative photo op , specifically because leaders intimated it may take months — and a new president as well as a Senate majority — for the bill to be passed .
“ It was uber-pandering . It was like super-pander , or pandering on steroids , ” Muhammad said . “ You ’ re doing it to show some faux solidarity with black people and you failed miserably . ”
House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn ( D-S.C. ) , the highest-ranking African American in House leadership , said he was irked by the criticism of the moment . He said he also worries that demonstrators energized by Floyd ’ s death are too quick to criticize people who seek to enact social change in a different way — or at a different pace .
“ We all have a role to play , ” he said . “ My role is to pass legislation and count votes . You can ’ t reject my role because it doesn ’ t go as fast as you want it . ”
“ What does it get us for anybody to be insulting to Nancy Pelosi , ” Clyburn added later , referring to the House speaker who , along with other lawmakers , appeared in kente cloth . “ We asked Nancy Pelosi to identify with us , to carry water for us . She made a gesture that identifies with us and we insult her . ”
Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California , who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination and is under consideration to be Biden ’ s running mate , said she shares the activists ’ concerns that change will come too slowly .
“ But my optimism overrides that fear , because we are seeing people take to the streets who seemingly have nothing in common , but have this issue in common , and are unifying and coalition-building around this issue , ” she said .
Other top Democrats have looked for ways to tap into the movement .
Biden has expressed solidarity with the protesters — vowing to combat systemic discrimination , meeting with the Floyd family and saying in a video message to his funeral that America must “ turn away from racism that stings at our very soul . ”
A Biden spokesman , Jamal Brown , said the former vice president is sympathetic with the frustration of activists as they combat racism in policing , housing , education and other aspects of society . “ He understands these problems won ’ t change overnight , but [ it ’ s ] not worth giving up the fight , ” Brown said , adding that Biden has worked for civil rights causes over the course of his career .
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) , whose bid to take the majority in his chamber relies on mobilizing voters in a handful of races targeting vulnerable Republican members , said he has been in touch with some grass-roots organizations . He said many activists know that change requires their engagement in the country ’ s political debates .
“ They understand you have to accept the idea that you have to push Washington around , ” Schumer said .
Schumer added that he has sought advice from Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) , whose two unsuccessful presidential campaigns were able to excite a movement of young activists .
“ What are the things that we can get to motivate people ? ” Schumer said he asked Sanders , though he would not detail more of their conversation .
Nina Turner , a chief surrogate for Sanders ’ s presidential campaign , said those conversations seem redundant . The senator ’ s bid for the presidency identified many of the policies activists are asking lawmakers to enact .
“ There are already a list of things . There ’ s no need to study , no need to have a task force ; the ideas are already out there , ” she said . “ You ’ re either going to do universal health care or you ’ re not . You ’ re going to legalize marijuana , take it off of Schedule I , or you ’ re not . You ’ re either going to have a $ 15 minimum wage or you ’ re not . ”
Tension around the pace of progress and disappointment in establishment politicians was also a hallmark of the civil rights protests of the past , said Matthew F. Delmont , a Dartmouth College professor who focuses on African American history . Malcolm X warned people that neither Democrats nor Republicans had adequate plans to help black Americans in his “ Ballot or the Bullet ” speech . And Martin Luther King Jr. called on his followers to not accept political stalling .
“ It ’ s always come down to the question of time , ” Delmont said . “ Dr . King had so many great sermons or speeches about time and how that group of activists just could not wait . People feel the same way today . You can ’ t wait for Biden to get elected . You can ’ t wait four years . We can ’ t wait on politicians if we want to see these things change . ”
But while civil rights protesters of the 1960s were able to direct pressure on the Kennedy and Johnson administrations to win landmark legislation rolling back state-sponsored discrimination , today ’ s protesters face the challenge of seeking changes that extend beyond the political realm — rooting out racism baked in at all levels of society over the course of centuries , or what Delmont called the “ unresolved policy issues from the 1960s movement . ”
Some activists mobilized by Floyd ’ s death say they would have a hard time overcoming long-standing disappointment with Democrats .
Marjaan Sirdar , a Minneapolis activist who lives a few blocks from where Floyd was killed , noted that his city has seen years of Democratic leadership that promoted initiatives to advance racial equality . At the same time , Sirdar said , the city was not working hard enough to root out racism in its police department .
“ The Democrats created this problem , ” Sirdar said . “ Anybody can pay for a $ 200 , $ 300 training and learn how to sound anti-racist . They learn the language of anti-racism and they just become better gatekeepers of white supremacy . ”
Michele Rayner-Goolsby , a lawyer who has advised activists and is now running for a Florida state House seat , said she understands demonstrators ’ distrust of many politicians but thinks a Biden election would be a step forward , particularly if he selects a black woman to be vice president .
“ I hear the concerns of folks , and I don ’ t want to discount those concerns , but I also think we can ’ t get lost or caught up in the minutiae of he doesn ’ t do this or he doesn ’ t do that . We literally have an anti-black president in office right now . ”
Stephanie Keene , a Philadelphia organizer who wants to abolish the police and prison system , said many who are inspired to protest this year see politicians as part of the problem .
“ Some people are like I ’ m . . . done accepting what the Democratic Party has offered us . It ’ s not getting better , ” said Keene , 37 . “ This current moment is a reflection of the United States ’ inability to meet any of the demands black people have put forward . I wish they would stop holding black people responsible for the failures of the Democratic Party . Why aren ’ t y ’ all responsible for not giving us a candidate worth voting for ? ”
Dumpson , the author and activist from Philadelphia , said he , too , is wary of politicians “ not really wanting to really sit down with us ” but is not yet ready to check out of the political system entirely . That is why , he said , Biden will have his vote but not his enthusiasm .","But before Jane Castor could speak, she was greeted by an organizer brandishing a bullhorn.

""Go home, Jane!"" yelled Bernice Lauredan, 28, an activist with Tampa Dream Defenders. ""You are not welcome here.""

“[Politicians are] kneeling but not meeting with the organizations that are responsible for moving voters on the ground,” said Alicia Garza, principal for Black Futures Lab and co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement. “When October comes along, they’re going to say can we have you on our [Instagram] live? Can we have you come to this fundraiser? And October is too late to start courting people. October is the time to begin capitalizing on the relationships you’ve made — not to start building them.”

Obama took note of the emerging tension between activists and Democratic political leaders earlier this month, when he urged protesters to get involved in politics.

“I’ve been hearing a little bit of chatter in the Internet about voting versus protest, politics and participation versus civil disobedience and direct action,” Obama said. “This is not an either-or — this is a both-and. To bring about real change, we both have to highlight a problem and make people in power uncomfortable.”

But so far, efforts by some leading Democrats have done little to bring the movement into the political fold.

Some activists, for instance, were turned off by the rollout last week of the Justice in Policing Act. Co-sponsored by more than 200 Democrats in both houses of Congress, the bill would ban neck restraints like the one that killed Floyd and no-knock warrants like the one that led to the death of Breonna Taylor. It also would make it easier to hold officers accountable for misconduct in civil and criminal courts.

But Abdul-Aliy Muhammad, a Philadelphia-based activist, had trouble seeing past the kente cloth. The Democratic leadership walked out in stoles made of the brightly colored fabric of Ghanaian origin. They also knelt for 8 minutes, 46 seconds — the amount of time Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin spent with his knee on Floyd’s neck.

Muhammad saw it as a performative photo op, specifically because leaders intimated it may take months — and a new president as well as a Senate majority — for the bill to be passed.

“It was uber-pandering. It was like super-pander, or pandering on steroids,” Muhammad said. “You’re doing it to show some faux solidarity with black people and you failed miserably.”

House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), the highest-ranking African American in House leadership, said he was irked by the criticism of the moment. He said he also worries that demonstrators energized by Floyd’s death are too quick to criticize people who seek to enact social change in a different way — or at a different pace.

“We all have a role to play,” he said. “My role is to pass legislation and count votes. You can’t reject my role because it doesn’t go as fast as you want it.”

“What does it get us for anybody to be insulting to Nancy Pelosi,” Clyburn added later, referring to the House speaker who, along with other lawmakers, appeared in kente cloth. “We asked Nancy Pelosi to identify with us, to carry water for us. She made a gesture that identifies with us and we insult her.”

Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination and is under consideration to be Biden’s running mate, said she shares the activists’ concerns that change will come too slowly.

“But my optimism overrides that fear, because we are seeing people take to the streets who seemingly have nothing in common, but have this issue in common, and are unifying and coalition-building around this issue,” she said.

Other top Democrats have looked for ways to tap into the movement.

Biden has expressed solidarity with the protesters — vowing to combat systemic discrimination, meeting with the Floyd family and saying in a video message to his funeral that America must “turn away from racism that stings at our very soul.”

A Biden spokesman, Jamal Brown, said the former vice president is sympathetic with the frustration of activists as they combat racism in policing, housing, education and other aspects of society. “He understands these problems won’t change overnight, but [it’s] not worth giving up the fight,” Brown said, adding that Biden has worked for civil rights causes over the course of his career.

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), whose bid to take the majority in his chamber relies on mobilizing voters in a handful of races targeting vulnerable Republican members, said he has been in touch with some grass-roots organizations. He said many activists know that change requires their engagement in the country’s political debates.

“They understand you have to accept the idea that you have to push Washington around,” Schumer said.

Schumer added that he has sought advice from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), whose two unsuccessful presidential campaigns were able to excite a movement of young activists.

“What are the things that we can get to motivate people?” Schumer said he asked Sanders, though he would not detail more of their conversation.

Nina Turner, a chief surrogate for Sanders’s presidential campaign, said those conversations seem redundant. The senator’s bid for the presidency identified many of the policies activists are asking lawmakers to enact.

“There are already a list of things. There’s no need to study, no need to have a task force; the ideas are already out there,” she said. “You’re either going to do universal health care or you’re not. You’re going to legalize marijuana, take it off of Schedule I, or you’re not. You’re either going to have a $15 minimum wage or you’re not.”

Tension around the pace of progress and disappointment in establishment politicians was also a hallmark of the civil rights protests of the past, said Matthew F. Delmont, a Dartmouth College professor who focuses on African American history. Malcolm X warned people that neither Democrats nor Republicans had adequate plans to help black Americans in his “Ballot or the Bullet” speech. And Martin Luther King Jr. called on his followers to not accept political stalling.

“It’s always come down to the question of time,” Delmont said. “Dr. King had so many great sermons or speeches about time and how that group of activists just could not wait. People feel the same way today. You can’t wait for Biden to get elected. You can’t wait four years. We can’t wait on politicians if we want to see these things change.”

But while civil rights protesters of the 1960s were able to direct pressure on the Kennedy and Johnson administrations to win landmark legislation rolling back state-sponsored discrimination, today’s protesters face the challenge of seeking changes that extend beyond the political realm — rooting out racism baked in at all levels of society over the course of centuries, or what Delmont called the “unresolved policy issues from the 1960s movement.”

Some activists mobilized by Floyd’s death say they would have a hard time overcoming long-standing disappointment with Democrats.

Marjaan Sirdar, a Minneapolis activist who lives a few blocks from where Floyd was killed, noted that his city has seen years of Democratic leadership that promoted initiatives to advance racial equality. At the same time, Sirdar said, the city was not working hard enough to root out racism in its police department.

“The Democrats created this problem,” Sirdar said. “Anybody can pay for a $200, $300 training and learn how to sound anti-racist. They learn the language of anti-racism and they just become better gatekeepers of white supremacy.”

Michele Rayner-Goolsby, a lawyer who has advised activists and is now running for a Florida state House seat, said she understands demonstrators’ distrust of many politicians but thinks a Biden election would be a step forward, particularly if he selects a black woman to be vice president.

“I hear the concerns of folks, and I don’t want to discount those concerns, but I also think we can’t get lost or caught up in the minutiae of he doesn’t do this or he doesn’t do that. We literally have an anti-black president in office right now.”

Stephanie Keene, a Philadelphia organizer who wants to abolish the police and prison system, said many who are inspired to protest this year see politicians as part of the problem.

“Some people are like I’m . . . done accepting what the Democratic Party has offered us. It’s not getting better,” said Keene, 37. “This current moment is a reflection of the United States’ inability to meet any of the demands black people have put forward. I wish they would stop holding black people responsible for the failures of the Democratic Party. Why aren’t y’all responsible for not giving us a candidate worth voting for?”

Dumpson, the author and activist from Philadelphia, said he, too, is wary of politicians “not really wanting to really sit down with us” but is not yet ready to check out of the political system entirely. That is why, he said, Biden will have his vote but not his enthusiasm.",www.washingtonpost.com,left,XYtJ9oO0IXRTYAeV

Most Americans are of one mind about the values important in raising children. Every parent, regardless of political disposition, wants his child to be responsible, well-mannered, independent and persistent.

They split, the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press finds in a new survey, on the importance on the left and the right on two key values. Conservatives are most likely to put religious faith near the top of the list of what to teach children. They put “tolerance” at the bottom of the list. Liberals reverse these priorities, holding tolerance as the highest possible good and religion as of little importance.

What Pew means by “tolerance” is anyone’s guess. It’s a nebulous concept, in any event, and that’s the way liberals like it. The term enables leftists to feel superior to history and society, and they groove on adopting something rejected by tradition. A man wants to dress up like a woman and call himself Charlene? No problem. That’s tolerance.

Yet their tolerance is a one-way street. When Charlene marries Clyde, liberals are ecstatic and can’t wait to dance with both bridegrooms, but they have zero tolerance for the wedding photographers and bakers who don’t want to be part of something they regard as icky and immoral, if not worse. “Tolerance” is not tolerance when compelled by an intolerant judge and the force of government.

The left has no patience for the things that traditionalists hold dear. A few liberal atheists sued the city of Las Cruces, N.M., insisting the crosses be removed from the municipal logo, though “Las Cruces” is Spanish for “The Crosses.” There’s no room for the Ten Commandments in public, but plenty of room for the latest in blasphemous art mocking faith and morals.

The liberal sticks his fingers in his ears, stamps his feet and insists that the science of global warming is “settled.” Those who disagree are rubes, hicks and “deniers.” The Los Angeles Times won’t print a letter to the editor to question global warming because that would be “asserting a factual inaccuracy.” Edelman, America’s largest public relations firm, won’t take clients who deny “climate change.”

Some liberals can’t even bear to say or hear the name of the Washington Redskins.

Mccarthy, Tobias Hoonhout, Bill Corsair, Jason Richwine","President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Greenville , N.C. , July 17 , 2019 . ( Kevin Lamarque/Reuters )
The real source of Trump derangement syndrome is his desire to wage a multi-front pushback against an elite , postmodern progressive world .
Donald Trump is waging a nonstop , all-encompassing war against progressive culture , in magnitude analogous to what 19th-century Germans once called a Kulturkampf .
As a result , not even former president George W. Bush has incurred the degree of hatred from the left that is now directed at Trump . For most of his time in office , Trump , his family , his friends , and his businesses have been investigated , probed , dissected , and constantly attacked .
In 2016 and early 2017 , Barack Obama appointees in the FBI , CIA , and Department of Justice tried to subvert the Trump campaign , interfere with his transition , and , ultimately , abort his presidency . Now , congressional Democrats promise impeachment before the 2020 election .
The usual reason for such hatred is said to be Trump ’ s unorthodox and combative take-no-prisoners style . Critics detest his crude and unfettered assertions , his lack of prior military or political experience , his attacks on the so-called bipartisan administrative state , and his intent to roll back the entire Obama-era effort of “ fundamentally transforming ” the country leftward .
Certainly , Trump ’ s agenda of closing the border , using tariffs to overturn a half-century of Chinese mercantilism , and pulling back from optional overseas military interventions variously offends both Democrats and establishment Republicans .
Trump periodically and mercurially fires his top officials . He apparently does not care whether the departed write damning memoirs or join his opposition . He will soon appoint his fourth national security adviser within just three years .
To make things worse for his critics , Trump ’ s economy is booming as never before in the 21st century : near-record-low unemployment , a record number of Americans working , increases in workers ’ wages and family incomes , low interest rates , low inflation , steady GDP growth , and a strong stock market .
Yet the real source of Trump derangement syndrome is his desire to wage a multi-front pushback — politically , socially , economically , and culturally — against what might be called the elite postmodern progressive world .
Contemporary elites increasingly see nationalism and patriotism as passé . Borders are 19th-century holdovers .
The European Union , not the U.S. Constitution , is seen as the preferable model to run a nation . Transnational and global organizations are wiser on environmental and diplomatic matters than is the U.S. government .
The media can no longer afford to be nonpartisan and impartial in its effort to rid America of a reactionary such as Trump , given his danger to the progressive future .
America ’ s ancient sins can never really be forgiven . In a new spirit of iconoclasm , thousands of buildings , monuments , and statues dedicated to American sinners of the past must be destroyed , removed , or renamed .
A new America supposedly is marching forward under the banner of ending fossil fuels , curbing the Second Amendment , redistributing income , promoting identity politics and open borders , and providing free college , free health care , and abortion on demand .
An insomniac Trump fights all of the above nonstop and everywhere . In the past , Republican presidents sought to slow the progressive transformation of America but despaired of ever stopping it .
No slugfest is too off-topic or trivial for Trump . Sometimes that means calling out former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for persuading NFL stars to kneel during the national anthem . Huge , monopolistic Silicon Valley companies are special Trump targets . Sometimes Trump enters cul-de-sac Twitter wars with Hollywood has-beens who have attacked him and his policies .
Trump variously goes after Antifa , political correctness on campus , the NATO hierarchy , the radical green movement , Planned Parenthood , American universities , and , above all , the media — especially CNN , the Washington Post and the New York Times .
For all the acrimony and chaos — and prognostications of Trump ’ s certain failure — a bloodied Trump wins more than he loses . NATO members may hate Trump , but more are finally paying their promised defense contributions .
In retrospect , many Americans concede that the Iran deal was flawed and that the Paris climate accord was mere virtue-signaling . China was long due for a reckoning .

(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)

The real source of Trump derangement syndrome is his desire to wage a multi-front pushback against an elite, postmodern progressive world.

Donald Trump is waging a nonstop, all-encompassing war against progressive culture, in magnitude analogous to what 19th-century Germans once called a Kulturkampf.

As a result, not even former president George W. Bush has incurred the degree of hatred from the left that is now directed at Trump. For most of his time in office, Trump, his family, his friends, and his businesses have been investigated, probed, dissected, and constantly attacked.

In 2016 and early 2017, Barack Obama appointees in the FBI, CIA, and Department of Justice tried to subvert the Trump campaign, interfere with his transition, and, ultimately, abort his presidency. Now, congressional Democrats promise impeachment before the 2020 election.

The usual reason for such hatred is said to be Trump’s unorthodox and combative take-no-prisoners style. Critics detest his crude and unfettered assertions, his lack of prior military or political experience, his attacks on the so-called bipartisan administrative state, and his intent to roll back the entire Obama-era effort of “fundamentally transforming” the country leftward.

Certainly, Trump’s agenda of closing the border, using tariffs to overturn a half-century of Chinese mercantilism, and pulling back from optional overseas military interventions variously offends both Democrats and establishment Republicans.

Trump periodically and mercurially fires his top officials. He apparently does not care whether the departed write damning memoirs or join his opposition. He will soon appoint his fourth national security adviser within just three years.

To make things worse for his critics, Trump’s economy is booming as never before in the 21st century: near-record-low unemployment, a record number of Americans working, increases in workers’ wages and family incomes, low interest rates, low inflation, steady GDP growth, and a strong stock market.

Yet the real source of Trump derangement syndrome is his desire to wage a multi-front pushback — politically, socially, economically, and culturally — against what might be called the elite postmodern progressive world.

Contemporary elites increasingly see nationalism and patriotism as passé. Borders are 19th-century holdovers.

The European Union, not the U.S. Constitution, is seen as the preferable model to run a nation. Transnational and global organizations are wiser on environmental and diplomatic matters than is the U.S. government.

The media can no longer afford to be nonpartisan and impartial in its effort to rid America of a reactionary such as Trump, given his danger to the progressive future.

America’s ancient sins can never really be forgiven. In a new spirit of iconoclasm, thousands of buildings, monuments, and statues dedicated to American sinners of the past must be destroyed, removed, or renamed.

A new America supposedly is marching forward under the banner of ending fossil fuels, curbing the Second Amendment, redistributing income, promoting identity politics and open borders, and providing free college, free health care, and abortion on demand.

An insomniac Trump fights all of the above nonstop and everywhere. In the past, Republican presidents sought to slow the progressive transformation of America but despaired of ever stopping it.

No slugfest is too off-topic or trivial for Trump. Sometimes that means calling out former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for persuading NFL stars to kneel during the national anthem. Huge, monopolistic Silicon Valley companies are special Trump targets. Sometimes Trump enters cul-de-sac Twitter wars with Hollywood has-beens who have attacked him and his policies.

Trump variously goes after Antifa, political correctness on campus, the NATO hierarchy, the radical green movement, Planned Parenthood, American universities, and, above all, the media — especially CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times.

For all the acrimony and chaos — and prognostications of Trump’s certain failure — a bloodied Trump wins more than he loses. NATO members may hate Trump, but more are finally paying their promised defense contributions.

In retrospect, many Americans concede that the Iran deal was flawed and that the Paris climate accord was mere virtue-signaling. China was long due for a reckoning.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation proved fruitless and was further diminished by Mueller’s bizarrely incoherent congressional testimony.

Some of the most prominent Trump haters — Michael Avenatti, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Antony Scaramucci, and Representative Adam Schiff — either have been discredited or have become increasingly irrelevant.

Trump has so enraged his Democratic adversaries that the candidates to replace him have moved farther to the left than any primary field in memory. They loathe Trump, but in their abject hatred he has goaded the various Democratic candidates into revealing their support for the crazy Green New Deal, reparations for slavery, relaxed immigration policies, and trillions of dollars in new free stuff.

In a way, the left-wing Democratic presidential candidates understand Trump best. If he wins his one-man crusade to stop the progressive project, they are finished, and their own party will make the necessary adjustments and then sheepishly drift back toward the center.

Will Progressives erase the history of their racist heroes, or only their racist enemies?

Much of the country has demanded the elimination of references to, and images of, people of the past — from Christopher Columbus to Robert E. Lee — who do not meet our evolving standards of probity.

In some cases, such damnation may be understandable if done calmly and peacefully — and democratically, by a majority vote of elected representatives.

Ciaramella, Scott Shackford, Matt Welch","In an excellent recent article , conservative legal commentator and longtime religious liberty litigator David French explains why current law protects religious liberty far more than many people—particularly many conservatives—think . French makes many good points , and I agree with nearly everything he says . I do have two reservations about his conclusion , however . One relates to the specific field of immigration law , which is a major exception to his thesis . The second is the growing tendency of many on both right and left to vary their approach to religious liberty issues depending on whose ox is being gored . The latter does not in itself change the nature of current legal doctrine . But it could have negative effects down the road .
Here are some of the excellent points French makes . On Title VII and employment discrimination :
I have seen a remarkable amount of commentary in the aftermath of the Supreme Court 's decision in Bostock v. Clayton County arguing that the Supreme Court dealt religious liberty in America a serious , dangerous blow . Bostock , for those who do n't follow SCOTUS case names closely , is the case that interpreted Title VII 's prohibition against discrimination on the basis of `` sex '' to necessarily include sexual orientation and gender identity . As I read piece after piece , I realized that many of the people writing about the impact on religious freedom simply did n't understand the law . A generation of Americans raised on breathless activist warnings about freedom 's demise genuinely believe that religious organizations teeter on a dangerous precipice… . Religious employers have a right to impose religious litmus tests on their employees . Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964—the same statute at issue in Bostock—contains a provision specifically designed to protect the autonomy of religious organizations . It states , `` This subchapter shall not apply … to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation , association , educational institution , or society of its activities . '' It 's true that this carveout does not allow the religious organization to discriminate on other grounds ( such as race or sex ) , but it does allow them to filter out all applicants who do not share the group 's faith . This has a profound impact on the relevant applicant pool and ( along with the First Amendment ) permits employers to require that applicants agree to the organization 's statement of faith . Religious employers are completely exempt from nondiscrimination statutes when hiring and firing `` ministerial '' employees . The ministerial exception may well be the key firewall protecting church from state . Put simply , and as defined by a unanimous Supreme Court in 2012 , both the Free Exercise and Establishment clauses of the First Amendment work together to remove the state—including all nondiscrimination laws—from the ministerial selection process . On Title IX , which bans sex discrimination in educational institutions : Religious educational institutions enjoy a right to exempt themselves from Title IX . If there 's a single question I 've received more than any other , it 's this : Does Bostock mean that religious schools will now have to alter policies regarding dorm rooms or sexual conduct to comply with federal prohibitions against sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination ? The short answer is no . The longer answer is nope , not unless they choose to be subject to Title IX… To be clear , Bostock is an employment case ( and thus the sections above apply to employment at religious schools ) , but one would expect that the definition of `` sex '' applied in Title VII would also extend to Title IX , thus preventing sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination in , for example , codes of conduct , dorm placements , and athletic programs . . But Title IX contains a special carveout : [ T ] his section shall not apply to an educational institution which is controlled by a religious organization if the application of this subsection would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such organization . The exemption is not automatic . Schools have to choose to opt out ( either proactively or in response to a Title IX complaint ) , and a number of religious schools have taken advantage of this provision . Many have not , but it is their choice , and that choice is plainly and clearly embedded in federal law .
French also covers a wide range of other issues , including discrimination against religious groups and organizations in access to public facilities , protections against employment discrimination targeting religious employees , and the extensive protection the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) gives to religious freedom by mandating religious exceptions to many `` generally applicable '' federal laws . I would that 21 states have enacted state RFRAs , which provide similar religious exemptions from state laws . Anyone interested in this topic should read French 's article in full . In most areas , religious liberty today enjoys broader protection than at any time in American history .
The big exception to French 's relatively optimistic conclusion is immigration law . Thanks to the Supreme Court 's badly flawed ruling in the 2018 travel ban case , the federal government is allowed to engage in religion-based discrimination in immigration law that would be forbidden in virtually any other context . As I explained in this article , evidence of unconstitutional discriminatory motivation in the travel ban case was substantially stronger than that presented in the Masterpiece Cakeshop decision , which the Supreme Court issued just a few weeks earlier . Yet the Court struck down the government action in the latter case , while upholding it in the former , because of the doctrine of special deference to the President and Congress on immigration policy . As a practical matter , this leaves the president and Congress free to engage in blatant religious discrimination against would-be immigrants , so long as there is even a thin veneer of a nondiscriminatory rationalization for their policy—even a transparently bogus one , as in the travel ban case itself .
This sad state of affairs is part of a more general pattern under which the Court has largely exempted immigration restrictions from many of the constitutional constraints that apply to virtually every other exercise of federal power . People who care about religious freedom—and other constitutional rights—should work to change that .
The other reservation I have about the state of religious liberty is the pattern of ideological and partisan double standards that all too often surround the issue . Too many on the right care greatly about religious liberty when theologically conservative Christians are the ones in peril , but turn a blind eye ( or worse ) in the travel ban case , and other situations where the group that is threatened is one they have less sympathy with . On the left , many who were rightly outraged by Trump 's travel ban have no such objections to Blaine Amendments that discriminate against religious schools , or recent state and local government policies that treat religious meetings and demonstrations far more harshly than secular protests that liberals have greater sympathy for . I criticized such double standards in greater detail here .
In the short and even medium term , such inconsistency is unlikely to undermine legal protection for religious liberty too much . But , in the long run , a society where most political activists and elites care about religious freedom only when it affects `` their '' side , is one where religious freedom necessarily rests on weaker foundations than it should .
I do not claim to be a paragon of virtue or consistency when it comes to religious liberty issues . But , for what it is worth , I was one of the relatively few people who argued that religious liberty claims deserved to prevail in both the travel ban case and also in Masterpiece Cakeshop ( which involved a conservative Christian baker who refused to bake cakes for same-sex weddings ) and the 2014 Hobby Lobby case ( which involved a RFRA claim by a theologically conservative business owner who opposed contraception ) .
As an atheist , I do not share the religious beliefs of the Muslim targets of Trump 's travel ban . And I have little sympathy for religious objections to same-sex marriage and contraception , both of which reflect attitudes I decry .

culture,BBC News,1,http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-30888767,X-ray technique 'reads' burnt Vesuvius scroll,,"Jonathan Webb, Science Reporter","For the first time , words have been read from a burnt , rolled-up scroll buried by Mount Vesuvius in AD79 .
The scrolls of Herculaneum , the only classical library still in existence , were blasted by volcanic gas hotter than 300C and are desperately fragile .
Deep inside one scroll , physicists distinguished the ink from the paper using a 3D X-ray imaging technique sometimes used in breast scans .
They believe that other scrolls could also be deciphered without unrolling .
The resort town of Herculaneum , sometimes called `` the other Pompeii '' , was similarly buried in ash by Vesuvius . A remarkable library of scrolls was excavated from one of its villas in the 18th century .
Previous efforts to read them , over many centuries , involved special strategies for unravelling the scrolls as delicately as possible .
Although some unrolled fragments have been read successfully , particularly in recent years with the help of infra-red cameras , such unwinding efforts were eventually abandoned because of how much of the scrolls they destroyed .
Some other efforts to peer inside the rolled-up scrolls using CT scans have revealed the shape of the ancient , coiled layers - but never successfully deciphered their contents .
Now , a team led by Dr Vito Mocella from the National Research Council 's Institute for Microelectronics and Microsystems ( CNR-IMM ) in Naples , Italy , has identified a handful of Greek letters within a rolled-up scroll for the very first time .
The key to the discovery was a technique called `` X-ray phase-contrast tomography '' , most commonly used in medicine .
Dr Mocella , a physicist with a background in photonics , first came up with the idea on a visit to the European Synchrotron in Grenoble , France .
`` I was in Grenoble for a collaboration , and they explained to me some new developments using phase contrast for science , for palaeontology .... They sounded like exotic applications , '' he told ███ .
Conventional X-ray imaging simply measures how much X-ray light gets through different parts of the tissue . But this newer method uses the fact that X-rays passing through an object are slightly distorted , or slowed down ( a change in the `` phase '' of the light waves ) .
Even tiny variations in the object 's make-up will affect that distortion - so measuring `` phase contrast '' can produce a very detailed , 3D picture of its internal structure .
Dr Silvia Pani is an X-ray physicist at the University of Surrey who has used the technique .
`` It works very well on some medical applications - particularly mammography - because you 're looking at details that have a very similar composition to that of the background , '' she told the BBC .
`` And that 's where conventional imaging sometimes fails . What they saw would have been impossible with conventional X-ray imaging . ''
In fact , when Dr Mocella 's team placed one of the scrolls - carefully - in the path of a very bright X-ray beam from the synchrotron , it was bumps on the paper rather than chemicals in the ink that yielded the long-hidden letters .
`` What we see is that the ink , which was essentially carbon based , is not very different from the carbonised papyrus , '' Dr Mocella explained .
Fortunately , however , the ink never penetrated into the fibres of the papyrus , but sat on top of them .
`` So the letters are there in relief , because the ink is still on the top . ''
It was this extra thickness - just a tenth of a millimetre - that revealed the strokes of the letters , even after volcanic incineration and two millennia underground .

For the first time, words have been read from a burnt, rolled-up scroll buried by Mount Vesuvius in AD79.

The scrolls of Herculaneum, the only classical library still in existence, were blasted by volcanic gas hotter than 300C and are desperately fragile.

Deep inside one scroll, physicists distinguished the ink from the paper using a 3D X-ray imaging technique sometimes used in breast scans.

They believe that other scrolls could also be deciphered without unrolling.

The work appears in the journal Nature Communications.

The resort town of Herculaneum, sometimes called ""the other Pompeii"", was similarly buried in ash by Vesuvius. A remarkable library of scrolls was excavated from one of its villas in the 18th century.

Previous efforts to read them, over many centuries, involved special strategies for unravelling the scrolls as delicately as possible.

Although some unrolled fragments have been read successfully, particularly in recent years with the help of infra-red cameras, such unwinding efforts were eventually abandoned because of how much of the scrolls they destroyed.

Some other efforts to peer inside the rolled-up scrolls using CT scans have revealed the shape of the ancient, coiled layers - but never successfully deciphered their contents.

Now, a team led by Dr Vito Mocella from the National Research Council's Institute for Microelectronics and Microsystems (CNR-IMM) in Naples, Italy, has identified a handful of Greek letters within a rolled-up scroll for the very first time.

'Exotic applications'

The key to the discovery was a technique called ""X-ray phase-contrast tomography"", most commonly used in medicine.

Dr Mocella, a physicist with a background in photonics, first came up with the idea on a visit to the European Synchrotron in Grenoble, France.

""I was in Grenoble for a collaboration, and they explained to me some new developments using phase contrast for science, for palaeontology.... They sounded like exotic applications,"" he told BBC News.

""And I said, I have another idea.""

Image copyright V Mocella / Nature Communications Image caption Analysis is a painstaking job because the layers of paper are squashed and twisted

Conventional X-ray imaging simply measures how much X-ray light gets through different parts of the tissue. But this newer method uses the fact that X-rays passing through an object are slightly distorted, or slowed down (a change in the ""phase"" of the light waves).

Even tiny variations in the object's make-up will affect that distortion - so measuring ""phase contrast"" can produce a very detailed, 3D picture of its internal structure.

Tell-tale bumps

Dr Silvia Pani is an X-ray physicist at the University of Surrey who has used the technique.

""It works very well on some medical applications - particularly mammography - because you're looking at details that have a very similar composition to that of the background,"" she told the BBC.

""And that's where conventional imaging sometimes fails. What they saw would have been impossible with conventional X-ray imaging.""

Image copyright Other Image caption The scrolls are the only library known to have survived from classical times

In fact, when Dr Mocella's team placed one of the scrolls - carefully - in the path of a very bright X-ray beam from the synchrotron, it was bumps on the paper rather than chemicals in the ink that yielded the long-hidden letters.

""What we see is that the ink, which was essentially carbon based, is not very different from the carbonised papyrus,"" Dr Mocella explained.

Fortunately, however, the ink never penetrated into the fibres of the papyrus, but sat on top of them.

""So the letters are there in relief, because the ink is still on the top.""

It was this extra thickness - just a tenth of a millimetre - that revealed the strokes of the letters, even after volcanic incineration and two millennia underground.

The work was time-consuming and involved a lot of guesswork, particularly because the layers of paper were not just rolled, but squashed and mangled by their encounter with Vesuvius.

Furthermore, the grid of papyrus fibres within the paper posed complications, because it disguised many of the letters' vertical and horizontal strokes. For this reason, letters with curved lines were easier to pick out.

""I don't think the technique is perfect,"" said Dr Mocella, who is already planning more experiments to improve it.

Dr Pani, meanwhile, remembers learning about the Herculaneum scrolls at school in Italy. She said she was ""very much impressed"" by the study.

NBC canceled ""Megyn Kelly Today"" and negotiated an exit from the network. Problem solved, right?

Yeah, not so much. In 2015, the majority of white Americans said it’s acceptable for a white person to wear blackface makeup for Halloween. I’m willing to bet dollars to doughnuts that’s still the case.

Banishing Kelly might feel good in the moment, but it’s yet another example of us as a society conflating ignorance with ill will, and not seizing the opportunity to educate both Kelly and her audience. Yes, as a TV show anchor and political commentator, Kelly should have educated herself on the topic long before Halloween 2018.

What’s happening

One of America’s most popular entertainment genres is the police show. Stories about crime are exciting, dramatic and have drawn large audiences for decades. But as the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others have sparked widespread protests and the nation reckons with police brutality and systemic racism, TV shows about law enforcement have come under fresh scrutiny for their depiction of the criminal justice system.

In the past week, networks have pulled the police shows “Cops” and “Live PD.” The cancellations follow the protests over police brutality and a slew of viral videos showing cops beating, pepper spraying and teargassing peaceful protesters and journalists. Some actors who portray cops have been donating to bail funds in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and are urging their peers to match their contributions.

What we watch on TV can shape our view of reality, and millions have learned about the criminal justice system through police procedurals. Shows like “Law & Order” and “NCIS” use a well-known format: Cops and other law enforcement officials are the protagonists and investigate a new case each episode, often solving it by the episode’s end.

This structure grew out of a collaboration between the entertainment industry and police departments. For decades, law enforcement officers consulted on shows and used them to help shape their public image, steering showrunners in the direction of “good guy” portrayals. For example, the Los Angeles Police Department provided both ideas and financial support to the classic 1960s series “Dragnet” and vetted scripts before filming.

Why there’s debate

While the popularity of these shows — “Cops” ran for more than 30 years — proves that audiences love the crime drama, some critics say that the shows serve only to push an overly positive image of cops.

But supporters of police shows worry that their mass cancellation, an effect of “cancel culture,” threatens free speech. In some instances, the call has gone too far, they say, especially in the case of “Paw Patrol,” an animated children’s show about rescue dogs. Supporters also argue that it’s dangerous to censor all depictions of police, and say that there should still be room for some positive images of cops.

Advocates and most critics agree it’s unlikely that networks will cancel all shows. But critics argue it would be beneficial to reimagine the ways police are portrayed. They point to shows like “Orange Is the New Black,” where prison inmates are the protagonists, and “Watchmen,” which examines police brutality and white supremacy, as examples of what a cop shows can be.

Critics say many shows glorify cops, normalize racism and injustice in the criminal justice system and skew viewers’ perceptions of what constitutes police brutality. They point to an unfair balance in most shows, where cops are the heroes who viewers get to know over entire seasons, while victims and perpetrators are guest stars and disappear after a few episodes. Onscreen, cops have unrealistically high clearance rates and alleged criminals are quickly brought to trial. A report by the advocacy group Color of Change found that police shows failed to accurately depict interactions between police and people of color and that officers rarely face consequences for wrongdoing. Critics also argue that a lack of diversity in writers’ rooms makes it difficult to tell stories about race and police.

What’s next

The television industry is on hold during the coronavirus pandemic, but as debate around how shows depict police intensifies, there may be a shift in how entertainment programming tells stories about police and the criminal justice system.

Perspectives

Cops are overrepresented in media

“When we talk about representation in movies and television, we often point at the voices and faces that are missing. But we also need to look at the voices and faces that are overrepresented. Too often police are beacons of morality who never do wrong. Too often criminals are people of color, particularly black men.

More than 150 other countries will join in this world census round—the 10-year period centered on 2020 , and around 90 percent of the world ’ s population has already been or will be counted .
But while impressive on a human scale , a modern census is technologically unspectacular . The American questionnaire asks just seven questions of each person , with a few more for each household as a whole . Counting generously , the government is collecting 130 bytes of data per person and perhaps another 13 bytes per household—amounting to around 45 GB for the whole US population .

More than 150 other countries will join in this world census round—the 10-year period centered on 2020, and around 90 percent of the world’s population has already been or will be counted.

But while impressive on a human scale, a modern census is technologically unspectacular. The American questionnaire asks just seven questions of each person, with a few more for each household as a whole. Counting generously, the government is collecting 130 bytes of data per person and perhaps another 13 bytes per household—amounting to around 45 GB for the whole US population. If it weren’t for the strict confidentiality, you could, once it’s complete, carry around the entire contents of the US census on a base model iPhone 11. The challenges of this year’s census are enormous, but they are social, political, logistical—and now public-health related—rather than strictly technological or scientific.

Political correctness kills art, rendering it bland. Which is why it was encouraging when Hollywood A-lister Scarlett Johansson said that — as an actress — she should be able to play “any person, or any tree, or any animal.”

No doubt Johansson would make a very sexy tree, and a very bold badger besides, but her claim to be able to play “any person” sparked furious controversy. I mean, just who does she think she is?

He scouted out the exact location with the two brothers he paid to stage the hoax , offered specific instructions on how he wanted to be beaten , and even gave them $ 100 to buy supplies used in the staged assault , prosecutors said .
The revelations came as Smollett made his first court appearance Thursday afternoon at a bond hearing following his early-morning arrest on a charge of disorderly conduct by filing a false police report .
Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr. set Smollett ’ s bond at $ 100,000 and ordered him to surrender his passport . No plea was entered and the actor said little other than giving his name . Smollett posted bond late Thursday afternoon and walked out of the Cook County Jail without making comment to a phalanx of reporters .
Smollett , who is gay and black , told investigators he was beaten by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs , wrapped a rope around his neck in the fashion of a noose and poured bleach on him . He also told investigators that the men who attacked yelled , `` This is MAGA country , '' a reference to President Donald Trump 's 2016 campaign slogan .
Assistant State ’ s Attorney Risa Lanier said Smollett plotted the attack with the brothers , describing one of the men , Abimbola “ Abel ” Osundairo , 25 , as a close friend of the actor 's .
Three men met on Jan. 25 and planned the attack during a conversation in the actor ’ s car . The attack was originally planned for 10 p.m. CST on Jan. 28 , but had to be pushed back a few hours because the actor ’ s flight from New York was delayed .
Smollett asked the other brother , Olabinjo Osundairo , to `` place a rope around his neck , pour gasoline on him and yell , ‘ This is MAGA country . ' ”
He also initially directed the brothers to pour gasoline on him during the attack but later suggested they use bleach , Lanier said .
Smollett and the brothers met again on Jan. 27 . The actor picked the men up from their home on the city ’ s North Side and drove them to the area near his apartment where he wanted them to stage the attack . A witness , an employee of nearby NBC News , saw it all go down .
The actor instructed the brothers not to bring their cellphones with them . That day he also wrote a $ 3,500 check to Abel Osundairo that was backdated to Jan. 23 .
He also gave them $ 100 to buy a ski mask , red hat and other supplies to be used in the attack , Lanier said .
“ Smollett also stated that he wanted the brothers to catch his attention by calling him an ‘ Empire ' F , 'Empire ' N , ” Lanier said . “ Smollett further detailed he wanted Abel to attack him , but not hurt him too badly and give him a chance to appear to fight back . ''
Prosecutors say texts between Abel Osundairo and Smollett show he also provided the drug ecstasy to the actor .
A half dozen people who were identified to the court as family members of Smollett watched the roughly 15 minute hearing .
Smollett , wearing a light black winter coat , watched intently as Lanier detailed the prosecution ’ s case . At moments , his mouth fell slightly agape as Lanier outlined what they think happened .
Judge Lyke was taken aback by the allegations outlined against Smollett even as he told the actor he has the presumption of innocence .
“ The most vile and despicable part of it , if it ’ s true , is the noose , '' said Lyke , who is black . `` That symbol conjures up such evil in this country ’ s history . ''
Jack Prior , a member Smollett ’ s legal defense team , said his client “ vehemently denies ” the charges and said that the case presented by prosecutors doesn ’ t jibe with the actor ’ s character .
He noted that in his five years living in Chicago , Smollett has become involved in philanthropy and volunteer work , even giving song-writing classes to detainees in the Illinois correctional system .
Smollett 's defense team – which recently added Los Angeles-based celebrity defense lawyer Mark Geragos to assist with the case – later said in a statement : “ Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system . The presumption of innocence , a bedrock in the search for justice , was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably , on the eve of a Mayoral election . Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing . ”
At a morning news conference , police detailed how the 36-year-old actor choreographed the attack in an attempt to raise his profile .

USA TODAY

CHICAGO – ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett plotted an attack to make himself look like the victim of a brutal anti-black, homophobic crime, prosecutors said Thursday.

He scouted out the exact location with the two brothers he paid to stage the hoax, offered specific instructions on how he wanted to be beaten, and even gave them $100 to buy supplies used in the staged assault, prosecutors said.

The revelations came as Smollett made his first court appearance Thursday afternoon at a bond hearing following his early-morning arrest on a charge of disorderly conduct by filing a false police report.

Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr. set Smollett’s bond at $100,000 and ordered him to surrender his passport. No plea was entered and the actor said little other than giving his name. Smollett posted bond late Thursday afternoon and walked out of the Cook County Jail without making comment to a phalanx of reporters.

Smollett, who is gay and black, told investigators he was beaten by two masked men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck in the fashion of a noose and poured bleach on him. He also told investigators that the men who attacked yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan.

Assistant State’s Attorney Risa Lanier said Smollett plotted the attack with the brothers, describing one of the men, Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo, 25, as a close friend of the actor's.

Lanier gave the prosecution's outline of the incident:

Three men met on Jan. 25 and planned the attack during a conversation in the actor’s car. The attack was originally planned for 10 p.m. CST on Jan. 28, but had to be pushed back a few hours because the actor’s flight from New York was delayed.

Smollett asked the other brother, Olabinjo Osundairo, to ""place a rope around his neck, pour gasoline on him and yell, ‘This is MAGA country.' ”

He also initially directed the brothers to pour gasoline on him during the attack but later suggested they use bleach, Lanier said.

Smollett and the brothers met again on Jan. 27. The actor picked the men up from their home on the city’s North Side and drove them to the area near his apartment where he wanted them to stage the attack. A witness, an employee of nearby NBC News, saw it all go down.

The actor instructed the brothers not to bring their cellphones with them. That day he also wrote a $3,500 check to Abel Osundairo that was backdated to Jan. 23.

He also gave them $100 to buy a ski mask, red hat and other supplies to be used in the attack, Lanier said.

“Smollett also stated that he wanted the brothers to catch his attention by calling him an ‘Empire' F, 'Empire' N,” Lanier said. “Smollett further detailed he wanted Abel to attack him, but not hurt him too badly and give him a chance to appear to fight back.""

Prosecutors say texts between Abel Osundairo and Smollett show he also provided the drug ecstasy to the actor.

A half dozen people who were identified to the court as family members of Smollett watched the roughly 15 minute hearing.

Smollett, wearing a light black winter coat, watched intently as Lanier detailed the prosecution’s case. At moments, his mouth fell slightly agape as Lanier outlined what they think happened.

Judge Lyke was taken aback by the allegations outlined against Smollett even as he told the actor he has the presumption of innocence.

“The most vile and despicable part of it, if it’s true, is the noose,"" said Lyke, who is black. ""That symbol conjures up such evil in this country’s history.""

Jack Prior, a member Smollett’s legal defense team, said his client “vehemently denies” the charges and said that the case presented by prosecutors doesn’t jibe with the actor’s character.

He noted that in his five years living in Chicago, Smollett has become involved in philanthropy and volunteer work, even giving song-writing classes to detainees in the Illinois correctional system.

Smollett's defense team – which recently added Los Angeles-based celebrity defense lawyer Mark Geragos to assist with the case – later said in a statement: “Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

At a morning news conference, police detailed how the 36-year-old actor choreographed the attack in an attempt to raise his profile.

Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who is also African-American, said Smollett staged the Jan. 29 attack to look like a hate crime, to take ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career ... because he was dissatisfied with his salary.""

Smollett has played Jamal Lyon on ""Empire"" since 2015. Fox said Thursday it is weighing its response.

“We understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process,"" 20th Century Fox Studio and Fox Entertainment said in a statement. ""We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options.”

“

Smollett could face up to one to three years in prison and substantial fines for disorderly conduct, a charge that ""can mean, say, causing a scene in public,” Adam Citron, a former New York state prosecutor turned defense attorney said. “In Illinois the law prohibits specific acts that waste public resources or cause unnecessary public fear or stress, and one of those acts is making a false police report.”

Smollett's initial status as a crime victim began to shift last weekend after police arrested and interviewed the Osundairos, who were originally identified as suspects after turning up in surveillance footage. They were seen running from the area, Commander Edward Wodnicki said.

.

Police learned that the Osundairos, both U.S. citizens, had flown to Nigeria soon after the attack, so officers immediately arrested the men at O'Hare International Airport.

The brothers were held in police custody for nearly two full days, the maximum police can hold suspects without charging them, before they cooperated with investigators. Their attorney, Gloria Schmidt, told police the brothers were willing to give a video interview.

“It was at that time that this investigation began to spin in an absolutely new direction,” Wodnicki said.

Meanwhile, the FBI is also in preliminary stages of investigating Smollet's role in the threatening letter sent to him at the Chicago studio where ""Empire"" films.

The letter was sent on Jan. 22, one week before his alleged assault. He could potentially faced federal charges as well, investigators said.

Johnson called on Smollett to come clean. Police did not immediately have an estimate for how much was spent carrying out the investigation.

“Absolute justice would be an apology to this city that he smeared, admitting what he did and then be man enough to offer what he should offer up in terms of all the resources that were put into this,"" he said.

From a mop-topped unknown named David Jones , to his space-alien alter ego `` Ziggy Stardust , '' to his dapper departure as the soul-influenced Thin White Duke , Bowie married music and fashion in a way few artists have been able to master .
He was theatrical , he was flamboyant , he was without parallel in his showmanship .
His albums , especially after his 1972 breakthrough `` The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars , '' were treated as events . His songs , including `` Changes , '' `` Fame , '' `` Heroes '' and `` Modern Love , '' were anthemic hits , played constantly on the radio and inspiring generations of musicians .
With a voice that soared from a baritone to a falsetto , he spoke of carrying on against the odds . Of the terror in knowing what the world is about . Of turning and facing the strange .
His songs were a salve for the alienated and the misfits of the world .
Bowie had just released his latest album , `` Blackstar , '' on Friday , his 69th birthday . It shot to No . 1 on the iTunes chart in the UK and No . 2 in the United States , underscoring his appeal even after decades in the music business .
Like his past releases , the work -- generally praised by music critics -- defied genres . The influential music publication NME called it an amalgamation of `` warped showtunes , skronking industrial rock , soulful balladeering , airy folk-pop , even hip-hop . ''
That in a nutshell was Bowie : There was hardly a musical style he did n't dabble in -- and indelibly leave his mark upon .
Since his breakthrough with `` Ziggy Stardust , '' Bowie 's reach was eclectic : glam rock , prog rock , pop rock , electronic rock .
And the results ? Electric . To the tune of more than 130 million records sold . The album titles , including `` Aladdin Sane , '' `` Station to Station '' and `` Scary Monsters , '' are familiar to any music fan .
Though he did n't have his first No . 1 single in the United States until `` Fame '' in 1975 , he 'd already been making a mark with heavily played singles , including `` Space Oddity , '' `` Changes , '' `` Suffragette City , '' `` Rebel Rebel '' and his first Top 40 hit , 1975 's `` Young Americans . ''
After that , he was almost as present on the singles charts as the album charts , with hits such as `` Golden Years , '' `` Under Pressure '' ( with Queen ) , `` Let 's Dance '' ( another No . 1 ) , `` Blue Jean '' and `` Never Let Me Down . ''
`` David Bowie was one of my most important inspirations , so fearless , so creative , he gave us magic for a lifetime , '' tweeted rapper Kanye West , as news of Bowie 's death made the rounds .
David Bowie was one of my most important inspirations , so fearless , so creative , he gave us magic for a lifetime . — KANYE WEST ( @ kanyewest ) January 11 , 2016
He was born David Jones , to a waitress and a nightclub owner in South London on January 8 , 1947 .
Though he began his musical life with his birth name , riding the mod wave of the mid-1960s , he changed to `` Bowie '' to avoid confusion with Davy Jones , the lead singer of the Monkees , who was enjoying serious pop success at the time .
That reinvention was the first of many . And his timing was often impeccable .
He released his song about a doomed astronaut , `` Space Oddity , '' just days before the 1969 moon landing .
Four years later he killed off his most famous creation , the other-worldly `` Ziggy Stardust , '' just at the point where it threatened to overwhelm him .
He soon transformed into the Thin White Duke , a cocksure but coked-out mad aristrocrat . While Ziggy was all arena rock , the Duke was chilled soul . While Ziggy gave him `` Space Oddity , '' the Duke gave him yet another timeless classic , `` Fame , '' a song co-written with John Lennon , one of his many admirers .
`` I went to the 'Diamond Dogs ' show ( in June 1974 ) expecting something like Ziggy Stardust , '' fan John Neilson told NPR in 2014 . `` And then in October I expected to see something like 'Diamond Dogs , ' and it was the soul revue . It might as well have been a completely different artist . ''
Bowie was as much observer as observed . In a 1974 interview with Dick Cavett , he said he started carrying a cane when he noticed his fans doing so .
`` He was chameleon in many ways , as we know , '' stage and film producer Robert Fox told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour . `` But he could become a very ordinary-looking man . And sometimes I 'd meet him in New York at a café , and people would n't recognize him . And they 'd be sitting three feet from him . He could just -- he could fit in . ''
Still , if it was all part of the package , the burden of living his art in public took a toll . By the mid-1970s , `` Bowie was lost in a haze of cocaine addiction , '' wrote Ultimate Classic Rock 's Frank Mastropolo . He finally holed up in Berlin and recorded the groundbreaking `` Berlin '' trilogy : `` Low , '' `` 'Heroes ' `` and `` Lodger . '' ( The quotation marks around the album title `` 'Heroes ' `` were a deliberate ironic touch . )
`` I had approached the brink of drug-induced calamity one too many times , and it was essential to take some kind of positive action , '' he said in an interview years later , according to Ultimate Classic Rock
Musically , he kept one foot in the avant garde . On the song `` Heroes , '' he half-sings , half-screams , with some of the atmosphere provided by white noise .
Others paid attention . Composer Philip Glass used `` Low '' and `` 'Heroes ' `` as the subjects of symphonies in the 1990s .
`` David Bowie was a true innovator , a true creative . May he rest in peace , '' tweeted uber-producer Pharrell Williams
Despite the edginess , Bowie 's work still resonated with the mainstream . `` Heroes , '' in fact , later became a theme for many . The 2012 British Olympic team entered the stadium to the tune .
He even sang a Christmas song , `` The Little Drummer Boy , '' with the most mainstream of American crooners , Bing Crosby , on a 1977 TV special . There were no theatrics , no frills , just Bowie 's pure voice meshing with one of the oldest of the Old Guard .
Starting with his collaboration with Queen on `` Under Pressure , '' he brilliantly reinvented himself to take full advantage of the music video era .
The 1983 `` Let 's Dance '' album , produced by Chic 's Nile Rodgers , became his most commercially successful album , its sound and his look influencing a new generation of musicians . The videos for the album 's singles , including the title cut and `` China Girl , '' were ubiquitous on the music video channel MTV .
Bowie , by then pushing 40 , was as relevant as the era 's power chord-slamming 20-somethings or synthesizer-playing Euro pop stars -- musicians for whom he 'd paved the way .
Through it all , his Midas touch made classics of other people 's songs . He produced Lou Reed 's `` Transformer , '' with its hit `` Walk on the Wild Side , '' and Iggy Pop 's `` Lust for Life , '' among others .
`` David 's friendship was the light of my life . I never met such a brilliant person . He was the best there is , '' Iggy Pop tweeted
He also innovated in the sale of his work . In 1997 , he raised $ 55 million by promising investors income from his back catalog . The financial device , labeled the `` Bowie bond , '' was later used for artists such as James Brown and Marvin Gaye .
Bowie 's output thinned in the 1990s and the 2000s , but he was no less envelope-pushing . He experimented with heavy metal , with industrial rock , and with drum and bass .
Bowie 's theatricality was n't limited to performing on stage . In 1976 he played the lead in Nicholas Roeg 's film `` The Man Who Fell to Earth '' as -- perhaps appropriately -- an alien . Four years later , he portrayed Joseph Merrick , who 'd been deformed by a medical condition , in Broadway 's `` The Elephant Man . ''
Bowie continued acting through most of his life , often drawn to unusual characters . He played a vampire in 1983 's `` The Hunger , '' the Goblin King in 1986 's `` Labyrinth , '' Pontius Pilate in 1988 's `` The Last Temptation of Christ '' and Andy Warhol ( about whom Bowie had once written a song ) in 1996 's `` Basquiat . ''
He was n't above a little comedy , however . He had cameos in TV shows such as `` SpongeBob SquarePants '' and `` Extras '' and played himself in 2001 's `` Zoolander . ''
His androgynous look sometimes led to questions of his sexuality that , like his music , defied classification .
He told Playboy magazine in the 1970s that he was bisexual . He told Rolling Stone in the 1980s he had always been a `` closet heterosexual . ''
`` I was virtually trying anything . I really had a hunger to experience everything that life had to offer , from the opium den to whatever , '' he said . But , he added , he was `` not a particularly hedonistic person -- I tried my best . I was up there with the best of them . I pushed myself into areas just for experiment and bravado , to see what would happen . But , in the final analysis , it 's not really me . ''
In 1992 , Bowie married his second wife , model Iman . Their daughter , Alexandria , was born in 2000 .
Bowie had some health problems in the early 2000s , including an emergency angioplasty in 2004 .
He also stopped touring after the `` A Reality '' tour in 2003-04 and , until 2013 's `` The Next Day , '' he had n't put out an album in 10 years .
But recent months had seen signs of a Bowie re-emergence . Aside from `` The Next Day , '' he co-wrote the current stage play `` Lazarus , '' based on `` The Man Who Fell to Earth , '' and recorded and released `` Blackstar . ''
`` He 'd just go from zero to 60 once we walked out of the control room and into the studio , '' drummer Mark Guiliana told Rolling Stone about the `` Blackstar '' sessions . `` And his vocal performances were always just stunning , amazing . ''
Longtime producer Tony Visconti reportedly turned the tables on Friday , having fans sing `` Happy Birthday '' to Bowie over the phone during Visconti 's live performance in New York .
Fox , who produced Bowie 's musical `` Lazarus '' and knew the singer for 40 years , told CNN that Bowie was in good spirits when the pair met only weeks ago .
`` He was n't felling particularly well . I knew that I only had a brief moment , '' Fox said . `` But he was impeccable as ever . His manners were impeccable . And he talked about the future of the show . He talked a little about the treatment that he was going to start . And he was optimistic and hopeful and positive as ever . ''
Bowie was always busy , always on to the next thing .
Twenty years ago , interviewed by Mick Brown of the UK Telegraph , he coolly assessed his past , but -- typically Bowie -- looked to the future .
At the time , he was reveling in the paintings of Damien Hirst and had plans for another project with producer Brian Eno . And there was no sense in waiting , he said .","(CNN) David Bowie , whose incomparable sound and chameleon-like ability to reinvent himself made him a pop music fixture for more than four decades, has died.

Marriage of music and fashion

From a mop-topped unknown named David Jones, to his space-alien alter ego ""Ziggy Stardust,"" to his dapper departure as the soul-influenced Thin White Duke, Bowie married music and fashion in a way few artists have been able to master.

He was theatrical, he was flamboyant, he was without parallel in his showmanship.

That in a nutshell was Bowie: There was hardly a musical style he didn't dabble in -- and indelibly leave his mark upon.

Since his breakthrough with ""Ziggy Stardust,"" Bowie's reach was eclectic: glam rock, prog rock, pop rock, electronic rock.

And the results? Electric. To the tune of more than 130 million records sold. The album titles, including ""Aladdin Sane,"" ""Station to Station"" and ""Scary Monsters,"" are familiar to any music fan.

Though he didn't have his first No. 1 single in the United States until ""Fame"" in 1975, he'd already been making a mark with heavily played singles, including ""Space Oddity,"" ""Changes,"" ""Suffragette City,"" ""Rebel Rebel"" and his first Top 40 hit, 1975's ""Young Americans.""

After that, he was almost as present on the singles charts as the album charts, with hits such as ""Golden Years,"" ""Under Pressure"" (with Queen), ""Let's Dance"" (another No. 1), ""Blue Jean"" and ""Never Let Me Down.""

""David Bowie was one of my most important inspirations, so fearless, so creative, he gave us magic for a lifetime,"" tweeted rapper Kanye West , as news of Bowie's death made the rounds.

Changing looks

He was born David Jones, to a waitress and a nightclub owner in South London on January 8, 1947.

Though he began his musical life with his birth name, riding the mod wave of the mid-1960s, he changed to ""Bowie"" to avoid confusion with Davy Jones, the lead singer of the Monkees, who was enjoying serious pop success at the time.

That reinvention was the first of many. And his timing was often impeccable.

He released his song about a doomed astronaut, ""Space Oddity,"" just days before the 1969 moon landing.

Four years later he killed off his most famous creation, the other-worldly ""Ziggy Stardust,"" just at the point where it threatened to overwhelm him.

He soon transformed into the Thin White Duke, a cocksure but coked-out mad aristrocrat. While Ziggy was all arena rock, the Duke was chilled soul. While Ziggy gave him ""Space Oddity,"" the Duke gave him yet another timeless classic, ""Fame,"" a song co-written with John Lennon, one of his many admirers.

Such speedy changes could catch his fans off guard.

""I went to the 'Diamond Dogs' show (in June 1974) expecting something like Ziggy Stardust,"" fan John Neilson told NPR in 2014. ""And then in October I expected to see something like 'Diamond Dogs,' and it was the soul revue. It might as well have been a completely different artist.""

Bowie was as much observer as observed. In a 1974 interview with Dick Cavett , he said he started carrying a cane when he noticed his fans doing so.

""He was chameleon in many ways, as we know,"" stage and film producer Robert Fox told CNN's Christiane Amanpour . ""But he could become a very ordinary-looking man. And sometimes I'd meet him in New York at a café, and people wouldn't recognize him. And they'd be sitting three feet from him. He could just -- he could fit in.""

Taking a toll

Still, if it was all part of the package, the burden of living his art in public took a toll. By the mid-1970s, ""Bowie was lost in a haze of cocaine addiction,"" wrote Ultimate Classic Rock's Frank Mastropolo . He finally holed up in Berlin and recorded the groundbreaking ""Berlin"" trilogy: ""Low,"" "" 'Heroes' "" and ""Lodger."" (The quotation marks around the album title "" 'Heroes' "" were a deliberate ironic touch .)

""I had approached the brink of drug-induced calamity one too many times, and it was essential to take some kind of positive action,"" he said in an interview years later, according to Ultimate Classic Rock

Musically, he kept one foot in the avant garde. On the song ""Heroes,"" he half-sings, half-screams, with some of the atmosphere provided by white noise.

Others paid attention. Composer Philip Glass used ""Low"" and "" 'Heroes' "" as the subjects of symphonies in the 1990s.

""David Bowie was a true innovator, a true creative. May he rest in peace,"" tweeted uber-producer Pharrell Williams

Despite the edginess, Bowie's work still resonated with the mainstream. ""Heroes,"" in fact, later became a theme for many. The 2012 British Olympic team entered the stadium to the tune.

He even sang a Christmas song, ""The Little Drummer Boy,"" with the most mainstream of American crooners, Bing Crosby, on a 1977 TV special. There were no theatrics, no frills, just Bowie's pure voice meshing with one of the oldest of the Old Guard.

The '80s and beyond

The 1980s were a great time to be Bowie.

Starting with his collaboration with Queen on ""Under Pressure,"" he brilliantly reinvented himself to take full advantage of the music video era.

The 1983 ""Let's Dance"" album, produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, became his most commercially successful album, its sound and his look influencing a new generation of musicians. The videos for the album's singles, including the title cut and ""China Girl,"" were ubiquitous on the music video channel MTV.

Bowie, by then pushing 40, was as relevant as the era's power chord-slamming 20-somethings or synthesizer-playing Euro pop stars -- musicians for whom he'd paved the way.

Through it all, his Midas touch made classics of other people's songs. He produced Lou Reed's ""Transformer,"" with its hit ""Walk on the Wild Side,"" and Iggy Pop's ""Lust for Life,"" among others.

""David's friendship was the light of my life. I never met such a brilliant person. He was the best there is,"" Iggy Pop tweeted

He also innovated in the sale of his work. In 1997, he raised $55 million by promising investors income from his back catalog. The financial device, labeled the ""Bowie bond,"" was later used for artists such as James Brown and Marvin Gaye.

Bowie's output thinned in the 1990s and the 2000s, but he was no less envelope-pushing. He experimented with heavy metal, with industrial rock, and with drum and bass.

Expanded horizons

Bowie's theatricality wasn't limited to performing on stage. In 1976 he played the lead in Nicholas Roeg's film ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"" as -- perhaps appropriately -- an alien. Four years later, he portrayed Joseph Merrick, who'd been deformed by a medical condition, in Broadway's ""The Elephant Man.""

Bowie continued acting through most of his life, often drawn to unusual characters. He played a vampire in 1983's ""The Hunger,"" the Goblin King in 1986's ""Labyrinth,"" Pontius Pilate in 1988's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" and Andy Warhol (about whom Bowie had once written a song) in 1996's ""Basquiat.""

He wasn't above a little comedy, however. He had cameos in TV shows such as ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" and ""Extras"" and played himself in 2001's ""Zoolander.""

His androgynous look sometimes led to questions of his sexuality that, like his music, defied classification.

He told Playboy magazine in the 1970s that he was bisexual. He told Rolling Stone in the 1980s he had always been a ""closet heterosexual.""

""I was virtually trying anything. I really had a hunger to experience everything that life had to offer, from the opium den to whatever,"" he said. But, he added, he was ""not a particularly hedonistic person -- I tried my best. I was up there with the best of them. I pushed myself into areas just for experiment and bravado, to see what would happen. But, in the final analysis, it's not really me.""

'Zero to 60'

In 1992, Bowie married his second wife, model Iman. Their daughter, Alexandria, was born in 2000.

Bowie had some health problems in the early 2000s, including an emergency angioplasty in 2004.

He also stopped touring after the ""A Reality"" tour in 2003-04 and, until 2013's ""The Next Day,"" he hadn't put out an album in 10 years.

But recent months had seen signs of a Bowie re-emergence. Aside from ""The Next Day,"" he co-wrote the current stage play ""Lazarus,"" based on ""The Man Who Fell to Earth,"" and recorded and released ""Blackstar.""

As usual, he gave it his all.

""He'd just go from zero to 60 once we walked out of the control room and into the studio,"" drummer Mark Guiliana told Rolling Stone about the ""Blackstar"" sessions . ""And his vocal performances were always just stunning, amazing.""

Longtime producer Tony Visconti reportedly turned the tables on Friday, having fans sing ""Happy Birthday"" to Bowie over the phone during Visconti's live performance in New York.

Fox, who produced Bowie's musical ""Lazarus"" and knew the singer for 40 years, told CNN that Bowie was in good spirits when the pair met only weeks ago.

""He wasn't felling particularly well. I knew that I only had a brief moment,"" Fox said. ""But he was impeccable as ever. His manners were impeccable. And he talked about the future of the show. He talked a little about the treatment that he was going to start. And he was optimistic and hopeful and positive as ever.""

Bowie was always busy, always on to the next thing.

Twenty years ago, interviewed by Mick Brown of the UK Telegraph, he coolly assessed his past, but -- typically Bowie -- looked to the future.

At the time, he was reveling in the paintings of Damien Hirst and had plans for another project with producer Brian Eno. And there was no sense in waiting, he said.

When a supreme talent like Jon Stewart announces he’s giving up his chair at the end of year, it’s hard not to think in superlatives.

He was the guy who forced CNN to cancel Crossfire. His self-conscious irony fortified brand liberalism with gooey comedy goodness. He captured that weird balance between snark and sincerity that the fabled television demo — 18 to 34 year olds — seemed to crave.

The cognoscenti found him cool.

And he is cool. And consistently funny. I watch every episode. But consider:

The Daily Show is funniest when its segments expose institutional failures or make fun of the foibles of politicians and the government, not when it lampoons conservatives, who are easy targets. But since both Stewart and his writers are liberals who favor an activist government that redistributes wealth and one that uses regulation to curtail the rapacious interests of corporations, the show hits its targets by convincing viewers to have less faith in government. I think Stewart would object here and say that the cynicism is directed at politicians and the way they use government, but since politicians are the ones who run the government, the effect is the same. Call it the tragedy of great satire. This is why Stewart is not and could never be an activist.

Also:

** Around 2.5 million Americans per night watch The Daily Show. More than nine million tune in to NBC Nightly News. The influence of the people who watch the show is greater than the show's influence itself.

What's best about the show? It incubates talent. Steve Carell and Ed Helms, both actors. Colbert, of course. But John Oliver, too. The Corddry bothers, Rob and Nate.

culture,The Atlantic,0,https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/07/pandemic-young-adults-living-with-parents/613723/,The New Boomerang Kids Could Change American Views of Living at Home,2020-07-03,Joe Pinsker,"Moving in with your parents is often seen as a mark of irresponsibility . The pandemic might show the country that it shouldn ’ t be .
Photography by Caroline Tompkins Image above : Marielle Brenner , age 25 , in the living room of her parents ’ house in Melville , New York , in June . She moved back in with them after the economic fallout from the pandemic made her rent in Chicago unaffordable . For the most part , the pandemic has restricted motion in America . But one exception has been a large-scale nationwide reshuffling of humans between homes . Before the coronavirus came to the United States , many of the country ’ s young adults were working , studying , and building lives on their own . Now a great deal of them are back to living with their parents . The number of American adults who have returned to living at home is enormous . A recent analysis of government data by the real-estate website Zillow indicated that about 2.9 million adults moved in with a parent or grandparent in March , April , and May , if college students were included ; most of them were 25 or younger . Their sudden dispersal into their parents ’ homes is , for some , the result of the suspension of spring classes on college campuses and , for others , the result of miserable economic conditions . A survey from the Pew Research Center in March found that the younger an American adult is , the more likely that the pandemic has deprived them or someone in their household of work or earnings . Rent and other expenses got harder to cover , or simply to justify , for a large group of young people , so they moved home .
But focusing only on these explanations obscures a larger trend line . From the mid-1980s until the late 2000s , the share of 25-to-34-year-olds living at home hovered in the range of 10 to 12 percent , according to Census Bureau data . That figure did start to rise when the Great Recession began , but it continued to climb well after the recession was over . It hit 13 percent in 2010 , 15 percent in 2015 , and nearly 17 percent in 2018 . At the end of the 2010s , roughly 2 million more Americans in the 25-to-34 age group were living with their parents than at the beginning of the decade . That suggests that , independent of the Great Recession , something broader has changed in how people embark on their adult lives . “ More people are in education longer , and people marry and have their first child later than ever , ” Jeffrey Jensen Arnett , a psychology professor at Clark University , told me . “ You put those two things together , and you have more people either remaining home or moving back home than was true 40 or 50 years ago. ” Arnett came up with the label emerging adulthood for the open-ended developmental stage lasting roughly from age 18 to 29 , and wrote a book of the same name . ( Arsh Raziuddin / ███ ; Data : Census Bureau ) The rising median age of marriage can be partly explained by the rise in nonmarital cohabitation among romantic partners , as well as by the fact that for many couples , marriage has become “ a trophy ” —a rite that marks the completion of the early stages of adulthood , rather than the beginning of them . Meanwhile , the widespread availability of birth control gives couples more agency in electing to postpone parenthood . These trends add up to a longer period in many young people ’ s lives when they aren ’ t living with a partner or children , and thus might continue living with their parents .
The second large-scale shift has to do with education—or really , with the way education prepares people for their working life . As the economy has tilted over the past several decades toward knowledge-based work , people with only a high-school degree have fewer pathways to financial stability . When this is the case , two things happen : Many young people spend more time in college or graduate school , and those who don ’ t pursue higher education can have trouble finding work that pays well enough for them to live independently . Both of these trends , Arnett said , steer more people back to their parents . But in general , those with a college degree are less likely to live at home than those without one , as are women , who tend to have more education and get married earlier than men ; meanwhile , Black and Hispanic young adults are more likely to live at home than white ones . Read : The false stereotypes about Millennials who live at home Karen Fingerman , a human-development and family-sciences professor at the University of Texas at Austin , noted an additional factor that might be at play : As the share of parents who are married has declined , more solo parents might opt to live with their own parents , so they can have help raising their kids . Meanwhile , another contributor to living at home doesn ’ t directly have to do with considerations like child care or education—some families simply prefer to have multiple generations under the same roof . “ They co-reside because they want to , ” Fingerman told me .
Those are the long-term forces that built up the large population of people living at home before the pandemic , and the pandemic has only added more ( as well as , it should be noted , harming young people who no longer can afford rent , but don ’ t have parents who can take them in ) . The current surge in young people moving home , Arnett said , is likely to be the largest since the Great Depression . In normal times , when people move in with their parents , their choice is typically planned out at least a little while in advance . But this spring , decisions about where to live were made “ in the midst of a crisis , ” Fingerman pointed out . “ There was no thought—there was no , Gee , I want to live with my parents. ” The decision to move back out probably won ’ t be made so quickly . The high up-front costs of moving into a new apartment alone or with roommates , Fingerman said , might encourage people to stay put even when the threat of the pandemic wanes , especially if the economy is slow to recover . Read : The pandemic will cleave America in two Public-health crises aside , the rise in the share of young people living at home in the past decade and a half has coincided with an important development in family life . “ We were already shifting as a society toward stronger intergenerational bonds , ” Fingerman said , pointing to research indicating that today ’ s young adults are in more frequent contact with their parents , and receive more guidance from them on emotional and financial matters compared with young adults several decades ago . In general , Fingerman said these strengthened connections represent a rewarding , welcome shift . They bring new closeness , though they can also bring up old tensions .
As young people have settled into their parents ’ houses during the pandemic , one difficulty has been navigating a shared physical space . “ One thing I ’ ve been dedicating some time to in quarantine is learning how to play the drums , ” Fletcher Lowe , a 22-year-old new college graduate who recently moved back in with his family in Tulsa , Oklahoma , told me . “ I bought an electronic drum kit a few weeks ago . I ’ m trying to be sensitive to the fact that I ’ m inhabiting a house . But the thing is , even with a plastic drum kit , it ’ s still going to make a lot of noise because you ’ re hitting it quite hard. ” In the course of reporting this article , I spoke with a 21-year-old in Colorado who has been sleeping on a futon in the living room of a two-bedroom apartment he shares with his mother and grandmother ( “ It ’ s cramped , to be honest ” ) ; a 21-year-old in Virginia who felt constricted by reverting to a twin-size bed ( “ It ’ s not sustainable ” ) ; and an 18-year-old in Missouri who was limiting his daily trips out of the basement for snack retrieval , so as not to disturb his parents while they made work calls near the kitchen ( “ I just have to be careful now when I go upstairs ” ) .
Parents ’ homes do have their charms , though . Eric Rivera , a 30-year-old in Brooklyn who moved in with his parents in New Jersey last weekend , has been looking forward to “ weirdly enough , having a dishwasher and laundry—all these things that we don ’ t normally have in New York City. ” Marielle Brenner , a 25-year-old who recently relocated from Chicago to her parents ’ house on Long Island , is pleased to regain access to a backyard .

The pandemic has interrupted many young people ’ s sense of progress by forcing them to move home . During emerging adulthood , Arnett told me , young people lay the groundwork for the rest of their adult lives and generally aim to “ get liftoff. ” “ The crisis throws a wrench into whatever you were doing , whether it ’ s work or school , ” he said . “ That ’ s got to be deflating. ” Before the pandemic , Chrissy Walker and her roommates in New York came up with a slogan for the year : “ 2020 : Our year for sure. ” This motto was intended to guide Walker , 22 years old and less than a year out of college , and her roommates as they scouted out new apartments , plotted career moves , and planned vacations during this exciting new post-college phase of their life . The slogan didn ’ t age well : Walker is now living at home with her parents in a suburb of Austin , Texas . “ It just feels like you ’ re being jerked around , like you didn ’ t get a full start at things , ” she told me .
Rivera , the 30-year-old who just moved back to New Jersey , is further along in adulthood , but had a similar feeling . His vision for the next few years was to continue advancing his career in tech-industry communications ; move out of his shared apartment and get a place of his own ; and “ buy furniture that ’ s not from Wayfair—kind of these bigger steps that symbolize being more of an adult. ” But he was laid off in March , which led him to leave that shared apartment and move in with his parents for at least the rest of the year . A move home is an interruption for parents too . They ’ ve generally entered a phase in which , with their kids out of the house , “ they get to turn back to their own lives after a 20-or-so-year hiatus , ” Arnett said . Pandemic or not , having a child in the house again upsets their rhythms and impinges on their newly regained freedoms . “ Wherever we want to go , we go , ” Peter Walker , Chrissy ’ s father , who ’ s 55 , told me about what life was like after she went off to college . “ We work as long as we want to work . We go vacationing without consideration about whether Chrissy would like it or not. ” The pandemic has taken him out of a phase of life that was just as independent as the one his daughter was in . Read : It ’ s okay to be a different kind of parent during the pandemic Chrissy and her parents ’ tastes and habits have occasionally collided since her move back home . For instance , Chrissy would often get hungry at night and , as she ’ d been doing regularly while living on her own , cook some food for herself at 10:30 or 11 p.m. , which was a bother to her parents as they were going to bed . ( In Peter ’ s telling , it was more like midnight . ) “ It became this huge thing , a giant tiff , for two days , about me [ wanting to ] eat after 10:30 and them wanting to go to bed , ” Chrissy said . “ The sentiment was like , ‘ You ’ re our kid in our house ; these are our rules , ’ and it , to me , was like , ‘ Well , I ’ m not a kid , and I didn ’ t really ask to be in your house right now . ’ ”
There is a danger , Arnett said , that after a move back home , parents and children will lapse into their old roles . But at the same time , as adults , all parties have an opportunity to rewrite those roles . Indeed , the late-night-snacking conflict was resolved—Chrissy started eating earlier . But some tensions are much less easily dealt with . Jordan , a 23-year-old recent college graduate in rural North Carolina , came out to their parents as nonbinary last year , and recently moved home after being unable to find work because of the pandemic . “ My parents have come a long way in loving and supporting the LGBTQ+ community , but they still don ’ t use my pronouns all the time , ” Jordan told me in an email . They said they were considering , “ half as a joke but also half-serious , ” putting up a poster on their bedroom door indicating their pronouns . ( They asked that I not publish their last name , in order to avoid harassment . ) To some , the gaps between who they were when they left home and who they are now can feel unbridgeable . “ I ’ ve used this time away from my family [ to accept ] my sexuality and political and philosophical beliefs , [ most of which are different from theirs ] , ” Tiara Primus , a recent graduate of Southern Oregon University , told me when I asked her near the end of her senior year about the prospect of moving back in with her parents . “ Going back home would mean dumping all of that in a bag and hiding it in the closet. ” ( She ’ s currently living in a city not far from campus , in her friend ’ s mother ’ s home . )
Some of the regression to old family dynamics can be pleasurable , though . “ I watch the news with my mom a lot , ” Fletcher Lowe , the aspiring drummer , said . “ That ’ s something I did in high school . It ’ s kind of nice , the little routines that are reentering my life that haven ’ t been there for a while. ” Indeed , living at home doesn ’ t seem to harm most parent-child relationships . A 2011 Pew survey of 25-to-34-year-olds who lived at home found that about half of them said doing so had no effect on their relationship with their parents ; the remaining half was split almost evenly between those who said their relationships had gotten better and those who said their relationships had gotten worse . In emerging adulthood , people “ generally get along really well with their parents , much better than they did as adolescents , ” Arnett said , referencing hundreds of interviews he ’ s done with 18-to-29-year-olds and their parents over the years . “ The overwhelming consensus is , Man , we ’ re glad adolescence is over , because that was a contentious time. ” This opens up the possibility of wider-ranging conversations and deeper connection . Whereas teens are prone to hiding parts of themselves from their parents , Arnett said , emerging adults are usually more forthcoming . “ It ’ s really gratifying to their parents , because parenting is a lot of work , ” he told me . Parents ’ attitude , in his experience is : “ Now the payoff finally comes . ”
“ It ’ s been a blessing , ” Peter Walker said of having his daughter back home . “ We get to connect and chat whenever we ’ d like. ” Living at home also allows siblings to bond . “ My sister was in sixth grade when I left for college , and now she ’ s entering 10th grade , ” Lowe said . “ There ’ s a lot of growing up that happens between those four years , so getting to see her being a real person is really cool. ” When some young people move back home , they are also , like their parents , in the rewarding position of noting how their loved ones have matured . Whatever their family relationships might be like , young people who have moved home can struggle with the symbolism of no longer living independently . “ I was already clocking in for the obligatory mid-20s existential crisis right before the pandemic started , ” Marielle Brenner told me . She is 25 and , until recently , was living in Chicago , working a job that didn ’ t inspire her or pay particularly well . She had student-loan debt and started cat-sitting to supplement her income . Her parents—who live in Melville , New York—raised the possibility of her moving home . “ I was very resistant to that , just because of the idea that ’ s been ingrained in so many young Millennials that moving home with your parents is a step back , ” she told me . “ It ’ s the ideal to be self-sufficient and live on your own , have your own place , have a successful job . ”
When the pandemic forced many businesses to close this spring , Brenner ’ s roommate lost his source of income and had to move out . Unable to afford the rent on her own , she reluctantly concluded that returning to Melville made the most sense financially . “ I never imagined living at home as a 25-year-old , ” she told me the day after she moved in . “ That sentence just feels like a failure. ” Many of the other young adults I ’ ve interviewed recently feel the same way about moving back in with their parents , even though they recognize that the circumstances that led them to do it were entirely beyond their control . Read : The misfortune of graduating in 2020 This feeling of failure is hard to shake , because it ’ s the product of cultural programming . According to 2015 data from the Census Bureau , some 82 percent of American adults think that moving out of one ’ s parents ’ house is a “ somewhat , ” “ quite , ” or “ extremely ” important component of entering adulthood . The median age that survey respondents identified for reaching this turning point was 21 , and yet less than half of 21-year-olds had actually reached it . Young people who don ’ t reach this milestone “ on time ” are often stigmatized . In 2005 , Time magazine ran a feature about “ young adults who live off their parents , bounce from job to job and hop from mate to mate , ” and put on its cover a picture of a young man in business-casual attire sitting in a child-size sandbox . “ What are they waiting for ? Who are these permanent adolescents , these twentysomething Peter Pans ? ” the story inside asked . “ And why can ’ t they grow up ? ” The article proposed a nickname for this generation whose exceeding clunkiness thankfully kept it from sticking around : “ Twixters , ” so named for the state of being “ betwixt and between . ”
In many places around the world , living at home doesn ’ t carry some of the associations it does in the U.S. Fingerman , the UT Austin professor , brought up the examples of Spain and Italy , which have high rates of adults living at home ; in Italy , for instance , 66.5 percent of 25-to-29-year-olds were living with their parents in 2018 . She said this may be related to the availability of housing in those countries , but it is also related to cultural values . “ They find the arrangement rewarding , they enjoy one another , and it ’ s part of their family life , ” she said . Plenty of people living in the U.S. find the arrangement rewarding too . Moréna Espiritual , an artist and an educator in New York City who uses they/them pronouns and is in their 20s , has been living with their mother and , on and off , their grandmother since before the pandemic . Separately , Espiritual ’ s 33-year-old sister is married with two kids , and their 30-year-old brother has a partner ; all of those relatives share a home . “ My family is very focused on staying together to support each other , ” Espiritual told me . Espiritual feels like living with family expands their world rather than limiting it . “ I can still party ; I can still have [ meaningful ] conversations ” with peers , they said , “ but I ’ ll come back to my home , where also I have the perspective of people that are older than me. ” Their household and others like it expose the problems with the narrative that living at home is a failure . “ For me , specifically , and my family , being Dominican , and coming from a household of mostly Black and Indigenous people , the way we ’ ve been raised to relate to each other is more interdependent and communal , especially when most of your family are immigrants that arrive here and aren ’ t very aware of how to navigate American society , ” Espiritual said . “ People just learn how to establish and respect each other ’ s boundaries as they age , instead of moving away from each other. ” This philosophy of family life , Espiritual told me , is common among their friends in Puerto Rico as well as the Dominican Republic and Colombia , many of whom are in their 20s and live at home .
Read : The nuclear family was a mistake Espiritual thinks that many people confuse living independently with being mature . “ What does being grown mean ? Does living by yourself mean that you ’ re grown ? ” they said . “ Because I think I ’ ve learned how to better establish boundaries and communicate while living at home than some people who don ’ t. ” The conventional story about young people living at home misses that point . One could argue , as Espiritual effectively does , that the virtues of living at home have been swallowed up by popular middle-class American narratives about self-sufficiency and achievement . Discussions of young adults who live with their parents often focus on when they will leave , and what awaits them when they do , rather than what they can gain from life at home while there . Besides , the stigma associated with living at home is more grounded in the past than the present . “ Many people still hold the old normative expectations—you ’ re ‘ supposed to ’ become an adult by the time you ’ re 21 or 22—and haven ’ t adjusted to the new reality , ” Arnett said . “ I think parents and grandparents often look at today ’ s emerging adults and think , Now , at their age I was doing X , Y , and Z , and they seem to be nowhere near doing those things . What ’ s wrong with them ? They are rather egocentrically applying the norms of their youth to today , when those aren ’ t the norms anymore. ” Today ’ s young people are coming of age in a new era but still being judged by the standards of a previous one . The economic system that has led so many of them to move home in the past 15 years may well deserve criticism , but their response to it is rational .
In the 21st century , a better way to think about living at home , Arnett told me , is that it is in many cases involuntary but rarely stunting . Since Arnett started studying this life stage nearly 30 years ago , he ’ s seen the stigma around living at home weaken . One cause of this shift , he thinks , is the immigration patterns of the past few decades . In interviewing the families of young adults , Arnett has noticed that many immigrants from Asia , Africa , and Latin America are accustomed to different norms around living at home , and thus hold a more positive view of it . For some parents , he told me , “ It ’ s more of a worry … if their kids move out in their 20s : Don ’ t they like their parents ? Why are they moving into an apartment half a mile away ? What ’ s wrong with that household ? ” Another reason is simply that , as living at home becomes more common , people adjust to it . “ It becomes more normal , ” he said . “ We shrug and get used to it. ” In fact , the pandemic might produce even more shrugging , and further update notions of what living at home symbolizes . “ There ’ s a thing that we sometimes call ‘ cultural lag ’ —society begins to change , but our cultural beliefs take a little longer to catch up , ” Fingerman told me . “ I think that was happening already , but with this big increase in the number of young adults who are going to be residing with their parents , and with a very clear explanation for why that occurred , I think the culture will shift , and people will very much consider this a normal pattern now. ” This change in attitude may well be helped along by the fact that this recent wave of people moving home was the result of a truly unforeseeable global catastrophe that affected even those with credentials for and careers in previously healthy industries .
Marielle Brenner told me about the moment this spring when she let go of her opposition to moving home . She was videochatting with two friends on the West Coast . “ I don ’ t know why it didn ’ t click with me before , but they were like , ‘ No one will blame you if you ’ re moving home right now with your parents , ’ ” she said . “ I guess it was them that made it okay for me to allow myself to consider that decision. ” That said , she wonders what people will think of living at home after the pandemic . “ If and when things get back to some sort of normal and unemployment goes down , ” she said , “ I have the fear that I will continue to stay here and it will be perceived as lazy. ” She has good reason to fear that . Writing in April in ███ , the sociologists Victor Tan Chen and Ofer Sharone predicted , based on their two decades of research on unemployed workers , that the initial phase of widespread “ solidarity and compassion for the millions who have lost their jobs ” because of the pandemic will be followed by a resurgence of “ the old stigmas against unemployed workers … as memories of the initial crisis fade and people find new reasons to fault others for not pulling themselves up by their bootstraps. ” Public attitudes toward people who moved home during the pandemic could follow the same pattern : sympathy now , judgment later . ( Likewise , Arnett thinks that stereotypes about irresponsible young people are “ remarkably sturdy. ” ) But maybe , this time , people will really start to embrace the new timelines of emerging adulthood . “ More than ever , there ’ s no reason to hurry into adult life and set artificial deadlines , ” Arnett said . “ The norms for when you get married , have children , become fully employed , are a lot more relaxed than they used to be . Now we can use that to our advantage and take some of the pressure off. ” Maybe this unhurried and understanding mentality will be the one that guides the people currently living at home when , 20 or 30 years from now , their own children are the ones doing the same .","Moving in with your parents is often seen as a mark of irresponsibility. The pandemic might show the country that it shouldn’t be.

Photography by Caroline Tompkins Image above: Marielle Brenner, age 25, in the living room of her parents’ house in Melville, New York, in June. She moved back in with them after the economic fallout from the pandemic made her rent in Chicago unaffordable. For the most part, the pandemic has restricted motion in America. But one exception has been a large-scale nationwide reshuffling of humans between homes. Before the coronavirus came to the United States, many of the country’s young adults were working, studying, and building lives on their own. Now a great deal of them are back to living with their parents. The number of American adults who have returned to living at home is enormous. A recent analysis of government data by the real-estate website Zillow indicated that about 2.9 million adults moved in with a parent or grandparent in March, April, and May, if college students were included; most of them were 25 or younger. Their sudden dispersal into their parents’ homes is, for some, the result of the suspension of spring classes on college campuses and, for others, the result of miserable economic conditions. A survey from the Pew Research Center in March found that the younger an American adult is, the more likely that the pandemic has deprived them or someone in their household of work or earnings. Rent and other expenses got harder to cover, or simply to justify, for a large group of young people, so they moved home.

But focusing only on these explanations obscures a larger trend line. From the mid-1980s until the late 2000s, the share of 25-to-34-year-olds living at home hovered in the range of 10 to 12 percent, according to Census Bureau data. That figure did start to rise when the Great Recession began, but it continued to climb well after the recession was over. It hit 13 percent in 2010, 15 percent in 2015, and nearly 17 percent in 2018. At the end of the 2010s, roughly 2 million more Americans in the 25-to-34 age group were living with their parents than at the beginning of the decade. That suggests that, independent of the Great Recession, something broader has changed in how people embark on their adult lives. “More people are in education longer, and people marry and have their first child later than ever,” Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, a psychology professor at Clark University, told me. “You put those two things together, and you have more people either remaining home or moving back home than was true 40 or 50 years ago.” Arnett came up with the label emerging adulthood for the open-ended developmental stage lasting roughly from age 18 to 29, and wrote a book of the same name. (Arsh Raziuddin / The Atlantic; Data: Census Bureau) The rising median age of marriage can be partly explained by the rise in nonmarital cohabitation among romantic partners, as well as by the fact that for many couples, marriage has become “a trophy”—a rite that marks the completion of the early stages of adulthood, rather than the beginning of them. Meanwhile, the widespread availability of birth control gives couples more agency in electing to postpone parenthood. These trends add up to a longer period in many young people’s lives when they aren’t living with a partner or children, and thus might continue living with their parents.

The second large-scale shift has to do with education—or really, with the way education prepares people for their working life. As the economy has tilted over the past several decades toward knowledge-based work, people with only a high-school degree have fewer pathways to financial stability. When this is the case, two things happen: Many young people spend more time in college or graduate school, and those who don’t pursue higher education can have trouble finding work that pays well enough for them to live independently. Both of these trends, Arnett said, steer more people back to their parents. But in general, those with a college degree are less likely to live at home than those without one, as are women, who tend to have more education and get married earlier than men; meanwhile, Black and Hispanic young adults are more likely to live at home than white ones. Read: The false stereotypes about Millennials who live at home Karen Fingerman, a human-development and family-sciences professor at the University of Texas at Austin, noted an additional factor that might be at play: As the share of parents who are married has declined, more solo parents might opt to live with their own parents, so they can have help raising their kids. Meanwhile, another contributor to living at home doesn’t directly have to do with considerations like child care or education—some families simply prefer to have multiple generations under the same roof. “They co-reside because they want to,” Fingerman told me.

Those are the long-term forces that built up the large population of people living at home before the pandemic, and the pandemic has only added more (as well as, it should be noted, harming young people who no longer can afford rent, but don’t have parents who can take them in). The current surge in young people moving home, Arnett said, is likely to be the largest since the Great Depression. In normal times, when people move in with their parents, their choice is typically planned out at least a little while in advance. But this spring, decisions about where to live were made “in the midst of a crisis,” Fingerman pointed out. “There was no thought—there was no, Gee, I want to live with my parents.” The decision to move back out probably won’t be made so quickly. The high up-front costs of moving into a new apartment alone or with roommates, Fingerman said, might encourage people to stay put even when the threat of the pandemic wanes, especially if the economy is slow to recover. Read: The pandemic will cleave America in two Public-health crises aside, the rise in the share of young people living at home in the past decade and a half has coincided with an important development in family life. “We were already shifting as a society toward stronger intergenerational bonds,” Fingerman said, pointing to research indicating that today’s young adults are in more frequent contact with their parents, and receive more guidance from them on emotional and financial matters compared with young adults several decades ago. In general, Fingerman said these strengthened connections represent a rewarding, welcome shift. They bring new closeness, though they can also bring up old tensions.

As young people have settled into their parents’ houses during the pandemic, one difficulty has been navigating a shared physical space. “One thing I’ve been dedicating some time to in quarantine is learning how to play the drums,” Fletcher Lowe, a 22-year-old new college graduate who recently moved back in with his family in Tulsa, Oklahoma, told me. “I bought an electronic drum kit a few weeks ago. I’m trying to be sensitive to the fact that I’m inhabiting a house. But the thing is, even with a plastic drum kit, it’s still going to make a lot of noise because you’re hitting it quite hard.” In the course of reporting this article, I spoke with a 21-year-old in Colorado who has been sleeping on a futon in the living room of a two-bedroom apartment he shares with his mother and grandmother (“It’s cramped, to be honest”); a 21-year-old in Virginia who felt constricted by reverting to a twin-size bed (“It’s not sustainable”); and an 18-year-old in Missouri who was limiting his daily trips out of the basement for snack retrieval, so as not to disturb his parents while they made work calls near the kitchen (“I just have to be careful now when I go upstairs”).

Parents’ homes do have their charms, though. Eric Rivera, a 30-year-old in Brooklyn who moved in with his parents in New Jersey last weekend, has been looking forward to “weirdly enough, having a dishwasher and laundry—all these things that we don’t normally have in New York City.” Marielle Brenner, a 25-year-old who recently relocated from Chicago to her parents’ house on Long Island, is pleased to regain access to a backyard. Read: Revenge of the suburbs This mix of inconveniences and luxuries forms the physical backdrop for a bigger drama—the sometimes fraught, sometimes liberating renegotiations of parent-child relationships, now that the child isn’t actually a child anymore. The pandemic has interrupted many young people’s sense of progress by forcing them to move home. During emerging adulthood, Arnett told me, young people lay the groundwork for the rest of their adult lives and generally aim to “get liftoff.” “The crisis throws a wrench into whatever you were doing, whether it’s work or school,” he said. “That’s got to be deflating.” Before the pandemic, Chrissy Walker and her roommates in New York came up with a slogan for the year: “2020: Our year for sure.” This motto was intended to guide Walker, 22 years old and less than a year out of college, and her roommates as they scouted out new apartments, plotted career moves, and planned vacations during this exciting new post-college phase of their life. The slogan didn’t age well: Walker is now living at home with her parents in a suburb of Austin, Texas. “It just feels like you’re being jerked around, like you didn’t get a full start at things,” she told me.

Rivera, the 30-year-old who just moved back to New Jersey, is further along in adulthood, but had a similar feeling. His vision for the next few years was to continue advancing his career in tech-industry communications; move out of his shared apartment and get a place of his own; and “buy furniture that’s not from Wayfair—kind of these bigger steps that symbolize being more of an adult.” But he was laid off in March, which led him to leave that shared apartment and move in with his parents for at least the rest of the year. A move home is an interruption for parents too. They’ve generally entered a phase in which, with their kids out of the house, “they get to turn back to their own lives after a 20-or-so-year hiatus,” Arnett said. Pandemic or not, having a child in the house again upsets their rhythms and impinges on their newly regained freedoms. “Wherever we want to go, we go,” Peter Walker, Chrissy’s father, who’s 55, told me about what life was like after she went off to college. “We work as long as we want to work. We go vacationing without consideration about whether Chrissy would like it or not.” The pandemic has taken him out of a phase of life that was just as independent as the one his daughter was in. Read: It’s okay to be a different kind of parent during the pandemic Chrissy and her parents’ tastes and habits have occasionally collided since her move back home. For instance, Chrissy would often get hungry at night and, as she’d been doing regularly while living on her own, cook some food for herself at 10:30 or 11 p.m., which was a bother to her parents as they were going to bed. (In Peter’s telling, it was more like midnight.) “It became this huge thing, a giant tiff, for two days, about me [wanting to] eat after 10:30 and them wanting to go to bed,” Chrissy said. “The sentiment was like, ‘You’re our kid in our house; these are our rules,’ and it, to me, was like, ‘Well, I’m not a kid, and I didn’t really ask to be in your house right now.’”

There is a danger, Arnett said, that after a move back home, parents and children will lapse into their old roles. But at the same time, as adults, all parties have an opportunity to rewrite those roles. Indeed, the late-night-snacking conflict was resolved—Chrissy started eating earlier. But some tensions are much less easily dealt with. Jordan, a 23-year-old recent college graduate in rural North Carolina, came out to their parents as nonbinary last year, and recently moved home after being unable to find work because of the pandemic. “My parents have come a long way in loving and supporting the LGBTQ+ community, but they still don’t use my pronouns all the time,” Jordan told me in an email. They said they were considering, “half as a joke but also half-serious,” putting up a poster on their bedroom door indicating their pronouns. (They asked that I not publish their last name, in order to avoid harassment.) To some, the gaps between who they were when they left home and who they are now can feel unbridgeable. “I’ve used this time away from my family [to accept] my sexuality and political and philosophical beliefs, [most of which are different from theirs],” Tiara Primus, a recent graduate of Southern Oregon University, told me when I asked her near the end of her senior year about the prospect of moving back in with her parents. “Going back home would mean dumping all of that in a bag and hiding it in the closet.” (She’s currently living in a city not far from campus, in her friend’s mother’s home.)

Some of the regression to old family dynamics can be pleasurable, though. “I watch the news with my mom a lot,” Fletcher Lowe, the aspiring drummer, said. “That’s something I did in high school. It’s kind of nice, the little routines that are reentering my life that haven’t been there for a while.” Indeed, living at home doesn’t seem to harm most parent-child relationships.

According to 2015 data from the Census Bureau, some 82 percent of American adults think that moving out of one’s parents’ house is a “somewhat,” “quite,” or “extremely” important component of entering adulthood. The median age that survey respondents identified for reaching this turning point was 21, and yet less than half of 21-year-olds had actually reached it. Young people who don’t reach this milestone “on time” are often stigmatized. In 2005, Time magazine ran a feature about “young adults who live off their parents, bounce from job to job and hop from mate to mate,” and put on its cover a picture of a young man in business-casual attire sitting in a child-size sandbox. “What are they waiting for? Who are these permanent adolescents, these twentysomething Peter Pans?” the story inside asked. “And why can’t they grow up?” The article proposed a nickname for this generation whose exceeding clunkiness thankfully kept it from sticking around: “Twixters,” so named for the state of being “betwixt and between.”

In many places around the world, living at home doesn’t carry some of the associations it does in the U.S. Fingerman, the UT Austin professor, brought up the examples of Spain and Italy, which have high rates of adults living at home; in Italy, for instance, 66.5 percent of 25-to-29-year-olds were living with their parents in 2018. She said this may be related to the availability of housing in those countries, but it is also related to cultural values. “They find the arrangement rewarding, they enjoy one another, and it’s part of their family life,” she said. Plenty of people living in the U.S. find the arrangement rewarding too. Moréna Espiritual, an artist and an educator in New York City who uses they/them pronouns and is in their 20s, has been living with their mother and, on and off, their grandmother since before the pandemic. Separately, Espiritual’s 33-year-old sister is married with two kids, and their 30-year-old brother has a partner; all of those relatives share a home. “My family is very focused on staying together to support each other,” Espiritual told me. Espiritual feels like living with family expands their world rather than limiting it. “I can still party; I can still have [meaningful] conversations” with peers, they said, “but I’ll come back to my home, where also I have the perspective of people that are older than me.” Their household and others like it expose the problems with the narrative that living at home is a failure. “For me, specifically, and my family, being Dominican, and coming from a household of mostly Black and Indigenous people, the way we’ve been raised to relate to each other is more interdependent and communal, especially when most of your family are immigrants that arrive here and aren’t very aware of how to navigate American society,” Espiritual said. “People just learn how to establish and respect each other’s boundaries as they age, instead of moving away from each other.” This philosophy of family life, Espiritual told me, is common among their friends in Puerto Rico as well as the Dominican Republic and Colombia, many of whom are in their 20s and live at home.

Read: The nuclear family was a mistake Espiritual thinks that many people confuse living independently with being mature. “What does being grown mean? Does living by yourself mean that you’re grown?” they said. “Because I think I’ve learned how to better establish boundaries and communicate while living at home than some people who don’t.” The conventional story about young people living at home misses that point. One could argue, as Espiritual effectively does, that the virtues of living at home have been swallowed up by popular middle-class American narratives about self-sufficiency and achievement. Discussions of young adults who live with their parents often focus on when they will leave, and what awaits them when they do, rather than what they can gain from life at home while there. Besides, the stigma associated with living at home is more grounded in the past than the present. “Many people still hold the old normative expectations—you’re ‘supposed to’ become an adult by the time you’re 21 or 22—and haven’t adjusted to the new reality,” Arnett said. “I think parents and grandparents often look at today’s emerging adults and think, Now, at their age I was doing X, Y, and Z, and they seem to be nowhere near doing those things. What’s wrong with them? They are rather egocentrically applying the norms of their youth to today, when those aren’t the norms anymore.” Today’s young people are coming of age in a new era but still being judged by the standards of a previous one. The economic system that has led so many of them to move home in the past 15 years may well deserve criticism, but their response to it is rational.

In the 21st century, a better way to think about living at home, Arnett told me, is that it is in many cases involuntary but rarely stunting. Since Arnett started studying this life stage nearly 30 years ago, he’s seen the stigma around living at home weaken. One cause of this shift, he thinks, is the immigration patterns of the past few decades. In interviewing the families of young adults, Arnett has noticed that many immigrants from Asia, Africa, and Latin America are accustomed to different norms around living at home, and thus hold a more positive view of it. For some parents, he told me, “It’s more of a worry … if their kids move out in their 20s: Don’t they like their parents? Why are they moving into an apartment half a mile away? What’s wrong with that household?” Another reason is simply that, as living at home becomes more common, people adjust to it. “It becomes more normal,” he said. “We shrug and get used to it.” In fact, the pandemic might produce even more shrugging, and further update notions of what living at home symbolizes. “There’s a thing that we sometimes call ‘cultural lag’—society begins to change, but our cultural beliefs take a little longer to catch up,” Fingerman told me. “I think that was happening already, but with this big increase in the number of young adults who are going to be residing with their parents, and with a very clear explanation for why that occurred, I think the culture will shift, and people will very much consider this a normal pattern now.” This change in attitude may well be helped along by the fact that this recent wave of people moving home was the result of a truly unforeseeable global catastrophe that affected even those with credentials for and careers in previously healthy industries.

Marielle Brenner told me about the moment this spring when she let go of her opposition to moving home. She was videochatting with two friends on the West Coast. “I don’t know why it didn’t click with me before, but they were like, ‘No one will blame you if you’re moving home right now with your parents,’” she said. “I guess it was them that made it okay for me to allow myself to consider that decision.” That said, she wonders what people will think of living at home after the pandemic. “If and when things get back to some sort of normal and unemployment goes down,” she said, “I have the fear that I will continue to stay here and it will be perceived as lazy.” She has good reason to fear that. Writing in April in The Atlantic, the sociologists Victor Tan Chen and Ofer Sharone predicted, based on their two decades of research on unemployed workers, that the initial phase of widespread “solidarity and compassion for the millions who have lost their jobs” because of the pandemic will be followed by a resurgence of “the old stigmas against unemployed workers … as memories of the initial crisis fade and people find new reasons to fault others for not pulling themselves up by their bootstraps.” Public attitudes toward people who moved home during the pandemic could follow the same pattern: sympathy now, judgment later. (Likewise, Arnett thinks that stereotypes about irresponsible young people are “remarkably sturdy.”) But maybe, this time, people will really start to embrace the new timelines of emerging adulthood. “More than ever, there’s no reason to hurry into adult life and set artificial deadlines,” Arnett said. “The norms for when you get married, have children, become fully employed, are a lot more relaxed than they used to be. Now we can use that to our advantage and take some of the pressure off.” Maybe this unhurried and understanding mentality will be the one that guides the people currently living at home when, 20 or 30 years from now, their own children are the ones doing the same.",www.theatlantic.com,left,Tu31CIOCLGUvXGah

culture,Reuters,1,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-charlesmanson/mass-killer-cult-leader-charles-manson-dies-at-83-idUSKBN1DK0JD,"Mass killer, cult leader Charles Manson dies at 83",2017-11-20,Diane Bartz,"( ███ ) - Charles Manson , the wild-eyed cult leader who orchestrated a string of gruesome killings in Southern California by his “ family ” of young followers , shattering the peace-and-love ethos of the late 1960s , died on Sunday , prison officials said . He was 83 .
Manson died of natural causes Sunday evening at a Kern County hospital , the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement . It gave no further details of the circumstances surrounding his death .
He had been serving a life sentence at the nearby Corcoran State Prison for ordering the murders of nine people , including actress Sharon Tate .
Long after Manson had largely faded from headlines , he loomed large as a symbol of the terror he unleashed in the summer of 1969 .
“ The very name Manson has become a metaphor for evil , ” the late Vincent Bugliosi , who prosecuted Manson , told the Los Angeles Times in 1994 .
A recent photograph showed the gray-bearded killer ’ s face still bearing the scar of a swastika he carved into his forehead decades earlier .
Manson became one of the 20th century ’ s most notorious criminals when he directed his mostly young , female followers to murder seven people in what prosecutors said was part of a plan to incite a race war .
Tate , aged 26 and eight months pregnant , was stabbed 16 times in the early morning hours of Aug. 9 , 1969 , by members of Manson ’ s cult at the rented hillside house she shared with her husband , filmmaker Roman Polanski , in the Benedict Canyon area of Los Angeles .
Four friends of the celebrity couple , including coffee heiress Abigail Folger and hairstylist Jay Sebring , were also stabbed or shot to death that night by Manson followers , who scrawled the word “ Pig ” in blood on the home ’ s front door before leaving . Polanski was away in Europe at the time .
The following night , members of Manson ’ s group stabbed grocery owner Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary to death , using their blood to write , “ Death to Pigs ” and “ Healter Skelter ” - a misspelled reference to the Beatles song “ Helter Skelter ” - on the walls and refrigerator door .
Although Manson did not personally kill any of the seven victims , he was found guilty of ordering their murders .
He was later convicted of ordering the murders of music teacher Gary Hinman , stabbed to death in July 1969 , and stuntman Donald “ Shorty ” Shea , stabbed and bludgeoned that August .
Manson was sentenced to death for the Tate-LaBianca murders , but his sentence was commuted to life in prison after the California Supreme Court abolished capital punishment in the state in 1972 .
Born Charles Milles Maddox on Nov. 12 , 1934 , in Cincinnati to a 16-year-old girl , Manson spent much of his youth shuttled between relatives and juvenile detention halls . By age 13 , he had been convicted of armed robbery .
Newly paroled from prison in 1967 , he began attracting members of his “ family ” in San Francisco ’ s Haight-Ashbury district , which had become a haven for the hippie youth culture .
The group moved with his followers to the Los Angeles area , eventually settling at Spahn Ranch , site of an outdoor movie location used for Western films and TV shows . Communal sex and drug use were a way of life as Manson became a messiah to the runaways , outcasts and criminals drawn by his charisma , intimidation and twisted spiritualism .
One follower told authorities she had seen Manson bring a bird back to life by breathing on it . Another said he could see and hear everything she did and said .
Manson aspired to be a rock star , and through one of his followers befriended Dennis Wilson , drummer of the Beach Boys , who would go on base their 1969 song “ Never Learn Not to Love ” on a Manson composition .
Wilson introduced Manson to music producer Terry Melcher , who later snubbed him . Melcher , along with his then-girlfriend , actress Candice Bergen , had previously rented the Benedict Canyon house .

He was 83.

Manson died of natural causes Sunday evening at a Kern County hospital, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement. It gave no further details of the circumstances surrounding his death.

He had been serving a life sentence at the nearby Corcoran State Prison for ordering the murders of nine people, including actress Sharon Tate.

Long after Manson had largely faded from headlines, he loomed large as a symbol of the terror he unleashed in the summer of 1969.

“The very name Manson has become a metaphor for evil,” the late Vincent Bugliosi, who prosecuted Manson, told the Los Angeles Times in 1994.

A recent photograph showed the gray-bearded killer’s face still bearing the scar of a swastika he carved into his forehead decades earlier.

Manson became one of the 20th century’s most notorious criminals when he directed his mostly young, female followers to murder seven people in what prosecutors said was part of a plan to incite a race war.

GRAFFITI WITH VICTIMS’ BLOOD

Tate, aged 26 and eight months pregnant, was stabbed 16 times in the early morning hours of Aug. 9, 1969, by members of Manson’s cult at the rented hillside house she shared with her husband, filmmaker Roman Polanski, in the Benedict Canyon area of Los Angeles.

Four friends of the celebrity couple, including coffee heiress Abigail Folger and hairstylist Jay Sebring, were also stabbed or shot to death that night by Manson followers, who scrawled the word “Pig” in blood on the home’s front door before leaving. Polanski was away in Europe at the time.

The following night, members of Manson’s group stabbed grocery owner Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary to death, using their blood to write, “Death to Pigs” and “Healter Skelter” - a misspelled reference to the Beatles song “Helter Skelter” - on the walls and refrigerator door.

Although Manson did not personally kill any of the seven victims, he was found guilty of ordering their murders.

He was later convicted of ordering the murders of music teacher Gary Hinman, stabbed to death in July 1969, and stuntman Donald “Shorty” Shea, stabbed and bludgeoned that August.

Manson was sentenced to death for the Tate-LaBianca murders, but his sentence was commuted to life in prison after the California Supreme Court abolished capital punishment in the state in 1972.

Born Charles Milles Maddox on Nov. 12, 1934, in Cincinnati to a 16-year-old girl, Manson spent much of his youth shuttled between relatives and juvenile detention halls. By age 13, he had been convicted of armed robbery.

Newly paroled from prison in 1967, he began attracting members of his “family” in San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury district, which had become a haven for the hippie youth culture.

The group moved with his followers to the Los Angeles area, eventually settling at Spahn Ranch, site of an outdoor movie location used for Western films and TV shows. Communal sex and drug use were a way of life as Manson became a messiah to the runaways, outcasts and criminals drawn by his charisma, intimidation and twisted spiritualism.

One follower told authorities she had seen Manson bring a bird back to life by breathing on it. Another said he could see and hear everything she did and said.

Manson aspired to be a rock star, and through one of his followers befriended Dennis Wilson, drummer of the Beach Boys, who would go on base their 1969 song “Never Learn Not to Love” on a Manson composition.

Wilson introduced Manson to music producer Terry Melcher, who later snubbed him. Melcher, along with his then-girlfriend, actress Candice Bergen, had previously rented the Benedict Canyon house.

The brutality of the killings stunned the nation.

“There was a lot of fear,” Bugliosi, author of the chilling book about the murders, “Helter Skelter,” told the Times in 1994. “The words printed in blood made it especially frightening for the Hollywood crowd.”

SENSATIONAL TRIAL

Denied his request to represent himself during his 9-1/2 month trial, Manson showed up in court with an “X” carved into his forehead, and would later alter it into a swastika.

Co-defendants Susan Atkins, Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel cut “X”s in their foreheads, shaved their scalps, sang Manson-written songs and giggled through chilling testimony.

At one point, Manson tried to leap over the defense table at the judge, snarling: “In the name of Christian justice, someone should cut your head off.” The judge began carrying a gun afterward.

Manson ultimately was brought down by his followers. Atkins told two inmates about the Tate-LaBianca murders while she was jailed in an unrelated killing, then testified to a grand jury before recanting. Prosecutors then persuaded another follower, Linda Kasabian, to testify against the rest of the group in exchange for immunity.

Convicted along with Manson, his three co-defendants, Atkins, Van Houten and Krenwinkel, also had their death sentences reduced to life terms.

Manson long maintained his innocence, telling Rolling Stone magazine that follower Charles “Tex” Watson was responsible for the Tate-LaBianca killings. Watson was tried separately and is serving a life term for his role in those killings.

Still, Manson seemed resigned to a life of incarceration, ceasing to even attend his parole review hearings after 1997.

Actress Marilu Henner recalls how elated she was to see her longtime friend Robin Williams looking so fit on the set of The Crazy Ones this spring.

""I could not believe how handsome and healthy he seemed,"" Henner says. ""You can tell that about someone right away. He seemed to have this aura about him.""

""But you don't really know what lies beneath,"" Henner says, choking up. ""It makes me so sad that it came to this.""

Williams was found dead in his Marin County, Calif., home Monday in an apparent suicide. Henner says the friend she started out in the business with in the late 1970s (Williams on the hit show Mork & Mindy, Henner on Taxi) seemed to be firing on all cylinders.

Williams had asked for her to appear on The Crazy Ones season finale as his ex-wife. He embraced Henner on the set when she arrived and then demanded to see pictures of her family on her smartphone.

( CNN ) This Fourth of July weekend , which finds much of America reeling from a rocky first half of 2020 , the mainstream and social media hype can be summed up in three words : `` Hamilton '' is back . The play has won 11 Tony Awards and a Pulitzer Prize for drama , and , according to Forbes , has generated over $ 1 billion in income from Broadway/London/United States tour ticket sales , publishing , cast recording and merchandising . A filmed version was released on the Disney+ streaming service on Friday .
But clearly it has landed in a different landscape from 2015 , when `` Hamilton '' premiered on Broadway . What Lauren Michele Jackson , writing in the New Yorker , calls the `` righteous , multicultural patriotism '' of the play seems now at odds with Black Lives Matter 's strident call for radical change to an America where the legacy of white supremacy lives on . In addition to demanding an end to anti-Black violence from police , many protesters have focused on removing or toppling various statues and monuments of Confederate leaders , as well as Andrew Jackson , Teddy Roosevelt , Christopher Columbus and even one of Abraham Lincoln , because of their symbolism .
Some eyebrows were raised when `` Hamilton 's '' creator and lead actor , Lin-Manuel Miranda , and its producer , Jeffrey Seller , admitted in late May that they were guilty of the `` moral failure '' of not speaking up about the George Floyd protests . Last week , in a profile published in WSJ Magazine , Miranda 's father , Democratic political consultant Luis Miranda , spoke vaguely of having reached out to Black Lives Matter leaders `` to begin to have dialogue '' about how Hamilton and its `` family '' can work together with them .
But while there has been at least one report of the use of a `` Hamilton '' quote `` History is watching '' at a BLM protest , to reassess `` Hamilton '' now is to note a crucial incompatibility with our current moment : Its hero and its message are essentially ambivalent while today 's politics around America 's racial sins requires taking a strong stance . Indeed , `` Hamilton '' is a minefield of mixed messages : Is our takeaway about its main character that he is a revolutionary hero or flawed philanderer ? Is its strategy of non-traditional casting a triumph that allows people of color to `` rise up '' or are they undermined by the irony of how their embodiment as founding fathers ignores the fact that most of the characters they play were slave owners ?
`` Hamilton '' was the perfect play for the Obama era because it fed into Democratic liberalism 's shift away from heroes like Thomas Jefferson -- who represented a figure of rugged pastoral individualism -- to Hamilton , the master banker/whiz kid financial planner . Miranda crafts `` Hamilton '' as an immigrant `` who gets the job done , '' an outsider . But Hamilton in reality faced none of the discrimination wielded against immigrants that he is drawn as a model for : for example , he had his elite education at Kings College in New York paid for by a trading company in his Caribbean island of St. Croix that had some dealings with the slave trade .
The ambivalence of Hamilton in the play is camouflaged by the love story at its center that seems also to be at the core of its appeal . First , his romance with Elizabeth Schuyler distracts our attention from the fact that the Schuylers were one of the largest and most notorious slave-owning families in New York state . The name is so scandalous that last month the mayor of Albany ordered the removal of a statue honoring Phillip Schuyler , Hamilton 's father-in-law .
A similar bit of camouflage is carried out in the scene where Hamilton has an extramarital affair with Maria Reynolds . The distracting hand-wringing over his betrayal happens as he is engaged in debates over the ratification of the Constitution . The story focuses on his desire to create a central bank to assume all debts -- at one point he taunts Jefferson by saying `` your debts are paid cuz you do n't pay for labor ... so we get Congress get held hostage by the South . '' But the drama over Reynolds glosses over his failure to speak out against the three-fifths compromise , which allowed Southern states to count Black people as three-fifths of a person for representation purposes .
While the play `` Hamilton '' has certainly acted as a positive vehicle for the exposure and success of people of color on Broadway , their subversive casting as white founders effectively erases the 14 % of late 18th-century Black residents who were mostly enslaved in New York and for whom such vaunted positions were unimaginable .
One could argue that `` Hamilton '' does not seek to fundamentally alter society with its feel-good version of the Revolution , especially since the values and triumphs it celebrates are drawn entirely from founding fathers who mainly did not consider people of color to be human .

culture,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/11/29/retailers-usher-in-holiday-shopping-season-as-black-friday-morphs-into/,Black Friday violence reported as retailers usher in start of holiday shopping season,2013-11-29,,"Despite some major retailers luring bargain-hunters with holiday savings since Halloween , major department stores reported strong traffic on Black Friday even though for many , the seasonal rush to attract shoppers began in earnest on Thanksgiving .
The holiday shopping season kicked off much earlier this year , as several retailers opened their stores on Thanksgiving Day optimistic that the added day might increase sales in what is typically the biggest shopping day of the year .
Retailers did not provide specific numbers , but Walmart and Target reported strong Thanksgiving Day traffic in stores and online , noting that shoppers were focused on big-ticket electronics like big-screen TVs and Xbox One , The Wall Street Journal reported .
In the past few years , retailers have pushed opening times into Thanksgiving night . They 've also pushed up discounting that used to be reserved for Black Friday into early November , which has led retail experts to question whether the Thanksgiving openings will steal some of Black Friday 's thunder .
The Journal report said Walmart recorded more than 10 million register transactions between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Thursday and nearly 400 million page views on Walmart.com . Target also said sales were among the highest ever online .
Overall , The National Retail Federation expects retail sales to be up 3.9 percent to $ 602.1 billion during the last two months of the year . That 's higher than last year 's 3.5 percent growth , but below the 6 percent pace seen before the recession .
Analysts expect sales to be generated at the expense of profits as retailers will likely have to do more discounting to get people into stores .
About 15,000 shoppers were at Macy 's Herald Square in New York City right before the doors opened , estimated Terry Lundgren , CEO , president and chairman of the department store chain . Last year , the store had 11,000 people right before the midnight opening .
Lundgren , who was at the entrance , told The Associated Press that the retailer knew it had to open when it found out other competitors were planning to open on Thanksgiving night . He also said it received positive feedback from its employees . `` We 're a competitive group , '' he said . `` It 's very clear they ( the shoppers ) want to be here at 8 p.m . ''
The store was featuring 375 doorbusters , up from last year 's 200 . Some of the deals included $ 79.99 jackets originally priced from $ 195 to $ 250 , and cashmere sweaters for $ 39 , marked down from 129 .
Shelby Wheatley , 17 , was with her mother , her mother 's friend and her best friend , who all traveled from Orlando , Fla. Wheatley was looking for a prom dress and wanted to buy it in New York .
`` I did Black Friday-but never Thursday -- and never in New York , '' she said .
As for Thanksgiving , the group celebrated early with family last week .
The Thanksgiving openings are part of retailers ' holiday strategy of trying to lure shoppers in early and often during the holiday shopping season . But the stores face challenges in doing that .
Some workers have petitions on change.org to protest against Target and Best Buy . The Retail Action Project , a labor-backed group of retail workers , also is planning to have members visiting customers at stores including Gap and Victoria 's Secret in Manhattan to educate them about the demands on workers .
Walmart has been the biggest target for protests against holiday hours . Most of the company 's stores are open 24 hours , but the retailer is starting its sales events at 6 p.m. on Thursday , two hours earlier than last year .
The issue is part of a broader campaign against the company 's treatment of workers that 's being waged by a union-backed group called OUR Walmart , which includes former and current workers . The group is staging demonstrations and walkouts at hundreds of stores around the country on Black Friday .
Brooke Buchanan , a Walmart spokeswoman , said the discounter has received `` really good feedback '' from employees about working the holiday .
The early start to this year 's shopping mayhem did not prevent several reported violent confrontations at stores around the nation that opened up for Black Friday , which is typically considered the biggest shopping day of the year .
A New Jersey man was arrested Thursday in a Walmart and charged with disorderly conduct and aggravated assault on a police officer after allegedly arguing with a store employee over a TV , NBCNewYork.com reported .

The holiday shopping season kicked off much earlier this year, as several retailers opened their stores on Thanksgiving Day optimistic that the added day might increase sales in what is typically the biggest shopping day of the year.

Retailers did not provide specific numbers, but Walmart and Target reported strong Thanksgiving Day traffic in stores and online, noting that shoppers were focused on big-ticket electronics like big-screen TVs and Xbox One, The Wall Street Journal reported.

In the past few years, retailers have pushed opening times into Thanksgiving night. They've also pushed up discounting that used to be reserved for Black Friday into early November, which has led retail experts to question whether the Thanksgiving openings will steal some of Black Friday's thunder.

The Journal report said Walmart recorded more than 10 million register transactions between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Thursday and nearly 400 million page views on Walmart.com. Target also said sales were among the highest ever online.

Overall, The National Retail Federation expects retail sales to be up 3.9 percent to $602.1 billion during the last two months of the year. That's higher than last year's 3.5 percent growth, but below the 6 percent pace seen before the recession.

Analysts expect sales to be generated at the expense of profits as retailers will likely have to do more discounting to get people into stores.

About 15,000 shoppers were at Macy's Herald Square in New York City right before the doors opened, estimated Terry Lundgren, CEO, president and chairman of the department store chain. Last year, the store had 11,000 people right before the midnight opening.

Lundgren, who was at the entrance, told The Associated Press that the retailer knew it had to open when it found out other competitors were planning to open on Thanksgiving night. He also said it received positive feedback from its employees. ""We're a competitive group,"" he said. ""It's very clear they (the shoppers) want to be here at 8 p.m.""

The store was featuring 375 doorbusters, up from last year's 200. Some of the deals included $79.99 jackets originally priced from $195 to $250, and cashmere sweaters for $39, marked down from 129.

Shelby Wheatley, 17, was with her mother, her mother's friend and her best friend, who all traveled from Orlando, Fla. Wheatley was looking for a prom dress and wanted to buy it in New York.

""I did Black Friday-but never Thursday--and never in New York,"" she said.

As for Thanksgiving, the group celebrated early with family last week.

The Thanksgiving openings are part of retailers' holiday strategy of trying to lure shoppers in early and often during the holiday shopping season. But the stores face challenges in doing that.

Some workers have petitions on change.org to protest against Target and Best Buy. The Retail Action Project, a labor-backed group of retail workers, also is planning to have members visiting customers at stores including Gap and Victoria's Secret in Manhattan to educate them about the demands on workers.

Walmart has been the biggest target for protests against holiday hours. Most of the company's stores are open 24 hours, but the retailer is starting its sales events at 6 p.m. on Thursday, two hours earlier than last year.

The issue is part of a broader campaign against the company's treatment of workers that's being waged by a union-backed group called OUR Walmart, which includes former and current workers. The group is staging demonstrations and walkouts at hundreds of stores around the country on Black Friday.

Brooke Buchanan, a Walmart spokeswoman, said the discounter has received ""really good feedback"" from employees about working the holiday.

The early start to this year's shopping mayhem did not prevent several reported violent confrontations at stores around the nation that opened up for Black Friday, which is typically considered the biggest shopping day of the year.

A New Jersey man was arrested Thursday in a Walmart and charged with disorderly conduct and aggravated assault on a police officer after allegedly arguing with a store employee over a TV, NBCNewYork.com reported.

On Thursday , a government-appointed scientific panel released a 600-page document that will start a year-long process to update the 2015 US dietary guidelines for Americans .

In the book , she documented how American eating practices are shaped much more by the invisible forces of industry and powerful lobbying groups than science .
Since the 1970s , for example , the group that sets the national guidelines caved under pressure from the meat industry , shying away from warning against the potential health harms and environmental damage of eating too much meat .

JB : A lot of the talk around the new recommendations has focused on potential changes that might come down in the forthcoming guidelines : adding a cap on added sugar intake and saturated fat , noting that coffee can be part of a healthy diet — and dropping the long-standing warnings about cholesterol as a `` nutrient of concern .

That she could be so horribly wrong and then so unsatisfyingly unavailable for the duration of an international flight led to an inevitable #hasjustinelanded hashtag Twitter storm. It also caused a fury of Internet rage, a deleted tweet and an apology ""for the pain I caused."" One upside -- some clever person registered justinesacco.com -- and had it redirect to Aid for Africa.

Richard Dawkins

The author and professional fly in the ointment of religion had faint praise for Islam in August, when he dryly noted the religion's poor showing in the Nobels. Gosh, if only the whole system of faith were built on prize winning, it might have been a real burn.

Rep. Steve Stockman

The Republican representative for Texas's 36th congressional district is very, very angry, very, very often. He calls ""Obamacare less popular than Chlamydia"" and uses his Twitter feed to sell bumper stickers that say, ""If babies had guns, they wouldn’t be aborted."" In short, he's a veritable geyser of awful commentary.

Gary Janetti makes a wish

Maybe he was just tired of all the attention BatKid got. In December, the TV writer cracked about sick children – comedy gold! And for what it's worth, joke writers, a child doesn't have to be terminally ill to qualify for Make-A-Wish.

I'm all for Make-A-Wish as long as they can guarantee the kid won't pull through at the last minute. — Gary Janetti (@GaryJanetti) December 8, 2013

Kanye West vs. Jimmy Kimmel

When late-night host Jimmy Kimmel poked fun of West on his show in September, the rapper went into full caps-lock mode, ranting, ""JIMMY KIMMEL PUT YOURSELF IN MY SHOES … OH NO THAT MEANS YOU WOULD HAVE GOTTEN TOO MUCH GOOD PUSSY IN YOUR LIFE…"" and ""YOU CAN’T PUT YOURSELF IN MY SHOES. YOUR FACE LOOKS CRAZY… IS THAT FUNNY?… OR IF I HAD A KID SAY IT WOULD IT BE FUNNY???"" and telling him he resembled SpongeBob. Naturally the whole thing ended with Kanye doing much deleting, guesting on Kimmel's show, and warning him, ""You shoulda saw the second set of tweets!""

Hugo Schwyzer

In one of the summer's strangest meltdowns, a man who built his reputation as a ""male feminist"" – and who'd announced just days before he was going offline to get away from the ""toxicity of take-down culture"" -- had what he called an ""episode,"" posting dozens of tweets in which he detailed how he'd ""hurt so many people with lies."" Though Schwyzer called himself ""a reminder of what [the] manipulative mentally ill can do,"" his saddest revelation of all was the weary observation about his own infamy.

The Onion vs. Quvenzhané Wallis

On Oscar night, the usually brilliant humor site belly flopped badly by remarking of the 9-year-old Best Actress nominee, ""Everyone else seems afraid to say it, but that Quvenzhané Wallis is kind of a c--t, right?"" Even Onion fans weren't amused. The post was quickly deleted, and the company CEO called it a ""senseless, humorless comment masquerading as satire.""

SpaghettiOs

This is not how you remember Pearl Harbor – with an anthropomorphized piece of canned pasta. But tell that to the clueless soul who was at the Twitter wheel December 7, when the brand did exactly that, advising, ""Take a moment to remember #PearlHarbor with us"" and featuring its jaunty, orange-sneakered mascot waving a flag. Though the tweet was quickly yanked, the most troubling mystery of the whole controversy is the lingering question as to why SpaghettiOs has almost 13,000 twitter followers.

Alec Baldwin

It hasn't been a great year for the impulse-control-challenged former ""30 Rock"" star and short-lived MSNBC host. In April, incensed that a reporter suggested Baldwin's wife had been tweeting during James Gandolfini’s funeral, he raged about the ""little bitch"" and ""toxic little queen"" and warned he'd like to put his foot in one of the writer's orifices -- except that he worried ""You'd dig it too much."" Unsurprisingly, Baldwin deleted the entire sputtering mess soon after.

Dinesh D'Souza

The reliably toxic professional troll capped off America's summer of racially explosive ugliness in August by declaring that ""I am thankful this week that America is big enough and great enough to survive grown-up Trayvon Martin in the White House!"" He must have changed his mind about his gratitude though – he deleted the tweet soon after.

Donald Trump

It's always hard to pick just one incident of the Donald being utterly nonsensical on Twitter, but there's got to be a special prize for his entirely predictable tinfoil-hatted reaction to the December death of Loretta Fuddy.

It was a move meant to shore up the support of his core supporters at a time when Trump 's reelection prospects look uncertain in the midst of declining approval of his handling of the virus and the economic meltdown . Adding fuel to the latest controversy on the right -- just as he did when he supported protesters at state capitols who rebelled against their states ' lockdowns -- Trump tried to assert authority he does not have as part of his relentless push for normalcy .
His comments came as the nation headed into Memorial Day weekend , a time when health experts worry that Americans ' vigilance will give way to complacency with the potential for crowded beaches , pools , parks , holiday barbecues -- and now churches -- across the country .
An updated predictions model from the PolicyLab at Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia this week forecasts that Miami and parts of Alabama , Tennessee and Texas will see rapid surges in new cases
Neither the President nor his press secretary explained Friday how he plans to follow through on his threat to governors , which he issued shortly before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released voluntary recommendations for religious institutions .
Still , Trump 's remarks Friday were threaded with his impatience for the cautionary warnings of the scientists and medical experts within his own administration , who are worried about a resurgence of coronavirus cases and have highlighted the risks of large gatherings ( which many religious services could entail ) . Throughout the week , he has courted his evangelical supporters with his charge that governors are treating churches unfairly and his insistence that he wants to `` get the churches open . ''
Trump said Friday that some governors have `` deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential , '' but have left out churches and other houses of worship . `` It 's not right . So I 'm correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential , '' he said during a brief statement at the White House .
`` I call upon governors to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now . If there 's any question , they 're going to have to call me , but they 're not going to be successful in that call , '' Trump said . `` The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential places of faith to open right now , for this weekend . If they do n't do it , I will override the governors . In America we need more prayer , not less , '' he said , taking no questions from reporters .
As his general election campaign with former Vice President Joe Biden heats up , Trump has increasingly invoked America 's culture wars . During a `` Rolling to Remember '' ceremony earlier on Friday to honor the nation 's veterans , prisoners of war and those missing in action -- where he spoke to bikers who then rode two laps around the White House driveway -- Trump noted his political support from bikers .
`` Always there , the bikers , '' he said . `` What do I have ? 98 % ? 95 ? We 're trying to find who are the 3 % or the 2 % . We 're looking for them , right ? ''
`` November 3rd is a big day , '' Trump said , referring to the November election after they lapped the South Lawn Drive . `` We do n't want to destroy this country . We 're going to make it bigger , better , greater than ever before . ''
Though the Memorial Day weekend traditionally kicks off summer , this year 's holiday will be anything but normal with many governors , mayors and local officials calling on their states ' residents to continue social distancing , wear masks and stay as close to home as possible .
Speaking from the briefing room podium later on Friday , Dr. Deborah Birx , the administration 's coronavirus response coordinator , tempered some of Trump 's enthusiasm for reopening -- emphasizing both the social distancing guidelines that churches should adhere to in order to reopen as well as the safety precautions Americans must take to enjoy their favorite pastimes this weekend .
In encouraging news , Birx noted that 42 states now have less a less than 10 % positivity rate of cases as a rolling seven-day average . But she noted that Maryland , the District of Columbia and Virginia are still the top states with high numbers of cases , followed by Nebraska , Illinois and Minnesota . `` There is still significant virus circulating here , '' she said of the Washington area .
Birx also highlighted the top metropolitan areas where the rate of positive cases has stalled or increased as places where Americans should be especially cautious this weekend . The DC metro area topped that list , followed by Baltimore , Chicago and Minneapolis . ( All of the others were below the 10 % threshold , which Birx said , showed `` great progress . '' )
Despite the encouraging news from Birx about the decline in the rate of positive cases , the holiday weekend could also mark another grim moment in the pandemic as the number of deaths in the US approached 100,000 .
`` We think we 're going to hit the milestone of 100,000 deaths over the four-day weekend , '' said Dr. Chris Murray , the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington , which has produced one of the most influential coronavirus models .
Looking ahead to the holiday weekend , Birx said Americans could get outside with a long list of caveats . Some Americans could play golf , she said , for example , if they are `` very careful '' and `` do n't touch the flags . '' She suggested playing tennis with `` marked balls '' and just one other person so `` you 're only touching your ball . ''
This weekend , if Americans want to do some kind of social gathering , `` it 's very important to maintain that six feet distance and very important to have your mask with you in case that six feet distance can not be maintained , '' Birx said .
`` We are asking continuously for you all to be outside , to enjoy your Memorial Day weekend ; to play golf ; to hike as Dr. ( Anthony ) Fauci said ; to play tennis with marked balls -- and to be out with your families that you have been in the household with ; and even consider sharing socially distanced space as long as you have utensils that belong to individuals and that maybe can be thrown out immediately , '' Birx said . `` There 's a lot of things to think through . I know you can do this . I know the American people can do it . ''
When asked about Trump 's declaration that churches and houses of worship should reopen , Birx said faith community leaders should be in touch with their local health departments to check the number of new cases in their zip codes , so they can communicate the risks to congregants .
`` Certainly people that have significant co-morbidities , we want them protected . I know those houses of worship want to protect them , '' Birx said . `` So really ensuring that -- maybe they ca n't go this week if there 's high number of Covid cases . Maybe they wait another week , but there is a way to social distance like you are here , '' she said , gesturing to the reporters who were spaced several seats apart in the White House briefing room , `` in places of worship . ''
Though Baltimore is one of the areas of concern for public health officials like Birx , Trump and first lady Melania Trump plan to travel to Fort McHenry in Baltimore on Monday to commemorate Memorial Day .
They will do so in spite of a plea from Baltimore 's Mayor Bernard `` Jack '' Young who said the trip will send the wrong message at a time when he is asking the city 's residents not to travel .
`` I 'm asking the President to rethink his trip . It sends a bad , bad message to the citizens of Baltimore because I 'm asking them to stay home and only come out for essential reasons , '' Young told CNN 's John King . `` I just want him to set the example for the rest of the country and not do this trip , because it 's not essential . ''
White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere responded to earlier criticism from Young by stating that `` the brave men and women who have preserved our freedoms for generations did not stay home and the President will not either as he honors their sacrifice by visiting such a historic landmark in our Nation 's history .

Speaking from the briefing room podium later on Friday, Dr. Deborah Birx, the administration's coronavirus response coordinator, tempered some of Trump's enthusiasm for reopening -- emphasizing both the social distancing guidelines that churches should adhere to in order to reopen as well as the safety precautions Americans must take to enjoy their favorite pastimes this weekend.

In encouraging news, Birx noted that 42 states now have less a less than 10% positivity rate of cases as a rolling seven-day average. But she noted that Maryland, the District of Columbia and Virginia are still the top states with high numbers of cases, followed by Nebraska, Illinois and Minnesota. ""There is still significant virus circulating here,"" she said of the Washington area.

Birx also highlighted the top metropolitan areas where the rate of positive cases has stalled or increased as places where Americans should be especially cautious this weekend. The DC metro area topped that list, followed by Baltimore, Chicago and Minneapolis. (All of the others were below the 10% threshold, which Birx said, showed "" great progress ."")

Despite the encouraging news from Birx about the decline in the rate of positive cases, the holiday weekend could also mark another grim moment in the pandemic as the number of deaths in the US approached 100,000.

""We think we're going to hit the milestone of 100,000 deaths over the four-day weekend,"" said Dr. Chris Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, which has produced one of the most influential coronavirus models.

Looking ahead to the holiday weekend, Birx said Americans could get outside with a long list of caveats. Some Americans could play golf, she said, for example, if they are ""very careful"" and ""don't touch the flags."" She suggested playing tennis with ""marked balls"" and just one other person so ""you're only touching your ball.""

This weekend, if Americans want to do some kind of social gathering, ""it's very important to maintain that six feet distance and very important to have your mask with you in case that six feet distance cannot be maintained,"" Birx said.

""We are asking continuously for you all to be outside, to enjoy your Memorial Day weekend; to play golf; to hike as Dr. (Anthony) Fauci said; to play tennis with marked balls -- and to be out with your families that you have been in the household with; and even consider sharing socially distanced space as long as you have utensils that belong to individuals and that maybe can be thrown out immediately,"" Birx said. ""There's a lot of things to think through. I know you can do this. I know the American people can do it.""

When asked about Trump's declaration that churches and houses of worship should reopen, Birx said faith community leaders should be in touch with their local health departments to check the number of new cases in their zip codes, so they can communicate the risks to congregants.

""Certainly people that have significant co-morbidities, we want them protected. I know those houses of worship want to protect them,"" Birx said. ""So really ensuring that -- maybe they can't go this week if there's high number of Covid cases. Maybe they wait another week, but there is a way to social distance like you are here,"" she said, gesturing to the reporters who were spaced several seats apart in the White House briefing room, ""in places of worship.""

Though Baltimore is one of the areas of concern for public health officials like Birx, Trump and first lady Melania Trump plan to travel to Fort McHenry in Baltimore on Monday to commemorate Memorial Day.

They will do so in spite of a plea from Baltimore's Mayor Bernard ""Jack"" Young who said the trip will send the wrong message at a time when he is asking the city's residents not to travel.

""I'm asking the President to rethink his trip. It sends a bad, bad message to the citizens of Baltimore because I'm asking them to stay home and only come out for essential reasons,"" Young told CNN's John King. ""I just want him to set the example for the rest of the country and not do this trip, because it's not essential.""

White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere responded to earlier criticism from Young by stating that ""the brave men and women who have preserved our freedoms for generations did not stay home and the President will not either as he honors their sacrifice by visiting such a historic landmark in our Nation's history.""",www.cnn.com,left,jiuCOvhqXhBeudX5

Proctor & Gamble ’ s $ 8 billion writedown last month in the value of the 118-year old shaving business company , Gillette , that it purchased for $ 57 billion in 2005 , followed closely upon the release of a highly controversial ad , which had little to say about the great shaves men could expect when using a Gillette razor , and a great deal to say , in scolding tones , about toxic masculinity . Social Justice Warriors hailed it as a great message . Ordinary men and a surprising number of women were revulsed by it .
In any case , the fact is that the ad was brutally misandric , the backlash against the ad was fierce , and P & G is taking a huge financial hit . Yeah , there are all kinds of other possible reasons for the nosedive—a shrinking market for shaving , increased competition—but it seems that just in case it wasn ’ t a coincidence , Gillette has decided to step off the “ woke ” corporation train , and go back to basics in their marketing .
The most obvious rubric of basic marketing—and you would think this is something they would already have known before the debacle , so the fact they didn ’ t tells us a lot about the brain freeze at the corporate level—is that if you have a defined target market for your product , the best strategy for upping sales isn ’ t to crap all over that market by telling them they are responsible for all social ills of society , but that here , use our product , and while you ’ re using it , think about how much better you can be as a human being , you piece of sh * t .
At the time of the blowback , Gillette thought they could ride out the storm on the strength of all the students at Intersectional U , who thought it was the best ad ever . They even produced another ad called “ First Shave , ” in which a father initiates his transgender son into shaving . Nobody objected to it , even if only about .01 % of Gillette ’ s market could relate to it , and another percentage , who knows how many , were doubtless made uncomfortable by it , so it was probably a wash sales-wise .
But that seems to have been their last conscious foray into social do-goodery . ( I say “ conscious ” advisedly . Read on . )
The message of Gillette ’ s latest ad , launched last week , is full-bore traditionally man-friendly , featuring a real-life Australian firefighter and personal trainer , Ben Ziekenheiner , getting ready for work . Ben ’ s morning toilette shows him calmly shaving – firefighters must be clean-shaven so their masks fit properly – but with interspersed scenes of raging fires and the men who combat them . As he shaves , his little girl looks up at him adoringly . The ad ends with a loving father-daughter hug , and Ben ’ s insightful remark that “ it ’ s not the fire , it ’ s more the constant reminder of who you might leave behind… ”
You notice there are only two elements in the ad besides Ben : the scary fire that kills people if they can not be saved , and the vulnerable innocent child , who expresses her fears for her dad in a simple drawing of a house with flames shooting out the windows that she gives to him , a gesture he is very sensitive to , evoking a protective embrace . You notice as well that there is no woman in the ad , not even a mother who looks upon the scene with approval .
For she is unnecessary . Think about it . If the child had been a little boy , he would have been watching his father shave with a view to his future self as a man . This little girl is watching her father shave as her future womanly self will relate to the men in her life : husband , brothers , son . She will associate shaving with manliness ; she will feel gratitude that men do the things she is not equipped to do , making her safer and more confident in whatever life has in store for her , which is highly unlikely to be anything involving anything like her father ’ s high-risk job .
This ad is a 180 degree turn away from the you-can-do-better ad . First , it doesn ’ t talk about men in general . It focuses on one guy that most men can relate to , and admire . And what a guy Ben is ! On a scale of one to ten , Ben ’ s male positivity hits eleven ! He is a manly man , built up through training to perfection of the male form . He is also a sensitive man . And he is the kind of man who channels his manliness into areas that are the furthest thing from “ toxic ” : fathering , service to his community and physical protection of the helpless . He has a right to feel fear , but what he worries about most is not being there for his family .
These three functions—often expressed as the three “ Ps ” : Parenthood , protection and productivity—happen to be the three necessary components for a healthy male presence in society . The fact that Ben is also a risk-taker is the icing on this marketing cake . For the quintessential trait of manliness , not always expressed in such heroic fashion as firefighting , is a willingness to take risks .
Gillette thinks that this ad represents their decision to “ shift the spotlight from social issues to local heroes. ” In fact , its message restores to heterosexual men the respect and valorization that has been sadly lacking in our culture . Considering the ramifications that are occurring as a result of men being told they are not needed on the cultural voyage , I can ’ t think of a social issue more badly in need of attention . And so this “ local heroes ” ad by Gillette is , therefore , paradoxically enough , not a shift away from promotion of social justice , but its very embodiment .","You have 14 free articles left today, enjoy reading.

Nobody objected to it, even if only about .01% of Gillette’s market could relate to it, and another percentage, who knows how many, were doubtless made uncomfortable by it, so it was probably a wash sales-wise.

But that seems to have been their last conscious foray into social do-goodery. (I say “conscious” advisedly. Read on.)

The message of Gillette’s latest ad, launched last week, is full-bore traditionally man-friendly, featuring a real-life Australian firefighter and personal trainer, Ben Ziekenheiner, getting ready for work. Ben’s morning toilette shows him calmly shaving – firefighters must be clean-shaven so their masks fit properly – but with interspersed scenes of raging fires and the men who combat them. As he shaves, his little girl looks up at him adoringly. The ad ends with a loving father-daughter hug, and Ben’s insightful remark that “it’s not the fire, it’s more the constant reminder of who you might leave behind…”

You notice there are only two elements in the ad besides Ben: the scary fire that kills people if they cannot be saved, and the vulnerable innocent child, who expresses her fears for her dad in a simple drawing of a house with flames shooting out the windows that she gives to him, a gesture he is very sensitive to, evoking a protective embrace. You notice as well that there is no woman in the ad, not even a mother who looks upon the scene with approval.

For she is unnecessary. Think about it. If the child had been a little boy, he would have been watching his father shave with a view to his future self as a man. This little girl is watching her father shave as her future womanly self will relate to the men in her life: husband, brothers, son. She will associate shaving with manliness; she will feel gratitude that men do the things she is not equipped to do, making her safer and more confident in whatever life has in store for her, which is highly unlikely to be anything involving anything like her father’s high-risk job.

This ad is a 180 degree turn away from the you-can-do-better ad. First, it doesn’t talk about men in general. It focuses on one guy that most men can relate to, and admire. And what a guy Ben is! On a scale of one to ten, Ben’s male positivity hits eleven! He is a manly man, built up through training to perfection of the male form. He is also a sensitive man. And he is the kind of man who channels his manliness into areas that are the furthest thing from “toxic”: fathering, service to his community and physical protection of the helpless. He has a right to feel fear, but what he worries about most is not being there for his family.

These three functions—often expressed as the three “Ps”: Parenthood, protection and productivity—happen to be the three necessary components for a healthy male presence in society. The fact that Ben is also a risk-taker is the icing on this marketing cake. For the quintessential trait of manliness, not always expressed in such heroic fashion as firefighting, is a willingness to take risks.

Gillette thinks that this ad represents their decision to “shift the spotlight from social issues to local heroes.” In fact, its message restores to heterosexual men the respect and valorization that has been sadly lacking in our culture. Considering the ramifications that are occurring as a result of men being told they are not needed on the cultural voyage, I can’t think of a social issue more badly in need of attention. And so this “local heroes” ad by Gillette is, therefore, paradoxically enough, not a shift away from promotion of social justice, but its very embodiment.

Just two years after leading the largest recorded protest in US history, the third annual Women’s March on Saturday is set to proceed under a cloud of controversy.

This year’s march is shaping up to be smaller and more splintered than before, after several major sponsors withdrew and local chapters disaffiliated from the central organization which leads it, following allegations of antisemitism.

Leaders were slow to deny and condemn allegations they had made antisemitic comments, and recent reporting has revealed deep ties between top officials and the Nation of Islam, whose leader, Louis Farrakhan, is a notorious antisemite.

Major progressive groups which sponsored the first march in 2017 have quietly withdrawn, including leading unions, environmental groups and women’s organizations. Of the many Jewish groups listed as partners in previous years, only a few remain. The Democratic National Committee, which had previously appeared on a list of 2019 Women’s March sponsors, recently disappeared too.

It’s a major blow for the movement that marked the beginning of the “resistance” in the wake of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential upset, when hundreds of thousands descended on the National Mall in Washington DC, a mass demonstration roughly three times the size of Trump’s own inauguration.

Experts called the 2017 Women’s March the largest single-day protest in recorded US history, with turnout around the country estimated in the millions, and top celebrities and politicians lending their star power to the event. It also presaged the coming of the powerful #MeToo movement which would reshape the culture around the treatment of women at work.

Following a protracted fight over the organization’s leadership, Vanessa Wruble, a Brooklyn-based activist who was pushed out of the organization in 2017, went on to help found another organization called March On, which emphasizes supporting local activists and denouncing antisemitism.

The result is that there will be two major women’s marches taking place on the streets of New York and many other cities around the country on Saturday – the original one, which emphasizes leadership by women of color, and another – March On – formed in opposition to antisemitism.

“Founded by the leaders of many of the marches across the country, March On is women-led, but open to all, and will employ a sophisticated political strategy to coordinate concrete actions at the federal, state, and local level through the joint efforts of millions of marchers,” the March On website states.

The coronavirus outbreaks in the United States have been the most intense in major cities and suburbs like New York , New Orleans , Detroit , Seattle and the Washington , D.C. , area . But experts in rural health say they know the virus is headed their way , and they worry that smaller communities are even less prepared to handle an influx of cases than their big-city colleagues .
“ We just have n't seen big numbers , thankfully , but I feel like everything I say with COVID I should end with 'yet , ’ ” said Jacqueline Barton True , vice president of rural health programs at the Washington State Hospital Association .
When the virus does come , those experts say they are concerned that the rate of severe and critical cases could be higher than in larger cities . Rural residents tend to be older , are more likely to have underlying conditions like hypertension and heart disease that put them at greater risk of serious symptoms , and in some regions they are more likely to smoke than are residents of urban areas .
“ Populations in our rural counties are older and sicker . When you look at those conditions that makes a population more vulnerable to COVID-19 , we see a lot of that in our rural counties , ” said Amy Stevens , vice president of the Health Policy Institute of Ohio . “ We do see higher rates of poverty in our rural counties . ”
Those in the poorest rural counties are also much less likely to be insured , according to the Economic Innovations Group , which tracks health data across the country . Mortality rates in those poorest counties are already substantially higher than in better-off counties , and the life expectancy is a notable five years lower .
At the same time , an epidemic of hospital closures has limited health care capacity in many smaller communities . More than 120 rural hospitals have closed since 2010 , according to data collected by the Cecil Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina , the majority of which have been in Appalachia and Deep South states . Eight hospitals have closed in just the first three months of 2020 .
The gravity of the threat posed by the coronavirus is adding financial pressure to the remaining hospitals that were already just scraping by . Health systems face an alarming rise in costs as they ramp up staff , stockpile supplies and prepare for a surge , while at the same time they are losing revenue as patients cancel routine procedures , from regular checkups to elective operations that have been temporarily suspended in many states .
“ We have just empty hospitals for those that are not yet impacted . They 're not able to do procedures like total knees and hips [ replacements ] , ” True said . “ That sort of perfect storm is really very concerning . We have a number of hospitals that have less than 30 days cash on hand . ”
“ You have this pandemic coming and the hospital might not be there when it hits , ” she said .
Smaller hospitals , too , are more likely to be overwhelmed , and they have less of an ability to surge capacity to deal with an influx of cases that a larger city might be able to handle . Some rural health systems have already repurposed some satellite clinics specifically to deal with potential COVID-19 patients in order to keep those patients away from other vulnerable people already in hospitals .
Making matters worse , the chronic shortage of personal protective gear and testing kits is exacerbated in areas with smaller populations . A major health system in a big city might order a million masks from a manufacturer in China ; that manufacturer is less likely to return calls from a smaller health care system that would only order 15,000 or 20,000 units .
“ They 're just not even getting the time of day from suppliers , because [ the suppliers are ] triaging as well , ” True said .
Public health departments in small rural communities are also frequently understaffed and under-funded . Many counties even combine health departments with their neighbors , and almost no health departments even in the best-funded big cities in the country have enough staff to conduct the sort of contact tracing necessary to squelch a virus before it breaks out widely .
“ In Ohio , we have a very decentralized public health system . That means that a majority of our public health workforce and public health funding in the state is at the local level . We have huge variation in investment and workforce in those departments , ” Stevens said .
Health experts said there are some built-in advantages to living in rural communities that might explain in part why the virus has yet to begin spreading widely in many such communities . A much lower population density means social distancing is easier to achieve . Many rural communities do not have public transportation systems — a burden on low-income workers in ordinary times but a potential positive that could help slow the spread in this crisis .
Early reports in New York City show the largest concentrations of cases are happening in areas close to the end of subway lines , potentially suggesting that spending long rides on public transportation could contribute to wider spread .
While New York ’ s outbreak may peak earlier because of the intense transmission , the spread to rural communities is almost inevitable — delaying , rather than eliminating , the threat .
That could buy rural communities critical time to both prepare their health systems and to deliver messages to local populations about the best ways to protect themselves , a narrow but critical window of opportunity to keep case curves low .
“ In some rural areas the peak might be later , because they don ’ t have that intensive population mixing that you see in a more urban environment , ” said Jeremy Konyndyk , a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development who helped lead the Obama administration 's response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa . “ But they will still get hit by it .

culture,Quillette,2,https://quillette.com/2020/05/07/covid-19-conspiracists-and-their-discontents/,COVID-19 Conspiracists and Their Discontents,2020-05-07,,"One reason why it ’ s surprisingly difficult to disprove many conspiracy theories is that they typically contain a real germ of truth , however small . In some places and eras , Jews really were overrepresented among communist cadres and the media . John F. Kennedy ’ s administration really did propose false-flag operations as an excuse to invade Cuba and assassinate Fidel Castro . Certain aspects of the World Trade Center collapse—including the fall of Building 7—really were odd and unprecedented . Some military video footage of unidentified aerial phenomena really is hard to square with conventional aircraft flight patterns . And then , of course , there are the various detours of the single bullet believed to have caused no fewer than seven entry and exit wounds to President Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally on November 22nd , 1963 .
This same complication applies to unfounded or thinly evidenced theories regarding the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic . Did the SARS-CoV-2 virus originate in bats sold at a wet market in Wuhan—or an artificial virus created in a bio-lab ? Did Dr. Li Wenliang , the Wuhan Central Hospital whistleblower who warned his government weeks before officials locked down the city , really die from COVID-19 ? Or was he murdered ? The whole area of inquiry has become a fertile playground for conspiracists , in part because no one can reasonably dispute the germ of truth behind their theories : the dishonesty and lack of transparency that often has characterized China ’ s response to the pandemic .
Conspiracism always flourishes when people are faced with uncertain , open-ended sources of suffering or evil . The mind abhors a vacuum of explanation . So when gaps in knowledge open up , the empty spaces are filled with available explanations that , however implausible , seem morally compelling . Usually , conspiracists target the suspected evildoers they had their eye on anyway .
Plagues and pandemics are especially popular feedstock for conspiracism because their causal agents—bacteria and viruses—remain invisible to the naked eye ( and were invisible , full stop , until the invention of powerful microscopes ) . But the Jews targeted by medieval mobs for poisoning wells and other imaginary acts of biological terrorism were not invisible . Nor , today , is Bill Gates , whom some members of the pro-Donald-Trump QAnon conspiracy movement accuse of seeking to undermine the Trump administration now that impeachment efforts have failed . Anthony Fauci , the medical lead on the American government ’ s response to the pandemic , often is lumped in with this alleged “ deep state ” movement supporting the Gatesian agenda . An analysis by the New York Times found over 70 accounts on Twitter promoting the hashtag # FauciFraud , with some tweeting as frequently as 795 times a day .
In some cases , the theories are quite complex . In late January , a YouTuber named Jordan Sather proclaimed that the “ government-funded Pirbright Institute out of the UK ” possibly planned “ the release of this disease ” through modification of a coronavirus that might otherwise be used to vaccinate birds . The connection to Gates was that the Pirbright Institute once received a grant to study livestock antibodies from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation . This convoluted theory was given a boost on April 13th by fabulist Roger Stone , who told Joe Piscopo on his AM radio program The Answer that “ Whether Bill Gates played some role in the creation and spread of this virus is open for vigorous debate. ” He added that Gates “ and other globalists are using it for mandatory vaccinations and microchipping people so we know if they ’ ve been tested . ”
Given that anti-vaxxers have been spreading false rumors about vaccines for generations , and that microchip-based conspiracies have been common since the 1970s , it should not be surprising that COVID-19 conspiracists were able to tap into pre-existing networks of true believers ( even if the assertion that the deep state has claimed Fauci—perhaps the most trusted man in America since Walter Cronkite—should test the credulity of even the most hardboiled conspiracy theorist ) .
As for Pirbright—a Surrey-based institute that , when it is not helping evil globalists spread diabolical plagues , dedicates itself to the study of infectious diseases among farm animals—a spokesman for the organization noted that its patent does not include any coronavirus-based vaccine that affects humans , that its work in this area isn ’ t funded by the Gates Foundation , and that “ the patented work cited in the conspiracy theories involved infectious bronchitis virus ( IBV ) only , and we made four changes in the gene responsible for replicating the virus ’ s genetic material . This has weakened the virus so it is no longer able to cause disease and [ thereby ] has potential to be used as a vaccine , but has not yet been developed ” ( my emphasis ) .
One grain of truth bolstering the vaccine-related subniche of conspiracy culture is that many jurisdictions really do require citizens to get vaccinated for certain common diseases such as measles . And so it is not crazy to assert—as some conspiracy theorists do in the lead-up to more far-fetched accusations—that governments may , in time , impose COVID-19 vaccination mandates if a safe and effective vaccine is developed . What is crazy is to imagine that all of this will be in the service of some kind of Hollywood-villain-style genocidal or thought-control agenda , an idea that emerged during the original SARS epidemic in the early 2000s , the 2009 H1N1 pandemic , and the subsequent Ebola crisis .
Then there ’ s the anti-vaxxer claim that the ordinary flu-vaccine regime that governments have been promoting for years actually makes people more vulnerable to COVID-19—and since China allegedly ordered more flu vaccines in 2019 than in prior years , this somehow explains why the outbreak began in Wuhan and not , say , Wichita . This theory has been addressed in detail by alternative-medicine and cancer-quackery debunker Dr. David Gorski at ScienceBasedMedicine.org . Among other things , he cheekily points out that “ antivaxxers love to claim that the flu vaccine doesn ’ t work , ” which , if true , would undercut the idea that it could cause interference with other viruses . And so , “ antivaxxers really need to make up their minds . ”
Wireless networks , electrical grids , and cordless devices also have provided conspiracy theorists with rich fodder—since , like microscopic pathogens , they are invisible to the naked eye even as they surround us . ( The same is true of the mind-control chemicals supposedly contained in the contrails produced by airplanes . Yet , oddly , with the skies now clear and almost entirely contrail-free during the pandemic lockdown , I haven ’ t noticed any radical change in human behavior . ) And so the timing of the coronavirus outbreak following the rollout of 5G cell technology in many markets predictably served as a dynamo for certain conspiracists—including Woody Harrelson , John Cusack , and Robert F. Kennedy , Jr . Indeed , the latter added a twist by introducing the further idea that the collective lockdown many of us are now enduring might have been intended to “ obstruct # 5G rollout and has effectively ended the opportunity for mass public protests , which were our best hope for derailing the 5G robber barons from microwaving our country and destroying nature . ”
Such theories , coupled to related claims that energy from 5G towers is the real source of COVID-19 , even led to recent arson attacks on British mobile phone towers in Birmingham , Liverpool , and Merseyside . It also apparently led to a train engineer in Los Angeles derailing a locomotive near the Navy hospital ship USNS Mercy . He later explained to investigators that the ship had “ an alternate purpose related to COVID-19 or a government takeover , ” and that “ you only get this chance once . The whole world is watching . I had to . People don ’ t know what ’ s going on here . Now they will. ” As FullFact.org notes , there are almost too many 5G conspiracy theories to track , and they often contradict each other .
Perhaps the most Jason Bourne-ish conspiracy theory is that COVID-19 did not really involve any kind of wet market in Wuhan , but is actually a “ bioweapon. ” The germ of truth here is that many nations really have been researching bioweapons for generations , including research on such scourges as Ebola , Smallpox , and Anthrax . In 2001 , a handful of Americans were killed by Anthrax delivered through the mail . And in 1979 , anthrax spores were accidentally leaked from a Soviet military research lab near the Russian city of Sverdlovsk ( now Yekaterinburg ) , leading to an estimated 100 deaths ( although precise details were subject to the usual Soviet obfuscation , including the claim the deaths were caused by tainted meat ) . China ’ s autocratic form of government , press censorship , occasionally aggressive foreign policy , and repression of whistleblowers all make the idea that the virus was created by artificial means—instead of ordinary natural selection among animal-borne pathogens—seem like it could be credible , even if there is no real evidence for it .
In fact , the evidence points in the opposite direction . According to a genetic analysis of the virus published on March 17th in the journal NatureMedicine , “ if genetic manipulation had been performed , one of the several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used . However , the genetic data irrefutably show that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone. ” The scientists noted the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses , concluding “ it is likely that bats serve as reservoir hosts for its progenitor , ” with the transmission to humans most likely occurring in late November to early December 2019 . The fact that bats are mammals living in massive colonies numbering in the millions , and are regularly infected with virus-based respiratory diseases , makes the link to humans all the more credible .
These are just a few of the many conspiracy theories ricocheting around the Internet . A full catalog would be almost impossible to create , and would quickly become obsolete as old conspiracy-theory strains mutated into new species ( much as with actual pathogens ) . This conspiracism will likely continue so long as people experience COVID-19-related fear and anxiety—emotions that always have been linked to conspiracist movements throughout history .
Even when there is no pandemic to worry about , all of us tend to harbor something that social scientists call a negativity bias—by which bad feelings assert themselves with greater perceived urgency than their positive counterparts . There are more words to describe pain than pleasure . There are more cognitive categories for negative emotions than positive . Bad impressions and negative stereotypes form faster and are more resistant to change than those that are positive . Losing money and friends is more painful to us than making money and friends is pleasurable . In the same way , negative global events generate more attention and causal explanations than positive events . Everyone asks , “ Why is there war ? ” But almost no one asks , “ Why is there peace ? ” —even though a broad examination of human history might suggest the latter question to be more apt .
One reason for this cognitive asymmetry is that human progress typically is made incrementally , in small steps , whereas catastrophic setbacks can occur all at once : Around the world right now , millions of businesses that took decades to build up may now go bankrupt because of a tragedy that has unfolded in a matter of months . Moreover , the mental habits we ’ ve developed through evolutionary processes are well suited to sensing the presence of large predators , but serve us poorly when the enemy can ’ t be detected . That ’ s when our thinking can go sideways , and whole societies become susceptible to conspiracist notions , which often represent mere extrapolations of existing populist political themes . Leaders around the world know this , and are leveraging our uncertainties and anxieties to grab more power , as in Viktor Orbán ’ s Hungary , Recep Tayyip Erdoğan ’ s Turkey , Benjamin Netanyahu ’ s Israel , Vladimir Putin ’ s Russia , and , especially , Xi Jinping ’ s China .
This is one of the great ironies of conspiracism : Unjustified fears about fictional conspiracies can themselves be leveraged by governments to facilitate their own very real machinations , which in turn reduce public trust . Thus does the cycle of conspiracism continue .

Did the SARS-CoV-2 virus originate in bats sold at a wet market in Wuhan—or an artificial virus created in a bio-lab? Did Dr. Li Wenliang, the Wuhan Central Hospital whistleblower who warned his government weeks before officials locked down the city, really die from COVID-19? Or was he murdered? The whole area of inquiry has become a fertile playground for conspiracists, in part because no one can reasonably dispute the germ of truth behind their theories: the dishonesty and lack of transparency that often has characterized China’s response to the pandemic.

Conspiracism always flourishes when people are faced with uncertain, open-ended sources of suffering or evil. The mind abhors a vacuum of explanation. So when gaps in knowledge open up, the empty spaces are filled with available explanations that, however implausible, seem morally compelling. Usually, conspiracists target the suspected evildoers they had their eye on anyway.

Plagues and pandemics are especially popular feedstock for conspiracism because their causal agents—bacteria and viruses—remain invisible to the naked eye (and were invisible, full stop, until the invention of powerful microscopes). But the Jews targeted by medieval mobs for poisoning wells and other imaginary acts of biological terrorism were not invisible. Nor, today, is Bill Gates, whom some members of the pro-Donald-Trump QAnon conspiracy movement accuse of seeking to undermine the Trump administration now that impeachment efforts have failed. Anthony Fauci, the medical lead on the American government’s response to the pandemic, often is lumped in with this alleged “deep state” movement supporting the Gatesian agenda. An analysis by the New York Times found over 70 accounts on Twitter promoting the hashtag #FauciFraud, with some tweeting as frequently as 795 times a day.

In some cases, the theories are quite complex. In late January, a YouTuber named Jordan Sather proclaimed that the “government-funded Pirbright Institute out of the UK” possibly planned “the release of this disease” through modification of a coronavirus that might otherwise be used to vaccinate birds. The connection to Gates was that the Pirbright Institute once received a grant to study livestock antibodies from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. This convoluted theory was given a boost on April 13th by fabulist Roger Stone, who told Joe Piscopo on his AM radio program The Answer that “Whether Bill Gates played some role in the creation and spread of this virus is open for vigorous debate.” He added that Gates “and other globalists are using it for mandatory vaccinations and microchipping people so we know if they’ve been tested.”

Given that anti-vaxxers have been spreading false rumors about vaccines for generations, and that microchip-based conspiracies have been common since the 1970s, it should not be surprising that COVID-19 conspiracists were able to tap into pre-existing networks of true believers (even if the assertion that the deep state has claimed Fauci—perhaps the most trusted man in America since Walter Cronkite—should test the credulity of even the most hardboiled conspiracy theorist).

As for Pirbright—a Surrey-based institute that, when it is not helping evil globalists spread diabolical plagues, dedicates itself to the study of infectious diseases among farm animals—a spokesman for the organization noted that its patent does not include any coronavirus-based vaccine that affects humans, that its work in this area isn’t funded by the Gates Foundation, and that “the patented work cited in the conspiracy theories involved infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) only, and we made four changes in the gene responsible for replicating the virus’s genetic material. This has weakened the virus so it is no longer able to cause disease and [thereby] has potential to be used as a vaccine, but has not yet been developed” (my emphasis).

One grain of truth bolstering the vaccine-related subniche of conspiracy culture is that many jurisdictions really do require citizens to get vaccinated for certain common diseases such as measles. And so it is not crazy to assert—as some conspiracy theorists do in the lead-up to more far-fetched accusations—that governments may, in time, impose COVID-19 vaccination mandates if a safe and effective vaccine is developed. What is crazy is to imagine that all of this will be in the service of some kind of Hollywood-villain-style genocidal or thought-control agenda, an idea that emerged during the original SARS epidemic in the early 2000s, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, and the subsequent Ebola crisis.

Then there’s the anti-vaxxer claim that the ordinary flu-vaccine regime that governments have been promoting for years actually makes people more vulnerable to COVID-19—and since China allegedly ordered more flu vaccines in 2019 than in prior years, this somehow explains why the outbreak began in Wuhan and not, say, Wichita. This theory has been addressed in detail by alternative-medicine and cancer-quackery debunker Dr. David Gorski at ScienceBasedMedicine.org. Among other things, he cheekily points out that “antivaxxers love to claim that the flu vaccine doesn’t work,” which, if true, would undercut the idea that it could cause interference with other viruses. And so, “antivaxxers really need to make up their minds.”

Wireless networks, electrical grids, and cordless devices also have provided conspiracy theorists with rich fodder—since, like microscopic pathogens, they are invisible to the naked eye even as they surround us. (The same is true of the mind-control chemicals supposedly contained in the contrails produced by airplanes. Yet, oddly, with the skies now clear and almost entirely contrail-free during the pandemic lockdown, I haven’t noticed any radical change in human behavior.) And so the timing of the coronavirus outbreak following the rollout of 5G cell technology in many markets predictably served as a dynamo for certain conspiracists—including Woody Harrelson, John Cusack, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Indeed, the latter added a twist by introducing the further idea that the collective lockdown many of us are now enduring might have been intended to “obstruct #5G rollout and has effectively ended the opportunity for mass public protests, which were our best hope for derailing the 5G robber barons from microwaving our country and destroying nature.”

Such theories, coupled to related claims that energy from 5G towers is the real source of COVID-19, even led to recent arson attacks on British mobile phone towers in Birmingham, Liverpool, and Merseyside. It also apparently led to a train engineer in Los Angeles derailing a locomotive near the Navy hospital ship USNS Mercy. He later explained to investigators that the ship had “an alternate purpose related to COVID-19 or a government takeover,” and that “you only get this chance once. The whole world is watching. I had to. People don’t know what’s going on here. Now they will.” As FullFact.org notes, there are almost too many 5G conspiracy theories to track, and they often contradict each other.

Perhaps the most Jason Bourne-ish conspiracy theory is that COVID-19 did not really involve any kind of wet market in Wuhan, but is actually a “bioweapon.” The germ of truth here is that many nations really have been researching bioweapons for generations, including research on such scourges as Ebola, Smallpox, and Anthrax. In 2001, a handful of Americans were killed by Anthrax delivered through the mail. And in 1979, anthrax spores were accidentally leaked from a Soviet military research lab near the Russian city of Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg), leading to an estimated 100 deaths (although precise details were subject to the usual Soviet obfuscation, including the claim the deaths were caused by tainted meat). China’s autocratic form of government, press censorship, occasionally aggressive foreign policy, and repression of whistleblowers all make the idea that the virus was created by artificial means—instead of ordinary natural selection among animal-borne pathogens—seem like it could be credible, even if there is no real evidence for it.

In fact, the evidence points in the opposite direction. According to a genetic analysis of the virus published on March 17th in the journal NatureMedicine, “if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used. However, the genetic data irrefutably show that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone.” The scientists noted the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses, concluding “it is likely that bats serve as reservoir hosts for its progenitor,” with the transmission to humans most likely occurring in late November to early December 2019. The fact that bats are mammals living in massive colonies numbering in the millions, and are regularly infected with virus-based respiratory diseases, makes the link to humans all the more credible.

These are just a few of the many conspiracy theories ricocheting around the Internet. A full catalog would be almost impossible to create, and would quickly become obsolete as old conspiracy-theory strains mutated into new species (much as with actual pathogens). This conspiracism will likely continue so long as people experience COVID-19-related fear and anxiety—emotions that always have been linked to conspiracist movements throughout history.

Even when there is no pandemic to worry about, all of us tend to harbor something that social scientists call a negativity bias—by which bad feelings assert themselves with greater perceived urgency than their positive counterparts. There are more words to describe pain than pleasure. There are more cognitive categories for negative emotions than positive. Bad impressions and negative stereotypes form faster and are more resistant to change than those that are positive. Losing money and friends is more painful to us than making money and friends is pleasurable. In the same way, negative global events generate more attention and causal explanations than positive events. Everyone asks, “Why is there war?” But almost no one asks, “Why is there peace?”—even though a broad examination of human history might suggest the latter question to be more apt.

One reason for this cognitive asymmetry is that human progress typically is made incrementally, in small steps, whereas catastrophic setbacks can occur all at once: Around the world right now, millions of businesses that took decades to build up may now go bankrupt because of a tragedy that has unfolded in a matter of months. Moreover, the mental habits we’ve developed through evolutionary processes are well suited to sensing the presence of large predators, but serve us poorly when the enemy can’t be detected. That’s when our thinking can go sideways, and whole societies become susceptible to conspiracist notions, which often represent mere extrapolations of existing populist political themes. Leaders around the world know this, and are leveraging our uncertainties and anxieties to grab more power, as in Viktor Orbán’s Hungary, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Turkey, Benjamin Netanyahu’s Israel, Vladimir Putin’s Russia, and, especially, Xi Jinping’s China.

This is one of the great ironies of conspiracism: Unjustified fears about fictional conspiracies can themselves be leveraged by governments to facilitate their own very real machinations, which in turn reduce public trust. Thus does the cycle of conspiracism continue.

Rochester police said that the statue was taken from its base in Maplewood Park and carried about 50 feet to a site near the Genesee River gorge , according to The Associated Press . The base , lower part of the statue and a finger on its left hand were reportedly damaged .
Carvin Eison , a leader of a project that brought a Douglass statue to the park in the city , told the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle that another statue would have to take its place because the damage was too significant to repair .
A Frederick Douglas statue in Maplewood Park was removed from its base overnight . pic.twitter.com/J43hqxuHTT — Atyia Collins ( @ Atyia_Collins ) July 5 , 2020
`` It 's particularly painful that it happened at this time , '' Eison told the newspaper . `` It 's really sad because here in Rochester the statue of Frederick Douglass has always been a face of good . ''
Douglass , who was born a slave in Maryland , delivered one of his most famous speeches on July 5 , 1852 , in Rochester . The speech , `` What to the Slave is the Fourth of July , ” questioned the Fourth of July celebration of freedom and liberty in a nation that enslaved people .
`` What have I , or those I represent , to do with your national independence ? '' he asked while speaking before the Rochester Ladies ' Anti-Slavery Society . `` Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice , embodied in that Declaration of Independence , extended to us ? ... What , to the American slave , is your 4th of July ?
`` I answer ; a day that reveals to him , more than all other days in the year , the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim . ''
A group of Douglass 's descendants gathered to read that speech for a video released by NPR over the weekend . The five descendants of Douglass also reflected on the speech 's resonance amid the nationwide protests in response to the May 25 death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody .
The presence of a Douglass monument in Rochester is also historically significant given the work he did during his life in the city . Maplewood Park is a site on the Underground Railroad where Douglass and others , including Harriet Tubman , aided slaves seeking freedom in the North .
The Douglass statue is one of 13 that were erected in the city in 2018 , according to CBS affiliate WROC-TV . Sunday 's incident marks the second time one of the monuments has been vandalized .","A statue of Frederick Douglass was ripped from its pedestal in upstate New York on Sunday, the day marking the 168th anniversary of the American abolitionist giving one of his most seminal speeches condemning slavery.

Rochester police said that the statue was taken from its base in Maplewood Park and carried about 50 feet to a site near the Genesee River gorge, according to The Associated Press. The base, lower part of the statue and a finger on its left hand were reportedly damaged.

Carvin Eison, a leader of a project that brought a Douglass statue to the park in the city, told the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle that another statue would have to take its place because the damage was too significant to repair.

""It's particularly painful that it happened at this time,"" Eison told the newspaper. ""It's really sad because here in Rochester the statue of Frederick Douglass has always been a face of good.""

A motive for the vandalism was not immediately clear.

Douglass, who was born a slave in Maryland, delivered one of his most famous speeches on July 5, 1852, in Rochester. The speech, ""What to the Slave is the Fourth of July,” questioned the Fourth of July celebration of freedom and liberty in a nation that enslaved people.

""What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence?"" he asked while speaking before the Rochester Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society. ""Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us? ... What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July?

""I answer; a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim.""

A group of Douglass's descendants gathered to read that speech for a video released by NPR over the weekend. The five descendants of Douglass also reflected on the speech's resonance amid the nationwide protests in response to the May 25 death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody.

The presence of a Douglass monument in Rochester is also historically significant given the work he did during his life in the city. Maplewood Park is a site on the Underground Railroad where Douglass and others, including Harriet Tubman, aided slaves seeking freedom in the North.

All of this in the face of dire consequences for public health amid an unrelenting global pandemic . These events are a mere smattering of a series of protests throughout the country that seek to resist the `` tyranny '' of state governors who have imposed lockdown restrictions in their states . These protests took what has now become a far too familiar form in American politics , connecting extremists waving Confederate `` battle flags '' and brandishing assault weapons to people demanding a right to shop without taking health precautions .
As Republican lawmakers assert that the `` cure ca n't be worse than the disease '' and the need to reopen the economy , they extol a neo–Social Darwinist worldview that privileges a survival of the fittest – or , at least , those who are wealthy enough and have the health insurance to cloister themselves for the duration .
To some , this problem may seem to pose a genuine paradox : on the one hand , the rights of the individual and individual choice ( liberty ) and the restriction of that liberty in the face of government actions to protect public health . But this is no paradox at all – in fact , it reflects a deeper degeneracy of the concept of freedom in contemporary American politics and culture . The cracks and fissures in American society that we have seen opening during this pandemic are rooted in a broader change in Americans ' understanding of the concept of freedom and the ways that this has been exploited and manipulated by the powerful . Understanding this requires some sense of where the modern idea of freedom came from and how it was defended .
The birth of modern political philosophy had at its core a crucial idea about what political freedom actually meant . According to many early modern political theorists , the concept of liberty denoted the capacity to follow rules and norms that one was able to accept based on one 's conscience . Laws , norms and institutions were not to be arbitrarily enforced upon individuals – i.e. , according to the whim or interest of some powerful agent – but , rather , were to be ratified by one 's own reason and reflection . Liberty was a freedom from dependence and control as well as a freedom to create and follow laws that had the common interest as the foundation of their legitimacy .
This idea of liberty as freedom from the domination of others as well as a freedom to create laws and impose them upon one 's own actions in accordance with the common good and interest was worked out by thinkers such as Machiavelli and Spinoza no less than Locke and Jefferson , among others . It was weaponized during the age of democratic revolutions in Britain , the United States , France , and Haiti and formed the basis for a modern view of politics and human freedom .
But defenders of monarchy and feudal hierarchy , status and privilege demonized the concept of liberty , likening it to a devolution of order and the slide into chaos . Thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes , Robert Filmer and others saw any notion of liberty as essentially linked to a decay of social order . Hobbes saw liberty as a cause of chaos and a state of nature where each did as he pleased . And as Filmer famously put the matter in the opening chapter of his `` Patriarcha '' ( 1680 ) that it was a new and `` dangerous opinion '' where liberty was essentially the power of each to act without the guidance of a sovereign .
Locke pointed out that these thinkers confused liberty with license , and later philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau would argue that our freedom as persons was dependent on our ability to think in terms of a `` general will , '' or in the common interest , even as Immanuel Kant would later make the concept of autonomy the cornerstone to any modern notion of freedom . All agreed , in the end , that liberty was the capacity for one to make laws of action for oneself according to reason , and this reason was one that was anchored in the common , universal parameters of our living in a social world with and among others . All agreed that freedom required responsibility : that to be free meant to take on the burden of self-legislation as a member of a free community . Only in this way could the principle of self-determination and self-rule be secured . Without the ethos of social responsibility , freedom would devolve back into tyranny and dominance : if you could not govern yourself as a member of the community , then others would step in to govern for you .
Much of American political history took a similar course with respect to the idea of liberty . Initially concerned with the conscience of the individual and the ability to protect property , the concept of liberty gradually matured into one where the freedom of each was interdependent on the freedom of others . After the Civil War and the emergence of the Gilded Age , the Progressive movement began to rework the concept of liberty more extensively . Thinkers such as George Herbert Mead , Charles Cooley and John Dewey reworked liberalism into a doctrine that held that the freedom of the individual was not a matter of removing their constraints to accumulate property or do as they pleased , but one that was a function of the extent to which each could partake in the highest caliber of public goods . The expansion of intelligence , the enrichment of one 's capacity to make choices , deliberate about the problems of their community , were all dependent upon this new concept of the individual . Castigating the persistence of the older , individualistic conception of liberty , Dewey argued in 1935 : `` It is absurd to conceive liberty as that of the business entrepreneur and ignore the immense regimentation to which workers are subjected . . . . [ F ] ull freedom of the human spirit and of individuality can be achieved only as there is effective opportunity to share in the cultural resources of civilization . ''
The cultivation of this kind of freedom required a rich nexus of public goods and regulation . Dewey and other progressives rightly saw that modern technological society needed this sense of responsibility even more to guarantee individual freedom . The New Deal and the social democratic welfare state of post-World War II America can be seen as an application of this reworked theory of liberty . But today this has degenerated as we see a reprise of the very narrow conception of liberty that Dewey and his contemporaries attacked as outmoded and out of step with the modern world . Neoliberalism has pushed this reductive , anti-social form of liberty against the social liberalism of the preceding decades . In many ways , the presence of a pathological understanding of freedom has its foundations in the very ways we conducted our pre-pandemic lives . Over the last four decades , neoliberal policies have chipped away at our public institutions , drained state budgets , marginalized public goods like education , and de-regulated our economy . Public life has shriveled as a consequence . Privatization has only reinforced our separateness from the public realm . Ideas about freedom have therefore been retuned to a condition not unlike a Hobbes ' state of nature where a war of all against all prevails .
The ideological project of neoliberalism has been to re-appropriate the concept of liberty and circumscribe it to the narrow realm of property , privacy and economic interest . What use are common goods when each lives according to one 's own efforts ? Liberty now is the absence of restraint , the elimination of any kind of direction over your life and your choices . The political right has made much of this simplistic philosophy : they convinced many citizens to sign on to a corporate agenda that has been able to undo the reforms made throughout much of the twentieth century in economic and social policy . The backlash against technical experts , unions , a robust social safety net , and other struts of an enlightened , socialized democracy is only gaining in momentum .
But there are other forces sustaining this culture of degenerate liberty . Alongside the undermining of the public institutions and spaces that interconnect us , neoliberalism has fostered a hyper consumerist culture . We are a nation of frantic consumers . Those individuals who , in highly publicized instances , stockpiled urgently needed medical supplies were trained by a culture that eagerly awaits Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales . Freedom is the freedom to violently consume . Deprived of the addiction to consumption or confronted by the idea that someone else might need something more urgently than you , it is easy to see why the closure of the economy might inspire rage . Entangled with the false conception of freedom is a false conception of human needs and human dignity .
And so , when we consider again the protests against instructions to stay at home or consider the well-being of fellow citizens by social distancing or wearing masks , we should be aware that these behaviors are the product of the long cultivation of a particularly malign understanding of freedom – one forged to legitimate a public philosophy of anomic individualism that could justify neoliberalism and that is now quite literally making our republic sick . Freedom without responsibility no longer is freedom , it is a kind of licentiousness that is socially as well as personally damaging . Neoliberalism helped rot out the ethos of social responsibility that accompanied modern norms of freedom . The paranoia that accompanies relentless economic competitiveness and social inequality , extended working hours , a culture of senseless consumption and hedonism – all have contributed to the sense that one is in this alone for one 's own benefit . Indeed , it is no accident that the largest percentage of victims of this pandemic have been essential workers deprived of the right unionize , elderly residents of for-profit nursing homes with little regulation , and people of color whose communities have been marginalized by austerity budgets .
In many respects , what Bernie Sanders calls democratic socialism owes far more to the brand of liberalism advocated by Dewey and other philosophers of the Progressive and New Deal eras than to any socialist thinker . Indeed , Sanders has been right that this tradition of thought is more authentically American than the more recent short-sighted and acquisitively individualistic public philosophy nurtured by neoliberalism . In planning its strategy to combat the pandemic , the Biden campaign will also have to confront the pathological conception of freedom that has made the United States one of the worst victims of this pandemic . It will have to show that an orientation toward the common good is requisite for any vital sense of individual liberty . For now we are once again facing the prospect that an unmanaged form of license , masquerading as liberty , will force us to accept more coercive forms of political life .
And as Americans reflect on what the COVID-19 crisis means for the future of American politics and culture , they may want to reflect anew on the ways our ideas about freedom have devolved and instead seek to retrieve once more a sense of social purpose to our degenerated culture of freedom . As Democrats suit up for their match with Donald Trump , this renewed sense of freedom should be the cornerstone for a new public philosophy : one that has democratic purpose , common interest and individual liberty together at its center . To lose this fight will give aid to the enemies of human progress and the culture of freedom that many fought and died for over the course of centuries .","A hair salon owner in Dallas, Texas; then, armed protestors in Michigan and other states; recently, images of packed boardwalks and swimming pools; and now the ""mass debate"" urging parishioners to attend regular religious services.

An emotional Megyn Kelly said she has learned from the backlash over her comments defending blackface.

Charles Manson , the pseudo-satanic sociopath behind a string of killings that shocked California out of its late 1960s cultural reverie , died on Sunday after almost a half century in prison .
The 83-year-old , who died of natural causes , had been serving multiple life sentences in state prison in Corcoran , California , for orchestrating the violence in 1969 that claimed the lives of Sharon Tate , the heavily pregnant wife of film director Roman Polanski , and six others .
While his death prompted the inevitable and renewed questioning around why his grim notoriety had been so enduring , Michele Hanisee , president of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys for Los Angeles County , said : “ Today , Manson ’ s victims are the ones who should be remembered and mourned on the occasion of his death . ”
She went on to quote the late Vincent Bugliosi , the prosecutor who put Manson behind bars , who had said : “ Manson was an evil , sophisticated conman with twisted and warped moral values . ”

Charles Manson, the pseudo-satanic sociopath behind a string of killings that shocked California out of its late 1960s cultural reverie, died on Sunday after almost a half century in prison.

The 83-year-old, who died of natural causes, had been serving multiple life sentences in state prison in Corcoran, California, for orchestrating the violence in 1969 that claimed the lives of Sharon Tate, the heavily pregnant wife of film director Roman Polanski, and six others.

While his death prompted the inevitable and renewed questioning around why his grim notoriety had been so enduring, Michele Hanisee, president of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys for Los Angeles County, said: “Today, Manson’s victims are the ones who should be remembered and mourned on the occasion of his death.”

She went on to quote the late Vincent Bugliosi, the prosecutor who put Manson behind bars, who had said: “Manson was an evil, sophisticated conman with twisted and warped moral values.”

Quick guide A quick guide to Charles Manson Show Hide Who was Charles Manson? Charles Manson was one of the most notorious murderers of the 20th century. He led a cult known as the Manson Family in California, most of whom were disaffected young women. Some became killers under his messianic influence. Murder from afar Despite spending more than 40 years in prison for the murders of seven people in 1969, Manson did not carry out the killings. Instead he convinced members of his ‘family’ to murder. One of their victims was the actor Sharon Tate, who was married to Roman Polanski and was more than eight months' pregnant when she was killed. Celebrity friends By the time of his trial in 1971, Manson had spent half of his life in correctional institutions for various crimes. He became a singer-songwriter before the Tate murders and got a break in the music industry when he met Beach Boys' Dennis Wilson, who let him crash at his home. Helter Skelter It is believed that Manson intended using the murders to incite an apocalyptic race war he called Helter Skelter, taking the name from the Beatles song. Notorious by name The killings and the seven-month trial that followed were the subjects of fevered news coverage in the US.

As the leader of a cult known as the Manson Family, Manson had instructed his followers, made up mostly of disaffected young women, to carry out the killings. The brutality of the murders set Los Angeles on edge, and ended the sunny optimism of the 60s counterculture and its aspirations to a new society built on peace and love. Manson presented himself as a demonic force: at trial, he carved a Nazi swastika into his forehead.

The five received the death penalty but were spared when capital punishment was temporarily abolished following a ruling by the supreme court in 1972.

Manson and three female followers, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, were convicted of murder and conspiracy to murder. Another defendant, Charles “Tex” Watson, was convicted later.

Tate, the wife of Polanski, who was out of the country the night of her murder, was eight and a half months pregnant when Manson’s followers broke into her home in Los Angeles. They stabbed and shot Tate and her visitors, Jay Sebring, Voytek Frykowski, coffee heiress Abigail Folger and Steven Parent. The word “Pig” was written in blood on the front door. Tate, who had starred in The Valley of the Dolls, was stabbed 16 times, and an “X” was carved into her stomach.

The next night, his followers murdered couple Leno and Rosemary LaBianca.

Although the followers committed the murders, Manson had ordered them. At the LaBianca home, he tied up the couple before leaving others to carry out the killings.

After his death on Sunday night, Tate’s sister Debra told NBC: “One could say I’ve forgiven them, which is quite different than forgetting what they are capable of. It is for this reason I fight so hard to make sure that each of these individuals stays in prison until the end of their natural days.”

In the 2004 book Sharon Tate Recollection, Polanski wrote: “Even after so many years, I find myself unable to watch a spectacular sunset or visit a lovely old house or experience visual pleasure of any kind without instinctively telling myself how much she would have loved it all.”

He became friends with the Byrds producer Terry Melcher (the son of Doris Day) and even recorded 13 folksy songs for an album that eventually was titled Lie: The Love and Terror Cult; it was released in March 1970 to help pay for his defense.

Manson had established himself as a would-be cult leader in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco. He took a handful of followers, some of whom would later be convicted in the killings, to the old Spahn Movie Ranch north of LA and turned it into a hedonistic commune.

Van Houten, the youngest member of the original Manson Family, later said that Manson had used sex, LSD, Bible readings, repeated playing of the Beatles’ White Album and rambling lectures about triggering a revolution to brainwash her.

Van Houten, 68, was convicted of the killings of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. She was recommended for parole in September but California’s governor, Jerry Brown, has yet to approve the recommendation. He rejected an earlier decision, concluding that Van Houten posed “an unreasonable danger to society if released from prison”.

In June, officials denied a parole request by Krenwinkel, the state’s longest-serving female prisoner, after her attorney said she had been abused by Manson or another person. She has been denied parole multiple times in the past.

Manson’s lawyer, Irving Kanarek, claimed his client was innocent during a 2014 interview with the Guardian. “No question he was legally innocent. And, more than that, he was actually innocent,” Kanarek said, arguing that there was no evidence connecting him to the case.

At a 2012 parole hearing, which was denied, Manson was quoted as having said to one of his prison psychologists: “I’m special. I’m not like the average inmate. I have spent my life in prison. I have put five people in the grave. I am a very dangerous man.”

According to the LA Times, Manson committed hundreds of rules violations while being held at the Corcoran state prison, including assault, repeated possession of a weapon and threatening staff. Officials said he has spat in guards’ faces, started fights, tried to cause a flood and set his mattress ablaze.

His death is unlikely to end interest in his crimes. Quentin Tarantino is believed to be preparing a film that uses the murders as a backdrop for its main plot, and an adaptation of Emma Cline’s bestselling 2016 novel, The Girls, is on the way.



Writer Joan Didion interviewed Linda Kasabian, the Manson family member who acted as a lookout in the Tate and LaBianca killings and later gave evidence at the trial, and described the atmosphere in Hollywood in an essay from her collection The White Album (1979).

“Everything was unmentionable but nothing was unimaginable…” Didion wrote. “A demented and seductive vortical tension was building in the community. The jitters were setting in. I recall a time when the dogs barked every night and the moon was always full.

“I remember that no one was surprised.”

Reached at home in Manhattan, Didion, 82, told the Guardian: “Manson’s legacy was never obvious to me. It wasn’t obvious when I went to talk with Linda Kasabian, and it isn’t obvious to me now. But I do find it easy to put him from my mind.”

In 2008, California officials ordered the search of a deserted ranch in Death Valley where Manson and his family briefly resided. The search turned up no evidence of human remains.

The grandparents are telling the old family stories for the 37th time . “ It was the most beautiful place you ’ ve ever seen in your life , ” says one , remembering his first day in America . “ There were lights everywhere … It was a celebration of light ! I thought they were for me. ” To hear more feature stories , get the Audm iPhone app . The oldsters start squabbling about whose memory is better . “ It was cold that day , ” one says about some faraway memory . “ What are you talking about ? It was May , late May , ” says another . The young children sit wide-eyed , absorbing family lore and trying to piece together the plotline of the generations . After the meal , there are piles of plates in the sink , squads of children conspiring mischievously in the basement . Groups of young parents huddle in a hallway , making plans . The old men nap on couches , waiting for dessert . It ’ s the extended family in all its tangled , loving , exhausting glory .
This particular family is the one depicted in Barry Levinson ’ s 1990 film , Avalon , based on his own childhood in Baltimore . Five brothers came to America from Eastern Europe around the time of World War I and built a wallpaper business . For a while they did everything together , like in the old country . But as the movie goes along , the extended family begins to split apart . Some members move to the suburbs for more privacy and space . One leaves for a job in a different state . The big blowup comes over something that seems trivial but isn ’ t : The eldest of the brothers arrives late to a Thanksgiving dinner to find that the family has begun the meal without him . “ You cut the turkey without me ? ” he cries . “ Your own flesh and blood ! … You cut the turkey ? ” The pace of life is speeding up . Convenience , privacy , and mobility are more important than family loyalty . “ The idea that they would eat before the brother arrived was a sign of disrespect , ” Levinson told me recently when I asked him about that scene . “ That was the real crack in the family . When you violate the protocol , the whole family structure begins to collapse. ” As the years go by in the movie , the extended family plays a smaller and smaller role . By the 1960s , there ’ s no extended family at Thanksgiving . It ’ s just a young father and mother and their son and daughter , eating turkey off trays in front of the television . In the final scene , the main character is living alone in a nursing home , wondering what happened . “ In the end , you spend everything you ’ ve ever saved , sell everything you ’ ve ever owned , just to exist in a place like this . ”
“ In my childhood , ” Levinson told me , “ you ’ d gather around the grandparents and they would tell the family stories … Now individuals sit around the TV , watching other families ’ stories. ” The main theme of Avalon , he said , is “ the decentralization of the family . And that has continued even further today . Once , families at least gathered around the television . Now each person has their own screen. ” This is the story of our times—the story of the family , once a dense cluster of many siblings and extended kin , fragmenting into ever smaller and more fragile forms . The initial result of that fragmentation , the nuclear family , didn ’ t seem so bad . But then , because the nuclear family is so brittle , the fragmentation continued . In many sectors of society , nuclear families fragmented into single-parent families , single-parent families into chaotic families or no families . If you want to summarize the changes in family structure over the past century , the truest thing to say is this : We ’ ve made life freer for individuals and more unstable for families . We ’ ve made life better for adults but worse for children . We ’ ve moved from big , interconnected , and extended families , which helped protect the most vulnerable people in society from the shocks of life , to smaller , detached nuclear families ( a married couple and their children ) , which give the most privileged people in society room to maximize their talents and expand their options . The shift from bigger and interconnected extended families to smaller and detached nuclear families ultimately led to a familial system that liberates the rich and ravages the working-class and the poor .
Annie Lowrey : The great affordability crisis breaking America This article is about that process , and the devastation it has wrought—and about how Americans are now groping to build new kinds of family and find better ways to live . Part I The Era of Extended Clans Through the early parts of American history , most people lived in what , by today ’ s standards , were big , sprawling households . In 1800 , three-quarters of American workers were farmers . Most of the other quarter worked in small family businesses , like dry-goods stores . People needed a lot of labor to run these enterprises . It was not uncommon for married couples to have seven or eight children . In addition , there might be stray aunts , uncles , and cousins , as well as unrelated servants , apprentices , and farmhands . ( On some southern farms , of course , enslaved African Americans were also an integral part of production and work life . ) Steven Ruggles , a professor of history and population studies at the University of Minnesota , calls these “ corporate families ” —social units organized around a family business . According to Ruggles , in 1800 , 90 percent of American families were corporate families . Until 1850 , roughly three-quarters of Americans older than 65 lived with their kids and grandkids . Nuclear families existed , but they were surrounded by extended or corporate families . Read : What number of kids makes parents happiest ? Extended families have two great strengths . The first is resilience . An extended family is one or more families in a supporting web . Your spouse and children come first , but there are also cousins , in-laws , grandparents—a complex web of relationships among , say , seven , 10 , or 20 people . If a mother dies , siblings , uncles , aunts , and grandparents are there to step in . If a relationship between a father and a child ruptures , others can fill the breach . Extended families have more people to share the unexpected burdens—when a kid gets sick in the middle of the day or when an adult unexpectedly loses a job .
A detached nuclear family , by contrast , is an intense set of relationships among , say , four people . If one relationship breaks , there are no shock absorbers . In a nuclear family , the end of the marriage means the end of the family as it was previously understood . The second great strength of extended families is their socializing force . Multiple adults teach children right from wrong , how to behave toward others , how to be kind . Over the course of the 18th and 19th centuries , industrialization and cultural change began to threaten traditional ways of life . Many people in Britain and the United States doubled down on the extended family in order to create a moral haven in a heartless world . According to Ruggles , the prevalence of extended families living together roughly doubled from 1750 to 1900 , and this way of life was more common than at any time before or since . During the Victorian era , the idea of “ hearth and home ” became a cultural ideal . The home “ is a sacred place , a vestal temple , a temple of the hearth watched over by Household Gods , before whose faces none may come but those whom they can receive with love , ” the great Victorian social critic John Ruskin wrote . This shift was led by the upper-middle class , which was coming to see the family less as an economic unit and more as an emotional and moral unit , a rectory for the formation of hearts and souls . But while extended families have strengths , they can also be exhausting and stifling . They allow little privacy ; you are forced to be in daily intimate contact with people you didn ’ t choose . There ’ s more stability but less mobility . Family bonds are thicker , but individual choice is diminished . You have less space to make your own way in life . In the Victorian era , families were patriarchal , favoring men in general and first-born sons in particular .
As factories opened in the big U.S. cities , in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , young men and women left their extended families to chase the American dream . These young people married as soon as they could . A young man on a farm might wait until 26 to get married ; in the lonely city , men married at 22 or 23 . From 1890 to 1960 , the average age of first marriage dropped by 3.6 years for men and 2.2 years for women . The families they started were nuclear families . The decline of multigenerational cohabiting families exactly mirrors the decline in farm employment . Children were no longer raised to assume economic roles—they were raised so that at adolescence they could fly from the nest , become independent , and seek partners of their own . They were raised not for embeddedness but for autonomy . By the 1920s , the nuclear family with a male breadwinner had replaced the corporate family as the dominant family form . By 1960 , 77.5 percent of all children were living with their two parents , who were married , and apart from their extended family . The Short , Happy Life of the Nuclear Family For a time , it all seemed to work . From 1950 to 1965 , divorce rates dropped , fertility rates rose , and the American nuclear family seemed to be in wonderful shape . And most people seemed prosperous and happy . In these years , a kind of cult formed around this type of family—what McCall ’ s , the leading women ’ s magazine of the day , called “ togetherness. ” Healthy people lived in two-parent families . In a 1957 survey , more than half of the respondents said that unmarried people were “ sick , ” “ immoral , ” or “ neurotic . ”
During this period , a certain family ideal became engraved in our minds : a married couple with 2.5 kids . When we think of the American family , many of us still revert to this ideal . When we have debates about how to strengthen the family , we are thinking of the two-parent nuclear family , with one or two kids , probably living in some detached family home on some suburban street . We take it as the norm , even though this wasn ’ t the way most humans lived during the tens of thousands of years before 1950 , and it isn ’ t the way most humans have lived during the 55 years since 1965 . Today , only a minority of American households are traditional two-parent nuclear families and only one-third of American individuals live in this kind of family . That 1950–65 window was not normal . It was a freakish historical moment when all of society conspired , wittingly and not , to obscure the essential fragility of the nuclear family .
For one thing , most women were relegated to the home . Many corporations , well into the mid-20th century , barred married women from employment : Companies would hire single women , but if those women got married , they would have to quit . Demeaning and disempowering treatment of women was rampant . Women spent enormous numbers of hours trapped inside the home under the headship of their husband , raising children .
For another thing , nuclear families in this era were much more connected to other nuclear families than they are today—constituting a “ modified extended family , ” as the sociologist Eugene Litwak calls it , “ a coalition of nuclear families in a state of mutual dependence. ” Even as late as the 1950s , before television and air-conditioning had fully caught on , people continued to live on one another ’ s front porches and were part of one another ’ s lives . Friends felt free to discipline one another ’ s children . In his book The Lost City , the journalist Alan Ehrenhalt describes life in mid-century Chicago and its suburbs : To be a young homeowner in a suburb like Elmhurst in the 1950s was to participate in a communal enterprise that only the most determined loner could escape : barbecues , coffee klatches , volleyball games , baby-sitting co-ops and constant bartering of household goods , child rearing by the nearest parents who happened to be around , neighbors wandering through the door at any hour without knocking—all these were devices by which young adults who had been set down in a wilderness of tract homes made a community . It was a life lived in public . Finally , conditions in the wider society were ideal for family stability . The postwar period was a high-water mark of church attendance , unionization , social trust , and mass prosperity—all things that correlate with family cohesion . A man could relatively easily find a job that would allow him to be the breadwinner for a single-income family . By 1961 , the median American man age 25 to 29 was earning nearly 400 percent more than his father had earned at about the same age .
Read : Gen-X women are caught in a generational tug-of-war A study of women ’ s magazines by the sociologists Francesca Cancian and Steven L. Gordon found that from 1900 to 1979 , themes of putting family before self dominated in the 1950s : “ Love means self-sacrifice and compromise. ” In the 1960s and ’ 70s , putting self before family was prominent : “ Love means self-expression and individuality. ” Men absorbed these cultural themes , too . The master trend in Baby Boomer culture generally was liberation— “ Free Bird , ” “ Born to Run , ” “ Ramblin ’ Man. ” Eli Finkel , a psychologist and marriage scholar at Northwestern University , has argued that since the 1960s , the dominant family culture has been the “ self-expressive marriage. ” “ Americans , ” he has written , “ now look to marriage increasingly for self-discovery , self-esteem and personal growth. ” Marriage , according to the sociologists Kathryn Edin and Maria Kefalas , “ is no longer primarily about childbearing and childrearing . Now marriage is primarily about adult fulfillment. ” Read : An interview with Eli Finkel on how we expect too much from our romantic partners This cultural shift was very good for some adults , but it was not so good for families generally . Fewer relatives are around in times of stress to help a couple work through them . If you married for love , staying together made less sense when the love died . This attenuation of marital ties may have begun during the late 1800s : The number of divorces increased about fifteenfold from 1870 to 1920 , and then climbed more or less continuously through the first several decades of the nuclear-family era . As the intellectual historian Christopher Lasch noted in the late 1970s , the American family didn ’ t start coming apart in the 1960s ; it had been “ coming apart for more than 100 years . ”
Americans today have less family than ever before . From 1970 to 2012 , the share of households consisting of married couples with kids has been cut in half . In 1960 , according to census data , just 13 percent of all households were single-person households . In 2018 , that figure was 28 percent . In 1850 , 75 percent of Americans older than 65 lived with relatives ; by 1990 , only 18 percent did . Over the past two generations , people have spent less and less time in marriage—they are marrying later , if at all , and divorcing more . In 1950 , 27 percent of marriages ended in divorce ; today , about 45 percent do . In 1960 , 72 percent of American adults were married . In 2017 , nearly half of American adults were single . According to a 2014 report from the Urban Institute , roughly 90 percent of Baby Boomer women and 80 percent of Gen X women married by age 40 , while only about 70 percent of late-Millennial women were expected to do so—the lowest rate in U.S. history . And while more than four-fifths of American adults in a 2019 Pew Research Center survey said that getting married is not essential to living a fulfilling life , it ’ s not just the institution of marriage they ’ re eschewing : In 2004 , 33 percent of Americans ages 18 to 34 were living without a romantic partner , according to the General Social Survey ; by 2018 , that number was up to 51 percent . Over the past two generations , families have also gotten a lot smaller . The general American birth rate is half of what it was in 1960 . In 2012 , most American family households had no children . There are more American homes with pets than with kids . In 1970 , about 20 percent of households had five or more people . As of 2012 , only 9.6 percent did . We ’ re likely living through the most rapid change in family structure in human history . The causes are economic , cultural , and institutional all at once . Over the past two generations , the physical space separating nuclear families has widened . Before , sisters-in-law shouted greetings across the street at each other from their porches . Kids would dash from home to home and eat out of whoever ’ s fridge was closest by . But lawns have grown more expansive and porch life has declined , creating a buffer of space that separates the house and family from anyone else . As Mandy Len Catron recently noted in ███ , married people are less likely to visit parents and siblings , and less inclined to help them do chores or offer emotional support . A code of family self-sufficiency prevails : Mom , Dad , and the kids are on their own , with a barrier around their island home .
Finally , over the past two generations , families have grown more unequal . America now has two entirely different family regimes . Among the highly educated , family patterns are almost as stable as they were in the 1950s ; among the less fortunate , family life is often utter chaos . There ’ s a reason for that divide : Affluent people have the resources to effectively buy extended family , in order to shore themselves up . Think of all the child-rearing labor affluent parents now buy that used to be done by extended kin : babysitting , professional child care , tutoring , coaching , therapy , expensive after-school programs . ( For that matter , think of how the affluent can hire therapists and life coaches for themselves , as replacement for kin or close friends . ) These expensive tools and services not only support children ’ s development and help prepare them to compete in the meritocracy ; by reducing stress and time commitments for parents , they preserve the amity of marriage . Affluent conservatives often pat themselves on the back for having stable nuclear families . They preach that everybody else should build stable families too . But then they ignore one of the main reasons their own families are stable : They can afford to purchase the support that extended family used to provide—and that the people they preach at , further down the income scale , can not .

In 1970 , the family structures of the rich and poor did not differ that greatly . Now there is a chasm between them . As of 2005 , 85 percent of children born to upper-middle-class families were living with both biological parents when the mom was 40 . Among working-class families , only 30 percent were . According to a 2012 report from the National Center for Health Statistics , college-educated women ages 22 to 44 have a 78 percent chance of having their first marriage last at least 20 years . Women in the same age range with a high-school degree or less have only about a 40 percent chance . Among Americans ages 18 to 55 , only 26 percent of the poor and 39 percent of the working class are currently married . In her book Generation Unbound , Isabel Sawhill , an economist at the Brookings Institution , cited research indicating that differences in family structure have “ increased income inequality by 25 percent. ” If the U.S. returned to the marriage rates of 1970 , child poverty would be 20 percent lower . As Andrew Cherlin , a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University , once put it , “ It is the privileged Americans who are marrying , and marrying helps them stay privileged. ” When you put everything together , we ’ re likely living through the most rapid change in family structure in human history . The causes are economic , cultural , and institutional all at once . People who grow up in a nuclear family tend to have a more individualistic mind-set than people who grow up in a multigenerational extended clan . People with an individualistic mind-set tend to be less willing to sacrifice self for the sake of the family , and the result is more family disruption . People who grow up in disrupted families have more trouble getting the education they need to have prosperous careers . People who don ’ t have prosperous careers have trouble building stable families , because of financial challenges and other stressors . The children in those families become more isolated and more traumatized .
Read : The working-to-afford-child-care conundrum Many people growing up in this era have no secure base from which to launch themselves and no well-defined pathway to adulthood . For those who have the human capital to explore , fall down , and have their fall cushioned , that means great freedom and opportunity—and for those who lack those resources , it tends to mean great confusion , drift , and pain . Over the past 50 years , federal and state governments have tried to mitigate the deleterious effects of these trends . They ’ ve tried to increase marriage rates , push down divorce rates , boost fertility , and all the rest . The focus has always been on strengthening the nuclear family , not the extended family . Occasionally , a discrete program will yield some positive results , but the widening of family inequality continues unabated . The people who suffer the most from the decline in family support are the vulnerable—especially children . In 1960 , roughly 5 percent of children were born to unmarried women . Now about 40 percent are . The Pew Research Center reported that 11 percent of children lived apart from their father in 1960 . In 2010 , 27 percent did . Now about half of American children will spend their childhood with both biological parents . Twenty percent of young adults have no contact at all with their father ( though in some cases that ’ s because the father is deceased ) . American children are more likely to live in a single-parent household than children from any other country .
Read : The divorce gap We all know stable and loving single-parent families . But on average , children of single parents or unmarried cohabiting parents tend to have worse health outcomes , worse mental-health outcomes , less academic success , more behavioral problems , and higher truancy rates than do children living with their two married biological parents . According to work by Richard V. Reeves , a co-director of the Center on Children and Families at the Brookings Institution , if you are born into poverty and raised by your married parents , you have an 80 percent chance of climbing out of it . If you are born into poverty and raised by an unmarried mother , you have a 50 percent chance of remaining stuck . It ’ s not just the lack of relationships that hurts children ; it ’ s the churn . According to a 2003 study that Andrew Cherlin cites , 12 percent of American kids had lived in at least three “ parental partnerships ” before they turned 15 . The transition moments , when mom ’ s old partner moves out or her new partner moves in , are the hardest on kids , Cherlin shows . While children are the vulnerable group most obviously affected by recent changes in family structure , they are not the only one . Consider single men . Extended families provided men with the fortifying influences of male bonding and female companionship . Today many American males spend the first 20 years of their life without a father and the next 15 without a spouse . Kay Hymowitz of the Manhattan Institute has spent a good chunk of her career examining the wreckage caused by the decline of the American family , and cites evidence showing that , in the absence of the connection and meaning that family provides , unmarried men are less healthy—alcohol and drug abuse are common—earn less , and die sooner than married men . The period when the nuclear family flourished was not normal . It was a freakish historical moment when all of society conspired to obscure its essential fragility . For women , the nuclear-family structure imposes different pressures . Though women have benefited greatly from the loosening of traditional family structures—they have more freedom to choose the lives they want—many mothers who decide to raise their young children without extended family nearby find that they have chosen a lifestyle that is brutally hard and isolating . The situation is exacerbated by the fact that women still spend significantly more time on housework and child care than men do , according to recent data . Thus , the reality we see around us : stressed , tired mothers trying to balance work and parenting , and having to reschedule work when family life gets messy .
Read : The loneliness of early parenthood Without extended families , older Americans have also suffered . According to the AARP , 35 percent of Americans over 45 say they are chronically lonely . Many older people are now “ elder orphans , ” with no close relatives or friends to take care of them . In 2015 , The New York Times ran an article called “ The Lonely Death of George Bell , ” about a family-less 72-year-old man who died alone and rotted in his Queens apartment for so long that by the time police found him , his body was unrecognizable . Finally , because groups that have endured greater levels of discrimination tend to have more fragile families , African Americans have suffered disproportionately in the era of the detached nuclear family . Nearly half of black families are led by an unmarried single woman , compared with less than one-sixth of white families . ( The high rate of black incarceration guarantees a shortage of available men to be husbands or caretakers of children . ) According to census data from 2010 , 25 percent of black women over 35 have never been married , compared with 8 percent of white women . Two-thirds of African American children lived in single-parent families in 2018 , compared with a quarter of white children . Black single-parent families are most concentrated in precisely those parts of the country in which slavery was most prevalent . Research by John Iceland , a professor of sociology and demography at Penn State , suggests that the differences between white and black family structure explain 30 percent of the affluence gap between the two groups .
In 2004 , the journalist and urbanist Jane Jacobs published her final book , an assessment of North American society called Dark Age Ahead . At the core of her argument was the idea that families are “ rigged to fail. ” The structures that once supported the family no longer exist , she wrote . Jacobs was too pessimistic about many things , but for millions of people , the shift from big and/or extended families to detached nuclear families has indeed been a disaster . As the social structures that support the family have decayed , the debate about it has taken on a mythical quality . Social conservatives insist that we can bring the nuclear family back . But the conditions that made for stable nuclear families in the 1950s are never returning . Conservatives have nothing to say to the kid whose dad has split , whose mom has had three other kids with different dads ; “ go live in a nuclear family ” is really not relevant advice . If only a minority of households are traditional nuclear families , that means the majority are something else : single parents , never-married parents , blended families , grandparent-headed families , serial partnerships , and so on . Conservative ideas have not caught up with this reality . Read : How politics in Trump ’ s America divides families Progressives , meanwhile , still talk like self-expressive individualists of the 1970s : People should have the freedom to pick whatever family form works for them . And , of course , they should . But many of the new family forms do not work well for most people—and while progressive elites say that all family structures are fine , their own behavior suggests that they believe otherwise . As the sociologist W. Bradford Wilcox has pointed out , highly educated progressives may talk a tolerant game on family structure when speaking about society at large , but they have extremely strict expectations for their own families . When Wilcox asked his University of Virginia students if they thought having a child out of wedlock was wrong , 62 percent said it was not wrong . When he asked the students how their own parents would feel if they themselves had a child out of wedlock , 97 percent said their parents would “ freak out. ” In a recent survey by the Institute for Family Studies , college-educated Californians ages 18 to 50 were less likely than those who hadn ’ t graduated from college to say that having a baby out of wedlock is wrong . But they were more likely to say that personally they did not approve of having a baby out of wedlock .
In other words , while social conservatives have a philosophy of family life they can ’ t operationalize , because it no longer is relevant , progressives have no philosophy of family life at all , because they don ’ t want to seem judgmental . The sexual revolution has come and gone , and it ’ s left us with no governing norms of family life , no guiding values , no articulated ideals . On this most central issue , our shared culture often has nothing relevant to say—and so for decades things have been falling apart . Read : Why is it hard for liberals to talk about ‘ family values ’ ? The good news is that human beings adapt , even if politics are slow to do so . When one family form stops working , people cast about for something new—sometimes finding it in something very old . Part II Redefining Kinship In the beginning was the band . For tens of thousands of years , people commonly lived in small bands of , say , 25 people , which linked up with perhaps 20 other bands to form a tribe . People in the band went out foraging for food and brought it back to share . They hunted together , fought wars together , made clothing for one another , looked after one another ’ s kids . In every realm of life , they relied on their extended family and wider kin . Except they didn ’ t define kin the way we do today . We think of kin as those biologically related to us . But throughout most of human history , kinship was something you could create .
Anthropologists have been arguing for decades about what exactly kinship is . Studying traditional societies , they have found wide varieties of created kinship among different cultures . For the Ilongot people of the Philippines , people who migrated somewhere together are kin . For the New Guineans of the Nebilyer Valley , kinship is created by sharing grease—the life force found in mother ’ s milk or sweet potatoes . The Chuukese people in Micronesia have a saying : “ My sibling from the same canoe ” ; if two people survive a dangerous trial at sea , then they become kin . On the Alaskan North Slope , the Inupiat name their children after dead people , and those children are considered members of their namesake ’ s family . In other words , for vast stretches of human history people lived in extended families consisting of not just people they were related to but people they chose to cooperate with . An international research team recently did a genetic analysis of people who were buried together—and therefore presumably lived together—34,000 years ago in what is now Russia . They found that the people who were buried together were not closely related to one another . In a study of 32 present-day foraging societies , primary kin—parents , siblings , and children—usually made up less than 10 percent of a residential band . Extended families in traditional societies may or may not have been genetically close , but they were probably emotionally closer than most of us can imagine . In a beautiful essay on kinship , Marshall Sahlins , an anthropologist at the University of Chicago , says that kin in many such societies share a “ mutuality of being. ” The late religion scholar J. Prytz-Johansen wrote that kinship is experienced as an “ inner solidarity ” of souls . The late South African anthropologist Monica Wilson described kinsmen as “ mystically dependent ” on one another . Kinsmen belong to one another , Sahlins writes , because they see themselves as “ members of one another . ”
Back in the 17th and 18th centuries , when European Protestants came to North America , their relatively individualistic culture existed alongside Native Americans ’ very communal culture . In his book Tribe , Sebastian Junger describes what happened next : While European settlers kept defecting to go live with Native American families , almost no Native Americans ever defected to go live with European families . Europeans occasionally captured Native Americans and forced them to come live with them . They taught them English and educated them in Western ways . But almost every time they were able , the indigenous Americans fled . European settlers were sometimes captured by Native Americans during wars and brought to live in Native communities . They rarely tried to run away . This bothered the Europeans . They had the superior civilization , so why were people voting with their feet to go live in another way ? When you read such accounts , you can ’ t help but wonder whether our civilization has somehow made a gigantic mistake . We can ’ t go back , of course . Western individualists are no longer the kind of people who live in prehistoric bands . We may even no longer be the kind of people who were featured in the early scenes of Avalon . We value privacy and individual freedom too much . Our culture is oddly stuck . We want stability and rootedness , but also mobility , dynamic capitalism , and the liberty to adopt the lifestyle we choose . We want close families , but not the legal , cultural , and sociological constraints that made them possible . We ’ ve seen the wreckage left behind by the collapse of the detached nuclear family . We ’ ve seen the rise of opioid addiction , of suicide , of depression , of inequality—all products , in part , of a family structure that is too fragile , and a society that is too detached , disconnected , and distrustful . And yet we can ’ t quite return to a more collective world . The words the historians Steven Mintz and Susan Kellogg wrote in 1988 are even truer today : “ Many Americans are groping for a new paradigm of American family life , but in the meantime a profound sense of confusion and ambivalence reigns . ”
From Nuclear Families to Forged Families Yet recent signs suggest at least the possibility that a new family paradigm is emerging . Many of the statistics I ’ ve cited are dire . But they describe the past—what got us to where we are now . In reaction to family chaos , accumulating evidence suggests , the prioritization of family is beginning to make a comeback . Americans are experimenting with new forms of kinship and extended family in search of stability . Usually behavior changes before we realize that a new cultural paradigm has emerged . Imagine hundreds of millions of tiny arrows . In times of social transformation , they shift direction—a few at first , and then a lot . Nobody notices for a while , but then eventually people begin to recognize that a new pattern , and a new set of values , has emerged . That may be happening now—in part out of necessity but in part by choice . Since the 1970s , and especially since the 2008 recession , economic pressures have pushed Americans toward greater reliance on family . Starting around 2012 , the share of children living with married parents began to inch up . And college students have more contact with their parents than they did a generation ago . We tend to deride this as helicopter parenting or a failure to launch , and it has its excesses . But the educational process is longer and more expensive these days , so it makes sense that young adults rely on their parents for longer than they used to . In 1980 , only 12 percent of Americans lived in multigenerational households . But the financial crisis of 2008 prompted a sharp rise in multigenerational homes . Today 20 percent of Americans—64 million people , an all-time high—live in multigenerational homes . The revival of the extended family has largely been driven by young adults moving back home . In 2014 , 35 percent of American men ages 18 to 34 lived with their parents . In time this shift might show itself to be mostly healthy , impelled not just by economic necessity but by beneficent social impulses ; polling data suggest that many young people are already looking ahead to helping their parents in old age . Another chunk of the revival is attributable to seniors moving in with their children . The percentage of seniors who live alone peaked around 1990 . Now more than a fifth of Americans 65 and over live in multigenerational homes . This doesn ’ t count the large share of seniors who are moving to be close to their grandkids but not into the same household . Immigrants and people of color—many of whom face greater economic and social stress—are more likely to live in extended-family households . More than 20 percent of Asians , black people , and Latinos live in multigenerational households , compared with 16 percent of white people . As America becomes more diverse , extended families are becoming more common . African Americans have always relied on extended family more than white Americans do . “ Despite the forces working to separate us—slavery , Jim Crow , forced migration , the prison system , gentrification—we have maintained an incredible commitment to each other , ” Mia Birdsong , the author of the forthcoming book How We Show Up , told me recently . “ The reality is , black families are expansive , fluid , and brilliantly rely on the support , knowledge , and capacity of ‘ the village ’ to take care of each other . Here ’ s an illustration : The white researcher/social worker/whatever sees a child moving between their mother ’ s house , their grandparents ’ house , and their uncle ’ s house and sees that as ‘ instability. ’ But what ’ s actually happening is the family ( extended and chosen ) is leveraging all of its resources to raise that child. ” Read : Why black families struggle to build wealth The black extended family survived even under slavery , and all the forced family separations that involved . Family was essential in the Jim Crow South and in the inner cities of the North , as a way to cope with the stresses of mass migration and limited opportunities , and with structural racism . But government policy sometimes made it more difficult for this family form to thrive . I began my career as a police reporter in Chicago , writing about public-housing projects like Cabrini-Green . Guided by social-science research , politicians tore down neighborhoods of rickety low-rise buildings—uprooting the complex webs of social connection those buildings supported , despite high rates of violence and crime—and put up big apartment buildings . The result was a horror : violent crime , gangs taking over the elevators , the erosion of family and neighborly life . Fortunately , those buildings have since been torn down themselves , replaced by mixed-income communities that are more amenable to the profusion of family forms . I often ask African friends who have immigrated to America what most struck them when they arrived . Their answer is always a variation on a theme—the loneliness . The return of multigenerational living arrangements is already changing the built landscape . A 2016 survey by a real-estate consulting firm found that 44 percent of home buyers were looking for a home that would accommodate their elderly parents , and 42 percent wanted one that would accommodate their returning adult children . Home builders have responded by putting up houses that are what the construction firm Lennar calls “ two homes under one roof. ” These houses are carefully built so that family members can spend time together while also preserving their privacy . Many of these homes have a shared mudroom , laundry room , and common area . But the “ in-law suite , ” the place for aging parents , has its own entrance , kitchenette , and dining area . The “ Millennial suite , ” the place for boomeranging adult children , has its own driveway and entrance too . These developments , of course , cater to those who can afford houses in the first place—but they speak to a common realization : Family members of different generations need to do more to support one another . The most interesting extended families are those that stretch across kinship lines . The past several years have seen the rise of new living arrangements that bring nonbiological kin into family or familylike relationships . On the website CoAbode , single mothers can find other single mothers interested in sharing a home . All across the country , you can find co-housing projects , in which groups of adults live as members of an extended family , with separate sleeping quarters and shared communal areas . Common , a real-estate-development company that launched in 2015 , operates more than 25 co-housing communities , in six cities , where young singles can live this way . Common also recently teamed up with another developer , Tishman Speyer , to launch Kin , a co-housing community for young parents . Each young family has its own living quarters , but the facilities also have shared play spaces , child-care services , and family-oriented events and outings . Read : The hot new Millennial housing trend is a repeat of the Middle Ages These experiments , and others like them , suggest that while people still want flexibility and some privacy , they are casting about for more communal ways of living , guided by a still-developing set of values . At a co-housing community in Oakland , California , called Temescal Commons , the 23 members , ranging in age from 1 to 83 , live in a complex with nine housing units . This is not some rich Bay Area hipster commune . The apartments are small , and the residents are middle- and working-class . They have a shared courtyard and a shared industrial-size kitchen where residents prepare a communal dinner on Thursday and Sunday nights . Upkeep is a shared responsibility . The adults babysit one another ’ s children , and members borrow sugar and milk from one another . The older parents counsel the younger ones . When members of this extended family have suffered bouts of unemployment or major health crises , the whole clan has rallied together . Courtney E. Martin , a writer who focuses on how people are redefining the American dream , is a Temescal Commons resident . “ I really love that our kids grow up with different versions of adulthood all around , especially different versions of masculinity , ” she told me . “ We consider all of our kids all of our kids. ” Martin has a 3-year-old daughter , Stella , who has a special bond with a young man in his 20s that never would have taken root outside this extended-family structure . “ Stella makes him laugh , and David feels awesome that this 3-year-old adores him , ” Martin said . This is the kind of magic , she concluded , that wealth can ’ t buy . You can only have it through time and commitment , by joining an extended family . This kind of community would fall apart if residents moved in and out . But at least in this case , they don ’ t . Read : The extended family of my two open adoptions As Martin was talking , I was struck by one crucial difference between the old extended families like those in Avalon and the new ones of today : the role of women . The extended family in Avalon thrived because all the women in the family were locked in the kitchen , feeding 25 people at a time . In 2008 , a team of American and Japanese researchers found that women in multigenerational households in Japan were at greater risk of heart disease than women living with spouses only , likely because of stress .

The scene is one many of us have somewhere in our family history: Dozens of people celebrating Thanksgiving or some other holiday around a makeshift stretch of family tables—siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, great-aunts. The grandparents are telling the old family stories for the 37th time. “It was the most beautiful place you’ve ever seen in your life,” says one, remembering his first day in America. “There were lights everywhere … It was a celebration of light! I thought they were for me.” To hear more feature stories, get the Audm iPhone app. The oldsters start squabbling about whose memory is better. “It was cold that day,” one says about some faraway memory. “What are you talking about? It was May, late May,” says another. The young children sit wide-eyed, absorbing family lore and trying to piece together the plotline of the generations. After the meal, there are piles of plates in the sink, squads of children conspiring mischievously in the basement. Groups of young parents huddle in a hallway, making plans. The old men nap on couches, waiting for dessert. It’s the extended family in all its tangled, loving, exhausting glory.

This particular family is the one depicted in Barry Levinson’s 1990 film, Avalon, based on his own childhood in Baltimore. Five brothers came to America from Eastern Europe around the time of World War I and built a wallpaper business. For a while they did everything together, like in the old country. But as the movie goes along, the extended family begins to split apart. Some members move to the suburbs for more privacy and space. One leaves for a job in a different state. The big blowup comes over something that seems trivial but isn’t: The eldest of the brothers arrives late to a Thanksgiving dinner to find that the family has begun the meal without him. “You cut the turkey without me?” he cries. “Your own flesh and blood! … You cut the turkey?” The pace of life is speeding up. Convenience, privacy, and mobility are more important than family loyalty. “The idea that they would eat before the brother arrived was a sign of disrespect,” Levinson told me recently when I asked him about that scene. “That was the real crack in the family. When you violate the protocol, the whole family structure begins to collapse.” As the years go by in the movie, the extended family plays a smaller and smaller role. By the 1960s, there’s no extended family at Thanksgiving. It’s just a young father and mother and their son and daughter, eating turkey off trays in front of the television. In the final scene, the main character is living alone in a nursing home, wondering what happened. “In the end, you spend everything you’ve ever saved, sell everything you’ve ever owned, just to exist in a place like this.”

“In my childhood,” Levinson told me, “you’d gather around the grandparents and they would tell the family stories … Now individuals sit around the TV, watching other families’ stories.” The main theme of Avalon, he said, is “the decentralization of the family. And that has continued even further today. Once, families at least gathered around the television. Now each person has their own screen.” This is the story of our times—the story of the family, once a dense cluster of many siblings and extended kin, fragmenting into ever smaller and more fragile forms. The initial result of that fragmentation, the nuclear family, didn’t seem so bad. But then, because the nuclear family is so brittle, the fragmentation continued. In many sectors of society, nuclear families fragmented into single-parent families, single-parent families into chaotic families or no families. If you want to summarize the changes in family structure over the past century, the truest thing to say is this: We’ve made life freer for individuals and more unstable for families. We’ve made life better for adults but worse for children. We’ve moved from big, interconnected, and extended families, which helped protect the most vulnerable people in society from the shocks of life, to smaller, detached nuclear families (a married couple and their children), which give the most privileged people in society room to maximize their talents and expand their options. The shift from bigger and interconnected extended families to smaller and detached nuclear families ultimately led to a familial system that liberates the rich and ravages the working-class and the poor.

Annie Lowrey: The great affordability crisis breaking America This article is about that process, and the devastation it has wrought—and about how Americans are now groping to build new kinds of family and find better ways to live. Part I The Era of Extended Clans Through the early parts of American history, most people lived in what, by today’s standards, were big, sprawling households. In 1800, three-quarters of American workers were farmers. Most of the other quarter worked in small family businesses, like dry-goods stores. People needed a lot of labor to run these enterprises. It was not uncommon for married couples to have seven or eight children. In addition, there might be stray aunts, uncles, and cousins, as well as unrelated servants, apprentices, and farmhands. (On some southern farms, of course, enslaved African Americans were also an integral part of production and work life.) Steven Ruggles, a professor of history and population studies at the University of Minnesota, calls these “corporate families”—social units organized around a family business. According to Ruggles, in 1800, 90 percent of American families were corporate families. Until 1850, roughly three-quarters of Americans older than 65 lived with their kids and grandkids. Nuclear families existed, but they were surrounded by extended or corporate families. Read: What number of kids makes parents happiest? Extended families have two great strengths. The first is resilience. An extended family is one or more families in a supporting web. Your spouse and children come first, but there are also cousins, in-laws, grandparents—a complex web of relationships among, say, seven, 10, or 20 people. If a mother dies, siblings, uncles, aunts, and grandparents are there to step in. If a relationship between a father and a child ruptures, others can fill the breach. Extended families have more people to share the unexpected burdens—when a kid gets sick in the middle of the day or when an adult unexpectedly loses a job.

A detached nuclear family, by contrast, is an intense set of relationships among, say, four people. If one relationship breaks, there are no shock absorbers. In a nuclear family, the end of the marriage means the end of the family as it was previously understood. The second great strength of extended families is their socializing force. Multiple adults teach children right from wrong, how to behave toward others, how to be kind. Over the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, industrialization and cultural change began to threaten traditional ways of life. Many people in Britain and the United States doubled down on the extended family in order to create a moral haven in a heartless world. According to Ruggles, the prevalence of extended families living together roughly doubled from 1750 to 1900, and this way of life was more common than at any time before or since. During the Victorian era, the idea of “hearth and home” became a cultural ideal. The home “is a sacred place, a vestal temple, a temple of the hearth watched over by Household Gods, before whose faces none may come but those whom they can receive with love,” the great Victorian social critic John Ruskin wrote. This shift was led by the upper-middle class, which was coming to see the family less as an economic unit and more as an emotional and moral unit, a rectory for the formation of hearts and souls. But while extended families have strengths, they can also be exhausting and stifling. They allow little privacy; you are forced to be in daily intimate contact with people you didn’t choose. There’s more stability but less mobility. Family bonds are thicker, but individual choice is diminished. You have less space to make your own way in life. In the Victorian era, families were patriarchal, favoring men in general and first-born sons in particular.

As factories opened in the big U.S. cities, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, young men and women left their extended families to chase the American dream. These young people married as soon as they could. A young man on a farm might wait until 26 to get married; in the lonely city, men married at 22 or 23. From 1890 to 1960, the average age of first marriage dropped by 3.6 years for men and 2.2 years for women. The families they started were nuclear families. The decline of multigenerational cohabiting families exactly mirrors the decline in farm employment. Children were no longer raised to assume economic roles—they were raised so that at adolescence they could fly from the nest, become independent, and seek partners of their own. They were raised not for embeddedness but for autonomy. By the 1920s, the nuclear family with a male breadwinner had replaced the corporate family as the dominant family form. By 1960, 77.5 percent of all children were living with their two parents, who were married, and apart from their extended family. The Short, Happy Life of the Nuclear Family For a time, it all seemed to work. From 1950 to 1965, divorce rates dropped, fertility rates rose, and the American nuclear family seemed to be in wonderful shape. And most people seemed prosperous and happy. In these years, a kind of cult formed around this type of family—what McCall’s, the leading women’s magazine of the day, called “togetherness.” Healthy people lived in two-parent families. In a 1957 survey, more than half of the respondents said that unmarried people were “sick,” “immoral,” or “neurotic.”

During this period, a certain family ideal became engraved in our minds: a married couple with 2.5 kids. When we think of the American family, many of us still revert to this ideal. When we have debates about how to strengthen the family, we are thinking of the two-parent nuclear family, with one or two kids, probably living in some detached family home on some suburban street. We take it as the norm, even though this wasn’t the way most humans lived during the tens of thousands of years before 1950, and it isn’t the way most humans have lived during the 55 years since 1965. Today, only a minority of American households are traditional two-parent nuclear families and only one-third of American individuals live in this kind of family. That 1950–65 window was not normal. It was a freakish historical moment when all of society conspired, wittingly and not, to obscure the essential fragility of the nuclear family.

For one thing, most women were relegated to the home. Many corporations, well into the mid-20th century, barred married women from employment: Companies would hire single women, but if those women got married, they would have to quit. Demeaning and disempowering treatment of women was rampant. Women spent enormous numbers of hours trapped inside the home under the headship of their husband, raising children.

For another thing, nuclear families in this era were much more connected to other nuclear families than they are today—constituting a “modified extended family,” as the sociologist Eugene Litwak calls it, “a coalition of nuclear families in a state of mutual dependence.” Even as late as the 1950s, before television and air-conditioning had fully caught on, people continued to live on one another’s front porches and were part of one another’s lives. Friends felt free to discipline one another’s children. In his book The Lost City, the journalist Alan Ehrenhalt describes life in mid-century Chicago and its suburbs: To be a young homeowner in a suburb like Elmhurst in the 1950s was to participate in a communal enterprise that only the most determined loner could escape: barbecues, coffee klatches, volleyball games, baby-sitting co-ops and constant bartering of household goods, child rearing by the nearest parents who happened to be around, neighbors wandering through the door at any hour without knocking—all these were devices by which young adults who had been set down in a wilderness of tract homes made a community. It was a life lived in public. Finally, conditions in the wider society were ideal for family stability. The postwar period was a high-water mark of church attendance, unionization, social trust, and mass prosperity—all things that correlate with family cohesion. A man could relatively easily find a job that would allow him to be the breadwinner for a single-income family. By 1961, the median American man age 25 to 29 was earning nearly 400 percent more than his father had earned at about the same age.

In short, the period from 1950 to 1965 demonstrated that a stable society can be built around nuclear families—so long as women are relegated to the household, nuclear families are so intertwined that they are basically extended families by another name, and every economic and sociological condition in society is working together to support the institution. Video: How the Nuclear Family Broke Down Disintegration But these conditions did not last. The constellation of forces that had briefly shored up the nuclear family began to fall away, and the sheltered family of the 1950s was supplanted by the stressed family of every decade since. Some of the strains were economic. Starting in the mid-’70s, young men’s wages declined, putting pressure on working-class families in particular. The major strains were cultural. Society became more individualistic and more self-oriented. People put greater value on privacy and autonomy. A rising feminist movement helped endow women with greater freedom to live and work as they chose.

Read: Gen-X women are caught in a generational tug-of-war A study of women’s magazines by the sociologists Francesca Cancian and Steven L. Gordon found that from 1900 to 1979, themes of putting family before self dominated in the 1950s: “Love means self-sacrifice and compromise.” In the 1960s and ’70s, putting self before family was prominent: “Love means self-expression and individuality.” Men absorbed these cultural themes, too. The master trend in Baby Boomer culture generally was liberation—“Free Bird,” “Born to Run,” “Ramblin’ Man.” Eli Finkel, a psychologist and marriage scholar at Northwestern University, has argued that since the 1960s, the dominant family culture has been the “self-expressive marriage.” “Americans,” he has written, “now look to marriage increasingly for self-discovery, self-esteem and personal growth.” Marriage, according to the sociologists Kathryn Edin and Maria Kefalas, “is no longer primarily about childbearing and childrearing. Now marriage is primarily about adult fulfillment.” Read: An interview with Eli Finkel on how we expect too much from our romantic partners This cultural shift was very good for some adults, but it was not so good for families generally. Fewer relatives are around in times of stress to help a couple work through them. If you married for love, staying together made less sense when the love died. This attenuation of marital ties may have begun during the late 1800s: The number of divorces increased about fifteenfold from 1870 to 1920, and then climbed more or less continuously through the first several decades of the nuclear-family era. As the intellectual historian Christopher Lasch noted in the late 1970s, the American family didn’t start coming apart in the 1960s; it had been “coming apart for more than 100 years.”

Americans today have less family than ever before. From 1970 to 2012, the share of households consisting of married couples with kids has been cut in half. In 1960, according to census data, just 13 percent of all households were single-person households. In 2018, that figure was 28 percent. In 1850, 75 percent of Americans older than 65 lived with relatives; by 1990, only 18 percent did. Over the past two generations, people have spent less and less time in marriage—they are marrying later, if at all, and divorcing more. In 1950, 27 percent of marriages ended in divorce; today, about 45 percent do. In 1960, 72 percent of American adults were married. In 2017, nearly half of American adults were single. According to a 2014 report from the Urban Institute, roughly 90 percent of Baby Boomer women and 80 percent of Gen X women married by age 40, while only about 70 percent of late-Millennial women were expected to do so—the lowest rate in U.S. history. And while more than four-fifths of American adults in a 2019 Pew Research Center survey said that getting married is not essential to living a fulfilling life, it’s not just the institution of marriage they’re eschewing: In 2004, 33 percent of Americans ages 18 to 34 were living without a romantic partner, according to the General Social Survey; by 2018, that number was up to 51 percent. Over the past two generations, families have also gotten a lot smaller. The general American birth rate is half of what it was in 1960. In 2012, most American family households had no children. There are more American homes with pets than with kids. In 1970, about 20 percent of households had five or more people. As of 2012, only 9.6 percent did. We’re likely living through the most rapid change in family structure in human history. The causes are economic, cultural, and institutional all at once. Over the past two generations, the physical space separating nuclear families has widened. Before, sisters-in-law shouted greetings across the street at each other from their porches. Kids would dash from home to home and eat out of whoever’s fridge was closest by. But lawns have grown more expansive and porch life has declined, creating a buffer of space that separates the house and family from anyone else. As Mandy Len Catron recently noted in The Atlantic, married people are less likely to visit parents and siblings, and less inclined to help them do chores or offer emotional support. A code of family self-sufficiency prevails: Mom, Dad, and the kids are on their own, with a barrier around their island home.

Finally, over the past two generations, families have grown more unequal. America now has two entirely different family regimes. Among the highly educated, family patterns are almost as stable as they were in the 1950s; among the less fortunate, family life is often utter chaos. There’s a reason for that divide: Affluent people have the resources to effectively buy extended family, in order to shore themselves up. Think of all the child-rearing labor affluent parents now buy that used to be done by extended kin: babysitting, professional child care, tutoring, coaching, therapy, expensive after-school programs. (For that matter, think of how the affluent can hire therapists and life coaches for themselves, as replacement for kin or close friends.) These expensive tools and services not only support children’s development and help prepare them to compete in the meritocracy; by reducing stress and time commitments for parents, they preserve the amity of marriage. Affluent conservatives often pat themselves on the back for having stable nuclear families. They preach that everybody else should build stable families too. But then they ignore one of the main reasons their own families are stable: They can afford to purchase the support that extended family used to provide—and that the people they preach at, further down the income scale, cannot.

In 1970, the family structures of the rich and poor did not differ that greatly. Now there is a chasm between them. As of 2005, 85 percent of children born to upper-middle-class families were living with both biological parents when the mom was 40. Among working-class families, only 30 percent were. According to a 2012 report from the National Center for Health Statistics, college-educated women ages 22 to 44 have a 78 percent chance of having their first marriage last at least 20 years. Women in the same age range with a high-school degree or less have only about a 40 percent chance. Among Americans ages 18 to 55, only 26 percent of the poor and 39 percent of the working class are currently married. In her book Generation Unbound, Isabel Sawhill, an economist at the Brookings Institution, cited research indicating that differences in family structure have “increased income inequality by 25 percent.” If the U.S. returned to the marriage rates of 1970, child poverty would be 20 percent lower. As Andrew Cherlin, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University, once put it, “It is the privileged Americans who are marrying, and marrying helps them stay privileged.” When you put everything together, we’re likely living through the most rapid change in family structure in human history. The causes are economic, cultural, and institutional all at once. People who grow up in a nuclear family tend to have a more individualistic mind-set than people who grow up in a multigenerational extended clan. People with an individualistic mind-set tend to be less willing to sacrifice self for the sake of the family, and the result is more family disruption. People who grow up in disrupted families have more trouble getting the education they need to have prosperous careers. People who don’t have prosperous careers have trouble building stable families, because of financial challenges and other stressors. The children in those families become more isolated and more traumatized.

Read: The working-to-afford-child-care conundrum Many people growing up in this era have no secure base from which to launch themselves and no well-defined pathway to adulthood. For those who have the human capital to explore, fall down, and have their fall cushioned, that means great freedom and opportunity—and for those who lack those resources, it tends to mean great confusion, drift, and pain. Over the past 50 years, federal and state governments have tried to mitigate the deleterious effects of these trends. They’ve tried to increase marriage rates, push down divorce rates, boost fertility, and all the rest. The focus has always been on strengthening the nuclear family, not the extended family. Occasionally, a discrete program will yield some positive results, but the widening of family inequality continues unabated. The people who suffer the most from the decline in family support are the vulnerable—especially children. In 1960, roughly 5 percent of children were born to unmarried women. Now about 40 percent are. The Pew Research Center reported that 11 percent of children lived apart from their father in 1960. In 2010, 27 percent did. Now about half of American children will spend their childhood with both biological parents. Twenty percent of young adults have no contact at all with their father (though in some cases that’s because the father is deceased). American children are more likely to live in a single-parent household than children from any other country.

Read: The divorce gap We all know stable and loving single-parent families. But on average, children of single parents or unmarried cohabiting parents tend to have worse health outcomes, worse mental-health outcomes, less academic success, more behavioral problems, and higher truancy rates than do children living with their two married biological parents. According to work by Richard V. Reeves, a co-director of the Center on Children and Families at the Brookings Institution, if you are born into poverty and raised by your married parents, you have an 80 percent chance of climbing out of it. If you are born into poverty and raised by an unmarried mother, you have a 50 percent chance of remaining stuck. It’s not just the lack of relationships that hurts children; it’s the churn. According to a 2003 study that Andrew Cherlin cites, 12 percent of American kids had lived in at least three “parental partnerships” before they turned 15. The transition moments, when mom’s old partner moves out or her new partner moves in, are the hardest on kids, Cherlin shows. While children are the vulnerable group most obviously affected by recent changes in family structure, they are not the only one. Consider single men. Extended families provided men with the fortifying influences of male bonding and female companionship. Today many American males spend the first 20 years of their life without a father and the next 15 without a spouse. Kay Hymowitz of the Manhattan Institute has spent a good chunk of her career examining the wreckage caused by the decline of the American family, and cites evidence showing that, in the absence of the connection and meaning that family provides, unmarried men are less healthy—alcohol and drug abuse are common—earn less, and die sooner than married men. The period when the nuclear family flourished was not normal. It was a freakish historical moment when all of society conspired to obscure its essential fragility. For women, the nuclear-family structure imposes different pressures. Though women have benefited greatly from the loosening of traditional family structures—they have more freedom to choose the lives they want—many mothers who decide to raise their young children without extended family nearby find that they have chosen a lifestyle that is brutally hard and isolating. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that women still spend significantly more time on housework and child care than men do, according to recent data. Thus, the reality we see around us: stressed, tired mothers trying to balance work and parenting, and having to reschedule work when family life gets messy.

Read: The loneliness of early parenthood Without extended families, older Americans have also suffered. According to the AARP, 35 percent of Americans over 45 say they are chronically lonely. Many older people are now “elder orphans,” with no close relatives or friends to take care of them. In 2015, The New York Times ran an article called “The Lonely Death of George Bell,” about a family-less 72-year-old man who died alone and rotted in his Queens apartment for so long that by the time police found him, his body was unrecognizable. Finally, because groups that have endured greater levels of discrimination tend to have more fragile families, African Americans have suffered disproportionately in the era of the detached nuclear family. Nearly half of black families are led by an unmarried single woman, compared with less than one-sixth of white families. (The high rate of black incarceration guarantees a shortage of available men to be husbands or caretakers of children.) According to census data from 2010, 25 percent of black women over 35 have never been married, compared with 8 percent of white women. Two-thirds of African American children lived in single-parent families in 2018, compared with a quarter of white children. Black single-parent families are most concentrated in precisely those parts of the country in which slavery was most prevalent. Research by John Iceland, a professor of sociology and demography at Penn State, suggests that the differences between white and black family structure explain 30 percent of the affluence gap between the two groups.

In 2004, the journalist and urbanist Jane Jacobs published her final book, an assessment of North American society called Dark Age Ahead. At the core of her argument was the idea that families are “rigged to fail.” The structures that once supported the family no longer exist, she wrote. Jacobs was too pessimistic about many things, but for millions of people, the shift from big and/or extended families to detached nuclear families has indeed been a disaster. As the social structures that support the family have decayed, the debate about it has taken on a mythical quality. Social conservatives insist that we can bring the nuclear family back. But the conditions that made for stable nuclear families in the 1950s are never returning. Conservatives have nothing to say to the kid whose dad has split, whose mom has had three other kids with different dads; “go live in a nuclear family” is really not relevant advice. If only a minority of households are traditional nuclear families, that means the majority are something else: single parents, never-married parents, blended families, grandparent-headed families, serial partnerships, and so on. Conservative ideas have not caught up with this reality. Read: How politics in Trump’s America divides families Progressives, meanwhile, still talk like self-expressive individualists of the 1970s: People should have the freedom to pick whatever family form works for them. And, of course, they should. But many of the new family forms do not work well for most people—and while progressive elites say that all family structures are fine, their own behavior suggests that they believe otherwise. As the sociologist W. Bradford Wilcox has pointed out, highly educated progressives may talk a tolerant game on family structure when speaking about society at large, but they have extremely strict expectations for their own families. When Wilcox asked his University of Virginia students if they thought having a child out of wedlock was wrong, 62 percent said it was not wrong. When he asked the students how their own parents would feel if they themselves had a child out of wedlock, 97 percent said their parents would “freak out.” In a recent survey by the Institute for Family Studies, college-educated Californians ages 18 to 50 were less likely than those who hadn’t graduated from college to say that having a baby out of wedlock is wrong. But they were more likely to say that personally they did not approve of having a baby out of wedlock.

In other words, while social conservatives have a philosophy of family life they can’t operationalize, because it no longer is relevant, progressives have no philosophy of family life at all, because they don’t want to seem judgmental. The sexual revolution has come and gone, and it’s left us with no governing norms of family life, no guiding values, no articulated ideals. On this most central issue, our shared culture often has nothing relevant to say—and so for decades things have been falling apart. Read: Why is it hard for liberals to talk about ‘family values’? The good news is that human beings adapt, even if politics are slow to do so. When one family form stops working, people cast about for something new—sometimes finding it in something very old. Part II Redefining Kinship In the beginning was the band. For tens of thousands of years, people commonly lived in small bands of, say, 25 people, which linked up with perhaps 20 other bands to form a tribe. People in the band went out foraging for food and brought it back to share. They hunted together, fought wars together, made clothing for one another, looked after one another’s kids. In every realm of life, they relied on their extended family and wider kin. Except they didn’t define kin the way we do today. We think of kin as those biologically related to us. But throughout most of human history, kinship was something you could create.

Anthropologists have been arguing for decades about what exactly kinship is. Studying traditional societies, they have found wide varieties of created kinship among different cultures. For the Ilongot people of the Philippines, people who migrated somewhere together are kin. For the New Guineans of the Nebilyer Valley, kinship is created by sharing grease—the life force found in mother’s milk or sweet potatoes. The Chuukese people in Micronesia have a saying: “My sibling from the same canoe”; if two people survive a dangerous trial at sea, then they become kin. On the Alaskan North Slope, the Inupiat name their children after dead people, and those children are considered members of their namesake’s family. In other words, for vast stretches of human history people lived in extended families consisting of not just people they were related to but people they chose to cooperate with. An international research team recently did a genetic analysis of people who were buried together—and therefore presumably lived together—34,000 years ago in what is now Russia. They found that the people who were buried together were not closely related to one another. In a study of 32 present-day foraging societies, primary kin—parents, siblings, and children—usually made up less than 10 percent of a residential band. Extended families in traditional societies may or may not have been genetically close, but they were probably emotionally closer than most of us can imagine. In a beautiful essay on kinship, Marshall Sahlins, an anthropologist at the University of Chicago, says that kin in many such societies share a “mutuality of being.” The late religion scholar J. Prytz-Johansen wrote that kinship is experienced as an “inner solidarity” of souls. The late South African anthropologist Monica Wilson described kinsmen as “mystically dependent” on one another. Kinsmen belong to one another, Sahlins writes, because they see themselves as “members of one another.”

Back in the 17th and 18th centuries, when European Protestants came to North America, their relatively individualistic culture existed alongside Native Americans’ very communal culture. In his book Tribe, Sebastian Junger describes what happened next: While European settlers kept defecting to go live with Native American families, almost no Native Americans ever defected to go live with European families. Europeans occasionally captured Native Americans and forced them to come live with them. They taught them English and educated them in Western ways. But almost every time they were able, the indigenous Americans fled. European settlers were sometimes captured by Native Americans during wars and brought to live in Native communities. They rarely tried to run away. This bothered the Europeans. They had the superior civilization, so why were people voting with their feet to go live in another way? When you read such accounts, you can’t help but wonder whether our civilization has somehow made a gigantic mistake. We can’t go back, of course. Western individualists are no longer the kind of people who live in prehistoric bands. We may even no longer be the kind of people who were featured in the early scenes of Avalon. We value privacy and individual freedom too much. Our culture is oddly stuck. We want stability and rootedness, but also mobility, dynamic capitalism, and the liberty to adopt the lifestyle we choose. We want close families, but not the legal, cultural, and sociological constraints that made them possible. We’ve seen the wreckage left behind by the collapse of the detached nuclear family. We’ve seen the rise of opioid addiction, of suicide, of depression, of inequality—all products, in part, of a family structure that is too fragile, and a society that is too detached, disconnected, and distrustful. And yet we can’t quite return to a more collective world. The words the historians Steven Mintz and Susan Kellogg wrote in 1988 are even truer today: “Many Americans are groping for a new paradigm of American family life, but in the meantime a profound sense of confusion and ambivalence reigns.”

From Nuclear Families to Forged Families Yet recent signs suggest at least the possibility that a new family paradigm is emerging. Many of the statistics I’ve cited are dire. But they describe the past—what got us to where we are now. In reaction to family chaos, accumulating evidence suggests, the prioritization of family is beginning to make a comeback. Americans are experimenting with new forms of kinship and extended family in search of stability. Usually behavior changes before we realize that a new cultural paradigm has emerged. Imagine hundreds of millions of tiny arrows. In times of social transformation, they shift direction—a few at first, and then a lot. Nobody notices for a while, but then eventually people begin to recognize that a new pattern, and a new set of values, has emerged. That may be happening now—in part out of necessity but in part by choice. Since the 1970s, and especially since the 2008 recession, economic pressures have pushed Americans toward greater reliance on family. Starting around 2012, the share of children living with married parents began to inch up. And college students have more contact with their parents than they did a generation ago. We tend to deride this as helicopter parenting or a failure to launch, and it has its excesses. But the educational process is longer and more expensive these days, so it makes sense that young adults rely on their parents for longer than they used to. In 1980, only 12 percent of Americans lived in multigenerational households. But the financial crisis of 2008 prompted a sharp rise in multigenerational homes. Today 20 percent of Americans—64 million people, an all-time high—live in multigenerational homes. The revival of the extended family has largely been driven by young adults moving back home. In 2014, 35 percent of American men ages 18 to 34 lived with their parents. In time this shift might show itself to be mostly healthy, impelled not just by economic necessity but by beneficent social impulses; polling data suggest that many young people are already looking ahead to helping their parents in old age. Another chunk of the revival is attributable to seniors moving in with their children. The percentage of seniors who live alone peaked around 1990. Now more than a fifth of Americans 65 and over live in multigenerational homes. This doesn’t count the large share of seniors who are moving to be close to their grandkids but not into the same household. Immigrants and people of color—many of whom face greater economic and social stress—are more likely to live in extended-family households. More than 20 percent of Asians, black people, and Latinos live in multigenerational households, compared with 16 percent of white people. As America becomes more diverse, extended families are becoming more common. African Americans have always relied on extended family more than white Americans do. “Despite the forces working to separate us—slavery, Jim Crow, forced migration, the prison system, gentrification—we have maintained an incredible commitment to each other,” Mia Birdsong, the author of the forthcoming book How We Show Up, told me recently. “The reality is, black families are expansive, fluid, and brilliantly rely on the support, knowledge, and capacity of ‘the village’ to take care of each other. Here’s an illustration: The white researcher/social worker/whatever sees a child moving between their mother’s house, their grandparents’ house, and their uncle’s house and sees that as ‘instability.’ But what’s actually happening is the family (extended and chosen) is leveraging all of its resources to raise that child.” Read: Why black families struggle to build wealth The black extended family survived even under slavery, and all the forced family separations that involved. Family was essential in the Jim Crow South and in the inner cities of the North, as a way to cope with the stresses of mass migration and limited opportunities, and with structural racism. But government policy sometimes made it more difficult for this family form to thrive. I began my career as a police reporter in Chicago, writing about public-housing projects like Cabrini-Green. Guided by social-science research, politicians tore down neighborhoods of rickety low-rise buildings—uprooting the complex webs of social connection those buildings supported, despite high rates of violence and crime—and put up big apartment buildings. The result was a horror: violent crime, gangs taking over the elevators, the erosion of family and neighborly life. Fortunately, those buildings have since been torn down themselves, replaced by mixed-income communities that are more amenable to the profusion of family forms. I often ask African friends who have immigrated to America what most struck them when they arrived. Their answer is always a variation on a theme—the loneliness. The return of multigenerational living arrangements is already changing the built landscape. A 2016 survey by a real-estate consulting firm found that 44 percent of home buyers were looking for a home that would accommodate their elderly parents, and 42 percent wanted one that would accommodate their returning adult children. Home builders have responded by putting up houses that are what the construction firm Lennar calls “two homes under one roof.” These houses are carefully built so that family members can spend time together while also preserving their privacy. Many of these homes have a shared mudroom, laundry room, and common area. But the “in-law suite,” the place for aging parents, has its own entrance, kitchenette, and dining area. The “Millennial suite,” the place for boomeranging adult children, has its own driveway and entrance too. These developments, of course, cater to those who can afford houses in the first place—but they speak to a common realization: Family members of different generations need to do more to support one another. The most interesting extended families are those that stretch across kinship lines. The past several years have seen the rise of new living arrangements that bring nonbiological kin into family or familylike relationships. On the website CoAbode, single mothers can find other single mothers interested in sharing a home. All across the country, you can find co-housing projects, in which groups of adults live as members of an extended family, with separate sleeping quarters and shared communal areas. Common, a real-estate-development company that launched in 2015, operates more than 25 co-housing communities, in six cities, where young singles can live this way. Common also recently teamed up with another developer, Tishman Speyer, to launch Kin, a co-housing community for young parents. Each young family has its own living quarters, but the facilities also have shared play spaces, child-care services, and family-oriented events and outings. Read: The hot new Millennial housing trend is a repeat of the Middle Ages These experiments, and others like them, suggest that while people still want flexibility and some privacy, they are casting about for more communal ways of living, guided by a still-developing set of values. At a co-housing community in Oakland, California, called Temescal Commons, the 23 members, ranging in age from 1 to 83, live in a complex with nine housing units. This is not some rich Bay Area hipster commune. The apartments are small, and the residents are middle- and working-class. They have a shared courtyard and a shared industrial-size kitchen where residents prepare a communal dinner on Thursday and Sunday nights. Upkeep is a shared responsibility. The adults babysit one another’s children, and members borrow sugar and milk from one another. The older parents counsel the younger ones. When members of this extended family have suffered bouts of unemployment or major health crises, the whole clan has rallied together. Courtney E. Martin, a writer who focuses on how people are redefining the American dream, is a Temescal Commons resident. “I really love that our kids grow up with different versions of adulthood all around, especially different versions of masculinity,” she told me. “We consider all of our kids all of our kids.” Martin has a 3-year-old daughter, Stella, who has a special bond with a young man in his 20s that never would have taken root outside this extended-family structure. “Stella makes him laugh, and David feels awesome that this 3-year-old adores him,” Martin said. This is the kind of magic, she concluded, that wealth can’t buy. You can only have it through time and commitment, by joining an extended family. This kind of community would fall apart if residents moved in and out. But at least in this case, they don’t. Read: The extended family of my two open adoptions As Martin was talking, I was struck by one crucial difference between the old extended families like those in Avalon and the new ones of today: the role of women. The extended family in Avalon thrived because all the women in the family were locked in the kitchen, feeding 25 people at a time. In 2008, a team of American and Japanese researchers found that women in multigenerational households in Japan were at greater risk of heart disease than women living with spouses only, likely because of stress. But today’s extended-family living arrangements have much more diverse gender roles. And yet in at least one respect, the new families Americans are forming would look familiar to our hunter-gatherer ancestors from eons ago. That’s because they are chosen families—they transcend traditional kinship lines.

`` They 're accepting of that , so they 're all for me trying to save money so when I become independent , I become self-sufficient and ready to go , '' she says . `` I 'm not drowning in debt , depression and need more money . ''
But Arnett says young millennials are less likely to feel adult if they are still financially dependent on their parents .
`` I graduated college , so I should now be self-sufficient , '' says Lauren Ruvo , a Harvard University graduate student . `` I feel self-sufficient , I make daily decisions for myself , but yet the financial piece I still do n't have . ''

The majority of today 's parents are so willing to support their grown kids because they invented the idea of striving for a career you really want , Arnett says .

This story is part of the New Boom series on millennials in America.

So your child moved back in with you after graduation, and it seems like she will never leave. Or worse, you're sending rent checks each month while she searches for jobs in the big city.

You often find yourself wondering if she will ever grow up. You're concerned that your child is suffering from delayed adolescence.

But research suggests there's no need to panic. Parental support during emerging adulthood does not necessarily inhibit young adults from becoming independent, experts say. This close relationship is actually beneficial to both kids and parents.

""I think it's a great thing overall that there's this wonderful closeness between parents and emerging adults today, and I really think it's unprecedented in human history,"" says Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, a research professor at Clark University in Massachusetts and director of the Clark Poll of Emerging Adults.

Arnett coined the term ""emerging adulthood"" — the life stage where young adults take time to find themselves in their 20s. He says this stage has brought a new closeness to the parent-child relationship.

The idea of the big American family doesn't exist so much anymore. Rather than having to divide time between multiple kids, parents today can plan their families more and focus on each kid, Arnett says.

""We've had this big change in our beliefs as a society about what's appropriate between parents and children,"" he says. ""Parents no longer feel like they should be some stern authority figure.""

Post-Grads Aren't Just Heading Home For Mom's Cooking

Parental support ranges from having the child living at home to paying for living expenses to just talking to the child daily.

Experts say pursuing more education, delaying marriage and the sluggish economy are the main reasons why millennials live with their parents. As more young adults stay single longer — some 25 percent of them will never marry — a bond with a parent can become the most important relationship in their lives, says Karen Fingerman, a research professor at the University of Texas, Austin.

Keep The Rent Checks Coming, Mom and Dad



Even if they don't live at home, a majority of today's emerging adults — about 74 percent — receive financial support from their parents, according to the 2013 Clark Poll.

""Virtually all 25-year-olds could support themselves if they really had to, but then they wouldn't be able to live a very nice life in their 20s,"" Clark University's Arnett says.

The majority of today's parents are so willing to support their grown kids because they invented the idea of striving for a career you really want, Arnett says.

""I think a lot of parents that can afford it will say, 'Well, I would really rather have this money for our own fun, but he needs it and they're trying hard, so we'll write the check,' "" he says.

It's Not Just About The Money



Millennials who are financially independent still rely on their parents for emotional support.

Kim Parker, a researcher at Pew, says more young people look to their parents for advice because the generation gap is closing. In the 1960s, the young and the old were often at odds, she says.

In 1986, about half of parents reported that they spoke to their grown children once a week. Today, 67 percent of mothers and 51 percent of fathers say they have contact with their young adult child almost every day, according to the 2013 Clark Poll.

To me, millennials are so invested in what their parents want and how their parents feel about their life.

""Typically we talk every day, and we just talk about whatever's going on,"" Ruvo says. ""I would value my parents' opinions more than probably the average 22-year-old, so when there are things that are going on, I call them for emotional support because I know that they won't sugarcoat anything.""

Fingerman says the idea of young adults turning to their parents for advice wasn't always so common.

When I was young, ""we were turning to other 19-year-olds and asking their advice, and now they're asking a 40-year-old with life experience,"" she says. ""It's a smart thing to do.""

But not all young adults have this kind of relationship with their parents. Leo Caldwell, 32, hasn't had a close relationship with his parents since he came out as a lesbian in college. He now identifies as transgender.

""To me, millennials are so invested in what their parents want and how their parents feel about their life,"" Caldwell says. ""I've experienced people feeling very shocked about me not telling my parents things.

The stigma around helicopter parenting leads both parents and young adult children to feel like this level of support is too much. According to the 2013 Clark Parents Poll, 61 percent of parents said their parents gave them little or no support when they were in their 20s. Only 26 percent of today's young adult children say that is true for them.

When Erica Deshpande, 22, was choosing which graduate school to attend, her parents told her they would pay and that money was no object. Columbia University gave her more money, but she chose Harvard because she went to Boston College for undergrad and liked the city.

""There was a lot of guilt associated with having my parents pay for me to just like my school better,"" she says. ""My dad especially is the one who sat down with me and really tried to make me feel that what they want is for me to be where I'm happy.

Parents and kids feel uncomfortable because cultural norms haven't caught up yet, Arnett says.

""Even though we have this new norm, we don't feel entirely comfortable because we still have this old value that they should kind of be doing this themselves,"" he says.

While both parents and their grown children agree this type of support is positive now, it's hard to tell if it will prevent them from becoming sufficiently independent in the long run.

As emerging adults grow older, they are less likely to receive financial support from their parents because they want to make their own financial decisions, Arnett says. The 2012 Clark Poll of Emerging Adults reported that only 6 percent of 26- to 29-year-olds said they received regular financial support.

""It's really underestimated in all these negative stereotypes about them how much they want to move ahead with their lives,"" Arnett says, ""and how much they prefer to be financially independent.""

What’s happening

Anyone closely following news about the state of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. could be forgiven for feeling a sense of whiplash. The two major storylines dominating coverage seem to directly contradict each other.

One narrative shows America behaving like a country that has contained the virus. Every state has lifted at least some of its lockdown restrictions. More businesses are reopening. The president is scaling down the activities of his coronavirus task force while planning to resume campaign rallies. Protesters have gathered en masse in cities across the country.

That series of events can be hard to reconcile with a troubling trend in many states that suggests the outbreak is far from contained and may actually be getting worse. Dozens of states have seen increases in case numbers over the past two weeks. Texas, Florida and Arizona — states that largely avoided major outbreaks in the early stages of the pandemic — set records for daily case numbers on Tuesday. Some places that were hit the worst in March and April, like New York, are seeing numbers continue to trend downward.

The U.S. has by far the most severe outbreak in the world, with more than 2 million cases and 117,000 deaths. Both those figures are at least double what any other nation has seen. The current trend, in which restrictions are being lifted despite rising case numbers, has raised concerns that the country is essentially abandoning its effort to stamp out the virus and instead deciding that reopening the economy and returning to normal life is the priority.

Why there’s debate

Though the U.S. is not the only country struggling with the virus right now, many nations have managed their outbreaks effectively and are beginning to safely reopen. The road map to successful containment is largely the same in each place: lockdowns to restrict the initial phase of infections, followed by robust programs of testing and contract tracing, and widespread mask usage.

The U.S. did initiate lockdowns, and they appear to have been effective. One study suggests the restrictions prevented up to 60 million coronavirus infections. But the latter steps of testing and contact tracing — which epidemiologists agree are crucial to keeping the virus in check when lockdowns are lifted — are not being carried out at nearly the scale they need to be in the U.S., experts say. Heated partisan debates have also led to mask requirements being lifted in many places.

There was significant attention on the first states to begin reopening in late April and early May, but the pandemic has largely taken a back seat to the ongoing protests against police violence and racism across the country. At the same time, political leaders have also pulled back from their focus on the virus. The Trump administration has largely shifted its efforts to other issues. Congress appears reticent to produce another massive stimulus bill to support the unemployed or bail out struggling states. Public support of social distancing has waned, raising questions about whether there is enough political will to reinstitute lockdowns even if they become necessary.

What’s next

The next several weeks will provide more clarity about the wisdom of American decision making about the virus. If case numbers continue to rise, it will put pressure on officials to reverse their moves to reopen and on legislators to offer financial relief.

On the other hand, if no major spike occurs, particularly one connected to the protests, it could provide evidence that warm temperatures and masks can help keep infections at manageable levels. These revelations could have a significant impact on reopening plans in the months leading up to a second wave of the virus that experts anticipate will come in the fall.

The new executive order offers renewed hope to children who want nothing more than a family to call their own.

NRPLUS MEMBER ARTICLE L ast year, I met with a group of students who had endured the foster-care system. Anthony was moved from foster home to foster home for 18 years — his entire childhood. Another, David, had entered foster care at eight years old. He was placed in seven different inpatient facilities within six months. Both expressed their hope that no child would ever have to experience what they had.

This week, President Trump signed an executive order to help kids like Anthony and David. The order, which will decrease the time that children spend in foster care and help them find loving families, is desperately needed to give some of America’s most vulnerable kids a better shot at a better life.

The foster-care system is full of despair. Of the more than 437,300 children currently in care, over 125,000 are waiting for their forever family. More than 50 percent have been in foster care for two years — or more. The kids left behind are usually those who need love the most: children over the age of nine, siblings who want to stay together, and kids with disabilities.

Worse, every year, around 20,000 young people age out of foster care without any legal connection to a family. The results for these young adults are terrifying: Researchers who have conducted longitudinal studies find that four in ten will experience homelessness; more than 25 percent will end up incarcerated; and 71 percent of the young women will be pregnant by age 21.

So how does this order help these kids find their forever families?

First, it elevates the role of faith-based groups and “bridge organizations” — non-profits that create long-term relationship between local churches and caseworkers. Local child-welfare agencies tend to be overwhelmed, and three in ten of the nation’s caseworkers cycle out every year. These outside groups can provide additional support and expertise to help adoption programs function properly.

The order directs that basic, local data be available to these organizations. For instance, they might know that there are 125,000 kids nationally, but they need to know how many kids in their county are waiting for adoption. How many families do they need to recruit? How long does it take the average family to be certified as a foster family? How long do they stay certified?

An American ex-pat friend called the other day to lament the turn of events in the United States. The division, racism and riots she saw play out on her Switzerland television left her feeling that America is becoming ever polarized and not the same home she left 10 years ago.

That’s a feeling a lot of Americans are experiencing now, and it’s certainly understandable given the frightening and tragic scenes across the country aired on replay.

We are facing compounding crises in America, and in important ways these mortal threats are strengthening us as a people, by forcing us to unite and rally around our core values. Coronavirus awakened Americans from a stupor. Our confidence that freedom, democracy and prosperity were somehow destined or ordained, that no threat could penetrate the shell of exceptionalism we imagined around ourselves, was rightly shattered with force exponentially greater than the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

We had been complacent, when a virus our president ignored turned into a pandemic he couldn’t stop. We learned, at far too high a price, that we have work to do, and that an America that rallies around the flag must first rally around its principles. And so the majority of Americans came together, making sacrifices to protect everyone.

That sense of national unity and purpose was the backdrop onto which the latest horrific and unjust killings of black Americans by police were cast. What we have learned in the ensuing weeks is that when we become sensitized to the distress of our neighbors, as we have with coronavirus, we become sensitive to other inequities as well. That keen awareness of our humanity is an opportunity for real change.

The stark images of police and protesters standing in opposition do not reflect the overwhelming agreement among the American people regarding police violence, and specifically the death of George Floyd. Almost 90% of Americans believe that the Minneapolis police officers charged in Floyd's death should face severe penalties. Likewise, Republicans, independents and Democrats broadly agree there’s a police racism problem in the United States and support protests.

Other civil rights issues similarly enjoy cross-partisan support. The majority of Americans want to give voters more choices and make casting a ballot more accessible. This year especially, amid a pandemic, Americans are eager for solutions that give voters options beyond showing up in person, waiting in a long line and standing in a crowd.

Ensure citizens' right to vote

While social change has been wrought through public demonstrations in our history, the most direct way Americans can have their voice heard is at the ballot box. That is why securing our voting rights against an ongoing public health threat has taken on new urgency. Americans want not only to be able to vote safely themselves, but also to ensure that everyone’s right is similarly protected.

That consideration for the rights of all Americans has extended beyond this pandemic and translated into renewed energy to increase voter participation and even end partisan gerrymandering.

This civic rebirth has been going on for several years, but the uniquely dangerous times we now face are galvanizing the country to better abide by our values. And it makes 2020 a ripe opportunity for real change and renewed civic service by a wide swathe of the citizenry.

The evidence of this American renewal is being broadcast into our homes nightly. People of every age, background, race, religion and even political party have turned out to march for a cause they believe in and which they want addressed now. Peaceful protests aren’t just a sign that people are outraged; they are a sign that citizens are engaged and ready to work toward improving their country.

Obstacles to change are daunting

We should not kid ourselves. The challenges that lie before us are daunting. Equal justice, policing reform and fixing our criminal justice system are enormous and seemingly intractable issues that won’t be solved overnight. Similarly, ending gerrymandering, securing elections from interference and reforming our electoral system require combating a rigid system designed by entrenched interests.

Yet, change is possible if we’re united in the common purpose of building America anew for future generations. We cannot let the narrative of division dominate our discourse in this moment. Instead, we have to recognize and focus on the points of agreement — the principles, values and ambitions that unite us as a people. After all, those shared ideals and aspirations are what bind us together, especially at our most desperate moments.

One could be forgiven for taking the cynical view that 2020 has been the worst year in our lifetimes in terms of chaos, fear and destruction. The silver-linings view is that increased awareness resulting from a brighter spotlight on our systemic challenges may embolden more bridge builders, problem solvers and reformers.

And 2020 may be the year that we finally push the boulder of needed reforms over the mountain thanks to a new generation of Americans saying enough.

If “ alien , ” a Latinate word deriving from the idea of “ other ” or “ different , ” sounds too outer space-like , why not substitute “ immigrant ” ?

Often , “ undocumented ” was dropped , leaving just “ immigrants ” — conflating applicants who waited years for legal entry with those who swarmed the border illegally .
Increasingly we now hear just “ migrants ” — a vague term that further divorces illegal immigration from reality by conflating the acts of leaving and entering the country .
Democrats used to self-identify as “ liberals. ” The Latin etymology means “ free , ” as in the context of “ free ” thinkers not burdened by oppressive traditions , ideological straitjackets , and unworkable norms .
But the problem with “ liberal ” is that even conservatives occasionally used the term , as in “ classical liberals ” who judged issues by facts and reason rather than rigid orthodoxy .
Moreover , “ liberal ” included little notion of evolution and advancement . So gradually , “ progressive ” has eclipsed the stuffy “ liberal . ”
“ Progressive ’ infers an activist , not a neutral , ideology — one that is always moving the country in the supposedly correct direction .
After all , who favors “ regression ” in any field over “ progression , ” an inherently positive noun implying beneficial advancement ?
A liberal Democrat was once someone seen as a free thinker . But “ progressive ” implies that one is more action-orientated and has an evolutionary agenda , not just a methodology .

Beware of euphemisms.

The reinvention of vocabulary can often be more effective than any social protest movement. Malarial swamps can become healthy “wetlands.” Fetid “dumps” are often rebranded as green “landfills.”

Global warming was once a worry about too much heat. It implied that man-made carbon emissions had so warmed the planet that life as we knew it would soon be imperiled without radical changes in consumer lifestyles.

Affirmative action originated as a means of making up for past prejudices against the African-American community, which comprised about 12 percent of the population.

By the late 1960s, slavery, Jim Crow and institutionalized segregation were finally considered unique stains on the American past, to be redeemed in the present by set-aside programs in college admissions and hiring predicated on racial considerations.

The problem with affirmative action is that the very name implied redress for historical wrongs that could be “affirmed” by compensatory action for a particular minority of the population. But lots of other groups wished to be included in an ever-expanding catalog of the oppressed.

If “alien,” a Latinate word deriving from the idea of “other” or “different,” sounds too outer space-like, why not substitute “immigrant”? Yet “illegal immigrant” still sounded as if breaking federal immigration laws was somehow a serious legal matter. So the vague “undocumented immigrant” superseded the old term.

As the numbers of those crossing the southern border grew and the power of those invested in expanded immigration — employers, identity-politics activists, Democratic operatives, the Mexican government — peaked, even more euphemisms emerged to downplay illegality.

Often, “undocumented” was dropped, leaving just “immigrants” — conflating applicants who waited years for legal entry with those who swarmed the border illegally.

Increasingly we now hear just “migrants” — a vague term that further divorces illegal immigration from reality by conflating the acts of leaving and entering the country.

Democrats used to self-identify as “liberals.” The Latin etymology means “free,” as in the context of “free” thinkers not burdened by oppressive traditions, ideological straitjackets, and unworkable norms.

But the problem with “liberal” is that even conservatives occasionally used the term, as in “classical liberals” who judged issues by facts and reason rather than rigid orthodoxy.

Moreover, “liberal” included little notion of evolution and advancement. So gradually, “progressive” has eclipsed the stuffy “liberal.”

“Progressive’ infers an activist, not a neutral, ideology — one that is always moving the country in the supposedly correct direction.

After all, who favors “regression” in any field over “progression,” an inherently positive noun implying beneficial advancement?

A liberal Democrat was once someone seen as a free thinker. But “progressive” implies that one is more action-orientated and has an evolutionary agenda, not just a methodology.

Beware of euphemisms. Radical changes in vocabulary are usually admissions that reality is unwelcome or indefensible.

NEW YORK — The co-founder of one the nation’s oldest venture capital firms fears a possible genocide against the wealthy.

Economists, advisers to the wealthy and the wealthy themselves describe a deep-seated anxiety that the national — and even global — mood is turning against the super-rich in ways that ultimately could prove dangerous and hard to control.

President Barack Obama and the Democrats have pivoted to income inequality ahead of the midterm elections. Pope Francis has strongly warned against the dangers of wealth concentration. And all of this follows the rise of the Occupy movement in 2011 and a bout of bank-bashing populism in the tea party.

The collective result, according to one member of the 1 percent, is a fear that the rich are in deep, deep trouble. Maybe not today but soon.

“You have a bunch of people who see conspiracies everywhere and believe that this inequality issue will quickly turn into serious class warfare,” said this person, who asked not to be identified by name so as not to anger any wealthy friends. “They don’t believe inequality is bad and believe the only way to deal with it is to allow entrepreneurs to have even fewer shackles.”

And so the rich are lashing out.

In the latest example, Thomas Perkins, co-founder of legendary Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, wrote a letter to The Wall Street Journal over the weekend comparing Nazi Germany’s persecution and mass murder of Jews to “the progressive war on the American one percent, namely the ‘rich.’”

He went on to say he feared a progressive “Kristallnacht,” referring to the 1938 German pogrom in which nearly 100 Jews were killed and more than 30,000 arrested, a dark omen of the murder of 6 million that would follow.

People, to put it mildly, went nuts.

Even Perkins’s old firm disavowed him and his comments and said he no longer has anything to do with the company. Perkins then went on Bloomberg television, ostensibly to apologize for the remark. But instead he doubled down on the analogy, saying “when you start to use hatred against a minority, it can get out of control.”

Perkins was not the first wealthy investor to invoke Nazi Germany as a warning over current attitudes toward the wealthy. In 2010, when Obama suggested raising the tax on “carried interest” earned by private equity executives, Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman said, “It’s a war. It’s like when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939.”

Obama still hasn’t managed to persuade Congress to hike the 20 percent rate on carried interest even though most on Wall Street expect to lose the perk at some point. Schwarzman eventually apologized for his Hitler remark.

“He is trying to get us back. He is very divisive and political,” Upper East Side resident Molly Jong Fast told the Post. “By not plowing the Upper East Side, he is saying, ‘I’m not one of them.’”

The mayor dutifully trundled up to the neighborhood to admit mistakes in plowing but strongly denied any ulterior motive.

It doesn’t end there.

Graham, Marina Koren, Ed Yong, Helen Lewis, George Packer, Yascha Mounk","Just before the 2016 election , and then again after its results became clear , I did a series of Atlantic items on a challenge I thought the press was not prepared for .
The challenge was dealing with a major political figure—Donald Trump—who fit no previous pattern of how presidents or other major figures conceived of “ truth ” versus “ lies . ”
All politicians , like all people , will lie about matters large and small . But most politicians , like most people , usually lie for a reason . They want to avoid blame or embarrassment . They want someone to like or treat them better . They want to paint themselves in a better light . They ’ ve talked themselves into “ believing ” a more comfortable version of perhaps-painful truths .
We all know examples from daily life . In the life of public figures , it means things like : Richard Nixon lying about Watergate ( in hopes of not getting caught ) . Bill Clinton lying about his affairs ( ditto ) . Lyndon Johnson concealing what he knew about the worsening situation in Vietnam ( so as not to complicate his re-election chances ) . FDR concealing his physical limitations ( so as not to have them complicate his political and policy goals ) .
So in dealing with the political universe as of the summer of 2015—the time when Donald Trump entered the presidential race—the press could start by asking : What ’ s the reason a certain statement might be a lie ? What would a president — a mayor , a senator— have to gain by shading the truth ? The related assumption was that people wouldn ’ t go to the trouble of crafting a lie without a reason to do so . Lies are harder to remember than the truth ; they involve more work in getting people to back up your story ; they involve the risk that you ’ ll be caught .
What made Donald Trump different was not how much more frequently he lies — though he does so at a prodigious rate . ( As Daniel Dale and the Washington Post ’ s fact-check team , among others , have tirelessly chronicled . )
Rather the difference was that Trump so plainly recognized no distinction between true and false—between what the “ facts ” showed and what he wanted them to be , between what he wanted people to think and what they could see for themselves . Some public figures are unusually “ willing ” to lie ; Trump seemed not even to notice he was doing so . The philosopher Harry Frankfurt ’ s famous book “ On Bullshit ” bears on this phenomenon—people who just talk , in a slurry of “ true ” and “ false , ” with no concern or even awareness of the difference between the two .
In Trump ’ s case it became clear long ago that he lacked the mental filter that alerts most people to the boundary between true and false . He would probably sail through any lie-detector test . He does not care if his claim can be instantly disproved ( eg , his “ landslide ” victory , actually one of the narrowest in history ) . He does not care if his lies contradict one another , as when he attributes the same “ someone told me ” story to different sources from one day to the next , or rolls out his ludicrous “ Sir ” anecdotes . He does not care if a lie does him any good—who believes , or cares , whether his uncle was “ a great super genius ” as a professor at MIT ? He does not care that the Adonis-like heroic portrait that has hung for years at Mar-a-Lago would be a source of mirth for most viewers .
“ The news media are not built for someone like this , ” I wrote two months before Trump was sworn in :
[ We have ] as president-elect a man whose nature as a liar is outside what our institutions are designed to deal with . Donald Trump either can not tell the difference between truth and lies , or he knows the difference but does not care… . Our journalistic and political assumption is that each side to a debate will “ try ” to tell the truth—and will count it as a setback if they ’ re caught making things up . Until now the idea has been that if you can show a contrast between words and actions , claim and reality , it may not bring the politician down , but it will hurt . For instance : Bill Clinton survived “ I did not have sexual relations with that woman , ” but he was damaged then , and lastingly , when the truth came out . Knowledge of the risks of being caught has encouraged most politicians to minimize provable lies . None of this works with Donald Trump . He doesn ’ t care , and at least so far the institutional GOP hasn ’ t either .
In that item , “ A Reflexive Liar in Command , ” and then a follow-up , “ Dealing with Trump ’ s Lies , ” I set out press guidelines for the time ahead . The first one was :
1 ) Call out lies as lies , not “ controversies. ” In covering Trump ’ s latest illegal-voting outburst [ that “ millions of people ” had snuck into the polling places and voted , presumably for Democrats ] , The Washington Post and The LA Times took the lead in clearly labeling the claim as false , rather than “ controversial ” or “ unsubstantiated. ” ... By contrast .. the NYT takes a more “ objective ” tone—there ’ s “ no evidence ” for Trump ’ s claim , much as there was “ no evidence ” for his assertion that Ted Cruz ’ s dad played a part in the JFK assassination . What ’ s the difference ? The NYT said that the claim had “ no evidence. ” The Post said it was false . The Times ’ s is more conventional—but it is also “ normalizing ” in suggesting that Trump actually cared whether there was evidence for what he said . I think the Post ’ s is closer to calling things what they are .
It ’ s nearly three-and-a-half years later . Everything we saw about Trump on the campaign trail we have seen from him in the White House , including the limitless fantasy-lying .
I submit that these three-and-a-half years later , much of the press has still not rebuilt itself , to cope with a time or a person like this . Or with a political party like the subservient Trump-era GOP .
To choose only a small subset of examples , from only the past three days ’ worth of history , here are some illustrations . These are words and deeds that , each on its own , would likely have been major black-mark news events in other eras . Now they are just part of the daily onrush .
1 ) Us , and them . Two days ago , on March 27 , Donald Trump signed in the Oval Office the most expensive spending bill in American history . Getting it enacted required sustained , major efforts from Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic speaker of the House , and from Chuck Schumer , the Senate minority leader , who got every one of his fellow Democrats to vote for the bill .
After Lyndon Johnson relied on Republican support to get his civil-rights and Medicare legislation through the Congress , he made sure that the Republican leaders from the House and Senate were with him for the signing ceremonies , to receive some of the first pens he used . ( When Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in the Oval Office , he had only Democratic legislators around him—but that was because of near-unanimous Republican opposition to the bill . )
Structurally Trump ’ s situation this week was like LBJ ’ s : he was signing a bill the other party had played a crucial role in passing . But when Trump signed the bill yesterday , not a single Democratic legislator was present . Pelosi said she had not been invited .
Every other president has tried , at some point , to expand his support beyond those who originally voted for him ( which is why all others have at some point had popularity ratings of 60 percent or 70 percent ) . Every other one has at some point tried to express the interests of the entire public , not just “ the base. ” Trump has never done either—and that failure is so baked-in that it barely registers now .
Obama used precious months in his first year trying to get GOP support for his medical plan ; he failed ; and a running press critique thereafter was that he should have been doing more to “ reach out ” to the other side . ( Recall the whole “ Have a drink with Mitch McConnell ” motif . ) I haven ’ t seen any columns fretting about Trump ’ s failure to “ reach out ” to Pelosi or Schumer . “ That ’ s just Trump . ”
2 ) “ If they don ’ t treat you right , I don ’ t call. ” In this past Friday ’ s version of his marathon TV sessions—the supposed “ health ” briefings that have become daily hour-long substitutes for Trump ’ s campaign rallies—Trump said that most of the governors now requesting federal aid were friendly to him . But not all , and the ones who weren ’ t “ appreciative ” had better watch their step .
Trump was asked what he meant about being “ appreciative. ” His answer ( as you can see starting at time 24:00 of this C-SPAN video ) :
“ Q . You say the governors are not appreciate of what the federal government has done . What more— “ A : [ breaking in } : I think the governor of Washington [ Jay Inslee ] is a failed presidential candidate . He leveled out at zero in the polls . He ’ s constantly tripping and—I guess ‘ complaining ’ would be a nice way of saying it… In Michigan , all she does is—she has no idea what ’ s going on . All she does is saying [ whining voice ] ‘ Oh , it ’ s the federal government ’ s fault… ’ “ I want them to be appreciative . We ’ ve done a great job… “ Mike Pence , I don ’ t think he sleeps any more . He calls all the governors . I tell him—I ’ m a different kind of guy—I tell him , Don ’ t call the governor of Washington . You ’ re wasting your time with him . “ Don ’ t call the woman in Michigan… . “ You know what I say , If they don ’ t treat you right , I don ’ t call . ”
What would have made news about this passage in any other era ?
First , the naked favor-trading : What Trump is saying about the states of Washington and Michigan is more or less what led the House to impeach him last year , regarding Ukraine . That is : threatened use of federal power and favors , to reward political friends and punish political enemies—and in this case for unconcealed , openly stated political reasons .
Second , the crassness and cruelty , to leaders coping with life-and-death emergencies in their home states . “ A failed presidential candidate. ” “ She has no idea what ’ s doing on . ”
Third , the misogyny : Repeatedly avoiding the name of Gretchen Whitmer , elected last year as governor of Michigan , and calling her “ the woman in Michigan. ” Check the C-SPAN video if you ’ re in doubt about the dismissive tone of these remarks , and recall Trump ’ s frequent references to “ Crooked Hillary ” and “ Crazy Nancy Pelosi . ”
There was some brief press followup on all these points , but mainly it was again normalized as Trump being Trump .
3 ) Lies , lies , lies . I ’ ll leave to the other chroniclers a complete list of the several dozen lies in Trump ’ s live-broadcast appearances in the past few days . On Thursday , he went on at length about the bounty of tariff payments that the U.S. was receiving “ from China ” —which revealed either a black-is-white misunderstanding of how tariffs work , or a Harry Frankfurt-style indifference to the bullshit of what he was saying . ( None of the White House reporters challenged him about his tariff claim . )
Here is just one consequential lie to stand for the rest : Trump repeatedly claims , and has done so every day this past week , that no one possibly could have seen this pandemic coming , and that everything was great until just a few weeks ago .
Of the countless reasons to know this is false , consider this Politico story on the detailed , 69-page playbook the National Security Council had prepared for coping with just this kind of emergency . The exact timing , origin , and biology of this new disease of course came as surprises . But the consequences and choices are ones any competent government would have foreseen .
Just a month before the 9/11 attacks , in which more than 3,000 people were killed , George W. Bush received a memo famously titled , “ Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S. ” Many years later , press analyses still pointed this out . For years after the attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi , in which four Americans died , congressional Republicans held several dozen hearings , to determine whether the Obama administration should have been more prepared .
In the past few days ’ papers , I see no followup on this NSC report . Press standards for covering Trump have already factored in , and thus implicitly forgiven , the corruption and incompetence .
4 ) Repeating the mistakes of 2015 . Starting in the summer of 2015 , cable channels began running live Trump rallies , because they were so “ interesting. ” People watched . Ratings went up . And by Election Day , Trump had received billions of dollars ’ worth of free airtime . One calculation of the value was $ 5 billion ; another , $ 2 billion . In either case , a lot .
Without this coverage—this decision by TV outlets , to improve their ratings by giving limitless free , live airtime to Trump—he could never have become the Republican nominee , let alone the president .
Trump himself clearly views the “ briefings ” about the “ virus ” — really , rallies about his greatness—as this year ’ s substitute for the live rallies he can no longer hold . But the cable and broadcast outlets , as if 2015 and 2016 had never occurred , are covering his daily briefings as they did the rallies of days gone by . For more on why this is a mistake , please see this suggestion from Jay Rosen of PressThink , about how the media could shift to “ emergency setting ” , and this from the Washington Post ’ s Erik Wemple on the problem of nonstop live coverage of Trump telling lies .
The media were not built for someone like this . That someone has not changed . The media must change .","Just before the 2016 election, and then again after its results became clear, I did a series of Atlantic items on a challenge I thought the press was not prepared for.

The challenge was dealing with a major political figure—Donald Trump—who fit no previous pattern of how presidents or other major figures conceived of “truth” versus “lies.”

They want someone to like or treat them better. They want to paint themselves in a better light. They’ve talked themselves into “believing” a more comfortable version of perhaps-painful truths.

We all know examples from daily life. In the life of public figures, it means things like: Richard Nixon lying about Watergate (in hopes of not getting caught). Bill Clinton lying about his affairs (ditto). Lyndon Johnson concealing what he knew about the worsening situation in Vietnam (so as not to complicate his re-election chances). FDR concealing his physical limitations (so as not to have them complicate his political and policy goals).

So in dealing with the political universe as of the summer of 2015—the time when Donald Trump entered the presidential race—the press could start by asking: What’s the reason a certain statement might be a lie? What would a president — a mayor, a senator— have to gain by shading the truth? The related assumption was that people wouldn’t go to the trouble of crafting a lie without a reason to do so. Lies are harder to remember than the truth; they involve more work in getting people to back up your story; they involve the risk that you’ll be caught.

What made Donald Trump different was not how much more frequently he lies — though he does so at a prodigious rate. (As Daniel Dale and the Washington Post’s fact-check team, among others, have tirelessly chronicled.)

Rather the difference was that Trump so plainly recognized no distinction between true and false—between what the “facts” showed and what he wanted them to be, between what he wanted people to think and what they could see for themselves. Some public figures are unusually “willing” to lie; Trump seemed not even to notice he was doing so. The philosopher Harry Frankfurt’s famous book “On Bullshit” bears on this phenomenon—people who just talk, in a slurry of “true” and “false,” with no concern or even awareness of the difference between the two.

In Trump’s case it became clear long ago that he lacked the mental filter that alerts most people to the boundary between true and false. He would probably sail through any lie-detector test. He does not care if his claim can be instantly disproved (eg, his “landslide” victory, actually one of the narrowest in history). He does not care if his lies contradict one another, as when he attributes the same “someone told me” story to different sources from one day to the next, or rolls out his ludicrous “Sir” anecdotes. He does not care if a lie does him any good—who believes, or cares, whether his uncle was “a great super genius” as a professor at MIT? He does not care that the Adonis-like heroic portrait that has hung for years at Mar-a-Lago would be a source of mirth for most viewers.

“The news media are not built for someone like this,” I wrote two months before Trump was sworn in:

[We have] as president-elect a man whose nature as a liar is outside what our institutions are designed to deal with. Donald Trump either cannot tell the difference between truth and lies, or he knows the difference but does not care…. Our journalistic and political assumption is that each side to a debate will “try” to tell the truth—and will count it as a setback if they’re caught making things up. Until now the idea has been that if you can show a contrast between words and actions, claim and reality, it may not bring the politician down, but it will hurt. For instance: Bill Clinton survived “I did not have sexual relations with that woman,” but he was damaged then, and lastingly, when the truth came out. Knowledge of the risks of being caught has encouraged most politicians to minimize provable lies. None of this works with Donald Trump. He doesn’t care, and at least so far the institutional GOP hasn’t either.

In that item, “A Reflexive Liar in Command,” and then a follow-up, “Dealing with Trump’s Lies,” I set out press guidelines for the time ahead. The first one was:

1) Call out lies as lies, not “controversies.” In covering Trump’s latest illegal-voting outburst [that “millions of people” had snuck into the polling places and voted, presumably for Democrats], The Washington Post and The LA Times took the lead in clearly labeling the claim as false, rather than “controversial” or “unsubstantiated.”... By contrast.. the NYT takes a more “objective” tone—there’s “no evidence” for Trump’s claim, much as there was “no evidence” for his assertion that Ted Cruz’s dad played a part in the JFK assassination. What’s the difference? The NYT said that the claim had “no evidence.” The Post said it was false. The Times’s is more conventional—but it is also “normalizing” in suggesting that Trump actually cared whether there was evidence for what he said. I think the Post’s is closer to calling things what they are.

It’s nearly three-and-a-half years later. Everything we saw about Trump on the campaign trail we have seen from him in the White House, including the limitless fantasy-lying.

I submit that these three-and-a-half years later, much of the press has still not rebuilt itself, to cope with a time or a person like this. Or with a political party like the subservient Trump-era GOP.

To choose only a small subset of examples, from only the past three days’ worth of history, here are some illustrations. These are words and deeds that, each on its own, would likely have been major black-mark news events in other eras. Now they are just part of the daily onrush.

1) Us, and them. Two days ago, on March 27, Donald Trump signed in the Oval Office the most expensive spending bill in American history. Getting it enacted required sustained, major efforts from Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House, and from Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, who got every one of his fellow Democrats to vote for the bill.

After Lyndon Johnson relied on Republican support to get his civil-rights and Medicare legislation through the Congress, he made sure that the Republican leaders from the House and Senate were with him for the signing ceremonies, to receive some of the first pens he used. (When Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in the Oval Office, he had only Democratic legislators around him—but that was because of near-unanimous Republican opposition to the bill.)

Structurally Trump’s situation this week was like LBJ’s: he was signing a bill the other party had played a crucial role in passing. But when Trump signed the bill yesterday, not a single Democratic legislator was present. Pelosi said she had not been invited.

Every other president has tried, at some point, to expand his support beyond those who originally voted for him (which is why all others have at some point had popularity ratings of 60 percent or 70 percent). Every other one has at some point tried to express the interests of the entire public, not just “the base.” Trump has never done either—and that failure is so baked-in that it barely registers now.

Obama used precious months in his first year trying to get GOP support for his medical plan; he failed; and a running press critique thereafter was that he should have been doing more to “reach out” to the other side. (Recall the whole “Have a drink with Mitch McConnell” motif.) I haven’t seen any columns fretting about Trump’s failure to “reach out” to Pelosi or Schumer. “That’s just Trump.”

2) “If they don’t treat you right, I don’t call.” In this past Friday’s version of his marathon TV sessions—the supposed “health” briefings that have become daily hour-long substitutes for Trump’s campaign rallies—Trump said that most of the governors now requesting federal aid were friendly to him. But not all, and the ones who weren’t “appreciative” had better watch their step.

Trump was asked what he meant about being “appreciative.” His answer (as you can see starting at time 24:00 of this C-SPAN video):

“Q. You say the governors are not appreciate of what the federal government has done. What more— “A: [breaking in}: I think the governor of Washington [Jay Inslee] is a failed presidential candidate. He leveled out at zero in the polls. He’s constantly tripping and—I guess ‘complaining’ would be a nice way of saying it… In Michigan, all she does is—she has no idea what’s going on. All she does is saying [whining voice] ‘Oh, it’s the federal government’s fault…’ “I want them to be appreciative. We’ve done a great job… “Mike Pence, I don’t think he sleeps any more. He calls all the governors. I tell him—I’m a different kind of guy—I tell him, Don’t call the governor of Washington. You’re wasting your time with him. “Don’t call the woman in Michigan…. “You know what I say, If they don’t treat you right, I don’t call.”

What would have made news about this passage in any other era?

First, the naked favor-trading: What Trump is saying about the states of Washington and Michigan is more or less what led the House to impeach him last year, regarding Ukraine. That is: threatened use of federal power and favors, to reward political friends and punish political enemies—and in this case for unconcealed, openly stated political reasons.

Second, the crassness and cruelty, to leaders coping with life-and-death emergencies in their home states. “A failed presidential candidate.” “She has no idea what’s doing on.”

Third, the misogyny: Repeatedly avoiding the name of Gretchen Whitmer, elected last year as governor of Michigan, and calling her “the woman in Michigan.” Check the C-SPAN video if you’re in doubt about the dismissive tone of these remarks, and recall Trump’s frequent references to “Crooked Hillary” and “Crazy Nancy Pelosi.”

There was some brief press followup on all these points, but mainly it was again normalized as Trump being Trump.

3) Lies, lies, lies. I’ll leave to the other chroniclers a complete list of the several dozen lies in Trump’s live-broadcast appearances in the past few days. On Thursday, he went on at length about the bounty of tariff payments that the U.S. was receiving “from China”—which revealed either a black-is-white misunderstanding of how tariffs work, or a Harry Frankfurt-style indifference to the bullshit of what he was saying. (None of the White House reporters challenged him about his tariff claim.)

Here is just one consequential lie to stand for the rest: Trump repeatedly claims, and has done so every day this past week, that no one possibly could have seen this pandemic coming, and that everything was great until just a few weeks ago.

Of the countless reasons to know this is false, consider this Politico story on the detailed, 69-page playbook the National Security Council had prepared for coping with just this kind of emergency. The exact timing, origin, and biology of this new disease of course came as surprises. But the consequences and choices are ones any competent government would have foreseen.

Just a month before the 9/11 attacks, in which more than 3,000 people were killed, George W. Bush received a memo famously titled, “Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.” Many years later, press analyses still pointed this out. For years after the attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi, in which four Americans died, congressional Republicans held several dozen hearings, to determine whether the Obama administration should have been more prepared.

In the past few days’ papers, I see no followup on this NSC report. Press standards for covering Trump have already factored in, and thus implicitly forgiven, the corruption and incompetence.



4) Repeating the mistakes of 2015. Starting in the summer of 2015, cable channels began running live Trump rallies, because they were so “interesting.” People watched. Ratings went up. And by Election Day, Trump had received billions of dollars’ worth of free airtime. One calculation of the value was $5 billion; another, $2 billion. In either case, a lot.

Without this coverage—this decision by TV outlets, to improve their ratings by giving limitless free, live airtime to Trump—he could never have become the Republican nominee, let alone the president.

Trump himself clearly views the “briefings” about the “virus” — really, rallies about his greatness—as this year’s substitute for the live rallies he can no longer hold. But the cable and broadcast outlets, as if 2015 and 2016 had never occurred, are covering his daily briefings as they did the rallies of days gone by. For more on why this is a mistake, please see this suggestion from Jay Rosen of PressThink, about how the media could shift to “emergency setting”, and this from the Washington Post’s Erik Wemple on the problem of nonstop live coverage of Trump telling lies.

In the midst of America's racial reckoning, the question of how to deal with memorials to controversial leaders has risen again to the national stage - and has brought back criticisms of ""cancel culture"" with it.

""Cancel culture"", the term for when individuals or companies face swift public backlash and boycott over offensive statements or actions, has been an incendiary topic in the movements of recent years, whether relating to misogyny, race or homophobia.

To some, it's a new way to flag past wrongs. To others, it's an ineffective over-reaction in the court of public opinion. In the wake of the George Floyd protests, some see the dethroning of historical figures associated with racism as the latest iteration of cancel culture.

On Tuesday, a group of more than 100 famous writers such Salman Rushdie and JK Rowling published a letter in Harper's magazine in which they decried ""this stifling atmosphere"" as toxic to artistic expression and healthy debate.

Here's a look at what US leaders and cultural experts have had to say about it.

Trump: 'Far-left fascism'

US President Donald Trump appears to be making it a central part of his re-election campaign. He has deemed cancel culture ""far-left fascism"", saying it is ""driving people from their jobs, shaming dissenters, and demanding total submission from anyone who disagrees...is the very definition of totalitarianism"".

He has criticised calls for renaming sites and removing monuments as part of this ""dangerous movement"".

""This attack on our liberty, our magnificent liberty, must be stopped, and it will be stopped very quickly,"" Mr Trump told supporters during his Independence Day event on 3 July.

""We will expose this dangerous movement, protect our nation's children, end this radical assault, and preserve our beloved American way of life.""

Obama: 'The world is messy'

Last October, former President Barack Obama challenged cancel culture and the idea of being ""woke"" - a term describing being alert to injustices and what's going on in the community - saying change was complex.

Young people who disagree with Trump and Obama

Mr Trump's critics in particular have said his own remarks condemning and publicly shaming those he disagrees with - from news outlets to former staff to protesters - also play into cancel culture.

But younger generations have pushed back against the notion that cancel culture equals unhelpful judgment.

""It was because they were spreading the kinds of ideas that contribute to the marginalisation of people like me and those I care about.""

So what's the statue row about?

Opinions held by protesters range from tearing down Confederate statues to dethroning all monuments associated with colonisation or with ties to slavery and racism.

Activists calling for the removal of statues like Confederate general Robert E Lee and Italian explorer Christopher Columbus have said these monuments glorify in lieu of teaching people about history.

What began in America has caused statues of past leaders around the world - from Winston Churchill to Mahatma Gandhi - to come under scrutiny.

And what's Trump said about this?

The president has called US statues ""sacred"" and ""treasured American legacies"", while describing the push for their removal ""a merciless campaign to wipe out our history"" and ""erase our values"".

His address at Mount Rushmore - a controversial memorial on land sacred to Native Americans - focused on these notions of ""angry mobs"" attacking US culture.

""Before these figures were immortalised in stone, they were American giants in full flesh and blood, gallant men whose intrepid deeds unleashed the greatest leap of human advancement the world has ever known,"" Mr Trump said.

The president has also defended the preservation of symbols of the Confederacy - the group of southern states that fought to keep slavery and sparked the Civil War.

What about Democrats?

Former Vice-President and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has also defended keeping monuments to presidents past, but said those memorialising Confederate leaders should be taken down.

""The idea of comparing whether or not George Washington owned slaves or Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, and somebody who was in rebellion committing treason trying to take down a union to keep slavery, I think there's a distinction there,"" Mr Biden said at a recent news conference.

The numbers are a stark change from when Quinnipiac posed the same question three years ago and found 50% of people were against removing the statues.

What about other views?

African American Studies Senior Lecturer Jason Nichols of the University of Maryland says deciding which monuments ought to go should depend on the reason the person is memorialised.

Big business helps to build communities as surely as it helps build people. There’s something sweet (and, as Williamson notes, a little bit Japanese) about the warehouse’s menu of non-work-related activities — on-site classes for those who seek some other career, (optional) group exercise programs. For a large cohort of Americans, our workplaces are our principal communities — where we find friends, common interests, absorbing challenges, even meaning and purpose. Some of us are our best selves when we’re on the job. There’s an editor at the city desk of my former employer the New York Post whose shift starts at 1 p.m. He shows up at 9 a.m. for the purpose of drinking coffee and cracking jokes and amusing everyone. Also he likes the work. Even on the sitcom The Office, with its exaggerated slate of the regrettable and awkward, an assortment of odd ducks somehow came to feel something like a community, maybe even a family.

SLIDESHOW: The Amazon Workplace

This isn’t sentimentality; the business sphere forces us to cooperate with one another, even if it doesn’t come naturally at first. We reach out across various barriers not because that’s our inclination but because that’s how the job gets done. The marketplace brings us together and then it steers us to behave. It’s more true now than ever, with the Yelpification of American business: Treat a customer badly, and your reputation may be permanently damaged. Treat an employee badly, and the next one may cost you more.

Using “liberal” in its proper sense, to mean “free,” economist Deirdre Nansen McCloskey writes in the summer issue of Modern Age: “The growth of the liberal market, I would argue, permits virtue, not vice.” McCloskey’s piece, “Why Liberalism’s Critics Fail,” is a rebuttal to Patrick Deneen’s sour book Why Liberalism Failed and its stern critique of the America that a free marketplace hath wrought.

The libertarian-leaning McCloskey sees Deneen’s communitarian plea as just “coercive utopianism” echoing Plato’s Republic or ancient Sparta. “His liberty is the right to obey with good cheer the will of God and of Nature and of that of the local commune. You will be happy that way, he says. Notice how unhappy you are now.”

Are we unhappy, though? If there is a certain amount of alienation in American life, is there any reason to believe that this is getting worse because of the free market? “The claim of alienation, though asserted in scores of fashionable books every publishing season, is comprehensively false,” writes McCloskey. Sir William Temple once remarked, about the honesty of 17th-century Dutch merchants, that it sprang not so much from “a principle of conscience or morality, as from a custom or habit introduced by the necessity of trade among them, which depends as much upon common honesty, as war does upon discipline.” The marketplace is something to welcome, not fear. Americans are adapting to its constant self-improvement with brio. Adds McCloskey, “We all take happily what the market gives — polite, accommodating, energetic, enterprising, risk-taking, trustworthy people with property, trade, and industry; not bad people.” American business is bolstering civic life, not destroying it. Capitalism is a community too.

Digital operatives recognize that Cosby ’ s fall is sure to be an unusual case , given the severity of what more than a dozen women have said he did , including several who had not spoken out before .
But strategists also see Cosby ’ s fall as a case study in how social media can spread old news to new audiences — with speed and efficiency dramatically different from what any previous generations of political candidates have encountered .
So while opposition researchers retool their digital approach ahead of the 2016 presidential race , when social media will be even more important , they ’ re planning how to use these digital platforms in new ways to reignite the controversies in their opponents ’ past as part of their campaign strategy .
“ The Cosby situation isn ’ t unique to Hollywood celebrities , ” said Vincent Harris , an Austin-based GOP digital consultant who worked for Mitch McConnell ’ s 2014 campaign and recently signed on as top tech strategist for Rand Paul ’ s political operation . “ The same situation could take place in politics , with decades old information , videos , and events coming to light and with enough online drive behind them , they could ignite a firestorm . People online are relentless and politicians must work hard to harness the searches and information seeking of voters , channeling them into a medium where they control the message . ”
Part of the reason the past does well on social media is the audience . Users tend to be younger and may not have lived through the first cycle of the story years ago .
“ Old news is actually new news , ” GOP strategist Kevin Madden said .
“ The stuff that happened 15 years ago is a window into how they arrived at this moment , ” Madden said of how the next generation of voters might find things newsworthy and help propel them to go viral . “ It ’ s a window into their resume and a window into the kind of person they are . ”
There ’ s also a sense among strategists that anything that happened before a platform existed is fair game . Twitter , for example , launched in 2006 and only became very popular in the last few years , making all kinds of old events relevant .
“ If something is found now from the 80s or 90s , that could light a fire on social media very very quickly because it ’ s news now , ” said JD Chang , founder of TrendPo , a political analytics company that sells data on Twitter and Facebook to campaign and member offices .
Chang , who has done work for Republicans and Democrats , including Paul Ryan ’ s Prosperity PAC and South Carolina House candidate Tom Adams , points out the issue can apply to long-time politicians . “ Their history may not be covered by social media , certainly not their earlier histories , ” he said .
That makes dealing with this new environment especially challenging for senators considering reelection bids in 2016 – from Harry Reid to John McCain , whose last race in 2010 came at a time when Facebook was just starting to play in elections and Twitter was still a relatively niche platform .
Social media is also forcing old events to be held to current moral standards . There was a time when leading lawmakers could have gotten away with making casual sexist comments , or something even worse , said former Obama 2012 digital director Teddy Goff . But not now . “ There ’ s an element of justice to what ’ s going on ” with Cosby , he said . But he noted that defenders can just as easily use social media to knock down an incorrect story or potential scandal .
“ Any politician with a history of sexist remarks or assaults is obviously at risk , ” Goff said . “ What they ’ ve said in the past , they ’ ve got to understand the change in sensibility and change in power structure . That ’ s what this is really about . It ’ s a situation where old men running newsrooms and holding political office are ceding power to actual people , of whom about 50 percent are women . ”
Some believe this issue could become a problem for Hillary Clinton , the party ’ s early 2016 frontrunner . Bill Clinton ’ s history of infidelity and allegations of harassment were thoroughly aired in the 1990s . The question is whether the information will find a new audience on social media or one that views the events through a new frame .
There is some precedent for a shift in attitude . Monica Lewinsky reemerged online this year with an interview in Vogue . While she was widely mocked and harassed online in the late 1990s — she even calls herself the first true victim of cyber bullying — she found a far more sympathetic environment in 2014 , with some comedians even apologizing for how she was treated as a White House intern and feminist writers defending her .
Still , Hillary Clinton ’ s expected 2016 campaign will have little hope that Republicans and reporters won ’ t spend time trying to rehash the former president ’ s personal and political scandals .
Paul , the Kentucky Republican and likely 2016 presidential candidate , hit Democrats and Bill Clinton earlier this year for using a position of power to take advantage of young women . “ Anybody who wants to take money from Bill Clinton or have a fundraiser has a lot of explaining to do , ” Paul said during a February interview on CSPAN ’ s “ Newsmakers ” program .

So while opposition researchers retool their digital approach ahead of the 2016 presidential race, when social media will be even more important, they’re planning how to use these digital platforms in new ways to reignite the controversies in their opponents’ past as part of their campaign strategy.

It would stream to homes on the Fourth of July weekend .
It ’ s a hell of a gift for our nation ’ s birthday .
As our country convulses , Miranda ’ s unlikely blockbuster , now 5 years old , has become something of a Rorschach test . How do you see America ?
Are we a 400-year-old blood-drenched relic founded on slavery , as the discredited New York Times 1619 Project has it , the American Revolution fought for the rights of slaveholders ? Are we today a malignant cancer , one metastasized over centuries and now terminal ?
Is America so hopelessly , systemically racist — and in some woke quarters , if you ’ re white , you ’ re a racist , no matter how well you know yourself , just a heads-up — that we should tear it all down , statues only the beginning ?
Or do you see the America that Miranda sees ? The one that ’ s an idea as much as a nation , our Founding Fathers flawed products of their time , many unable to grasp the contradictions in fighting for freedom while slaveholders themselves , struggling to codify a republic they believed could be exceptional ?
“ And so the American experiment begins , ” goes the lyric in “ Yorktown , ” the show ’ s electrifying set piece depicting the Revolution ’ s most consequential battle and its aftermath .
The American experiment : Has there ever been a more eloquent , perfect description of our imperfection ?
“ Hamilton ” itself is an experiment , a patriotic hip-hop musical with a multiracial cast portraying George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , and with Miranda — himself of Puerto Rican descent — playing Alexander Hamilton . Race here is both irrelevant and a way to remind us that all races suffered in , and contributed to , our founding .
While “ Hamilton ” may not be historically accurate — Miranda glosses over his hero ’ s buying and selling of slaves for his in-laws , as well as Jefferson ’ s and Washington ’ s slaveholding — it doesn ’ t have to be . It ’ s not a documentary . It ’ s a work of art speaking to our better angels .
There ’ s a reason Miranda won the Pulitzer , a Kennedy Center Honor , a MacArthur Genius Grant and an armload of Tonys and Grammys for “ Hamilton . ”
There ’ s also a reason that its diehard fans include Barack Obama and Jay-Z , and that Disney paid $ 75 million for the worldwide rights .
On our best days , this is the America we believe in , a melting pot , in which humanitarian ideals unite us all . On our worst days , this is the America for which we continue to fight .
Two other key lines from “ Yorktown ” acknowledge just how much our complicated history lives with us still :
Miranda is reflecting truths we well know . Not everyone in America is equal yet . Not all immigrants feel welcome — or are welcome . We will never be free until we eradicate the systemic legacies of slavery . That fight is not yet over .
But with “ Hamilton , ” Miranda reminds us that the good fight is always worth waging , no matter the cost . On this most unusual Fourth , it feels only right to celebrate his musical — and , by extension , the best of America .","Not long after we went into quarantine — all of us just beginning to understand the magnitude of it, feeling so much fear and uncertainty — Lin-Manuel Miranda and Bob Iger announced that a filmed version of “Hamilton” would be released earlier than scheduled.

It’s a hell of a gift for our nation’s birthday.

Are we a 400-year-old blood-drenched relic founded on slavery, as the discredited New York Times 1619 Project has it, the American Revolution fought for the rights of slaveholders? Are we today a malignant cancer, one metastasized over centuries and now terminal?

Is America so hopelessly, systemically racist — and in some woke quarters, if you’re white, you’re a racist, no matter how well you know yourself, just a heads-up — that we should tear it all down, statues only the beginning?

Or do you see the America that Miranda sees? The one that’s an idea as much as a nation, our Founding Fathers flawed products of their time, many unable to grasp the contradictions in fighting for freedom while slaveholders themselves, struggling to codify a republic they believed could be exceptional?

“And so the American experiment begins,” goes the lyric in “Yorktown,” the show’s electrifying set piece depicting the Revolution’s most consequential battle and its aftermath.

The American experiment: Has there ever been a more eloquent, perfect description of our imperfection?

“Hamilton” itself is an experiment, a patriotic hip-hop musical with a multiracial cast portraying George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and with Miranda — himself of Puerto Rican descent — playing Alexander Hamilton. Race here is both irrelevant and a way to remind us that all races suffered in, and contributed to, our founding.

While “Hamilton” may not be historically accurate — Miranda glosses over his hero’s buying and selling of slaves for his in-laws, as well as Jefferson’s and Washington’s slaveholding — it doesn’t have to be. It’s not a documentary. It’s a work of art speaking to our better angels.

There’s a reason Miranda won the Pulitzer, a Kennedy Center Honor, a MacArthur Genius Grant and an armload of Tonys and Grammys for “Hamilton.”

There’s also a reason that its diehard fans include Barack Obama and Jay-Z, and that Disney paid $75 million for the worldwide rights.

On our best days, this is the America we believe in, a melting pot, in which humanitarian ideals unite us all. On our worst days, this is the America for which we continue to fight.

Two other key lines from “Yorktown” acknowledge just how much our complicated history lives with us still:

“We’ll never be free until we end slavery.”

“Immigrants — we get the job done!”

Miranda is reflecting truths we well know. Not everyone in America is equal yet. Not all immigrants feel welcome — or are welcome. We will never be free until we eradicate the systemic legacies of slavery. That fight is not yet over.

But with “Hamilton,” Miranda reminds us that the good fight is always worth waging, no matter the cost. On this most unusual Fourth, it feels only right to celebrate his musical — and, by extension, the best of America.",www.nypost.com,right,gVZiNUsuk0sjLU1V

What’s happening

The phrase “Twitter, do your thing” can set off a potentially powerful series of events in what has become a repeated online phenomenon: A person or brand does something considered offensive or problematic, a social media user posts about it and the incident snowballs across the internet, allowing countless people to put pressure on a person or organization until that entity is “canceled.”

The idea of “cancel culture” — first coined by Black Twitter users — dates back to 2015 and began as a means of calling out friends or acquaintances. Since then it has evolved to targeting the powerful, sometimes with highly effective results (for example, the #MeToo movement and #OscarsSoWhite campaign). Public shaming is in no way new, but the internet has made the process of “canceling” even more potent and widespread.

More recently, the phenomenon has led to firings, resignations and boycotts amid the country’s shifting views on race. TV shows were pulled off the air because of onscreen depictions of police. Writers lost or left their jobs at prominent publications because of their controversial views. Non-celebrities have also become entangled. A Boeing executive resigned over a 33-year-old article arguing that women should not serve in combat. A young democratic socialist lost his job at a data science firm after tweeting the results of a study about race riots.

A fiery debate erupted over a letter published in Harper’s magazine that warned of the dangers of “ideological conformity.” Signed by more than 150 influential journalists and academics, the Harper’s letter effectively argued for the end of cancel culture and received a great deal of backlash online.

Why there’s debate

The debate over cancel culture centers around whether mass public criticism furthers the cause of justice or if it represents a misinformed online witchhunt that poses a threat to free speech. The phenomenon has been criticized by prominent politicians on both sides of the aisle — President Trump called it “the very definition of totalitarianism,” and former President Barack Obama said there are “ambiguities” that should be considered when criticizing people’s wrongdoing.

Critics of cancel culture say it threatens freedom of speech and open debate. If people have to worry about personal or professional repercussions for what they say, ideas won’t be fully examined, they argue. Disagreement is fine, but “canceling” someone goes too far and only denies people the opportunity to grow and have their opinions change over time. Another group says cancel culture rarely results in real systemic change and can even let companies off the hook by making small moves, like disciplining or firing a single employee, instead of addressing larger organizational issues. There are also times when the online mob acts on incomplete information, like the case of a viral video of a young woman at a boarded-up store.

Proponents of cancel culture argue that it serves to reverse deeply entrenched power structures. Social media empowers those whose voices have been historically silenced by providing them a platform to hold large companies and public figures accountable. Those who are upset by cancel culture, they argue, are the elite who are, for the first time, being held to account, they say.

Others argue that there is no such thing as cancel culture and that the phrase has been invented to make worthwhile criticism seem somehow new or exotic. One bad news cycle is rarely enough to end the career or threaten the financial stability of influential figures, they argue. For example, it’s unlikely that someone like “Harry Potter” author J.K.

Remember that famous line in the movie Jerry Maguire where Renee Zellweger says to Tom Cruise, ""You had me at 'hello' ""? Well it turns out there is some scientific evidence to back this up. People use voices to instantly judge people, researchers say.

Whom Do You Trust? What do you think when you hear a stranger speak? It turns out that we make judgments about traits like aggression and trustworthiness within a second of hearing someone's voice.

""From the first word you hear a person speak, you start to form this impression of the person's personality, says Phil McAleer, a psychologist at the University of Glasgow, Scotland, who led the study.

In his experiment, McAleer recorded 64 people, men and women, from Glasgow, reading a paragraph that included the word ""hello."" He then extracted all the hellos and got 320 participants to listen to the different voices and rate them on 10 different personality traits, such as trustworthiness, aggressiveness, confidence, dominance and warmth.

What he found was that the participants largely agreed on which voice matched which personality trait. One male voice was overwhelmingly voted the least trustworthy, ""the sort of guy you'd want to avoid,"" McAleer says. The pitch of the untrustworthy voice was much lower than the male deemed most trustworthy. McAleer says this is probably because a higher pitched male voice is closer to the natural pitch of a female, making the men sound less aggressive and friendlier than the lower male voices.

What makes females sound more trustworthy is whether their voices rise or fall at the end of the word, says McAleer. ""Probably the trustworthy female, when she drops her voice at the end, is showing a degree of certainty and so can be trusted.""

McAleer says it doesn't really matter whether the ratings of personality accurately reflect a speaker's true personality. What matters, he contends, is that there was so much agreement on the traits.

""What we find is that they all seem to perceive that one voice is the most trustworthy and another voice is the least trustworthy,"" he says. And the same is true of all the other personality traits that were tested.

In less than a second, the time it takes to say ""hello,"" we make a snap judgment about someone's personality, says Jody Kreiman, a UCLA researcher who studies how we perceive voice.

During an event in Kentucky on Wednesday , McConnell referred to social distancing guidelines when he said , “ There ’ s no stigma attached to wearing a mask . There ’ s no stigma attached to staying six feet apart . ”
The Kentucky lawmaker also declared that people have an “ obligation ” to others to wear a mask because they could be asymptomatic , meaning they have the coronavirus but are not showing any symptoms .
“ That ’ s not too much to ask of a younger person , ” McConnell later added about wearing a mask . “ So to get through this next phase , as we ease back into normal , even if you ’ re in a low-risk category , do what we ’ re asking you to do for the good of others as we begin to move back to normal . ”
“ For anybody who cares what we think , [ my advice is ] to say what I said earlier which is : Just because you ’ re 21 , it doesn ’ t mean you don ’ t have a responsibility to other people , even though your chances of having a problem are pretty slim . I think the more we can say that the better . ”
Aside from the political world , actor Matthew McConaughey also touched on the topic of masks during a May 12 interview on Fox News .
“ I think wearing a mask is not propaganda . I don ’ t think it ’ s partisanship or politics . I think a mask is all about our purpose right now , ” McConaughey said , as IJR previously reported .
He also noted that the politics surrounding wearing a mask has “ created a false divide , sort of two wars in America — an us versus them war and us versus the virus war . ”
“ If we try to fight both of those wars , we ’ re going to lose both of them , but if we try to fight the one against the virus , which is the one we should be fighting , then we ’ re going to beat it , ” he added .
McConnell ’ s recent remarks come as the death toll due to the coronavirus passed the 100,000 mark in the U.S .

New York turned from a mess into a haven . But now Michael Bloomberg -- Giuliani 's mayoral successor beginning in 2002 -- is paying the price for a successful anti-crime record that followed in Giuliani 's footsteps . Bloomberg has defended NYPD policies as non-racially biased ; in 2015 , he told The Aspen Institute that supposedly disproportionate `` targeting '' of minorities was not disproportionate but based on criminal conduct and description thereof .

Nonetheless , Bloomberg was widely blasted as a racist for his comments . That criticism came from both left and right . Bloomberg quickly apologized for his five-year-old comments , saying : `` By the time I left office , I cut it back 95 % , but I should 've done it faster and sooner .

Unfortunately , we live in a world where the counterfactual can be entertained without reference to reality .

I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country . ''
Swift 's statement could potentially boost turnout among her fans , many of whom were preteens when Swift first rose to stardom , and are now of voting age .
Swift says she `` can not support Marsha Blackburn , '' a Republican congresswoman running for the Senate . Instead , Swift says she will be voting for Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives .
`` She did n't make it about partisan issues . She made it very much about values , and I think that is an integral part of this election , '' says 21-year-old Blake Kitterman , vice president of Tennessee Young Democrats . Kitterman tells NPR that Swift has the potential to influence many young voters .
`` The basic values that she has as a person , and that I would hope everyone else in the country has , do not really surprise me . It 's a clear cut choice between Marsha Blackburn and Phil Bredesen , and I 'm happy and reassured that she supported the right candidate in my mind , '' says Kitterman .
`` Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me . She voted against equal pay for women . She voted against the Re-authorization of the Violence Against Women Act , which attempts to protect women from domestic violence , stalking , and date rape . She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples . She also believes they should not have the right to marry . These are not MY Tennessee values . ''
In her Sunday Instagram post , Swift , who is 28 , also made it clear she wants people in office who support LGBTQ rights and gender and racial equality .
`` I can not vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans , no matter their skin color , gender or who they love , '' she says .
Andy Cole , the vice chairman of the Tennessee Young Republicans , says he does n't think Swift 's endorsement will have much influence on the minds of young voters .
`` We 've seen celebrities endorse Democrats before . Most Tennessee voters are worried about which candidate is going to give them a good job , which candidate is going to get out and fix the education system , which candidate is going to do the things Tennessee voters need ... We 're glad she has an opinion , and we love to see younger people have opinions , because frankly , I think too often , younger people have been disengaged . ''
It 's unclear to what extent Swift 's endorsement could help Democratic candidates . According to a study by Pew , millennials are among the most liberal generations in the U.S. , with the majority supporting Democrats in their districts . Only 27 percent of millennials approve of President Trump 's job performance .
At the same time , young voters are not showing up at the polls . In the past four midterm elections , young people between the ages of 18 and 24 voted at a rate of just 20 percent .
In her post , Swift urges her young fans to show up at the ballot in November .
`` Please , please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values . For a lot of us , we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100 % on every issue , but we have to vote anyway ... So many intelligent , thoughtful , self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count . ''
Kitterman of the Tennessee Young Democrats says that even without Swift 's support , an increasing number of younger voters will be turning out to vote this year .
`` There are multiple threats now going against us , and I think that is a factor in pushing millennial turnout , '' he says . `` Taylor Swift only reinforces this built-up tension that we have in ourselves .

Mccarthy, Tobias Hoonhout, Bill Corsair, Jason Richwine","The all-seeing social-justice eye penetrates every aspect of our lives : sports , movies , public monuments , social media , funerals . . .
A definition of totalitarianism might be the saturation of every facet of daily life by political agendas and social-justice messaging .
At the present rate , America will soon resemble the dystopias of novels such as 1984 and Brave New World in which all aspects of life are warped by an all-encompassing ideology of coerced sameness . Or rather , the prevailing orthodoxy in America is the omnipresent attempt of an elite — exempt from the consequences of its own ideology thanks to its supposed superior virtue and intelligence — to mandate an equality of result .
We expect their 24/7 political messaging on cable-channel news networks , talk radio , or print and online media . And we concede that long ago an NPR , CNN , MSNBC , or New York Times ceased being journalistic entities as much as obsequious megaphones of the progressive itinerary .
But increasingly we can not escape anywhere the lidless gaze of our progressive lords , all-seeing , all-knowing from high up in their dark towers .
The Peter Strzok–Lisa Page texts , along with the careers of former FBI director James Comey and his deputy Andrew McCabe , reveal a politicized and in some sense rotten FBI hierarchy , beholden far more to its own exalted sense of a progressive self than merely to investigating crimes against the people .
Lois Lerner was a clumsy reflection of how the IRS long ago became weaponized in service to auditing deplorables . Former CIA director John Brennan and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper used their supposedly nonpartisan positions to further political agendas . That each in his own way is clownish does not mitigate their rank efforts to graft intelligence agencies onto political causes .
The same deterioration is true of many in the Department of Justice , who , along with the FBI , misled FISA-court justices , as if that were the only , or perhaps the easiest , way to obtain politically driven surveillance on U.S. citizens .

Americans have long accepted that Hollywood movies no longer seek just to entertain or inform , but to indoctrinate audiences by pushing progressive agendas .

Yet that iconic act disappears from the movie version . ( At least Ryan Gosling , who plays Armstrong , does not walk out of the space capsule to string up a U.N . banner . )
Gosling claimed that the moon landing should not be seen as an American effort .

The all-seeing social-justice eye penetrates every aspect of our lives: sports, movies, public monuments, social media, funerals . . .

A definition of totalitarianism might be the saturation of every facet of daily life by political agendas and social-justice messaging.

At the present rate, America will soon resemble the dystopias of novels such as 1984 and Brave New World in which all aspects of life are warped by an all-encompassing ideology of coerced sameness. Or rather, the prevailing orthodoxy in America is the omnipresent attempt of an elite — exempt from the consequences of its own ideology thanks to its supposed superior virtue and intelligence — to mandate an equality of result.

We expect their 24/7 political messaging on cable-channel news networks, talk radio, or print and online media. And we concede that long ago an NPR, CNN, MSNBC, or New York Times ceased being journalistic entities as much as obsequious megaphones of the progressive itinerary.

But increasingly we cannot escape anywhere the lidless gaze of our progressive lords, all-seeing, all-knowing from high up in their dark towers.

The Peter Strzok–Lisa Page texts, along with the careers of former FBI director James Comey and his deputy Andrew McCabe, reveal a politicized and in some sense rotten FBI hierarchy, beholden far more to its own exalted sense of a progressive self than merely to investigating crimes against the people.

Lois Lerner was a clumsy reflection of how the IRS long ago became weaponized in service to auditing deplorables. Former CIA director John Brennan and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper used their supposedly nonpartisan positions to further political agendas. That each in his own way is clownish does not mitigate their rank efforts to graft intelligence agencies onto political causes.

The same deterioration is true of many in the Department of Justice, who, along with the FBI, misled FISA-court justices, as if that were the only, or perhaps the easiest, way to obtain politically driven surveillance on U.S. citizens. Americans now are woke to the reality that straying too much into the forbidden zone guarantees that their communications can be monitored on the pretense that they’re colluding with some nefarious power. Yet if foreigners are the menace, why did our proverbial best and brightest traffic with a paid foreign spy at election time to sabotage a political campaign, then trump even the improper use of electronic surveillance with the insertion of paid informants?

Google, Facebook, and Twitter are facing accusations of censoring social-media accounts and massaging Internet searches according to their progressive political agendas. The masters of the universe have given us the stereotype of 20- and 30-something social-warrior geeks, fiddling with their algorithms to virtue-signal their left-wing fides to a global audience.

It had a good three-year run , but inevitably , hypocrisy and political expediency caught up with it .
Ninety-five Hollywood supporters of the # MeToo movement smeared now-SCOTUS Justice Brett Kavanaugh over flimsy sexual assault allegations in 2018 in an attempt to block his Supreme Court appointment . But now that Democrat presidential hopeful Joe Biden has sexual assault allegations of his own -- allegations with more corroborating evidence than the claims against Kavanugh at least -- these celebs ’ appeals to believing victims no matter what have seemed to dry up . Some of them are even defending Biden and calling his accuser a liar .
Big names like Lady Gaga , Ellen DeGeneres , Jamie Lee Curtis , and nearly 100 more celebrities have had nothing to say against the man running to prevent President Donald Trump ’ s 2020 re-election nor expressed any solidarity with the woman who claimed Biden assaulted her in 1993 . Not even several of the famous ladies belonging to female assault victims solidarity organization Time ’ s Up — like Jessica Chastain , Brie Larson , Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore — have offered a word of support to the alleged victim .
They weren ’ t so silent when conservative judge Brett Kavanaugh endured his Senate Judiciary Hearing in 2018 , every single one of these nearly 100 celebrities smeared him on social media . Many insisted he was an alcoholic , “ liar , ” committed “ sexual violence ” and deserved have his “ pesky penis ” cut off , while the rest of these 95 concerned citizens implied it by pledging belief in Blasey Ford ’ s testimony .
Biden hasn ’ t been held to the same , or any real standard by his friends in Hollywood . It ’ s clear # MeToo has become a political weapon , not a moral awakening , as these virtue-signalling hypocrites sold it .
Perhaps the worst offender in this is Alyssa Milano , whose pivot from defending one accuser to defending the accused was shocking . Milano , a leader of the # MeToo movement , pulled out all the stops in trying to get the public to see Brett Kavanaugh as a predator who assaulted Dr. Ford back in the ‘ 80s . In addition to dismissing the at-the time SCOTUS nominee as a liar and tweeting she believed Dr. Ford , she pulled stunts like sitting in the Senate building during the hearings and harassing Senator Susan Collins ( R-ME ) in her own office before the lawmaker voted to appoint the justice .
She sure seemed like she had female victims ’ backs -- or so she wanted us to think at the time .
Two years later , Alyssa Milano abandoned those standards in order to protect her preferred presidential candidate from assault allegations . Instead of providing a platform for Tara Reade ’ s claims , Milano kept quiet for almost a month after they broke . Only after enough public pressure did Milano acknowledge the allegations . However she rationalized her support for Biden in a Deadline op-ed , claiming the Reade/Biden situation was not as “ black and white ” as the Kavanaugh/Blasey Ford situation .
This is the same woman who tweeted in 2018 , “ You can ’ t pretend to be the party of the American people and then not support a woman who comes forward with her # MeToo story. ” Yikes , that did not age well .
Imagine you ’ re a Hollywood A-lister who has taken up the cause of a sexual assault awareness group that helped take down notorious serial-predator Harvey Weinstein . Wouldn ’ t you at the very least acknowledge , corroborated allegations against the person running to be the most powerful man in the world ? Well some of the ladies of female victims awareness org TIME ’ S UP still have yet to say anything about Reade ’ s accusations against Biden , but they all pledged undying support to Ford .
Julianne Moore , Reese Witherspoon , Brie Larson , Kerry Washington , Jessica Chastain , America Ferrera , Natalie Portman , all members of TIME ’ S UP , have kept quiet about Tara Reade ’ s specific allegations since they broke . Not a hot look for the the group that revolutionized # MeToo politics . Reade herself called out the group on April 29 for having not paid attention to her .
Fox News reported Reade ’ s words : “ You should be able to have your voice heard without losing your career and losing your job . And that 's what your whole mission is about . Why do I not qualify for your mission ? Why , because my perpetrator is the leading Democrat ? Why does that exempt me from help ? ''
It ’ s a fair question . During the Kavanaugh hearings , actresses Moore and Ferrera participated in a PSA thanking Dr. Ford for her testimony of Kavanaugh ’ s “ sexual violence. ” Witherspoon tweeted against Kavanaugh . Larson tweeted , “ # BelieveSurvivors , ” and Washington tweeted , “ Women must be heard . Today I am wearing black in solidarity with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford . # BelieveSurvivors # TIMESUP # StopKavanaugh . ”
Chastain posted her belief that Kavanaugh was the man that “ assaulted ” Ford and Portman told Variety that Kavanaugh ’ s appointment demonstrated “ how stacked ” the system is against women . But what makes Biden so different for these women ?
Since Reade ’ s admonition of these A-listers , TIME ’ S UP President Tina Tchen has acknowledged the need “ for complete transparency into this [ Reade ’ s ] claim and the multiple claims against President Donald Trump. ” Hmm , sounds like a bit of a qualification there . Tchen also praised Biden ’ s May 1 denial to MSNBC ’ s Nicolle Wallce , saying “ Today , Vice President Joe Biden sat down and directly addressed the allegation against him with the seriousness it deserves , something that the current president has never done . ”
Yeah they sympathize with Reade -- so they say -- but clearly they ’ re going easy on Biden and will deflect to Trump ’ s accusation if needs be .
Bette Midler ’ s journey from # believeallwomen to # doubtingvictims is another major example of # MeToo hypocrisy . During the Kavanaugh hearings , the Hocus Pocus actress made waves with her radically over-the-top appeal to female victimhood .
Her empathy for Ford was apparently so great that in Sept 2018 she tweeted , “ ‘ Women are the n-word of the world ’ ” -- a reference to a John Lennon and Yoko Ono song . She elaborated with her own words , writing , “ Raped , beaten , enslaved , married off , worked like dumb animals ; denied education and inheritance ; enduring the pain and danger of childbirth and life IN SILENCE for THOUSANDS of years . ”
Of course , even Midler recognized that this was a bit extreme , deleting the tweet later . Though without a doubt , Midler had proclaimed that she was a female ally who prided herself on giving assault victims the benefit of the doubt . Well , that is , until the guy running against Trump got hit with his own set of allegations .
Contrary to most of her quiet tinseltown colleagues , Midler attacked Reade ’ s 2020 allegations head on , accusing her of orchestrating a political hitjob against the man that needed to beat Trump in November . As some news outlets like MSNBC broke the month-long media silence on Reade ’ s allegations , Midler became annoyed . She tweeted , “ Why do the # Dems always twist themselves into pretzels over this shit ? We heard Donald Trump say ‘ I grab 'em by the pussy ! ’ and no one made a peep ! Did n't seem to hurt him , but we have been paying ever since . Who is paying to # SWIFTBOAT Joe Biden ? ? ”
So much for believing victims . It seems she wants their stories buried , at least if we are judging by her Kavanaugh standard . In this case , wasn ’ t Midler doing her part in making another woman an “ n-word of the world ? ”
Of course you can ’ t mention lefty hypocrisy without good ol ’ Debra Messing . The Will & Grace actress and sworn enemy of President Trump on Twitter got caught in a bit of # MeToo hot water when she tried to debunk Reade ’ s assault accusation against the former vice president on May 2 . According to Fox News , Messing retweeted to her “ 635,000 plus ” followers a Medium article doubting Reade ’ s integrity . But annoyed users guilted her into deleting it .
Several users jumped on Messing ’ s post , asserting that she was “ shaming ” survivors . Intercept journalist Glenn Greenwald responded with a sarcastic tweet that said , “ Gee , I wonder why a woman might be reluctant to come forward with allegations against a powerful male Democratic politician. ” Another wrote , “ at this point Debra Messing is vying for Alyssa Milano ’ s position of useful idiot shaming survivors . ”
Those charges proved troublesome for Messing who had just revealed a glaring double standard in her # MeToo values . Sure anyone might doubt Reade ’ s account but Messing had set the precedent that she believed all survivors during the Kavanaugh trial . During that fiasco , Messing tweeted , “ We call on Judge Brett Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination immediately . We the people , regardless of political party , will not tolerate a man credibly accused of sexual violence by multiple women as our next Supreme Court Justice . # TIMESUP . ”
For Messing , Ford ’ s mere words were enough to convince her Kavanaugh was a rapist , but Reade ’ s corroborated evidence against Biden somehow isn ’ t worth anything . Even Deborah Ramirez ’ s flimsy claims against Kavanaugh were enough evidence for the actress in 2018 .
Never one to break away from any of the day ’ s prevailing leftwing talking points , ABC late night host Jimmy Kimmel slammed Brett Kavanaugh during his show in Sept. 2018 . The comedian butchered the SCOTUS nominee , saying , “ Hear me out on this : So Kavanaugh gets confirmed to the Supreme Court , OK ? Well , in return , we get to cut that pesky penis of his off in front of everyone . ”
And when it came to Biden ’ s allegations , Kimmel was soft on the former vice president like the rest of the media . The host took some criticism for not asking Biden a single question about the allegation during their late night interview , which aired after Reade ’ s bombshell story resurfaced during a Rolling Stone podcast on March 25 , 2020 .
CBS Late Late Show host James Corden made Brett Kavanaugh the brunt of his jokes during his October 4 , 2018 broadcast . Corden slammed Kavanaugh as an angry alcoholic , but like Jimmy Kimmel , Corden avoided any controversy with alleged abuser Biden .
Corden interviewed the Democrat presidential candidate during his show on April 21 , 2020 , but did not mention anything about Biden ’ s allegations or Tara Reade during the segment . This was nearly a month after Reade ’ s allegations broke .
Ice Age actor John Leguizamo made a ridiculous about-face on his # MeToo politics from Kavanaugh to Biden . During the 2018 SCOTUS hearings , Leguizamo called the judge a “ liar ” in a facebook post , writing , “ I wouldn ’ t hire Kavanaugh to work shuffleboard court , never mind the Supreme Court . # liarliarpantsonfire . ”
However , when Biden ’ s allegations started gaining traction , Leguizamo , a member of the Biden campaign ’ s Latin outreach group , took the candidate 's side . He jumped on articles that attempted to debunk Biden ’ s allegations , and shared them via Twitter writing , “ Biden is cleared ! Tara admitting it wasn ’ t assault ! . ” However when the Tara Reade story continued to gain traction , Leguizamo insisted that Reade ’ s claims be scrutinized more closely and even deflected to Trump ’ s own allegations .
Why couldn ’ t he give Kavanaugh the benefit of the doubt ?
Curtis even blasted Biden for his part in Clarence Thomas ’ Supreme Court appointment in 1991 . Curtis tweeted in 2019 , “ Come on @ JoeBiden . Just CALL Anita Hill and then GO TO HER HOUSE and APOLOGIZE to her FACE . The longer you wait the worse it gets . ”
Though since Reade ’ s allegation , Curtis hasn ’ t posted about the subject on either Twitter or Instagram . Could her hands be tied because Joe Biden is most likely the Democrat presidential nominee ?
Mrs. Doubtfire screenwriter Randi Mayem Singer outed herself as a huge # MeToo hypocrite since the Biden allegations . During the Kavanaugh hearings , Singer tweeted , “ Mitch McConnell just stood on the Senate floor and called the women accusing Brett Kavanaugh liars . Somewhere in America a young woman was just sexually attacked . She hears him loud and clear . Vote . ”
However , she made no such defense of Reade after her allegations against Biden resurfaced . She actually insinuated that Reade was a political plant , tweeting , “ So is Tara Reade/ ’ Jennifer ’ trying to impress Vladimir on behalf of Donald Trump/ ’ John Barron ’ ? ” When someone called her out for her double standard , she responded , “ Men lie . Women lie . People lie . Have always had a problem with a blanket ‘ believe ’ approach . It devalues true victims . Women must be heard and listened to . I hope she gets the help she needs . ”
Singer also shared an article with Twitter on May 11 that rationalized voting for Biden while believing Tara Reade ’ s allegations . According to the post , beating Trump is more important than punishing Biden for sexual assault , though Singer commented in her tweet that she ’ s still not convinced by Reade ’ s claims even though she agrees that Biden must win at all costs .
Lefty actress Patricia Arquette slammed Kavanaugh back in Sept. 2018 , quipping that “ The only think [ sic ] Kavanaugh should Judge are the beers at Octoberfest. ” She also agreed with now-disgraced anti-Trump lawyer Michael Avenatti ’ s claim that the FBI must investigate Judge Kavanaugh over allegations . Arquette responded to Avenatti , lamenting that Kavanaugh ’ s victims will suffer “ the victim blaming and the ‘ slut shaming ’ ” from his defenders .
But now that Biden has allegations , Arquette seems to have changed her tune on victims . She deflected from Reade ’ s allegations to those of Trump assault accusers on April 30 , insisting that MSNBC host Christ Hayes focus on those rather than the tough questions he had concerning Biden ’ s assault .
And on May 2 , Arquette tweeted , “ Which Tara Reade do you want me to believe ? The one who last year said Biden touched her neck and made her feel uncomfortable Or this one ? ” Is Arquette “ shaming ” or “ victim blaming ” on this one ?
Lefty comedian Amy Schumer and supermodel Emily Ratajkowski made waves during the Kavanaugh hearing by getting arrested alongside 300 anti-Kavanaugh protestors . Ratajkowski tweeted Oct. 4 , “ Today I was arrested protesting the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh , a man who has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault . Men who hurt women can no longer be placed in positions of power . ”
In a video posted by TPUSA Chief Creative Officer Benny Johnson , Schumer can be seen being asked by police officers whether she had been arrested . The comedian says yes and calmly takes her place in line . The point is , these ladies clearly enjoyed their virtue-signalling for the sake of “ believing victims , ” however now that a leftwing nominee is accused we haven ’ t seen these ladies protest his nomination .
Apparently standing up for victims against the left ’ s only shot at beating Trump is not a good look .
Of course it ’ s clear that the standard of “ # believeallwomen , ” -- that all-hallowed # MeToo mantra -- ended up only being a manipulative political weapon used against powerful men the left hated and put away when powerful lefty men were accused . In the end there was no benefit of the doubt for Biden ’ s accuser , Tara Reade , like there was for Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , or even lamer accusers .
Rose McGowan , an actress , alleged Weinstein abuse victim and one of the few consistent # MeToo activists had the stones to call out this hypocrisy . She blasted Alyssa Milano and other two-faced lefties on April 29 , saying , “ You are a fraud . This is about holding the media accountable . You go after Trump & Kavanaugh saying Believe Victims , you are a lie . ”

So much for privileged male predators being the threat to women . If they are liberal , the rules don ’ t apply .","You can say goodbye to the #MeToo movement. It had a good three-year run, but inevitably, hypocrisy and political expediency caught up with it.

Ninety-five Hollywood supporters of the #MeToo movement smeared now-SCOTUS Justice Brett Kavanaugh over flimsy sexual assault allegations in 2018 in an attempt to block his Supreme Court appointment. But now that Democrat presidential hopeful Joe Biden has sexual assault allegations of his own -- allegations with more corroborating evidence than the claims against Kavanugh at least -- these celebs’ appeals to believing victims no matter what have seemed to dry up. Some of them are even defending Biden and calling his accuser a liar.

Big names like Lady Gaga, Ellen DeGeneres, Jamie Lee Curtis, and nearly 100 more celebrities have had nothing to say against the man running to prevent President Donald Trump’s 2020 re-election nor expressed any solidarity with the woman who claimed Biden assaulted her in 1993. Not even several of the famous ladies belonging to female assault victims solidarity organization Time’s Up — like Jessica Chastain, Brie Larson, Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore — have offered a word of support to the alleged victim.

They weren’t so silent when conservative judge Brett Kavanaugh endured his Senate Judiciary Hearing in 2018, every single one of these nearly 100 celebrities smeared him on social media. Many insisted he was an alcoholic, “liar,” committed “sexual violence” and deserved have his “pesky penis” cut off, while the rest of these 95 concerned citizens implied it by pledging belief in Blasey Ford’s testimony.

Biden hasn’t been held to the same, or any real standard by his friends in Hollywood. It’s clear #MeToo has become a political weapon, not a moral awakening, as these virtue-signalling hypocrites sold it.

The Worst of the #MeToo Hypocrites

Alyssa Milano

Perhaps the worst offender in this is Alyssa Milano, whose pivot from defending one accuser to defending the accused was shocking. Milano, a leader of the #MeToo movement, pulled out all the stops in trying to get the public to see Brett Kavanaugh as a predator who assaulted Dr. Ford back in the ‘80s. In addition to dismissing the at-the time SCOTUS nominee as a liar and tweeting she believed Dr. Ford, she pulled stunts like sitting in the Senate building during the hearings and harassing Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) in her own office before the lawmaker voted to appoint the justice.

She sure seemed like she had female victims’ backs -- or so she wanted us to think at the time.

Two years later, Alyssa Milano abandoned those standards in order to protect her preferred presidential candidate from assault allegations. Instead of providing a platform for Tara Reade’s claims, Milano kept quiet for almost a month after they broke. Only after enough public pressure did Milano acknowledge the allegations. However she rationalized her support for Biden in a Deadline op-ed, claiming the Reade/Biden situation was not as “black and white” as the Kavanaugh/Blasey Ford situation.

This is the same woman who tweeted in 2018, “You can’t pretend to be the party of the American people and then not support a woman who comes forward with her#MeToo story.” Yikes, that did not age well.

The Women of TIME’S UP

Imagine you’re a Hollywood A-lister who has taken up the cause of a sexual assault awareness group that helped take down notorious serial-predator Harvey Weinstein. Wouldn’t you at the very least acknowledge, corroborated allegations against the person running to be the most powerful man in the world? Well some of the ladies of female victims awareness org TIME’S UP still have yet to say anything about Reade’s accusations against Biden, but they all pledged undying support to Ford.

Julianne Moore, Reese Witherspoon, Brie Larson, Kerry Washington, Jessica Chastain, America Ferrera, Natalie Portman, all members of TIME’S UP, have kept quiet about Tara Reade’s specific allegations since they broke. Not a hot look for the the group that revolutionized #MeToo politics. Reade herself called out the group on April 29 for having not paid attention to her.

Fox News reported Reade’s words: “You should be able to have your voice heard without losing your career and losing your job. And that's what your whole mission is about. Why do I not qualify for your mission? Why, because my perpetrator is the leading Democrat? Why does that exempt me from help?""

It’s a fair question. During the Kavanaugh hearings, actresses Moore and Ferrera participated in a PSA thanking Dr. Ford for her testimony of Kavanaugh’s “sexual violence.” Witherspoon tweeted against Kavanaugh. Larson tweeted, “#BelieveSurvivors,” and Washington tweeted, “Women must be heard. Today I am wearing black in solidarity with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. #BelieveSurvivors #TIMESUP #StopKavanaugh.”

Chastain posted her belief that Kavanaugh was the man that “assaulted” Ford and Portman told Variety that Kavanaugh’s appointment demonstrated “how stacked” the system is against women. But what makes Biden so different for these women?

Since Reade’s admonition of these A-listers, TIME’S UP President Tina Tchen has acknowledged the need “for complete transparency into this [Reade’s] claim and the multiple claims against President Donald Trump.” Hmm, sounds like a bit of a qualification there. Tchen also praised Biden’s May 1 denial to MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallce, saying “Today, Vice President Joe Biden sat down and directly addressed the allegation against him with the seriousness it deserves, something that the current president has never done.”

Yeah they sympathize with Reade -- so they say -- but clearly they’re going easy on Biden and will deflect to Trump’s accusation if needs be.

Bette Midler

Bette Midler’s journey from #believeallwomen to #doubtingvictims is another major example of #MeToo hypocrisy. During the Kavanaugh hearings, the Hocus Pocus actress made waves with her radically over-the-top appeal to female victimhood.

Her empathy for Ford was apparently so great that in Sept 2018 she tweeted, “‘Women are the n-word of the world’” -- a reference to a John Lennon and Yoko Ono song. She elaborated with her own words, writing, “Raped, beaten, enslaved, married off, worked like dumb animals; denied education and inheritance; enduring the pain and danger of childbirth and life IN SILENCE for THOUSANDS of years.”

Of course, even Midler recognized that this was a bit extreme, deleting the tweet later. Though without a doubt, Midler had proclaimed that she was a female ally who prided herself on giving assault victims the benefit of the doubt. Well, that is, until the guy running against Trump got hit with his own set of allegations.

Contrary to most of her quiet tinseltown colleagues, Midler attacked Reade’s 2020 allegations head on, accusing her of orchestrating a political hitjob against the man that needed to beat Trump in November. As some news outlets like MSNBC broke the month-long media silence on Reade’s allegations, Midler became annoyed. She tweeted, “Why do the #Dems always twist themselves into pretzels over this shit? We heard Donald Trump say ‘I grab 'em by the pussy!’ and no one made a peep! Didn't seem to hurt him, but we have been paying ever since. Who is paying to #SWIFTBOAT Joe Biden??”

So much for believing victims. It seems she wants their stories buried, at least if we are judging by her Kavanaugh standard. In this case, wasn’t Midler doing her part in making another woman an “n-word of the world?”

Debra Messing

Of course you can’t mention lefty hypocrisy without good ol’ Debra Messing. The Will & Grace actress and sworn enemy of President Trump on Twitter got caught in a bit of #MeToo hot water when she tried to debunk Reade’s assault accusation against the former vice president on May 2. According to Fox News, Messing retweeted to her “635,000 plus” followers a Medium article doubting Reade’s integrity. But annoyed users guilted her into deleting it.

Several users jumped on Messing’s post, asserting that she was “shaming” survivors. Intercept journalist Glenn Greenwald responded with a sarcastic tweet that said, “Gee, I wonder why a woman might be reluctant to come forward with allegations against a powerful male Democratic politician.” Another wrote, “at this point Debra Messing is vying for Alyssa Milano’s position of useful idiot shaming survivors.”

Those charges proved troublesome for Messing who had just revealed a glaring double standard in her #MeToo values. Sure anyone might doubt Reade’s account but Messing had set the precedent that she believed all survivors during the Kavanaugh trial. During that fiasco, Messing tweeted, “We call on Judge Brett Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination immediately. We the people, regardless of political party, will not tolerate a man credibly accused of sexual violence by multiple women as our next Supreme Court Justice. #TIMESUP.”

For Messing, Ford’s mere words were enough to convince her Kavanaugh was a rapist, but Reade’s corroborated evidence against Biden somehow isn’t worth anything. Even Deborah Ramirez’s flimsy claims against Kavanaugh were enough evidence for the actress in 2018.

Other Famous #MeToo Hypocrites

Jimmy Kimmel

Never one to break away from any of the day’s prevailing leftwing talking points, ABC late night host Jimmy Kimmel slammed Brett Kavanaugh during his show in Sept. 2018. The comedian butchered the SCOTUS nominee, saying, “Hear me out on this: So Kavanaugh gets confirmed to the Supreme Court, OK? Well, in return, we get to cut that pesky penis of his off in front of everyone.”

And when it came to Biden’s allegations, Kimmel was soft on the former vice president like the rest of the media. The host took some criticism for not asking Biden a single question about the allegation during their late night interview, which aired after Reade’s bombshell story resurfaced during a Rolling Stone podcast on March 25, 2020.

James Corden

CBS Late Late Show host James Corden made Brett Kavanaugh the brunt of his jokes during his October 4, 2018 broadcast. Corden slammed Kavanaugh as an angry alcoholic, but like Jimmy Kimmel, Corden avoided any controversy with alleged abuser Biden.

Corden interviewed the Democrat presidential candidate during his show on April 21, 2020, but did not mention anything about Biden’s allegations or Tara Reade during the segment. This was nearly a month after Reade’s allegations broke.

John Leguizamo

Ice Age actor John Leguizamo made a ridiculous about-face on his #MeToo politics from Kavanaugh to Biden. During the 2018 SCOTUS hearings, Leguizamo called the judge a “liar” in a facebook post, writing, “I wouldn’t hire Kavanaugh to work shuffleboard court, never mind the Supreme Court. #liarliarpantsonfire.”

However, when Biden’s allegations started gaining traction, Leguizamo, a member of the Biden campaign’s Latin outreach group, took the candidate's side. He jumped on articles that attempted to debunk Biden’s allegations, and shared them via Twitter writing, “Biden is cleared! Tara admitting it wasn’t assault!.” However when the Tara Reade story continued to gain traction, Leguizamo insisted that Reade’s claims be scrutinized more closely and even deflected to Trump’s own allegations.

Why couldn’t he give Kavanaugh the benefit of the doubt?

Jamie Lee Curtis

Halloween and Freaky Friday actress Jamie Lee Curtis scorned Kavanaugh in 2018, posting a mock picture of the U.S. Constitution being shredded on Instagram in response to the Justice’s appointment. She captioned it, saying “Appropriate and concerning. A call to action for us to protect the constitution and try to get the inclusion rider, the ERA added.”

Curtis even blasted Biden for his part in Clarence Thomas’ Supreme Court appointment in 1991. Curtis tweeted in 2019, “Come on @JoeBiden. Just CALL Anita Hill and then GO TO HER HOUSE and APOLOGIZE to her FACE. The longer you wait the worse it gets.”

Though since Reade’s allegation, Curtis hasn’t posted about the subject on either Twitter or Instagram. Could her hands be tied because Joe Biden is most likely the Democrat presidential nominee?

Randi Mayem Singer

Mrs. Doubtfire screenwriter Randi Mayem Singer outed herself as a huge #MeToo hypocrite since the Biden allegations. During the Kavanaugh hearings, Singer tweeted, “Mitch McConnell just stood on the Senate floor and called the women accusing Brett Kavanaugh liars. Somewhere in America a young woman was just sexually attacked. She hears him loud and clear. Vote.”

However, she made no such defense of Reade after her allegations against Biden resurfaced. She actually insinuated that Reade was a political plant, tweeting, “So is Tara Reade/’Jennifer’ trying to impress Vladimir on behalf of Donald Trump/’John Barron’?” When someone called her out for her double standard, she responded, “Men lie. Women lie. People lie. Have always had a problem with a blanket ‘believe’ approach. It devalues true victims. Women must be heard and listened to. I hope she gets the help she needs.”

Singer also shared an article with Twitter on May 11 that rationalized voting for Biden while believing Tara Reade’s allegations. According to the post, beating Trump is more important than punishing Biden for sexual assault, though Singer commented in her tweet that she’s still not convinced by Reade’s claims even though she agrees that Biden must win at all costs.

Sorry, Tara.

Patricia Arquette

Lefty actress Patricia Arquette slammed Kavanaugh back in Sept. 2018, quipping that “The only think[sic] Kavanaugh should Judge are the beers at Octoberfest.” She also agreed with now-disgraced anti-Trump lawyer Michael Avenatti’s claim that the FBI must investigate Judge Kavanaugh over allegations. Arquette responded to Avenatti, lamenting that Kavanaugh’s victims will suffer “the victim blaming and the ‘slut shaming’” from his defenders.

But now that Biden has allegations, Arquette seems to have changed her tune on victims. She deflected from Reade’s allegations to those of Trump assault accusers on April 30, insisting that MSNBC host Christ Hayes focus on those rather than the tough questions he had concerning Biden’s assault.

And on May 2, Arquette tweeted, “Which Tara Reade do you want me to believe? The one who last year said Biden touched her neck and made her feel uncomfortable Or this one?” Is Arquette “shaming” or “victim blaming” on this one?

Amy Schumer and Emily Ratajkowski

Lefty comedian Amy Schumer and supermodel Emily Ratajkowski made waves during the Kavanaugh hearing by getting arrested alongside 300 anti-Kavanaugh protestors. Ratajkowski tweeted Oct. 4, “Today I was arrested protesting the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, a man who has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault. Men who hurt women can no longer be placed in positions of power.”

In a video posted by TPUSA Chief Creative Officer Benny Johnson, Schumer can be seen being asked by police officers whether she had been arrested. The comedian says yes and calmly takes her place in line. The point is, these ladies clearly enjoyed their virtue-signalling for the sake of “believing victims,” however now that a leftwing nominee is accused we haven’t seen these ladies protest his nomination.

Apparently standing up for victims against the left’s only shot at beating Trump is not a good look.

Of course it’s clear that the standard of “#believeallwomen,” -- that all-hallowed #MeToo mantra -- ended up only being a manipulative political weapon used against powerful men the left hated and put away when powerful lefty men were accused. In the end there was no benefit of the doubt for Biden’s accuser, Tara Reade, like there was for Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, or even lamer accusers.

Rose McGowan, an actress, alleged Weinstein abuse victim and one of the few consistent #MeToo activists had the stones to call out this hypocrisy. She blasted Alyssa Milano and other two-faced lefties on April 29, saying, “You are a fraud. This is about holding the media accountable. You go after Trump & Kavanaugh saying Believe Victims, you are a lie.”

McGowan added. “You have always been a lie. The corrupt DNC is in on the smear job of Tara Reade, so are you. SHAME.” McGowan may be on to something, at the very least she’s right about the Hollywood double standard.

Williamson","Adriana Gomez prays outside Our Lady Queen of Angels Catholic Church in Los Angeles , Calif. , on Palm Sunday , April 5 , 2020 . ( Kyle Grillot/Reuters )
How can this crisis time make for deeper living and flourishing ? Try the Liturgy of the Hours .
I ’ ve found that if you ask a sensible priest or nun these days what habit might help for prayer and sanity during quarantine , they tend to say : the Liturgy of the Hours . The Liturgy of the Hours is known as the prayer of the Church . You wake up and you pray . You stop at midday and you pray . In the evening , you pray , and before you go to sleep , too . When you pray night prayer , or compline , you really take a look at your day and ask God to forgive you where you need forgiveness . You can even stop mid-morning and mid-afternoon , if you choose . You live your life , guided by prayer .
It all serves as many beautiful things — including a reminder that there ’ s something more than what we can see ( including Andrew Cuomo ’ s and Donald Trump ’ s next press conference ) . There is something greater , something beyond even the question of when you can stop sheltering in place or of when you and your husband wind up with jobs again . Maybe the busier you are with homeschooling suddenly and somewhat permanently , the more important it is that you find something that isn ’ t simply a numbing agent to be a stable part of your life .
I mention all this because never in my life have I found praying the Liturgy of the Hours more important . I ’ ve been praying it for the better part of a decade now , at least , and while I always find it powerful , maybe I ’ ve never felt so obviously and consistently challenged . There are times in recent days when I want to push back a little . But you really can ’ t for too long . Because the longer you pray , the longer you realize that you really do believe this . The most penetrating-to-the-depths-of-the-soul part of the Liturgy of the Hours tends to be the psalms . And if you read the Book of Psalms at all , you realize that they hit on just about every human emotion . And I can ’ t be the only person experiencing just about every human emotion these days ?
The greatest gift the prayer of the Church has been , over this past week especially , is its encouragement with hope . Easter is really an octave . So every day of the week after Easter Sunday is another Easter . They are solemnities , time for joyous celebration . Now joyous celebration takes a different tone these days — and yet what a need we have for it . To make a commitment to the Liturgy of the Hours is to make a commitment to hope . Each day , these days , it makes you sing “ Alleluia ! ” — even if you are not feeling it . And if you are not feeling it , it is all the more important to sing it . There were definitely days during the week after Easter when I did not want to even think about it . Again , that ’ s probably when it ’ s most important !
My stubbornness in quarantine is consistent with a trend I ’ ve been watching in my own praying of the Liturgy of the Hours and in living in the liturgical life of the Church in recent years . Almost every Good Friday , I don ’ t want to leave Good Friday . I don ’ t want to move past this central reality of the Christian faith : that Jesus died for love of us . That ’ s a life-changing reality — but then so is the whole story . That He was born for us , and that He rose from the dead .

How can this crisis time make for deeper living and flourishing? Try the Liturgy of the Hours.

I’ve found that if you ask a sensible priest or nun these days what habit might help for prayer and sanity during quarantine, they tend to say: the Liturgy of the Hours. The Liturgy of the Hours is known as the prayer of the Church. You wake up and you pray. You stop at midday and you pray. In the evening, you pray, and before you go to sleep, too. When you pray night prayer, or compline, you really take a look at your day and ask God to forgive you where you need forgiveness. You can even stop mid-morning and mid-afternoon, if you choose. You live your life, guided by prayer.

It all serves as many beautiful things — including a reminder that there’s something more than what we can see (including Andrew Cuomo’s and Donald Trump’s next press conference). There is something greater, something beyond even the question of when you can stop sheltering in place or of when you and your husband wind up with jobs again. Maybe the busier you are with homeschooling suddenly and somewhat permanently, the more important it is that you find something that isn’t simply a numbing agent to be a stable part of your life.

I mention all this because never in my life have I found praying the Liturgy of the Hours more important. I’ve been praying it for the better part of a decade now, at least, and while I always find it powerful, maybe I’ve never felt so obviously and consistently challenged. There are times in recent days when I want to push back a little. But you really can’t for too long. Because the longer you pray, the longer you realize that you really do believe this. The most penetrating-to-the-depths-of-the-soul part of the Liturgy of the Hours tends to be the psalms. And if you read the Book of Psalms at all, you realize that they hit on just about every human emotion. And I can’t be the only person experiencing just about every human emotion these days?

The greatest gift the prayer of the Church has been, over this past week especially, is its encouragement with hope. Easter is really an octave. So every day of the week after Easter Sunday is another Easter. They are solemnities, time for joyous celebration. Now joyous celebration takes a different tone these days — and yet what a need we have for it. To make a commitment to the Liturgy of the Hours is to make a commitment to hope. Each day, these days, it makes you sing “Alleluia!” — even if you are not feeling it. And if you are not feeling it, it is all the more important to sing it. There were definitely days during the week after Easter when I did not want to even think about it. Again, that’s probably when it’s most important!

My stubbornness in quarantine is consistent with a trend I’ve been watching in my own praying of the Liturgy of the Hours and in living in the liturgical life of the Church in recent years. Almost every Good Friday, I don’t want to leave Good Friday. I don’t want to move past this central reality of the Christian faith: that Jesus died for love of us. That’s a life-changing reality — but then so is the whole story. That He was born for us, and that He rose from the dead. If you are Christian, these are tenets of faith that can’t ever be a sideshow. These are our identity. This is who our God is, and this is who we are in Him. But every year I feel like those 40 days of Lent are not quite enough. I get to Good Friday and realize that there have been distractions. I get to Good Friday, and I want to spend the rest of my life doing penance for all the thoughtless things I’ve done, all the sins that made clear it wasn’t a crowd two millennia ago that crucified Christ, it was me. That’s devastating when you think about it too long, which is why the Church in her wisdom, as we say, does not keep us there forever. Yes, we should be reflecting on Jesus’s death daily, but the story in its wholeness is crucial.

Reportedly, it was the millennials who put ""Democratic"" Socialist Bernie Sanders to a near dead-heat tie for first in Iowa. (I use scare quotes around ""Democratic"" because as legendary campaign manager James Carville helpfully pointed out to Sean Illing, writing at Vox recently, ""Look, Bernie Sanders isn’t a Democrat.

Per John McCormack at National Review, ""In Iowa, Bernie’s Youth Movement Showed Up While Generation X Flaked Out"":

""According to Iowa entrance polls, voters under 30 comprised 24 percent of the caucus-going electorate — up six points from 2016 and one point better than 2008, when young voters carried Barack Obama to victory.

Yikes! Are our kids turning into a pink tide? Or is their newfound infatuation with socialism just an overblown ""red scare?""

OK, boomers, capitalism has been defamed by its enemies, both ""foreign"" (socialism) and ""domestic"" (cronyism).

As for the latter capitalism has been somewhat traduced and subverted by rich people who game the system that made them rich into making them absurdly richer.

That said, true capitalism is adamant about liberty and justice for all. Capitalism, the real deal, is all about rewarding merit — rewarding those who contribute to the general welfare by making desirable goods and services affordable, and, with that, creating jobs — rather than rewarding status.

A system that rewards people based on their social status is called feudalism. Socialism and cultural Marxism are just lipstick on the pig of feudalism.

Cronyism is mere feudalism too.

As Adam Smith wrote in the original bible of free market capitalism, ""Wealth of Nations,"" Book I, Chapter I, ""It is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people.""

These words serve as the epigram and leitmotif of a recently published book, ""The Capitalist Manifesto,"" of which I am co-author. True capitalism is all about uplifting the poor — as well as workers — as well as the affluent — through the ethical use of their God-given talents.

True Capitalism is, in a word to which the left gives lavish lip service, inclusive.

Bonus! Capitalism (unlike Socialism) has been shown repeatedly to actually work in practice. Imperfectly, to be sure, but better than everything else ever tried.

If the economy is not working to uplift the poor, making working people financially secure with dignity, and supporting the ecology of the planet, it’s not real Capitalism. It’s just some big business interest culturally appropriating our Capitalist brand. Adam Smith foresaw this too. He called it mercantilism. It was and is antithetical to free markets.

So, go easy, millennials. Real capitalism, not socialism, would power your way out of student debt and your childhood bedroom in your parent's house. The cure for your, and our, current doldrums is to replace the current faux capitalism with the real deal.

Meanwhile, oh my friends and dear old anticommunist comrades-in-arms, please go easy on the millennials. This is an age-old phenomenon.

Witness, yet again, youthful idealism and sweet naïveté at play.

This is not the the decline and fall of western civilization.

Per Quote Investigator:

""An excited supporter burst into the private chambers of the old tiger Clemenceau one day and cried, 'Your son has just joined the Communist Party.' Clemenceau regarded his visitor calmly and remarked, 'Monsieur, my son is 22 years old. If he had not become a Communist at 22, I would have disowned him. If he is still a Communist at 30, I will do it then.'""

I am the vastly right-wing father of four wonderful children. My beloved daughters Jessica and Sarah are delightfully apolitical. My beloved 21-year-old son David is (last I heard) infatuated with Bernie. If he were not, I’d disown him. My beloved 32-year old son Michael is out canvassing for Mayor Pete, a social democrat not a ""Democratic"" Socialist.

No need to disown him, either. (A raised eyebrow will suffice.)

A youthful flirtation with socialism is endearing, not threatening, and is a tradition.

Socialism offers a wonderful, if inevitably heartbreaking, romantic fling.

For happily ever after? Bring on capitalism.

The Seattle Police Department received 614 calls in the last two weeks — 22 percent more than average rate . Domestic violence prevention organizations in Boston warn of an increase in cases .

With the economy tanking and families locked together because of stay-at-home orders to combat the spread of the coronavirus pandemic , domestic violence rates appear to be soaring . This requires an urgent response : States should immediately order the closures of liquor stores . They can reopen when home isolation is no longer needed .
No question that confinement of families , sudden demands to oversee home schooling , precipitous job loss , and worry over an invisible viral predator are the ingredients of a toxic domestic brew . But alcohol is what turns it into a second invisible public health crisis .
Most adults drink rarely or not at all . Just 10 percent of adults account for 75 percent of all alcohol sold , consuming 10 or more drinks per day . That kind of excessive use impairs judgment , engenders anger agitation and dysphoria , and can lead to violent behavior .
Reducing access to alcohol during the crisis will reduce the frequency of home violence . Finland ’ s liquor store employee strike in the 1970s as well as Sweden ’ s curtailment of liquor store sales on certain days in the 1980s , both had that effect . South Dakota imposed twice daily sobriety breathalyzer checks for individuals with multiple arrests for drunk driving last decade . That worked too . Not only did drunk driving rates fall , but so did calls for domestic violence — both by about 10 percent .
These data could support curtailing liquor sales at any time , and reducing domestic violence was one of the motivations for the temperance movement a century ago . But our response to the coronavirus pandemic itself is what makes this move appropriate now and for the duration of home isolation , as the isolation frustrates an array of safeguards we have in place to identify domestic abuse in the first place .
Victims are often identified through contact with professionals outside the home . I learned this firsthand as a third-year medical student in the 1990s . I evaluated a two-year-old boy with leg pain , which an X-ray revealed as a spiral fracture of the femur . This fracture rarely occurs other than as a consequence of a beating , and the boy ’ s belligerent and intoxicated father was arrested three hours later . This all took place in a hospital nestled in a tony enclave of Minneapolis .
Health care workers of all stripes and in most states are required to report suspected domestic abuse of both children and adults . In schools , teachers , counselors , social workers , and nurses are often trained to identify abused children , and most states require them to report what they uncover .
Telemedicine visits are replacing in person contact between health care workers and patients . The new classroom is a Google hangout . Video encounters leave the victims in the homes with their abuser and provide none of the privacy or perception that in-person consultation affords . Calls to domestic violence support lines require privacy as well , although text chat is an increasingly available silent alternative .
Alcoholics Anonymous rapidly moved meetings online , but the reality is that access to a private setting and the Internet are prerequisites to participation and not universal among its members . Yet a recent analysis found that AA is the most effective means to help people stay sober . One of the authors of that report , Keith Humphreys of Stanford University , put the problem plainly to me : “ When supports for sobriety are low and alcohol supply is high , more people get intoxicated and inflict harm on themselves and their families. “
The cascading effects of domestic violence also exacerbate the pandemic . Each house call by police or paramedics is another opportunity for the disease to spread . It consumes time and personal protective equipment that are in desperately short supply . Any preventable visit to the emergency room chokes off that bottlenecked resource . And even trips to the liquor store are an avoidable reason for people to come into contact under stay at home orders .
Banning alcohol sales , even temporarily , will come at some cost . Liquor stores will close . Many who enjoy a glass of wine at dinner will have to forgo that pleasure for a few weeks or months . I can give up my occasionally “ quarantini ” with a twist . And we can all give up the alcohol during our Zoom happy hours .
With liquor stores closed , many people addicted to alcohol will have to endure the physical effects of withdrawal . For most , it lasts days and is deeply unpleasant . For about 5 percent , it can be life threatening without medical care . Doctors will need to be on the lookout for patients who may be in need of extensive assistance . The treatments for withdrawal are well known , widely available , and effective .
Even with these possible downsides , the benefits to domestic violence victims and potential victims whom we have few other ways of helping through this crisis should be our priority .
Peter B. Bach is a physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York City .","The Fresno sheriff’s department filed 77 percent more domestic violence reports two weeks ago than three weeks ago. The Seattle Police Department received 614 calls in the last two weeks — 22 percent more than average rate. Domestic violence prevention organizations in Boston warn of an increase in cases.

No question that confinement of families, sudden demands to oversee home schooling, precipitous job loss, and worry over an invisible viral predator are the ingredients of a toxic domestic brew. But alcohol is what turns it into a second invisible public health crisis.

Most adults drink rarely or not at all. Just 10 percent of adults account for 75 percent of all alcohol sold, consuming 10 or more drinks per day. That kind of excessive use impairs judgment, engenders anger agitation and dysphoria, and can lead to violent behavior.

Reducing access to alcohol during the crisis will reduce the frequency of home violence. Finland’s liquor store employee strike in the 1970s as well as Sweden’s curtailment of liquor store sales on certain days in the 1980s, both had that effect. South Dakota imposed twice daily sobriety breathalyzer checks for individuals with multiple arrests for drunk driving last decade. That worked too. Not only did drunk driving rates fall, but so did calls for domestic violence — both by about 10 percent.

These data could support curtailing liquor sales at any time, and reducing domestic violence was one of the motivations for the temperance movement a century ago. But our response to the coronavirus pandemic itself is what makes this move appropriate now and for the duration of home isolation, as the isolation frustrates an array of safeguards we have in place to identify domestic abuse in the first place.

Victims are often identified through contact with professionals outside the home. I learned this firsthand as a third-year medical student in the 1990s. I evaluated a two-year-old boy with leg pain, which an X-ray revealed as a spiral fracture of the femur. This fracture rarely occurs other than as a consequence of a beating, and the boy’s belligerent and intoxicated father was arrested three hours later. This all took place in a hospital nestled in a tony enclave of Minneapolis.

Health care workers of all stripes and in most states are required to report suspected domestic abuse of both children and adults. In schools, teachers, counselors, social workers, and nurses are often trained to identify abused children, and most states require them to report what they uncover.

Telemedicine visits are replacing in person contact between health care workers and patients. The new classroom is a Google hangout. Video encounters leave the victims in the homes with their abuser and provide none of the privacy or perception that in-person consultation affords. Calls to domestic violence support lines require privacy as well, although text chat is an increasingly available silent alternative.

Alcoholics Anonymous rapidly moved meetings online, but the reality is that access to a private setting and the Internet are prerequisites to participation and not universal among its members. Yet a recent analysis found that AA is the most effective means to help people stay sober. One of the authors of that report, Keith Humphreys of Stanford University, put the problem plainly to me: “When supports for sobriety are low and alcohol supply is high, more people get intoxicated and inflict harm on themselves and their families.“

The cascading effects of domestic violence also exacerbate the pandemic. Each house call by police or paramedics is another opportunity for the disease to spread. It consumes time and personal protective equipment that are in desperately short supply. Any preventable visit to the emergency room chokes off that bottlenecked resource. And even trips to the liquor store are an avoidable reason for people to come into contact under stay at home orders.

Banning alcohol sales, even temporarily, will come at some cost. Liquor stores will close. Many who enjoy a glass of wine at dinner will have to forgo that pleasure for a few weeks or months. I can give up my occasionally “quarantini” with a twist. And we can all give up the alcohol during our Zoom happy hours.

With liquor stores closed, many people addicted to alcohol will have to endure the physical effects of withdrawal. For most, it lasts days and is deeply unpleasant. For about 5 percent, it can be life threatening without medical care. Doctors will need to be on the lookout for patients who may be in need of extensive assistance. The treatments for withdrawal are well known, widely available, and effective.

Even with these possible downsides, the benefits to domestic violence victims and potential victims whom we have few other ways of helping through this crisis should be our priority.

According to Donatone , we can not know , because , `` We do n't have the data on what millennials will be like when they ’ re 40 .

A decade before America 's own catastrophic Great Recession , the economies of South Korea , Thailand and Japan experienced collapse ( and subsequent long-term recession ) , commonly known as the `` East Asia Crisis . '' Its causes should sound eerily familiar to any American : Massive market deregulation led to a huge infusion of capital in assets like real estate .

It was so hard on them that eventually they became known as the `` freeters . '' In a phenomenal article for the Atlantic , Ethan Devine paints a stunning picture of modern-day Japan from the perspective of these freeters , and those who 've grown up in the intervening years . And according to Levine , one of the most notable consequences of the `` Lost Decade '' on the freeter generation has been a mental health crisis of epic proportions :
The first freeters are now in their late 30s and early 40s . Almost one-third do not hold regular jobs , and some never have . One-fifth still live with their parents . This perpetual failure to launch has taken a psychological toll . Aging freeters file six of every 10 mental-health insurance claims .

If Japan is a reasonable model for our current predicament , Donatone should n't be so surprised that she 's seeing an uptick in college students reporting mental health problems , though she may regret not waiting a bit longer before declaring unequivocally that `` helicopter parents '' are primarily to blame . Furthermore , if the recent history of Japan can serve as a guide for the future of our own country , it 's especially important that we take the mental health issues of millennials seriously , while also attempting to confront the underlying economic problems that we face . Twenty years ago , young people in Japan were never given the opportunity to build productive , stable lives for themselves and their families . Devine cautions that the consequences of a `` Lost Generation '' could extend for years to come :
No one knows why Japan ’ s economy never fully recovered , but some economists are starting to trace the problem to young people ... who can not find good jobs , don ’ t learn new skills , and neither earn nor spend enough to help get the economy moving . That generational problem , while far more advanced in Japan , is not unlike our own .
And according to Devine , these economic problems started to become self-reinforcing :
What is most alarming is that things keep getting worse for subsequent generations . Today , more than 20 years after Japan ’ s bubble burst , youth unemployment is higher than ever . Only half of working 15-to-24-year-olds have regular jobs , and another 10 percent are unemployed . The rest are “ nonregulars. ” Somewhat akin to temp positions in the U.S. , Japan ’ s nonregular jobs pay half as much as regular jobs , offer few benefits , and can be eliminated on a whim—which they often are . The portion of young Japanese working as nonregulars exploded in the mid-1990s and has marched upward ever since .
It 's unfortunate that Brooke Donatone was n't aware of the context that Devine 's article provides before she made her anecdotal , unsubstantiated claims about an entire generation . If she had , she might have realized that the practical economic problems we face are n't just window dressing that threaten our fragile self-esteem .

Resignations were demanded.

But all three hunkered down, and the crisis abated. Now a new cultural issue has emerged.

First-term Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton, from the D.C. suburbs, has denounced Virginia's representation in the U.S. Capitol by statues of George Washington in the Rotunda and Robert E. Lee in the crypt a floor below.

Both statues have represented Virginia for more than a century.

Wexton wants Lee replaced by an African American hero from a list that she and Rep. A. Donald McEachin reportedly submitted.

Two names on their list are unfamiliar figures from the desegregation days of the 1950s. The third is better known: Nat Turner.

In ""The Americans: A Social History of the United States,"" published in 1969, author J. C. Furnas describes the deeds of the man Wexton and McEachin would be pleased to see replace Robert E. Lee:

""In August 1831, Nat Turner, paranoid slave preacher and cunjur man, led his superstition-fuddled followers to kill fifty-five whites of all sexes and ages in an aimless terrorizing of Southhampton County in the southeastern corner of Virginia.

""The poor twisted creature could hardly have found a worse time to sharpen Southern fears of a slave rising."" Turner was tried and hanged and, that winter, writes Furnas, ""The Virginia legislature voted down by a narrow margin a bill for gradual extinction of slavery.""

Nat Turner's terrorism had set back emancipation.

Let me go out on a limb: If the Virginia General Assembly votes to replace Robert E. Lee in the U.S. Capitol with a statue of Nat Turner, it will not be the unifying event Wexton imagines.

But the Assembly will be dealing soon with measures even more volatile.

After the enthusiasm around Barack Obama ’ s election to the presidency in 2008—and with the 15-year gap between Y2K and now—it ’ s easy to forget just how hopeless things felt at the turn of the millennium .

After the enthusiasm around Barack Obama’s election to the presidency in 2008—and with the 15-year gap between Y2K and now—it’s easy to forget just how hopeless things felt at the turn of the millennium. The frenzied anticipation for Y2K—distinctly manic in its tone—ended up being pretty anticlimactic; 2000 wasn’t the future, it just sounded like it. The political landscape was marked by bitterness and scandal on both sides of the aisle; the year before, in Colorado, the Columbine massacre ushered in what is now a depressingly familiar phenomenon: the American mass shooting. It was an era of bad pop music and brick-like cellphones, distinctive for its glitzy, superficial marketing of the future and slow destruction of that same future with gas-guzzling SUVs.

Is this a damning reflection on society?

The answer is a categorical yes.

For over 800 years, Notre Dame has been a symbol of France’s history, both in a literal and metaphorical sense. The eerie construction has served as the scene of major events in history, and as a haven of inestimable heritage. However, even if we exhaust the English language by paying homage to the Gothic structure in a whole host of ways, Notre Dame is just a building. A building of great prestige, I concede. Nevertheless, it is just a building.

In Sri Lanka, people died, hundreds of them, and the world barely blinked. Why?

We live in a consumer culture, one built on a foundation of things.

Our entire economic and social system appears to revolves around the notion of aspirational acquisitions— the idea that a better ‘you’ can be bought. It doesn’t really matter what you buy. It can be a new car or a new coffee machine. Just buy. Don’t have the cash? It doesn’t matter; just stick it on the credit card. Modern society appears to rests on the notion that, no matter what, acquiring things is all that really matters. Eat, sleep, buy, repeat.

Is it an exaggeration to think that millions of us love things — like our smartphones — more than actual people?

I don’t think so. Consumerism is a transcendent religion. Apple and Amazon are the Gods we bow to. By focusing individuals on the deification of consumption, consumer culture fosters narcissistic personalities and behaviors.

Narcissists generally display high levels of arrogance; they are deeply concerned with issues of personal competence, the pursuit of power and prestige, often to compensate for feelings of inner emptiness and diminished self-worth.

The desire for external validation is totally compatible with the idea of materialistic wealth, as both are heavily motivated by the praise of others. In fact, research suggests that materialistic values are fueled by feelings of insecurity. A 2002 study published in the journal Psychology and Marketing found that those who regularly doubt themselves and their own self-worth tend to be more acquisitive.

Consumerism capitalizes on an individual’s insecurities. It leads society down a path that equates purchases with the idea of self- improvement and social mobility. As a dynamic cultural force, consumerism appeals to us at a base level. Want a better life? Want more respect? Want more friends? Well, material possesions can help.

This brings me back to Notre Dame, which was and still is a material possession. State owned, the now badly damaged building is just another thing. A notable thing, but still just a thing. Again, hundreds of people died in Sri Lanka — people, not things. Why are so many quick to lament the loss of a building but not the loss of life?

Daum , a student at Woods Cross High School in Utah , became the target of the progressive social media mob when she wore a qipao , a dress whose roots are grounded in China , which set off the snowflake brigade . Daum found herself being accused of cultural appropriation . Yeah , we ’ re back to this crowd again . She was looking for something unique to wear , she wasn ’ t mocking Chinese culture , and to her credit , she would do it again knowing the consequences of her fashion choice .
Jeremy Lam was the person who appears to have set off the firestorm .
“ I 'm proud of my culture , including the extreme barriers marginalized people within that culture have had to overcome those obstacles . For it to simply be subject to American consumerism and cater to a white audience , is parallel to colonial ideology , ” he explained in a Twitter thread .
My culture is NOT your goddamn prom dress . https : //t.co/vhkNOPevKD — Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 27 , 2018
The qipao was originally a loose dress/garment without shape , made for Chinese women to clean the house and do other domestic chores with . — Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 28 , 2018
It was then altered and embroidered as a beautiful form-fitting outfit to wear publically , which Chinese women were not allowed to do at during the times of extreme patriarchal oppression . — Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 28 , 2018
In a time where Asian women were silenced they were able to create , not only a piece of art but a symbol of activism . This piece of clothing embraced femininity , confidence , and gender equality through its beautiful , eye-catching appearance . — Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 28 , 2018
It even broke the division of financial classes ! It could be made with high-quality materials that only the upper class could afford such as special silks and linens , but a dress just as beautiful could have been made with just cotton and low-quality linen . — Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 28 , 2018
Femme factory workers wore this dress ! ! ! And the style was then spread throughout Asian as a beautiful garment and sign of women 's liberation . — Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 28 , 2018
I 'm proud of my culture , including the extreme barriers marginalized people within that culture have had to overcome those obstacles . For it to simply be subject to American consumerism and cater to a white audience , is parallel to colonial ideology . — Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 28 , 2018
He then gave himself a pat on the back for starting this discussion on race :
1 . I ’ ve been incredibly blessed for the opportunity to have sparked such an interesting and polarizing conversation on race relations in the status quo . — Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 29 , 2018
2 . I apologize if any of the interactions you ’ ve had on here have been negative and insensitive . I apologize if I have hurt you ’ re feelings . I will not apologize , however , for voicing my concerns and beliefs . I owe it to myself , family and friends to express my opinions . — Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 29 , 2018
3 . In this period of time , I have experienced the most blatant and outward forms of racial backlash in my life . That if I hate America , and its values of being a mixing pot of culture , that I should just leave . This is not specific to me or my experience either , it ’ s common . — Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 29 , 2018
4 . Having an immigrant background , I can say Im blessed to live in the US . But this doesn ’ t mean that it ’ s without its issues . If those who try to make the US better thru a critical lense are told to just go back to their countries , how do we progress as an inclusive society ? — Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 29 , 2018
5 . I realize that what was conveyed could ’ ve been interpreted as speaking for others , and I ’ m sorry if I made you feel that way . When I say “ My culture ” that is exactly what I mean . My racial experience isn ’ t definitive of other experiences . But I ’ m tired of hiding mine . — Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 29 , 2018
6 . Whether or not people agree with me I will stand for what I believe , because I feel in my heart that it ’ s right . I won ’ t be boxed in with the confines of the model minority stereotype . If I feel disrespected , I will tell you . I will stay angry , I will stay resilient . — Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 29 , 2018
Yeah , here ’ s the thing . This whole argument about cultural appropriation is crap . It ’ s just a way for the most left wing of left-wingers to keep themselves trapped in a glass case of emotion . As a Korean-American , I ’ m a member of the larger Asian community and I couldn ’ t care less what Daum wore at prom . I do hope she had a great time besides the total losers who try to find white , neo-colonialism in every aspect of life . You weren ’ t there . You don ’ t know this girl . What the hell is this ? David French had more on this insanity :
If you ’ re a normal human being , like the majority of Americans who saw their Instagram , Facebook , and Twitter feeds fill up with prom pictures last weekend , you thought that was a pretty girl in a pretty dress . Nothing more . But if you ’ re a toxic social-justice warrior , you saw something else . You saw oppression . You saw exploitation . You saw bigotry . You saw — gasp — “ cultural appropriation. ” The dress , you see , had obvious Asian influences , and Daum isn ’ t Asian : Daum , to her immense credit , has weathered the shamestorm without backing down . She says simply that she bought the dress because she thought it was “ beautiful ” and she “ admired the beauty of the culture. ” So , that ’ s the story . Here ’ s why it matters : It ’ s indicative of how the people who care the most about identity and oppression are seized by rage and unreason . And because cultures are shaped and defined by those who care the most , Daum ’ s story is not just a Twitter story ; it ’ s increasingly the American story .

Yes , there are times where one 's culture is mocked through a vicious and racist lens . Yes , that happens . It did n't happen here .","It was supposed to be a fun night for Keziah Daum—and maybe that was still the case—but it soon turned into Outrage Theater. Daum, a student at Woods Cross High School in Utah, became the target of the progressive social media mob when she wore a qipao, a dress whose roots are grounded in China, which set off the snowflake brigade. Daum found herself being accused of cultural appropriation. Yeah, we’re back to this crowd again. She was looking for something unique to wear, she wasn’t mocking Chinese culture, and to her credit, she would do it again knowing the consequences of her fashion choice.

Jeremy Lam was the person who appears to have set off the firestorm.

“I'm proud of my culture, including the extreme barriers marginalized people within that culture have had to overcome those obstacles. For it to simply be subject to American consumerism and cater to a white audience, is parallel to colonial ideology,” he explained in a Twitter thread.

My culture is NOT your goddamn prom dress. https://t.co/vhkNOPevKD — Jeremy Lam (@jere_bare) April 27, 2018

Unrelated Fun Fact (a thread):

The qipao was originally a loose dress/garment without shape, made for Chinese women to clean the house and do other domestic chores with. — Jeremy Lam (@jere_bare) April 28, 2018

It was then altered and embroidered as a beautiful form-fitting outfit to wear publically, which Chinese women were not allowed to do at during the times of extreme patriarchal oppression. — Jeremy Lam (@jere_bare) April 28, 2018

In a time where Asian women were silenced they were able to create, not only a piece of art but a symbol of activism. This piece of clothing embraced femininity, confidence, and gender equality through its beautiful, eye-catching appearance. — Jeremy Lam (@jere_bare) April 28, 2018

It even broke the division of financial classes! It could be made with high-quality materials that only the upper class could afford such as special silks and linens, but a dress just as beautiful could have been made with just cotton and low-quality linen. — Jeremy Lam (@jere_bare) April 28, 2018

Femme factory workers wore this dress!!! And the style was then spread throughout Asian as a beautiful garment and sign of women's liberation. — Jeremy Lam (@jere_bare) April 28, 2018

In short:

I'm proud of my culture, including the extreme barriers marginalized people within that culture have had to overcome those obstacles. For it to simply be subject to American consumerism and cater to a white audience, is parallel to colonial ideology. — Jeremy Lam (@jere_bare) April 28, 2018

He then gave himself a pat on the back for starting this discussion on race:

1. I’ve been incredibly blessed for the opportunity to have sparked such an interesting and polarizing conversation on race relations in the status quo. — Jeremy Lam (@jere_bare) April 29, 2018

2. I apologize if any of the interactions you’ve had on here have been negative and insensitive. I apologize if I have hurt you’re feelings. I will not apologize, however, for voicing my concerns and beliefs. I owe it to myself, family and friends to express my opinions. — Jeremy Lam (@jere_bare) April 29, 2018

3. In this period of time, I have experienced the most blatant and outward forms of racial backlash in my life. That if I hate America, and its values of being a mixing pot of culture, that I should just leave. This is not specific to me or my experience either, it’s common. — Jeremy Lam (@jere_bare) April 29, 2018

4. Having an immigrant background, I can say Im blessed to live in the US. But this doesn’t mean that it’s without its issues. If those who try to make the US better thru a critical lense are told to just go back to their countries, how do we progress as an inclusive society? — Jeremy Lam (@jere_bare) April 29, 2018

5. I realize that what was conveyed could’ve been interpreted as speaking for others, and I’m sorry if I made you feel that way. When I say “My culture” that is exactly what I mean. My racial experience isn’t definitive of other experiences. But I’m tired of hiding mine. — Jeremy Lam (@jere_bare) April 29, 2018

6. Whether or not people agree with me I will stand for what I believe, because I feel in my heart that it’s right. I won’t be boxed in with the confines of the model minority stereotype. If I feel disrespected, I will tell you. I will stay angry, I will stay resilient. — Jeremy Lam (@jere_bare) April 29, 2018

Yeah, here’s the thing. This whole argument about cultural appropriation is crap. It’s just a way for the most left wing of left-wingers to keep themselves trapped in a glass case of emotion. As a Korean-American, I’m a member of the larger Asian community and I couldn’t care less what Daum wore at prom. I do hope she had a great time besides the total losers who try to find white, neo-colonialism in every aspect of life. You weren’t there. You don’t know this girl. What the hell is this? David French had more on this insanity:

If you’re a normal human being, like the majority of Americans who saw their Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter feeds fill up with prom pictures last weekend, you thought that was a pretty girl in a pretty dress. Nothing more. But if you’re a toxic social-justice warrior, you saw something else. You saw oppression. You saw exploitation. You saw bigotry. You saw — gasp — “cultural appropriation.” The dress, you see, had obvious Asian influences, and Daum isn’t Asian: Daum, to her immense credit, has weathered the shamestorm without backing down. She says simply that she bought the dress because she thought it was “beautiful” and she “admired the beauty of the culture.” So, that’s the story. Here’s why it matters: It’s indicative of how the people who care the most about identity and oppression are seized by rage and unreason. And because cultures are shaped and defined by those who care the most, Daum’s story is not just a Twitter story; it’s increasingly the American story. Let’s take the concept of “cultural appropriation.” It’s absurd down to its very definition. Susan Scafidi, author of Who Owns Culture? Appropriation and Authenticity in American Law, defines it like this: Taking intellectual property, traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, or artifacts from someone else’s culture without permission. This can include unauthorized use of another culture’s dance, dress, music, language, folklore, cuisine, traditional medicine, religious symbols, etc. It’s most likely to be harmful when the source community is a minority group that has been oppressed or exploited in other ways or when the object of appropriation is particularly sensitive, e.g. sacred objects. In a multi-ethnic, multi-racial culture like America’s, the potential for offense is unlimited. (Moreover, who, exactly, is empowered to grant “permission” to wear clothing, cook food, or use language? Is there a central registry?

We pride ourselves in being a melting pot of culture. Anyone can be an American. Anyone can become an American. It’s a rich blend of cultures, whereas Asians are mostly homogenous societies. That’s not to say anything is wrong with that; it’s just how they are. But our nation’s strength is grounded in the diversity of our people. I agree with French; we need permission to eat at a Mexican restaurant? Do I need to send a request to the Italian embassy to eat at Filomena in Georgetown?

A designer friend made this #qipao for me.

Politicians in the US state of Mississippi have passed a resolution to replace the state flag with one without the Confederate emblem.

Mississippi is the last state in the US to feature the emblem on its flag.

The flag was originally used by the slave-owning states that lost the US Civil War (1861-65).

On Sunday, the measure passed in both chambers of the Mississippi legislature: in the House of Representatives by a margin of 91-23, and then in the Senate by a majority of 37-14.

Senators reportedly cheered when the results were announced.

Lawmakers voted in favour of proposing the bill on Saturday.

Mr Reeves, who had previously said that he would not veto a bill - but did not publicly back it, said on Saturday that ""if they send me a bill this weekend, I will sign it"".

culture,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/26/7451641/interview-box-office,The Interview made $1 million on Christmas Day,2014-12-26,"Emily Todd Vanderwerff, Umair Irfan, Nicole Narea, Terry Nguyen, German Lopez, Alissa Wilkinson, Constance Grady","The Interview made just over $ 1 million at the box office Thursday , for a per-screen average of $ 3,142 from its 331 theaters . Assuming normal box office erosion , it will likely make it to $ 3 million in traditional ticket sales by the end of Christmas weekend .
At first blush , that number seems pretty good . Making $ 1 million in a single day , on so few screens , is definitely an accomplishment . And the per-screen average is n't bad either . The film finished 15th in overall sales on the day , but it finishes seventh in per-screen average , with three of the films coming in ahead of it — Selma , American Sniper , and the Indian import PK — playing on fewer screens . ( Releasing a film to a handful of theaters first , to build excitement and hopefully reap high box office from just those theaters , is a time-honored strategy for Oscar contenders like Selma and American Sniper . )
You also have to consider that Sony has simultaneously released the film to Video On Demand , where it has been among the top sellers for YouTube and Google Play . Of course , we do n't get traditional box office figures for those sellers , just as we rarely get hard numbers for DVD sales . So we ca n't know if The Interview has sold 1 million downloads or one dozen .
The embattled film was pulled from release after major theater chains refused to show it in the wake of terrorist threats directed against it by the hackers who broke into the computer system of Sony Pictures , the film 's studio . Sony reversed course on Tuesday , releasing the film to independent theaters , most notably Texas 's small Alamo Drafthouse chain .
The question , then , is if the $ 1 million number is good or disappointing . The film cost $ 44 million to make , and no matter how good the VOD numbers are , it seems highly unlikely to make back its budget ( to say nothing of marketing ) . Sony will still take a substantial write-off on the film .
Plus , films in limited release have pulled much , much better per-screen averages , even this year . The Grand Budapest Hotel , for instance , made over $ 55,000 per theater in its opening weekend , from just 66 theaters . Its opening weekend total was $ 3.6 million , a number The Interview probably has no hope of hitting . From that point of view , the number is disappointing .
But from another point of view , that $ 1 million is pretty good , all things considered . Yes , hackers , presumably backed by North Korea , gave the film a surprising amount of publicity , that could have translated into stealth marketing .
But it 's also important to note that the film was already entering a crowded marketplace where it seemed likely to play also-ran to a bunch of far more high-profile openings , like war film Unbroken and musical adaptation Into the Woods , both of which made over $ 15 million yesterday . Even if that $ 1 million number is a little low , the movie 's return from the dead was so last minute that it was in the upper realm of numbers it could reasonably hope to obtain . Now the question is if the film will have any legs going forward .","The Interview made just over $1 million at the box office Thursday, for a per-screen average of $3,142 from its 331 theaters. Assuming normal box office erosion, it will likely make it to $3 million in traditional ticket sales by the end of Christmas weekend.

At first blush, that number seems pretty good. Making $1 million in a single day, on so few screens, is definitely an accomplishment. And the per-screen average isn't bad either. The film finished 15th in overall sales on the day, but it finishes seventh in per-screen average, with three of the films coming in ahead of it — Selma, American Sniper, and the Indian import PK — playing on fewer screens. (Releasing a film to a handful of theaters first, to build excitement and hopefully reap high box office from just those theaters, is a time-honored strategy for Oscar contenders like Selma and American Sniper.)

You also have to consider that Sony has simultaneously released the film to Video On Demand, where it has been among the top sellers for YouTube and Google Play. Of course, we don't get traditional box office figures for those sellers, just as we rarely get hard numbers for DVD sales. So we can't know if The Interview has sold 1 million downloads or one dozen.

The embattled film was pulled from release after major theater chains refused to show it in the wake of terrorist threats directed against it by the hackers who broke into the computer system of Sony Pictures, the film's studio. Sony reversed course on Tuesday, releasing the film to independent theaters, most notably Texas's small Alamo Drafthouse chain.

The question, then, is if the $1 million number is good or disappointing. The film cost $44 million to make, and no matter how good the VOD numbers are, it seems highly unlikely to make back its budget (to say nothing of marketing). Sony will still take a substantial write-off on the film.

Plus, films in limited release have pulled much, much better per-screen averages, even this year. The Grand Budapest Hotel, for instance, made over $55,000 per theater in its opening weekend, from just 66 theaters. Its opening weekend total was $3.6 million, a number The Interview probably has no hope of hitting. From that point of view, the number is disappointing.

But from another point of view, that $1 million is pretty good, all things considered. Yes, hackers, presumably backed by North Korea, gave the film a surprising amount of publicity, that could have translated into stealth marketing.

But it's also important to note that the film was already entering a crowded marketplace where it seemed likely to play also-ran to a bunch of far more high-profile openings, like war film Unbroken and musical adaptation Into the Woods, both of which made over $15 million yesterday. Even if that $1 million number is a little low, the movie's return from the dead was so last minute that it was in the upper realm of numbers it could reasonably hope to obtain. Now the question is if the film will have any legs going forward.",www.vox.com,left,xWanQu677X19v9FG

What’s happening

In the dictionary, the word essential has a simple definition. Merriam-Webster defines essential as an adjective meaning “of the utmost importance.”

The coronavirus outbreak is proving that, in practice, deciding what’s essential is much more complicated. States and cities across America have mandated that all nonessential businesses close to help stem the spread of the virus. The bulk of the exceptions to these restrictions are clearly of “utmost importance”: hospitals, pharmacies, grocery stores, etc. The lists vary from place to place, with some surprising businesses being allowed to remain open.

Two of the most debated businesses that have been deemed essential in some places are marijuana dispensaries and gun shops. Several states have allowed all pot retailers to stay open, while others are allowing sales only for medicinal use. Gun stores have been shuttered in a handful of states, and in others they have been allowed to stay open. The federal government recently added gun stores to its list of critical services, but the decision is ultimately up to individual states.

Why there’s debate

Recreational marijuana is legal in 11 states and Washington, D.C., albeit sometimes with restrictions on commercial sales. In those states, advocates say cannabis products provide relief for people with a long list of conditions, including anxiety, depression and other mental health issues that could be triggered by the stress of the pandemic.

These advocates argue that limiting sales only to medical marijuana could mean those who lack the resources to get a prescription will go without treatment for an indeterminate amount of time. Others argue that closing legal pot vendors would open a market for illegal drug dealers who could be coronavirus superspreaders.

Beyond the typical criticism of legalized marijuana, some medical experts say it may be dangerous to promote use of smokable products at the same time that a virus causing severe respiratory illness is being spread through the population.

Gun rights supporters say closing firearms retailers violates their Second Amendment freedoms. Though states appear to be on sound legal ground in shutting down the shops, that could change if the closures are challenged in court, experts say.

Others say citizens should have the right to buy guns to protect themselves should police forces experience any disruption because of the pandemic. Like marijuana, there are also concerns that shutting down legal retailers could lead to guns being sold on the black market without proper tracking or background checks.

Critics say guns aren’t necessary to carry out social distancing protocols, and allowing people to stock up on weapons out of fear risks escalating the country’s already pervasive gun violence problem. “We don’t live in the Wild West, where people are dependent on guns for food,” the mayor of San Jose, Calif., said when ordering all gun stores shuttered.

What’s next

As the virus spreads across the country, new states may be forced to wrangle with the question of what to do about marijuana and gun sellers in the near future. The National Rifle Association has filed a lawsuit challenging California’s gun store closures that could inform decisions by other governors, depending on how it is decided.

Marijuana

Marijuana is necessary treatment for a variety of mental health conditions

“There’s a great number of people with conditions like anxiety who medicate those conditions with cannabis. And a lot of folks are going to be suffering heightened degrees of anxiety and other types of emotional disruption given everything that's going on.” — Steve DeAngelo, marijuana dispensary owner, to ABC News

Closing dispensaries will lead to unsafe illegal sales

“Not surprisingly, black-market pot dealers have also been doing a brisk business during the crisis, and unlike legal sellers, they feel little need to abide by official orders.” — Dan Levin, New York Times

Smoking marijuana presents unknown health risks

“Some medical experts question the wisdom of allowing uninhibited access to marijuana during a massive public health crisis.

What it’s like to move into your parents’ basement — as a functionally employed adult.

I have spent most of the past three weeks underground.

Fortunately, that is not because I am a sick man (at least not from the coronavirus), or a spiteful man (well, most of the time), or an unattractive man (no comment). These are the three attributes the twisted first-person narrator of Dostoevsky’s Notes from Underground gives himself in its opening lines.

In early March, fearing the worst of New York’s then-nascent coronavirus outbreak, I left the city and returned to my childhood home in a southwest-Ohio suburb.

Many years ago, they gave my childhood bed away, leaving my bedroom a repository of my past’s accumulated detritus. (Stay away, Marie Kondo.) And though there were other bedrooms for me to use in this long-empty nest, I opted for the dark, quiet, basement guest room on my first night back. And you know what? I kinda liked it.

culture,The Imaginative Conservative,2,https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2019/12/birth-control-decline-civilization-steven-kessler.html,The Rise of Birth Control & the Decline of Civilization,2019-12-02,Steven Kessler,"Traditionally , the type of men that women wanted to marry embodied all the classic standards of male achievement : educated , physically fit , able to hold down a job . But in 1960 , everything changed . A watershed moment produced an oral contraceptive known as “ the pill. ” No innovation has fundamentally altered the premises of civilization quite like birth control .
In The Sociological Tradition , Robert Nisbet referred to the Industrial and French Revolutions as the two great ideas of the western world . [ 1 ] No two events so dramatically altered civilization as significantly , their temporal overlap only intensifying their effects .
If the two Revolutions are the two great ideas of the Western world , then the third great idea must be birth control . No innovation has fundamentally altered the premises of civilization quite like birth control .
While liberals believe the central unit of life is the individual , conservatives believe that it is the family unit . [ 2 ] We are not a civilization of individuals , we are a civilization of families , with the family unit being the foundational brick on which civilization is built . [ 3 ]
The traditional family unit is predicated on the following biological premises : Men have an unlimited supply of sperm , and biologically speaking , can never truly know if they are the father of a child . The child may bear a strong resemblance to the man perceived to be the father , but for all he knows , it could be someone else . Therefore , men look to reproduce WIDELY . [ 4 ] Women , on the other hand , have a finite number of eggs . The clock is ticking for women , and time eventually runs out on their reproductive years when they reach menopause . From a biological perspective , sex will lead to pregnancy , which is a high-cost long-term enterprise . Women bear the cost of pregnancy more so than men , therefore sex is costlier to women . This high cost means women must be selective with whom they reproduce , so women look to reproduce WISELY . [ 5 ]
Men are buyers in the mating market , and women sellers ; men are in supply , and women in demand . [ 6 ] As the demand for sex emanates largely on the male side , women have the leverage when it comes to negotiating the exchange between the sexes , and have traditionally served as gatekeepers . [ 7 ] Again , due to the high cost of sex to women , they have traditionally only sold sex to men at an equally high cost : marriage . [ 8 ]
Traditionally , the type of men that women wanted to marry embodied all the classic standards of male achievement : educated , physically fit , a good listener , able to hold down a job , a sense of humor , and other qualities women find appealing . Men worked hard in life to achieve these qualities to appeal enough to a woman . Hopefully , these qualities are enough to encourage consideration for marriage . In exchange for the fidelity of marriage , a woman would willingly give a man sex . [ 9 ]
Women were largely dependent on men for their safety , financial support , and various other needs . Women had little to no ability to control their fertility , and were often pregnant , or stuck caring for their young . Men therefore had to earn a living and become the providers . While this was not the case for 100 % of the population , it was the case for most people . [ 10 ]
And then everything changed . In 1960 , a watershed moment produced an oral contraceptive known as “ the pill. ” [ 11 ] By 1964 , 6.5 million married women were using the pill , and by 1972 , the Supreme Court extended access to the pill to unmarried women via Eisenstadt V. Baird ; in 1973 , Roe V. Wade fully legalized abortion . [ 12 ] The ease of application and the accessibility of the pill and abortion upended the civilizational premises described above .
Now , the high cost of sex associated with the risk of pregnancy can suddenly disappear , should a woman choose to use birth control or abort the pregnancy . Pregnancy and childrearing previously served as a barrier for women to enter the labor force and attain advanced or professional degrees , but now , thanks to birth control , women are free to participate in both . Women began entering higher education , the workforce , and began delaying childbearing at rates never seen previously . [ 13 ]
The benefits women and society at large incurred from these advances are highly beneficial . They help our economy , set the precedents for women as positive role models , they allow women the opportunity to choose to have a family when they are ready , and enable a typical household to have two earners .
Yet despite these seemingly beneficial characteristics , birth control and abortion have also dramatically increased certain problems and have caused serious consequences in ways most people never assumed would occur . This is why birth control is referred to as , “ the paradox of the pill. ” [ 14 ]
One of the most intriguing unintended consequences of the pill is that it lowered the cost of sex to women . Pregnancy made sex extremely costly for women , so therefore , women would traditionally only sell sex to men at the high cost of marriage . Now , without the risk of pregnancy to those willing to use either the pill or obtain an abortion , sex was suddenly cheap .
In his book , Cheap Sex : The Transformation of Men , Marriage , and Monogamy , Mark Regnerus defined cheap sex as something that is
characterized by personal ease of sexual access and social perceptions of the same . Sex is cheap if women expect little in return for it and men do not have to supply much time , attention , resources , recognition , or fidelity in order to experience it . [ 15 ]
More succinctly , Dr. Regnerus defined cheap sex as charging and costing little . [ 16 ]
This cheap sex was ushered in by the technology shock of birth control and abortion . George Akerlof , Janet Yellen , and Michael Katz insightfully theorized that this technology shock increased out of wedlock births and altered a woman ’ s leverage in the marriage market , among other things . [ 17 ]
A woman who takes the pill , or will get an abortion , or both , has little to no cost to sex , and can therefore “ sell ” it to men cheaply . A woman who refrains from using contraception can only sell sex at a much higher cost . Which type of women will men prefer ? The obvious answer is women selling cheap sex . The expression , “ no one ’ s gon na want to buy the cow if you ’ re giving the milk away for free ” comes to mind . Women on the pill are practically giving the milk away for free . How does someone selling the cow at full price compete ? The answer is that they can not compete .
Dr. Akerlof et al . identified this economic condition as follows : “ a cost saving innovation almost invariably penalizes producers who , for whatever reason , fail to adopt it. ” [ 18 ] Dr. Akerlof and his colleagues elaborated on the economic conundrum now facing women thusly :
Before technology shock , abstinence would be the norm for all women . After the technology shock those women who would use contraception or would be willing to obtain an abortion in the event of pregnancy or both engage in premarital sexual activity . However , those women who are not willing to obtain an abortion will also engage in sexual activity , since they correctly fear that if they abstain their partners would seek satisfaction elsewhere . [ 19 ]
The women who would otherwise refrain from premarital sex were priced out of the market by competitors offering the product much cheaper . Not only that , but now these women are basically forced to participate in premarital sex : “ The advent of contraception and abortion used by others may result in an unwanted increase in sexual participation for those who reject the new technology. ” [ 20 ]
Now , premarital sex is the cultural standard norm in relationships . As it always had before , sex leads to pregnancies , and without the high cost of marriage accompanying it , an increase of out-of-wedlock births followed . [ 21 ] This new standard increased the rate of single motherhood , which then decreased the stigma of single-motherhood . [ 22 ]
Birth control and abortion also made the entire process a choice . [ 23 ] The availability of birth control and abortion made the choice on the mother ’ s end axiomatic , but the optional nature of the bargain for exchange impacted male choice in a less obvious way : “ The sexual revolution , by making the birth of the child the physical choice of the mother , makes marriage and child support a social choice of the father. ” [ 24 ] The availability of female choice has also given men a choice to participate in parenthood . Should men choose to opt out—behavior not socially possible prior to birth control and abortion—women would be stuck as single mothers .
Dr. Akerlof and co. place the rise of single motherhood squarely on the shoulders of the technology shock of birth control and on-demand abortion . Additionally , they blame the technology shock specifically for the rise in out-of-wedlock births while debunking other theories relating to the rise in single motherhood like Charles Murray ’ s liberal welfare-state theory , and Julius Wilson ’ s job shortage theory . [ 25 ]
The problems associated with single motherhood , absentee fathers , divorced homes , and the relationship these issues have with both children and society at large are well documented . In In The Case for Carriage : Why Married People Are Happier , Healthier , and Better Off Financially , Marriage and Civilization : How Monogamy Made Us Human , Families Without Fathers : Fathers , Marriage , and Children in American Society , Family and Civilization , and Fatherless America : Confronting Our Most Urgent Social Problem , the authors articulated issues such as the immense societal benefit to marriage , the individual benefits of marriage , the importance of fathers in co-raising children , and the importance of marriage towards reducing crime rates and other nefarious behaviors . These books illustrate that we are not a nation of individuals , but rather a nation of families . Civilizations ebb and flow based on the strengths of their families . [ 26 ] When there are too many weak families , a civilization will decay and collapse . [ 27 ] Cheap sex exacerbates or encourages much of the social and societal ills associated with weakening family units .
The above referenced texts systematically detailed the importance of marriage to civilizations and the result of what happens when too many unmarried , or weak families exist in a society . The importance of strong families and their relationship to civilizations is something many already know . Historians , those in the academic fields of family studies or human development , and many on both ends of the political spectrum are all aware of this causality .
One specific area that is not well known relates to cheap sex , civilizational strength , and the incentive sex with women provides men . Traditionally , the great incentive for men to achieve in the world was their desire to attract a woman so they could marry and then have sex with her . Cheap sex invalidates this incentive .
Dr. Regnerus quoted Professor Kathleen Vohs ’ opinion on the subject :
Nowadays , young men can skip the wearying detour of getting education and career prospects to qualify for sex . Now he does not have to get married and accept all those costs , including promising to share his lifetime earnings and forego other women forever . Female sex partners are available without all that . [ 28 ]
Dr. Regnerus understood that , “ one thing is clear . . . cheap sex does not make men more productive. ” [ 29 ] Essentially , sex has forever been a motivating factor for male achievement . As people respond to incentives , cheap sex has removed this incentive for men .
Interestingly , Dr. Regnerus said that “ this is not a new theory. ” [ 30 ] Dr. Regnerus quoted Sigmund Freud on this issue : “ Civilization is built largely on erotic energy that has been blocked , concentrated , accumulated , and redirected. ” [ 31 ] This is a reference to Freud ’ s theory of sexual sublimation .
Freud ’ s theory was tested by J.D . Unwin in his study , Sex and Culture . Unwin surveyed 86 defunct civilizations and tested the relationship between sexual permissiveness and the strength of the civilization . Unwin found that every defunct civilization had prohibitions against premarital sex and extramarital sex in its infancy and ascendancy ; when the sexual opportunities were relaxed to include premarital sex and extra-marital sex , the civilizations lost their energy and eventually collapsed . [ 32 ]
Unwin discussed W.H.R . Rivers ’ interpretation of sexual sublimation : “ By sublimation is meant a process in which an instinctive tendency . . . which would normally find expression in some kind of undesirable conduct , has its energy diverted into a channel in which it comes to have a positive social value. ” [ 33 ] Sexual energy , when properly channeled , leads to great things . It is converted into productive means for a civilization , and this energy propels a civilization into prosperity .
We believe that civilization has been built up by sacrifices in gratification of the primitive impulses , and that it is to a great extent for ever being recreated as each individual repeats the sacrifice of his instinctive pleasures for the common good . The sexual are amongst the most important of the instinctive forces thus utilized : they are in this way sublimated , that is to say , their energy is turned aside from its sexual goal and diverted towards other ends , no longer sexual and socially more valuable . [ 34 ]
Unwin corroborated this thought with data from collapsed civilizations that have all but vanished . He concluded that , “ the limitation of the sexual opportunity must be regarded as the cause of the cultural advance. ” [ 35 ]
Unwin ’ s conclusions were shared by Napoleon Hill , a man who set out on a very different path , yet still arrived at the same destination . In Think and Grow Rich , Hill surveyed the 500 richest men in America to see if he could determine commonalities among them to distill the essence of the secrets to their success . Among other things , he learned that the richest men in America had personal moral and spiritual taboos against cheap sex , including personal gratification . [ 36 ] He referred to this practice as , “ sex transmutation , ” which is :
The transmutation of sex energy calls for the exercise of will-power , to be sure , but the reward is worth the effort . The desire for sexual expression is inborn and natural . The desire can not , and should not be submerged or eliminated . But it should be given an outlet through forms of expression which enrich the body , mind , and spirit of man . If not given this form of outlet , through transmutation , it will seek outlets through purely physical channels . [ 37 ]
Self-control in sexual energy is the key to our success . This notion , that self-control is the key to our success , has been corroborated by a longitudinal study performed at Stanford University called , “ The marshmallow test : mastering self-control. ” [ 38 ]
Birth control and abortion have freed men and women from the self-control necessary to maintain and propel a civilization forward . Historically , when these restraints were relaxed , civilizations decayed and then disappeared . [ 39 ] Men no longer needed to mature into marriage material to acquire sex , and a glut of unmarried men in a civilization is highly toxic .
In Marriage and Civilization : How Monogamy Made Us Human , William Tucker explained that the salient factor in creating civil society is monogamous marriage . Men are capable—and more probable than women—of violent and criminal behavior . [ 40 ] The greatest deterrent to this undesirable behavior in men is in fact a stable marriage to a woman and living with her and any of their offspring .
When men do not have women and children depending upon them , when men are not marrying , these same men who would otherwise mature and grow up fail to do so . [ 41 ] When men are not needed or welcomed in their own homes , men are unmoored . [ 42 ] When there is nothing tethering men to society they never develop any incentive to grow up and leave the “ frat house. ” [ 43 ] These men without any incentives to mature and grow-up are left with idle hands , and idle hands are the Devil ’ s playground .
Contraceptives have given men idle hands , reduced their incentive to achieve , and contributed to a decline in male employment . [ 44 ] Not only has there been a dramatic rise in male unemployment , but in America today , there is a high rate of men who are out of the workforce altogether . [ 45 ] These men are not only unemployed , but are not looking for work whatsoever . [ 46 ] Sadly , “ once a prime-age man removes himself from the labor force , there is a good—and increasing—chance he will remain an unworker for a long time. ” [ 47 ] When men are no longer in the labor force , “ the male retreat from the labor force has further exacerbated family breakdown , promoted welfare dependency , recast ‘ disability ’ into a viable alternative lifestyle , and routinized the support of men of prime working age by women. ” [ 48 ]
Men not working , unmotivated , and able to obtain cheap sex all fall under the scope of idle hands . This has all been facilitated by birth control and abortion . Drs . Baumeister and Vohs understood this phenomenon in the following way :
Men ’ s access to sex has turned out to be maximized not by keeping women in an economically disadvantaged and dependent condition , but instead by letting them have abundant access and opportunity . . . . Once women had been granted wide opportunities for education and wealth , they no longer had to hold sex hostage . [ 49 ]
The very opportunities birth control affords women are also giving men cheap sex , which has a detrimental effect on male behavior .
The very opportunities birth control affords women have also detrimentally affected women . Birth control and abortion , by increasing illegitimate births , has led to “ the feminization poverty ” ; men are no longer forced to marry the women they impregnate , yet women still overwhelmingly bear the cost of pregnancy . [ 50 , 51 ] Oddly , the financial gains by women are not making them happier , as , “ Women whose husbands are the breadwinners tend to be happier than other women. ” [ 52 ] Female sexual risk has been reduced , educational and financial attainment has risen , yet life is now , “ more challenging on them relationally . . . . the route to marriage—something the vast majority still holds as a goal—is more fraught with years and failed relationships than in the past. ” [ 53 ] Basically , “ Once familiar structures , narratives , and rituals about romance and marriage—how to date , falling in love , whom to marry , why , and when—have largely collapsed. ” [ 54 ]
The increase in the number of partners and failed relationships has a negative effect on women . For women reporting 20 or more sexual partners in life , they self-reported higher rates of depression , anxiety , infidelity , divorce , sexually transmitted diseases , and are generally less happy with life . [ 55 ] Essentially , cheap sex and sex without commitment does not make women happy the way it does for men . [ 56 ]
A widely circulated piece of scholarship called , “ The Paradox of Declining Female Happiness , ” discussed the notion that there has never been a better time to be a woman , yet women are now more unhappy than ever—both in absolute terms , and relative to men . [ 57 ] They asked the following question : “ This finding of a decline in women ’ s well-being relative to that of men raises questions about whether modern social constructs have made women worse off. ” [ 58 ]
The important syntax here is the phrase , “ social constructs. ” A pillar of contemporary liberal thought , particularly in the contemporary academic discipline of “ intersectionality , ” is that society is an arbitrary social construct . [ 59 ] Nothing in this world has any meaning ; everything that we , as a society , do , is predicated on perpetuating the power structure of white , male , able-bodied , cisgendered , heterosexuals . [ 60 ] Modernity and liberalism have been telling women that all these traditional norms regarding marriage , dating , sexuality , and gender roles are completely arbitrary and meaningless ; they exist exclusively to maintain the patriarchal authority of men over women .
Nisbet delineated the tenets of liberalism in , The Sociological Tradition , where he explained that : “ The dominant objective . . . were those of release : release of individual from ancient social ties and of the mind from fettering traditions. ” [ 61 ] Emancipating women from all the traditional bonds of marriage and family is thus the goal , a goal that has been successfully accomplished with largely negative results . [ 62 ]
Perhaps then society is not an arbitrary social construct . Perhaps there is in fact meaning and truth to our societal customs and to our societal norms relating to gender . We have our traditional gender norms because men and women are different , and these differences are biological , not arbitrary social constructs . [ 63 ]
The issues addressed here reflect more of a micro-approach to civilizational energy and civilizational decay . By taking a step backwards , we can take a macro-approach and discuss the issues from a theoretical and philosophical perspective .
This discussion is a debate between conflicting visions about the human condition . The philosophical position liberal progressives take is called , “ Meliorism. ” Meliorism was the Enlightenment era term for progressivism . [ 64 ] The important feature of Meliorism in this discussion is the natural goodness of Man , corrupted by society . [ 65 ] This aspect of progressivism believes that human beings are born benevolent , and evil and problems are introduced to us from society . [ 66 ] By fixing society—adjusting the norms and standards—we can eradicate the problems society introduces to us . [ 67 ] Society is also perfectible with the right tinkering , and there is nothing out of the reach of Man to improve . [ 68 ]
Conservatives believe that the problems of the world do not come from without , nor is Man born naturally benevolent . [ 69 ] Problems come from within Man ’ s fallen and imperfect nature , and no amount of societal tinkering can ever eradicate evil . [ 70 ] Conservatives believe in the tradition of natural law . [ 71 ] To oversimplify , natural law theory is the belief that God or nature—whatever you choose to believe—ordained the world before us with an ironclad , non-negotiable , and immutable law : the natural law . When Man chooses to violate the natural law , we fall . [ 72 ]
To the liberal Meliorist , the human condition is alterable , and we can do whatever we want to society . It is ours to mold and perfect . To the conservative , the human condition is tragic . Whether we like it or not , the world is a certain way , and there are rules we must follow , for when we ignore these rules , they lead to our downfall . Life is not fair , and we must learn to cope with that fact .
Let ’ s use real estate as a simple metaphor for interpreting the conflicting visions , with society serving as the real estate . Liberals believe they own the real estate . They are free to alter the property as they wish because they own it . Conservatives believe that we do not own the real estate , but that we are merely renters . The lease agreement was drawn up before our time , and can not be altered , nor can we mute or suppress some of the terms .
Etched in stone in the lease agreement of life is the fact that civilizations collapse when the sexual opportunities are easily gratified , especially once those opportunities are extended to women . Read Unwin ’ s unfortunate conclusion :
The subsequent loss of social energy after the emancipation of women . . . has been due not to the emancipation but to the extension of sexual opportunity which has always accompanied it . In human records there is no instance of female emancipation which has not been accompanied by an extension of sexual opportunity . [ 73 ]
When cheap sex is easily attainable , a society crumbles : “ as soon as the sexual opportunity of the society . . . was extended , the energy of the society . . . decreased and finally disappeared. ” [ 74 ]
For whatever reason , cheap sex and sexual opportunity in a civilization allotted to women violates the natural law . When we violate the natural law , we fall . As Russell Kirk knew : “ Deny a fact , and that fact will be your master. ” [ 75 ]
Birth control , and to a lesser extent , abortion , are bringing about the destruction of our civilization . It is now only a matter of time before Western civilization collapses . According to Unwin , we cross the River Rubicon three generations from when the norms about sexual opportunities are relaxed . [ 76 ]
We are no different from any other civilization that has come before us and violated this aspect of the natural law . Do not be fooled by modernity and technological advancements that appear to make us better than previous generations . Sooner or later , Western civilization as we know it will join the ill-fated annals of history as just that : history .

But in 1960, everything changed. A watershed moment produced an oral contraceptive known as “the pill.” No innovation has fundamentally altered the premises of civilization quite like birth control.

In The Sociological Tradition, Robert Nisbet referred to the Industrial and French Revolutions as the two great ideas of the western world.[1] No two events so dramatically altered civilization as significantly, their temporal overlap only intensifying their effects.

If the two Revolutions are the two great ideas of the Western world, then the third great idea must be birth control. No innovation has fundamentally altered the premises of civilization quite like birth control.

While liberals believe the central unit of life is the individual, conservatives believe that it is the family unit.[2] We are not a civilization of individuals, we are a civilization of families, with the family unit being the foundational brick on which civilization is built.[3]

The traditional family unit is predicated on the following biological premises: Men have an unlimited supply of sperm, and biologically speaking, can never truly know if they are the father of a child. The child may bear a strong resemblance to the man perceived to be the father, but for all he knows, it could be someone else. Therefore, men look to reproduce WIDELY.[4] Women, on the other hand, have a finite number of eggs. The clock is ticking for women, and time eventually runs out on their reproductive years when they reach menopause. From a biological perspective, sex will lead to pregnancy, which is a high-cost long-term enterprise. Women bear the cost of pregnancy more so than men, therefore sex is costlier to women. This high cost means women must be selective with whom they reproduce, so women look to reproduce WISELY.[5]

Men are buyers in the mating market, and women sellers; men are in supply, and women in demand.[6] As the demand for sex emanates largely on the male side, women have the leverage when it comes to negotiating the exchange between the sexes, and have traditionally served as gatekeepers.[7] Again, due to the high cost of sex to women, they have traditionally only sold sex to men at an equally high cost: marriage.[8]

Traditionally, the type of men that women wanted to marry embodied all the classic standards of male achievement: educated, physically fit, a good listener, able to hold down a job, a sense of humor, and other qualities women find appealing. Men worked hard in life to achieve these qualities to appeal enough to a woman. Hopefully, these qualities are enough to encourage consideration for marriage. In exchange for the fidelity of marriage, a woman would willingly give a man sex.[9]

Women were largely dependent on men for their safety, financial support, and various other needs. Women had little to no ability to control their fertility, and were often pregnant, or stuck caring for their young. Men therefore had to earn a living and become the providers. While this was not the case for 100% of the population, it was the case for most people.[10]

And then everything changed. In 1960, a watershed moment produced an oral contraceptive known as “the pill.”[11] By 1964, 6.5 million married women were using the pill, and by 1972, the Supreme Court extended access to the pill to unmarried women via Eisenstadt V. Baird; in 1973, Roe V. Wade fully legalized abortion.[12] The ease of application and the accessibility of the pill and abortion upended the civilizational premises described above.

Now, the high cost of sex associated with the risk of pregnancy can suddenly disappear, should a woman choose to use birth control or abort the pregnancy. Pregnancy and childrearing previously served as a barrier for women to enter the labor force and attain advanced or professional degrees, but now, thanks to birth control, women are free to participate in both. Women began entering higher education, the workforce, and began delaying childbearing at rates never seen previously.[13]

The benefits women and society at large incurred from these advances are highly beneficial. They help our economy, set the precedents for women as positive role models, they allow women the opportunity to choose to have a family when they are ready, and enable a typical household to have two earners.

Yet despite these seemingly beneficial characteristics, birth control and abortion have also dramatically increased certain problems and have caused serious consequences in ways most people never assumed would occur. This is why birth control is referred to as, “the paradox of the pill.”[14]

One of the most intriguing unintended consequences of the pill is that it lowered the cost of sex to women. Pregnancy made sex extremely costly for women, so therefore, women would traditionally only sell sex to men at the high cost of marriage. Now, without the risk of pregnancy to those willing to use either the pill or obtain an abortion, sex was suddenly cheap.

In his book, Cheap Sex: The Transformation of Men, Marriage, and Monogamy, Mark Regnerus defined cheap sex as something that is

characterized by personal ease of sexual access and social perceptions of the same. Sex is cheap if women expect little in return for it and men do not have to supply much time, attention, resources, recognition, or fidelity in order to experience it.[15]

More succinctly, Dr. Regnerus defined cheap sex as charging and costing little.[16]

This cheap sex was ushered in by the technology shock of birth control and abortion. George Akerlof, Janet Yellen, and Michael Katz insightfully theorized that this technology shock increased out of wedlock births and altered a woman’s leverage in the marriage market, among other things.[17]

A woman who takes the pill, or will get an abortion, or both, has little to no cost to sex, and can therefore “sell” it to men cheaply. A woman who refrains from using contraception can only sell sex at a much higher cost. Which type of women will men prefer? The obvious answer is women selling cheap sex. The expression, “no one’s gonna want to buy the cow if you’re giving the milk away for free” comes to mind. Women on the pill are practically giving the milk away for free. How does someone selling the cow at full price compete? The answer is that they cannot compete.

Dr. Akerlof et al. identified this economic condition as follows: “a cost saving innovation almost invariably penalizes producers who, for whatever reason, fail to adopt it.”[18] Dr. Akerlof and his colleagues elaborated on the economic conundrum now facing women thusly:

Before technology shock, abstinence would be the norm for all women. After the technology shock those women who would use contraception or would be willing to obtain an abortion in the event of pregnancy or both engage in premarital sexual activity. However, those women who are not willing to obtain an abortion will also engage in sexual activity, since they correctly fear that if they abstain their partners would seek satisfaction elsewhere.[19]

The women who would otherwise refrain from premarital sex were priced out of the market by competitors offering the product much cheaper. Not only that, but now these women are basically forced to participate in premarital sex: “The advent of contraception and abortion used by others may result in an unwanted increase in sexual participation for those who reject the new technology.”[20]

Now, premarital sex is the cultural standard norm in relationships. As it always had before, sex leads to pregnancies, and without the high cost of marriage accompanying it, an increase of out-of-wedlock births followed.[21] This new standard increased the rate of single motherhood, which then decreased the stigma of single-motherhood.[22]

Birth control and abortion also made the entire process a choice.[23] The availability of birth control and abortion made the choice on the mother’s end axiomatic, but the optional nature of the bargain for exchange impacted male choice in a less obvious way: “The sexual revolution, by making the birth of the child the physical choice of the mother, makes marriage and child support a social choice of the father.”[24] The availability of female choice has also given men a choice to participate in parenthood. Should men choose to opt out—behavior not socially possible prior to birth control and abortion—women would be stuck as single mothers.

Dr. Akerlof and co. place the rise of single motherhood squarely on the shoulders of the technology shock of birth control and on-demand abortion. Additionally, they blame the technology shock specifically for the rise in out-of-wedlock births while debunking other theories relating to the rise in single motherhood like Charles Murray’s liberal welfare-state theory, and Julius Wilson’s job shortage theory.[25]

The problems associated with single motherhood, absentee fathers, divorced homes, and the relationship these issues have with both children and society at large are well documented. In In The Case for Carriage: Why Married People Are Happier, Healthier, and Better Off Financially, Marriage and Civilization: How Monogamy Made Us Human, Families Without Fathers: Fathers, Marriage, and Children in American Society, Family and Civilization, and Fatherless America: Confronting Our Most Urgent Social Problem, the authors articulated issues such as the immense societal benefit to marriage, the individual benefits of marriage, the importance of fathers in co-raising children, and the importance of marriage towards reducing crime rates and other nefarious behaviors. These books illustrate that we are not a nation of individuals, but rather a nation of families. Civilizations ebb and flow based on the strengths of their families.[26] When there are too many weak families, a civilization will decay and collapse.[27] Cheap sex exacerbates or encourages much of the social and societal ills associated with weakening family units.

The above referenced texts systematically detailed the importance of marriage to civilizations and the result of what happens when too many unmarried, or weak families exist in a society. The importance of strong families and their relationship to civilizations is something many already know. Historians, those in the academic fields of family studies or human development, and many on both ends of the political spectrum are all aware of this causality.

One specific area that is not well known relates to cheap sex, civilizational strength, and the incentive sex with women provides men. Traditionally, the great incentive for men to achieve in the world was their desire to attract a woman so they could marry and then have sex with her. Cheap sex invalidates this incentive.

Dr. Regnerus quoted Professor Kathleen Vohs’ opinion on the subject:

Nowadays, young men can skip the wearying detour of getting education and career prospects to qualify for sex. Now he does not have to get married and accept all those costs, including promising to share his lifetime earnings and forego other women forever. Female sex partners are available without all that.[28]

Dr. Regnerus understood that, “one thing is clear . . . cheap sex does not make men more productive.”[29] Essentially, sex has forever been a motivating factor for male achievement. As people respond to incentives, cheap sex has removed this incentive for men.

Interestingly, Dr. Regnerus said that “this is not a new theory.”[30] Dr. Regnerus quoted Sigmund Freud on this issue: “Civilization is built largely on erotic energy that has been blocked, concentrated, accumulated, and redirected.”[31] This is a reference to Freud’s theory of sexual sublimation.

Freud’s theory was tested by J.D. Unwin in his study, Sex and Culture. Unwin surveyed 86 defunct civilizations and tested the relationship between sexual permissiveness and the strength of the civilization. Unwin found that every defunct civilization had prohibitions against premarital sex and extramarital sex in its infancy and ascendancy; when the sexual opportunities were relaxed to include premarital sex and extra-marital sex, the civilizations lost their energy and eventually collapsed.[32]

Unwin discussed W.H.R. Rivers’ interpretation of sexual sublimation: “By sublimation is meant a process in which an instinctive tendency . . . which would normally find expression in some kind of undesirable conduct, has its energy diverted into a channel in which it comes to have a positive social value.”[33] Sexual energy, when properly channeled, leads to great things. It is converted into productive means for a civilization, and this energy propels a civilization into prosperity.

Unwin quoted Freud’s analysis of this process:

We believe that civilization has been built up by sacrifices in gratification of the primitive impulses, and that it is to a great extent for ever being recreated as each individual repeats the sacrifice of his instinctive pleasures for the common good. The sexual are amongst the most important of the instinctive forces thus utilized: they are in this way sublimated, that is to say, their energy is turned aside from its sexual goal and diverted towards other ends, no longer sexual and socially more valuable.[34]

Unwin corroborated this thought with data from collapsed civilizations that have all but vanished. He concluded that, “the limitation of the sexual opportunity must be regarded as the cause of the cultural advance.”[35]

Unwin’s conclusions were shared by Napoleon Hill, a man who set out on a very different path, yet still arrived at the same destination. In Think and Grow Rich, Hill surveyed the 500 richest men in America to see if he could determine commonalities among them to distill the essence of the secrets to their success. Among other things, he learned that the richest men in America had personal moral and spiritual taboos against cheap sex, including personal gratification.[36] He referred to this practice as, “sex transmutation,” which is:

The transmutation of sex energy calls for the exercise of will-power, to be sure, but the reward is worth the effort. The desire for sexual expression is inborn and natural. The desire cannot, and should not be submerged or eliminated. But it should be given an outlet through forms of expression which enrich the body, mind, and spirit of man. If not given this form of outlet, through transmutation, it will seek outlets through purely physical channels.[37]

Self-control in sexual energy is the key to our success. This notion, that self-control is the key to our success, has been corroborated by a longitudinal study performed at Stanford University called, “The marshmallow test: mastering self-control.”[38]

Birth control and abortion have freed men and women from the self-control necessary to maintain and propel a civilization forward. Historically, when these restraints were relaxed, civilizations decayed and then disappeared.[39] Men no longer needed to mature into marriage material to acquire sex, and a glut of unmarried men in a civilization is highly toxic.

In Marriage and Civilization: How Monogamy Made Us Human, William Tucker explained that the salient factor in creating civil society is monogamous marriage. Men are capable—and more probable than women—of violent and criminal behavior.[40] The greatest deterrent to this undesirable behavior in men is in fact a stable marriage to a woman and living with her and any of their offspring.

When men do not have women and children depending upon them, when men are not marrying, these same men who would otherwise mature and grow up fail to do so.[41] When men are not needed or welcomed in their own homes, men are unmoored.[42] When there is nothing tethering men to society they never develop any incentive to grow up and leave the “frat house.”[43] These men without any incentives to mature and grow-up are left with idle hands, and idle hands are the Devil’s playground.

Contraceptives have given men idle hands, reduced their incentive to achieve, and contributed to a decline in male employment.[44] Not only has there been a dramatic rise in male unemployment, but in America today, there is a high rate of men who are out of the workforce altogether.[45] These men are not only unemployed, but are not looking for work whatsoever.[46] Sadly, “once a prime-age man removes himself from the labor force, there is a good—and increasing—chance he will remain an unworker for a long time.”[47] When men are no longer in the labor force, “the male retreat from the labor force has further exacerbated family breakdown, promoted welfare dependency, recast ‘disability’ into a viable alternative lifestyle, and routinized the support of men of prime working age by women.”[48]

Men not working, unmotivated, and able to obtain cheap sex all fall under the scope of idle hands. This has all been facilitated by birth control and abortion. Drs. Baumeister and Vohs understood this phenomenon in the following way:

Men’s access to sex has turned out to be maximized not by keeping women in an economically disadvantaged and dependent condition, but instead by letting them have abundant access and opportunity. . . . Once women had been granted wide opportunities for education and wealth, they no longer had to hold sex hostage.[49]

The very opportunities birth control affords women are also giving men cheap sex, which has a detrimental effect on male behavior.

The very opportunities birth control affords women have also detrimentally affected women. Birth control and abortion, by increasing illegitimate births, has led to “the feminization poverty”; men are no longer forced to marry the women they impregnate, yet women still overwhelmingly bear the cost of pregnancy.[50, 51] Oddly, the financial gains by women are not making them happier, as, “Women whose husbands are the breadwinners tend to be happier than other women.”[52] Female sexual risk has been reduced, educational and financial attainment has risen, yet life is now, “more challenging on them relationally. . . . the route to marriage—something the vast majority still holds as a goal—is more fraught with years and failed relationships than in the past.”[53] Basically, “Once familiar structures, narratives, and rituals about romance and marriage—how to date, falling in love, whom to marry, why, and when—have largely collapsed.”[54]

The increase in the number of partners and failed relationships has a negative effect on women. For women reporting 20 or more sexual partners in life, they self-reported higher rates of depression, anxiety, infidelity, divorce, sexually transmitted diseases, and are generally less happy with life.[55] Essentially, cheap sex and sex without commitment does not make women happy the way it does for men.[56]

A widely circulated piece of scholarship called, “The Paradox of Declining Female Happiness,” discussed the notion that there has never been a better time to be a woman, yet women are now more unhappy than ever—both in absolute terms, and relative to men.[57] They asked the following question: “This finding of a decline in women’s well-being relative to that of men raises questions about whether modern social constructs have made women worse off.”[58]

The important syntax here is the phrase, “social constructs.” A pillar of contemporary liberal thought, particularly in the contemporary academic discipline of “intersectionality,” is that society is an arbitrary social construct.[59] Nothing in this world has any meaning; everything that we, as a society, do, is predicated on perpetuating the power structure of white, male, able-bodied, cisgendered, heterosexuals.[60] Modernity and liberalism have been telling women that all these traditional norms regarding marriage, dating, sexuality, and gender roles are completely arbitrary and meaningless; they exist exclusively to maintain the patriarchal authority of men over women.

Nisbet delineated the tenets of liberalism in, The Sociological Tradition, where he explained that: “The dominant objective . . . were those of release: release of individual from ancient social ties and of the mind from fettering traditions.”[61] Emancipating women from all the traditional bonds of marriage and family is thus the goal, a goal that has been successfully accomplished with largely negative results.[62]

Perhaps then society is not an arbitrary social construct. Perhaps there is in fact meaning and truth to our societal customs and to our societal norms relating to gender. We have our traditional gender norms because men and women are different, and these differences are biological, not arbitrary social constructs.[63]

The issues addressed here reflect more of a micro-approach to civilizational energy and civilizational decay. By taking a step backwards, we can take a macro-approach and discuss the issues from a theoretical and philosophical perspective.

This discussion is a debate between conflicting visions about the human condition. The philosophical position liberal progressives take is called, “Meliorism.” Meliorism was the Enlightenment era term for progressivism.[64] The important feature of Meliorism in this discussion is the natural goodness of Man, corrupted by society.[65] This aspect of progressivism believes that human beings are born benevolent, and evil and problems are introduced to us from society.[66] By fixing society—adjusting the norms and standards—we can eradicate the problems society introduces to us.[67] Society is also perfectible with the right tinkering, and there is nothing out of the reach of Man to improve.[68]

Conservatives believe that the problems of the world do not come from without, nor is Man born naturally benevolent.[69] Problems come from within Man’s fallen and imperfect nature, and no amount of societal tinkering can ever eradicate evil.[70] Conservatives believe in the tradition of natural law.[71] To oversimplify, natural law theory is the belief that God or nature—whatever you choose to believe—ordained the world before us with an ironclad, non-negotiable, and immutable law: the natural law. When Man chooses to violate the natural law, we fall.[72]

To the liberal Meliorist, the human condition is alterable, and we can do whatever we want to society. It is ours to mold and perfect. To the conservative, the human condition is tragic. Whether we like it or not, the world is a certain way, and there are rules we must follow, for when we ignore these rules, they lead to our downfall. Life is not fair, and we must learn to cope with that fact.

Let’s use real estate as a simple metaphor for interpreting the conflicting visions, with society serving as the real estate. Liberals believe they own the real estate. They are free to alter the property as they wish because they own it. Conservatives believe that we do not own the real estate, but that we are merely renters. The lease agreement was drawn up before our time, and cannot be altered, nor can we mute or suppress some of the terms.

Etched in stone in the lease agreement of life is the fact that civilizations collapse when the sexual opportunities are easily gratified, especially once those opportunities are extended to women. Read Unwin’s unfortunate conclusion:

The subsequent loss of social energy after the emancipation of women . . . has been due not to the emancipation but to the extension of sexual opportunity which has always accompanied it. In human records there is no instance of female emancipation which has not been accompanied by an extension of sexual opportunity.[73]

When cheap sex is easily attainable, a society crumbles: “as soon as the sexual opportunity of the society . . . was extended, the energy of the society . . . decreased and finally disappeared.”[74]

For whatever reason, cheap sex and sexual opportunity in a civilization allotted to women violates the natural law. When we violate the natural law, we fall. As Russell Kirk knew: “Deny a fact, and that fact will be your master.”[75]

Birth control, and to a lesser extent, abortion, are bringing about the destruction of our civilization. It is now only a matter of time before Western civilization collapses. According to Unwin, we cross the River Rubicon three generations from when the norms about sexual opportunities are relaxed.[76]

We are no different from any other civilization that has come before us and violated this aspect of the natural law. Do not be fooled by modernity and technological advancements that appear to make us better than previous generations. Sooner or later, Western civilization as we know it will join the ill-fated annals of history as just that: history.

While it 's not unheard-of for ratings to fluctuate , analysts attribute the surge in Mr. Colbert 's viewership to a greater demand for politicized comedy in the weeks since President Trump took office . Current interest in Colbert and similar entertainers , experts say , follows a long tradition of satirists thriving in times of political unrest .
But as more and more Americans turn to comedians for comfort in a fraught political climate , some observers question whether increasingly partisan late-night television shows are helping or hurting national discourse . Defenders of left-leaning personalities like Colbert or TBS 's Samantha Bee say it 's important for high-profile figures to take a political stance against what they perceive as offensive or discriminatory policies and rhetoric , no matter what the cost .
But critics warn that ubiquitous anti-Trump sentiment among late-night hosts could alienate Americans who voted for the president , exacerbating already record-high partisan polarization .
`` Late-night talk shows have about as good a chance as anything of bringing Trump supporters and non-supporters together . There is something about the premise of these shows – to get you to laugh – that can be disarming to supporters and non-supporters alike , '' says Michael Parkin , an associate professor of politics at Oberlin College in Ohio , in an email to The ███ . `` It 's harder to yell at your TV when you 're laughing . ''
However , he adds , `` I think this only works ... as long as viewers see the hosts as engaging in comedy , rather than partisan hackery . ''
Under a president who has declared traditional media the `` opposition party '' and repeatedly denounced mainstream news sources as `` fake , '' historians say political satire from comedians such as Colbert , Ms. Bee , and Trevor Noah could play an increasingly important role in political discourse in the next four years , as Story Hinckley reported for The ███ in December :
Political satire will undoubtedly become more colorful during the Trump administration , but it may also prove more valuable . Satire has reaffirmed freedom of speech in US history before and it may do so again , given Trump ’ s tendency to flout traditional media norms . He threatened to “ open up ” libel laws during his campaign , criticized leading publications for publishing content he disagrees with , and before Wednesday 's surprise Q & A with reporters , had n't held a press conference since July . “ Historically , satire is always at its most valuable when freedom of press is constrained .... Satire is a way of challenging power when the legitimate ways of challenging power are closed off , ” says Geoffrey Baym , chairman of Temple University ’ s media and communications department , noting that satirists thrived in czarist Russia , for example . “ Great moments of satire come in opposition to some sense of totalizing control . ”
But , political observers note , hyper-partisan satire – particularly at the expense of an already-polarizing figure like Mr. Trump – can come at a cost , as comedians seen as pushing a liberal political agenda run the risk of alienating the significant chunk of Americans who voted for him .
In a September opinion piece for The New York Times , conservative columnist Ross Douthat argues that this `` rapid colonization of new cultural territory by an ascendant social liberalism '' has created an `` echo chamber from which the imagination struggles to escape . ''
`` Outside the liberal tent , the feeling of being suffocated by the left ’ s cultural dominance is turning voting Republican into an act of cultural rebellion — which may be one reason the Obama years , so good for liberalism in the culture , have seen sharp G.O.P . gains at every level of the country ’ s government , '' writes Mr. Douthat . `` This spirit of political-cultural rebellion is obviously crucial to Trump ’ s act . ''
Jody Baumgartner , a professor of political science at East Carolina University and co-author of the book `` Politics is a Joke ! : How TV Comedians are Remaking Political Life , '' agrees that partisan late-night comedy is unlikely to bring Americans of differing political stripes together – and , by deepening the political divide , may inadvertently achieve the opposite of its intended effect .
`` What this continual lambasting by the late-night comics could do is serve to sort of harden [ viewers ' ] positions , '' Professor Baumgartner tells the Monitor in a phone interview .
`` If people really do n't like Trump , I would think that they would want to start to be worried , because the constant barrage of anti-Trump media and late-night joking is probably serving to bolster his support among his supporters . ''
`` If you really want to bring the guy down , '' he adds , `` maybe you should leave him alone for a while . ''
Still , speaking out against what they see as an immoral president is worth the risk of losing viewers who voted for him , say some defenders of Colbert and other political comedians . What 's important , they argue , is that high-profile figures take a stand against Trump 's incendiary rhetoric and controversial policies . If those figures happen to lose a few fans along the way , so be it .

''","Ratings for ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" have surpassed those of ""The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon"" for the second week in a row, marking Mr. Colbert's second stretch on top since first taking the job in 2015.

While it's not unheard-of for ratings to fluctuate, analysts attribute the surge in Mr. Colbert's viewership to a greater demand for politicized comedy in the weeks since President Trump took office. Current interest in Colbert and similar entertainers, experts say, follows a long tradition of satirists thriving in times of political unrest.

But as more and more Americans turn to comedians for comfort in a fraught political climate, some observers question whether increasingly partisan late-night television shows are helping or hurting national discourse. Defenders of left-leaning personalities like Colbert or TBS's Samantha Bee say it's important for high-profile figures to take a political stance against what they perceive as offensive or discriminatory policies and rhetoric, no matter what the cost.

But critics warn that ubiquitous anti-Trump sentiment among late-night hosts could alienate Americans who voted for the president, exacerbating already record-high partisan polarization.

""Late-night talk shows have about as good a chance as anything of bringing Trump supporters and non-supporters together. There is something about the premise of these shows – to get you to laugh – that can be disarming to supporters and non-supporters alike,"" says Michael Parkin, an associate professor of politics at Oberlin College in Ohio, in an email to The Christian Science Monitor. ""It's harder to yell at your TV when you're laughing.""

However, he adds, ""I think this only works ... as long as viewers see the hosts as engaging in comedy, rather than partisan hackery.""

Under a president who has declared traditional media the ""opposition party"" and repeatedly denounced mainstream news sources as ""fake,"" historians say political satire from comedians such as Colbert, Ms. Bee, and Trevor Noah could play an increasingly important role in political discourse in the next four years, as Story Hinckley reported for The Christian Science Monitor in December:

Political satire will undoubtedly become more colorful during the Trump administration, but it may also prove more valuable. Satire has reaffirmed freedom of speech in US history before and it may do so again, given Trump’s tendency to flout traditional media norms. He threatened to “open up” libel laws during his campaign, criticized leading publications for publishing content he disagrees with, and before Wednesday's surprise Q&A with reporters, hadn't held a press conference since July. “Historically, satire is always at its most valuable when freedom of press is constrained.... Satire is a way of challenging power when the legitimate ways of challenging power are closed off,” says Geoffrey Baym, chairman of Temple University’s media and communications department, noting that satirists thrived in czarist Russia, for example. “Great moments of satire come in opposition to some sense of totalizing control.”

But, political observers note, hyper-partisan satire – particularly at the expense of an already-polarizing figure like Mr. Trump – can come at a cost, as comedians seen as pushing a liberal political agenda run the risk of alienating the significant chunk of Americans who voted for him.

In a September opinion piece for The New York Times, conservative columnist Ross Douthat argues that this ""rapid colonization of new cultural territory by an ascendant social liberalism"" has created an ""echo chamber from which the imagination struggles to escape.""

""Outside the liberal tent, the feeling of being suffocated by the left’s cultural dominance is turning voting Republican into an act of cultural rebellion — which may be one reason the Obama years, so good for liberalism in the culture, have seen sharp G.O.P. gains at every level of the country’s government,"" writes Mr. Douthat. ""This spirit of political-cultural rebellion is obviously crucial to Trump’s act.""

Jody Baumgartner, a professor of political science at East Carolina University and co-author of the book ""Politics is a Joke!: How TV Comedians are Remaking Political Life,"" agrees that partisan late-night comedy is unlikely to bring Americans of differing political stripes together – and, by deepening the political divide, may inadvertently achieve the opposite of its intended effect.

""What this continual lambasting by the late-night comics could do is serve to sort of harden [viewers'] positions,"" Professor Baumgartner tells the Monitor in a phone interview.

""If people really don't like Trump, I would think that they would want to start to be worried, because the constant barrage of anti-Trump media and late-night joking is probably serving to bolster his support among his supporters.""

""If you really want to bring the guy down,"" he adds, ""maybe you should leave him alone for a while.""

Still, speaking out against what they see as an immoral president is worth the risk of losing viewers who voted for him, say some defenders of Colbert and other political comedians. What's important, they argue, is that high-profile figures take a stand against Trump's incendiary rhetoric and controversial policies. If those figures happen to lose a few fans along the way, so be it.

""What Douthat considers an 'embrace [of] the race-gender-sexual identity agenda,' could be more accurately described as, say, finally recognizing the contributions of previously marginalized groups that have spent decades fighting to make their voices heard in a mainstream culture that has generally considered them worthy of nothing more than opprobrium and mockery,"" writes Gary Legum for Salon in response to Douthat's Times column.

""It is not 'left-wing political correctness' to respect these voices. It is called 'civility,' the same civility that Douthat is demanding liberals show to conservative viewpoints.""

At a time when some Trump opponents have argued that silence is equivalent to complicity, it may be fair to question whether it's truly possible for a late-night television host – or any celebrity, for that matter – to avoid taking a political stance.

What’s happening

When President Ronald Reagan left office, he defined America as a “shining city on a hill,” a country that other nations would look to as a model of prosperity and freedom. Reagan, like many other presidents and politicians, lauded the country for its “American exceptionalism,” the set of beliefs that the country’s history, values and politics make it distinct and worthy of respect and leadership on the world stage.

But amid dueling crises — the coronavirus pandemic and the racial reckoning — belief in American exceptionalism has been deeply shaken. A staggering 62 percent of Americans no longer see their country as the “shining city on a hill” that Reagan once imagined, a Yahoo News/YouGov poll revealed. Outside the U.S., Europeans’ trust in America has also deteriorated, according to a European Council on Foreign Relations poll.

Americans are facing the highest coronavirus case count and death toll in the world, a lack of national pandemic strategy and a financial crisis, while grappling with the country’s dark racial legacy. Doctors lack proper personal protective equipment, governors have been left to handle their states’ responses without much aid from the federal government, and hospitals in multiple states have been overwhelmed to the point of having no ICU beds. The pandemic’s effects on health and unemployment have hit communities of color the hardest, especially Black, Latino and Native American populations. And months into the crisis, Americans marched for racial justice as the protests against the police killings of Black Americans became what may be the largest protest movement in the history of the country.

Why there’s debate

The U.S. coronavirus response and the racial reckoning have brought into question where America stands on the world stage. Most agree — and polls show — that the U.S.’s response to the pandemic has negatively affected its global reputation.

Some believe this is the end of American exceptionalism. They say the public health crisis marks the end of America’s status as a superpower, as international health experts criticize the country’s virus response. They point to many pandemic response failures — from the country’s inability to produce even the most basic medical equipment for its health care workers to its struggle to restart sports. It’s time for America to learn from the rest of the world on the coronavirus response, they say. America’s standing in the world order may shift soon, they warn, pointing to the possibility of the crash of the U.S. dollar and the decline of the value of an American passport.

Others point to America’s failures to grapple with its racist past. They say the structures that caused the racial injustice now being protested have been in place for decades, and the pandemic and recent police killings of Black Americans simply forced them into the spotlight, causing many white Americans to reckon with them for the first time. American exceptionalism has always been hypocritical, they say, arguing that the country struggles to fix its own problems while proclaiming its superiority to the rest of the world.

But while the pandemic has mostly brought pity and criticism from other nations and frustration within American borders, the mass protests for racial justice have also brought, for some, a reason to hope. When thousands of Americans marched for justice, citizens of other countries followed suit, spilling into the streets. Some say this shows that other nations still look at America as a model for social change. The decline of American exceptionalism, they say, could ultimately be what makes the country stronger than ever before.

What’s next

Experts don’t believe the coronavirus pandemic will end until a successful vaccine is developed. Though protests for racial justice are slowing, changes are rippling through society, from the toppling of Confederate statues to countless promises of corporate diversity initiatives. In November, Americans will vote in the presidential election, which will likely have a significant impact on the country’s next steps in response to the pandemic and the racial justice movement.",www.news.yahoo.com,center,KfPfDVRvryDwcmcP

Today , they are broken . When we emerge , the world will be different , and so will we .
The journalists at ███ are proud to bring you trustworthy and relevant reporting about the coronavirus . To help keep this news free , become a member and sign up for our newsletter , Outbreak Today .
I ruined the mood in a family group chat last week . Someone shared a meme that read , “ This # Coronavirus is turning me into a democrat . I ’ m staying at home , not working , complaining about everything , and waiting for a check from the government . ”
Another family member used the yearly death rate of the flu to dismiss concerns over the coronavirus . Then someone else argued that millions of people die around the world every year in car accidents . “ Will cars be banned , ” they snarkily asked . I tried not to react emotionally , but it ’ s hard to keep your cool after weeks of trying to convince older relatives every day to stay inside and socially distance . “ We ’ re currently at half as many American coronavirus deaths as the number of people who died on 9/11 , ” I replied , using the only statistic I ’ ve found that communicates the kind of world-changing loss that this pandemic will cause . “ If Dr. Fauci ’ s projections are correct , it will be the equivalent of 30–60 9/11s. ” The chat went quiet for a while after that . The numbers I was referring to have quickly gone out of date — they ’ re much higher now . But comparing this pandemic to other mass casualty , world-shaping events is the only way I know to make them resonate . As of this week , more than 5,000 Americans have died of the coronavirus — more than the 2,977 who died on September 11 , 2001 . More than any other event in my life , 9/11 changed the world : inspiring national security policies like the Patriot Act , jump-starting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — the latter of which has become the longest-running war in US history — and leading to the creation of the Transportation Security Administration , Immigration and Customs Enforcement , and the Department of Homeland Security , effectively militarizing the United States ’ borders and immigration services . On Sunday , Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said , optimistically , if we continue practicing social distancing , between 100,000 and 200,000 Americans would die of COVID-19 , the disease caused by the novel coronavirus . Projections are always bounded by inaccuracies ( and there have been plenty in the past few months ) — but if Fauci were correct , the death toll would be as if there were a 9/11 attack every day for the next two to three months . My grandmother was born in 1928 ; she spent the first 10 years of her life living through the Great Depression in the Oklahoma Dust Bowl and the last five years of her life hoarding food until it rotted in her fridge and pantry . The trauma never left . Neither will the trauma of thousands upon thousands of deaths once it ’ s safe to leave our homes . When we emerge , we will be different people in a different world .
“ The Authoritarian Creep ” If China ’ s claim to have won supremacy over the virus is to be believed , the country was able to make up for a botched early response by mobilizing its vast and intricate surveillance infrastructure to carry out an authoritarian crackdown , the terrifying scale of which is only matched by the terrifying fear among Western liberals that it was necessary . Payment apps like Alipay and WeChat installed software to track users ' movements . China ’ s state-run telecom color-coded users ’ phones in red , green , and yellow , based on their risk of possible infection — which were then checked by guards at train stations . Those who broke quarantine were reported to the police . Chinese social media platforms like Weibo and WeChat were heavily censored to quell conspiracy theories and rumors . Those efforts may be working . The country is reporting that its case numbers are decreasing , and it has banned virtually all foreigners from entering the country as it attempts to return to normal without a second spike . Yet it ’ s hard to know exactly how real the claims are that China has flattened its curve . Three US officials told Bloomberg on Wednesday that the US intelligence community had concluded China ’ s numbers are actually much higher than what ’ s been reported . But with the US and Europe struggling to contain the outbreak , analysts have started asking whether China will emerge from this pandemic as the new global superpower . Jeremy Lee Wallace , a Cornell professor and leader of the university ’ s China 's Cities research group , told ███ the country is definitely attempting to position itself as a new global leader amid the pandemic . “ [ China ] styled itself a leader in climate change and international trade following the election of Donald Trump and is proudly boasting of its successes in fighting COVID-19 , ” Wallace said . “ Whether it will work depends on the outcomes in other countries and how those outcomes are perceived. ” Presenting itself as a responsible custodian is now central to the Chinese Communist Party ’ s propaganda strategy . Chinese diplomats and state media outlets are sparring directly with President Donald Trump ’ s own ad hoc online army on platforms like Twitter and YouTube , criticizing the US for its inability to mitigate the damage of the outbreak . Jack Ma , the Chinese billionaire cofounder of the multinational tech company Alibaba Group , recently tweeted two photos of medical supplies being loaded onto a China Cargo Airlines flight . “ The first shipment of masks and coronavirus test kits to the US is taking off from Shanghai . All the best to our friends in America , ” Ma wrote . According to the Jack Ma Foundation , the shipment contained 500,000 testing kits and 1 million masks . Ma ’ s foundations have already claimed to have shipped 1.8 million masks and 100,000 test kits to other heavily affected countries . Chinese state media is very aware it ’ s a Chinese billionaire shipping tests and masks around the world , not an American one . “ China has shared its experience , but many Western countries are just not willing to follow . When the pandemic is over , these countries will find that it was not China that had led to the severe conditions in the US and Europe , but their own wrong judgments and choices , ” the Global Times wrote Wednesday . David Jacobson , professor of global business strategy at Southern Methodist University 's Cox School of Business and a visiting professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing , told ███ he worries China ’ s test-and-mask diplomacy could fall apart , citing reports of European countries sending back faulty equipment . “ In the world of the Communist Party state propaganda , which is probably the most powerful arm right now because it 's trying to globally set the narrative of how China 's viewed , they 're saying , ‘ We 're here to help , we learned all these lessons , and we 're here to help the world. ’ ” he said . Jacobson said he ’ s optimistic that countries will see through the spin . “ The world is seeing the sham , ” he said . “ If the tests do n't work , test diplomacy does n't work. ” But it ’ s not just in an ascendant China — an authoritarian COVID-19 creep is on the rise everywhere . NPR called semi-authoritarian city-state Singapore a “ coronavirus model. ” The country flattened its curve by setting up early proactive measures like a virus-fighting task force , strict hospital and home quarantines , and a ban on large gatherings . It also used a technique called contact tracing , building a movement log of the infected through surveillance footage , digital signatures left by ATM card withdrawals or credit card payments , and a Bluetooth-tracking smartphone app called TraceTogether . The European Union now has its first dictatorship . On Monday , the Hungarian Parliament passed a bill giving Prime Minister Viktor Orbán the right to rule by decree indefinitely , establishing a COVID-19 state of emergency without a time limit , suspending both Parliament and elections , and instituting prison time for spreading “ fake news ” or rumors . Countries like Israel , Italy , and Austria are working with their telecommunications networks to use anonymized location data to track people in infection hot spots and monitor if citizens are breaking stay-in-place orders . Russia is using its massive 170,000-camera facial recognition system to catch people who violate quarantine and self-isolation . Hong Kong has deployed electronic bracelets for those who test positive for the virus . Turkmenistan ’ s state-controlled media outlets are no longer allowed to use the word “ coronavirus , ” and it has been removed from health information brochures . India has been particularly aggressive about containing the pandemic and tracking the infected . The country has experimented with stamping people who have been infected with ink that doesn ’ t wash off for weeks . The Indian central government is seeking a ruling from the country ’ s Supreme Court that would force all media outlets to receive approval to print , publish , or telecast content about COVID-19 . And in the country ’ s southern state of Karnataka , quarantined people are now required to download an app on their phones , through which they must take and send a selfie — which includes GPS coordinates in its metadata — every hour to government officials . US companies like Facebook and Google are discussing how to track infection hot spots using anonymized location data , while American leaders are asking if the coronavirus is the kind of emergency that requires setting aside privacy and civil liberties .
“ A Greater Depression ” The immediate effects of the pandemic — postponed weddings , canceled vacations , empty supermarket shelves , sinking housing prices , salary cuts , layoffs — suggest no one will come out of this period without losing something . But we are only at the beginning . Predicting how bad things will get economically is difficult . A viral outbreak of this scale has only happened once before in the industrialized world : the 1918 influenza pandemic that hit the world in two seasonal waves , killing 50 million people worldwide and 675,000 in the US . That pandemic occurred during World War I , which makes it hard to compare to now , even setting aside all the other changes in the past century . But according to a 2007 research paper on the economic effects of the 1918 pandemic , published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis , the economic effects of the outbreak only lasted for a short time . “ Many businesses , especially those in the service and entertainment industries , suffered double-digit losses in revenue , ” the paper read . “ Society as a whole recovered from the 1918 influenza quickly , but individuals who were affected by the influenza had their lives changed forever . Given our highly mobile and connected society , any future influenza pandemic is likely to be more severe in its reach , and perhaps in its virulence. ” While the 1918 pandemic isn ’ t a perfect comparison to the modern coronavirus pandemic , Kevin Kruse , a history professor at Princeton University , told ███ that last century 's outbreak exacerbated national problems that were already building up . “ The 1918 flu was part of a broader wave of disruptions and crises that rocked America . The spike in unemployment and inflation after World War I , the 1919 ‘ bloody summer ’ of race riots , major labor strikes that fall , the First Red Scare that winter , ” Kruse said . “ There was such a national sense of unease and uncertainty. ” Two months into this current outbreak , massive layoffs have started , American industries have demanded bailouts , and unemployment rates have surged . Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis are projecting total employment reductions of 47 million — an unemployment rate of 32.1 % . According to Forbes , every sector of the American economy is shrinking : Hotel chain Marriott International is furloughing tens of thousands of workers , Landry ’ s , the parent company of Del Frisco ’ s and Bubba Gump Shrimp , laid off 40,000 workers . Air Canada plans to lay off 5,100 members of its cabin crew . Shoe retailer DSW put 80 % of its workers on a temporary unpaid leave of absence . The US news industry ’ s advertising spending is in free fall . Digital outlets like BuzzFeed and Vice have already announced salary cuts , and the mass media company Gannett — which owns titles like USA Today , the Arizona Republic , and the Des Moines Register — announced many staffers will be furloughed for five days a month through June . The news media may receive low-interest loans , but airlines will receive nearly $ 60 billion in financial assistance as part of the Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security ( CARES ) Act , which Trump signed into law last Friday , but there are already questions from industry leaders about whether that ’ s enough to keep the industry aloft . Luigi Zingales , a finance professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and cohost of the podcast Capitalisn ’ t , told ███ that we don ’ t know yet how effective the CARES Act will be but added it was n't targeted at the right industries . “ I see this as purely an electoral move , which is not justified from an economic point of view , ” he said . “ The goal of the package is to redistribute and preserve the existing production capacity of the US economy. ” He said one immediate issue is that no one knows how it will help gig workers , which make up about 7 % of the country ’ s total employment . “ My understanding is basically nobody knows , ” he said . “ Imagine I work as a cab driver and through this program I get paid my regular wage , but I work as an Uber driver and I get nothing. ” American workers are already reacting to this economic downturn , striking and protesting . More fundamentally , the way we understand labor and class in this country is changing more than it has since the Great Depression .
“ A Divided America ” On Monday , a group of workers walked off the job at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island . An Amazon employee named Chris Smalls claimed the company fired him after he led a protest against its safety conditions . On Tuesday , Whole Foods Market workers held a “ sick-out. ” Members of the Industrial Division of Communication Workers of America protested Monday at the General Electric aviation facility in Lynn , Massachusetts , as well as its headquarters in Boston , demanding the company use its manufacturing resources to build more ventilators . Health care workers are protesting as well . Nurses across the country have begun to protest the shortages of personal protective equipment , which they say are putting their lives at risk . National Nurses United held a rally in front of Alta Bates Summit Medical Center in Oakland earlier this month . Last Saturday , more than two dozen nurses protested in front of Jacobi Hospital in the Bronx . And the fact that major American cities , including New York , Boston , Los Angeles , San Francisco , and St. Louis , have temporarily banned evictions hasn ’ t quelled the rumblings of a nationwide rent strike . Rent Strike 2020 , the activist organization leading the push , is demanding a two-month freeze on the collection of rent , residential mortgages , and utility bills “ to allow working families to do what is necessary to prepare for the difficult social measures required to flatten the outbreak curve , ” the organization ’ s website reads . Peter Gowan , a researcher and resident fellow at the Democracy Collaborative 's Next System Project , told ███ that many Americans are learning that a lot of the economic policies they were told couldn ’ t be done following the 2008 financial crisis are actually possible . “ You were seeing people say it 's impossible to think about giving cash payments to everyone , it 's impossible to increase unemployment benefits , that it 's impossible to have the government tell companies what they need to be producing , ” Gowan said . “ But now you 're seeing the Democratic Party and parts of the Republican Party telling President Trump that he needs to use the Defense Production Act to increase the production of ventilators. ” But it ’ s not just strikes and protests ; TikTok videos demonstrating Mark Zuckerberg 's coronavirus donation — $ 25 million — compared to his total wealth — $ 55.1 billion — and the immediate public disgust at actor Gal Gadot ’ s star-studded “ Imagine '' video reveal how quickly the pandemic has torn open the seams of American class consciousness . “ I hope that in the coming months and years that we 'll see a revitalized labor movement , ” Gowan said . “ I hope the left , and people in general , internalize that a lot of the things you 're told are rules are actually just norms created for the preservation of property and the rights of capital. ” Even though the way Americans think about the structure of their society and the value of labor is changing quickly , there are still two outbreaks in the US : One is a minor inconvenience suffered by the rich , who can abandon heavily affected urban areas for second homes , escape to “ virus-free ” retreats , and all seem to be getting tests . And there is a second outbreak , where delivery drivers and retail employees work under the constant threat of infection , where nurses have to use bleach to clean and reuse face masks , and where parking lots in Las Vegas are turned into homeless shelters , complete with spray-painted social distancing markers . Things are even worse for the incarcerated . At the Cook County Jail in Chicago , 134 inmates tested positive for COVID-19 this week . According to one legal organization ’ s analysis , coronavirus infections in New York City ’ s largest jail have skyrocketed to nearly 10 times the rate of the city ’ s residents . We are teetering dangerously close to a viral bomb going off inside ICE detention centers . A medical worker and a detainee have both tested positive for COVID-19 at a New Jersey facility earlier this month ; last week , three unaccompanied immigrant children in the custody of a US refugee agency in New York tested positive for the virus . On Sunday , Trump walked back his Easter deadline for turning the economy back on , but the recent push to go back to work — pandemic or not — is still being trumpeted by prominent Republicans and right-wing media . As Trump continues prioritizing the market over human lives , his administration ’ s Lord of the Flies approach has left the country ’ s governors scrambling to fill in the gaps left by a impotent federal government — a grim fulfillment of writer James Fallows ' prediction last year that America would soon be heading toward the disintegration that marked the end of the Roman Empire . Conspiracy theorists and far-right extremists are experimenting with how to use the coronavirus to their advantage . The QAnon movement and many other misinformation communities , like 5G truthers and anti-vaxxers have have been more active , latching on to the pandemic as proof of their paranoid worldviews . Tom Kawczynski , a white nationalist in Maine , is hosting a daily Coronavirus Central podcast that has been in Apple ’ s top 20 podcasts under the “ Health & Fitness ” category since the outbreak began . Last week , an international white supremacist group called the Hundred-Handers created a Twitter account claiming to be the regional arm of climate change activist group Extinction Rebellion ; it tweeted photos of a fake campaign promoting the coronavirus as a natural “ cure ” to the human “ disease. ” We will exit this pandemic with a new understanding of how both our government and society work . Formerly fringe ideas on the left like universal basic income or universal health care are now household terms , online misinformation and disinformation are no longer abstract concepts but constant presences in our group chats , and malicious ideologies like ecofascism are taking root . We will need new stories , but it ’ s unclear who will tell them and how .
“ We Live Online Now ” Right now , for one of the first times in modern history , huge swaths of the Earth ’ s population are being told to stay indoors . Workers who can conduct business remotely are . Group videoconferencing platforms like Zoom and Houseparty have blossomed . We spend our days switching back and forth between different inboxes , emails , family group chats , Slack messages , WhatsApp groups , and Instagram DMs — the bad screen and the good screen are now the same screen . There is a strong possibility we will not suddenly revert back to full offices when the world turns back on . Christopher McKnight Nichols , history professor and director of the Center for the Humanities at Oregon State University , told ███ that the 1918 pandemic ’ s biggest impact on American media was how seriously the press began to take public trust following the outbreak . “ The lessons learned were largely about [ news ] coverage when the federal government is suppressing honest , open speech , ” Nichols said . “ There were rampant false cures and treatments peddled by large firms as well as those who could best be understood as charlatans . Attempting to crack down on advertising of some of this false medicine was a result. ” This wave of mistrust is happening now as well . Except — contrary to the countless pieces fretting about an end to globalization , which cite the general breakdown in the rule-based global order and the deteriorating relationship between the US and China — we ’ re combating misinformation on a global scale we ’ ve never seen before . As the pandemic left China , an unverified video of a Chinese nurse overreporting the virus ’ s death toll spread from Chinese messaging platform WeChat to Twitter , where it was subtitled in English and then shared in huge numbers on YouTube . The same hoax about helicopters being used to disinfect cities was spotted in Italy , the Netherlands , the US , Turkey , and Argentina by fact-checkers .

I ruined the mood in a family group chat last week. Someone shared a meme that read, “This #Coronavirus is turning me into a democrat. I’m staying at home, not working, complaining about everything, and waiting for a check from the government.”

Another family member used the yearly death rate of the flu to dismiss concerns over the coronavirus. Then someone else argued that millions of people die around the world every year in car accidents. “Will cars be banned,” they snarkily asked. I tried not to react emotionally, but it’s hard to keep your cool after weeks of trying to convince older relatives every day to stay inside and socially distance. “We’re currently at half as many American coronavirus deaths as the number of people who died on 9/11,” I replied, using the only statistic I’ve found that communicates the kind of world-changing loss that this pandemic will cause. “If Dr. Fauci’s projections are correct, it will be the equivalent of 30–60 9/11s.” The chat went quiet for a while after that. The numbers I was referring to have quickly gone out of date — they’re much higher now. But comparing this pandemic to other mass casualty, world-shaping events is the only way I know to make them resonate. As of this week, more than 5,000 Americans have died of the coronavirus — more than the 2,977 who died on September 11, 2001. More than any other event in my life, 9/11 changed the world: inspiring national security policies like the Patriot Act, jump-starting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — the latter of which has become the longest-running war in US history — and leading to the creation of the Transportation Security Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Department of Homeland Security, effectively militarizing the United States’ borders and immigration services. On Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said, optimistically, if we continue practicing social distancing, between 100,000 and 200,000 Americans would die of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Projections are always bounded by inaccuracies (and there have been plenty in the past few months) — but if Fauci were correct, the death toll would be as if there were a 9/11 attack every day for the next two to three months. My grandmother was born in 1928; she spent the first 10 years of her life living through the Great Depression in the Oklahoma Dust Bowl and the last five years of her life hoarding food until it rotted in her fridge and pantry. The trauma never left. Neither will the trauma of thousands upon thousands of deaths once it’s safe to leave our homes. When we emerge, we will be different people in a different world.

“The Authoritarian Creep” If China’s claim to have won supremacy over the virus is to be believed, the country was able to make up for a botched early response by mobilizing its vast and intricate surveillance infrastructure to carry out an authoritarian crackdown, the terrifying scale of which is only matched by the terrifying fear among Western liberals that it was necessary. Payment apps like Alipay and WeChat installed software to track users' movements. China’s state-run telecom color-coded users’ phones in red, green, and yellow, based on their risk of possible infection — which were then checked by guards at train stations. Those who broke quarantine were reported to the police. Chinese social media platforms like Weibo and WeChat were heavily censored to quell conspiracy theories and rumors. Those efforts may be working. The country is reporting that its case numbers are decreasing, and it has banned virtually all foreigners from entering the country as it attempts to return to normal without a second spike. Yet it’s hard to know exactly how real the claims are that China has flattened its curve. Three US officials told Bloomberg on Wednesday that the US intelligence community had concluded China’s numbers are actually much higher than what’s been reported. But with the US and Europe struggling to contain the outbreak, analysts have started asking whether China will emerge from this pandemic as the new global superpower. Jeremy Lee Wallace, a Cornell professor and leader of the university’s China's Cities research group, told BuzzFeed News the country is definitely attempting to position itself as a new global leader amid the pandemic. “[China] styled itself a leader in climate change and international trade following the election of Donald Trump and is proudly boasting of its successes in fighting COVID-19,” Wallace said. “Whether it will work depends on the outcomes in other countries and how those outcomes are perceived.” Presenting itself as a responsible custodian is now central to the Chinese Communist Party’s propaganda strategy. Chinese diplomats and state media outlets are sparring directly with President Donald Trump’s own ad hoc online army on platforms like Twitter and YouTube, criticizing the US for its inability to mitigate the damage of the outbreak. Jack Ma, the Chinese billionaire cofounder of the multinational tech company Alibaba Group, recently tweeted two photos of medical supplies being loaded onto a China Cargo Airlines flight. “The first shipment of masks and coronavirus test kits to the US is taking off from Shanghai. All the best to our friends in America,” Ma wrote. According to the Jack Ma Foundation, the shipment contained 500,000 testing kits and 1 million masks. Ma’s foundations have already claimed to have shipped 1.8 million masks and 100,000 test kits to other heavily affected countries. Chinese state media is very aware it’s a Chinese billionaire shipping tests and masks around the world, not an American one. “China has shared its experience, but many Western countries are just not willing to follow. When the pandemic is over, these countries will find that it was not China that had led to the severe conditions in the US and Europe, but their own wrong judgments and choices,” the Global Times wrote Wednesday. David Jacobson, professor of global business strategy at Southern Methodist University's Cox School of Business and a visiting professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing, told BuzzFeed News he worries China’s test-and-mask diplomacy could fall apart, citing reports of European countries sending back faulty equipment. “In the world of the Communist Party state propaganda, which is probably the most powerful arm right now because it's trying to globally set the narrative of how China's viewed, they're saying, ‘We're here to help, we learned all these lessons, and we're here to help the world.’” he said. Jacobson said he’s optimistic that countries will see through the spin. “The world is seeing the sham,” he said. “If the tests don't work, test diplomacy doesn't work.” But it’s not just in an ascendant China — an authoritarian COVID-19 creep is on the rise everywhere. NPR called semi-authoritarian city-state Singapore a “coronavirus model.” The country flattened its curve by setting up early proactive measures like a virus-fighting task force, strict hospital and home quarantines, and a ban on large gatherings. It also used a technique called contact tracing, building a movement log of the infected through surveillance footage, digital signatures left by ATM card withdrawals or credit card payments, and a Bluetooth-tracking smartphone app called TraceTogether. The European Union now has its first dictatorship. On Monday, the Hungarian Parliament passed a bill giving Prime Minister Viktor Orbán the right to rule by decree indefinitely, establishing a COVID-19 state of emergency without a time limit, suspending both Parliament and elections, and instituting prison time for spreading “fake news” or rumors. Countries like Israel, Italy, and Austria are working with their telecommunications networks to use anonymized location data to track people in infection hot spots and monitor if citizens are breaking stay-in-place orders. Russia is using its massive 170,000-camera facial recognition system to catch people who violate quarantine and self-isolation. Hong Kong has deployed electronic bracelets for those who test positive for the virus. Turkmenistan’s state-controlled media outlets are no longer allowed to use the word “coronavirus,” and it has been removed from health information brochures. India has been particularly aggressive about containing the pandemic and tracking the infected. The country has experimented with stamping people who have been infected with ink that doesn’t wash off for weeks. The Indian central government is seeking a ruling from the country’s Supreme Court that would force all media outlets to receive approval to print, publish, or telecast content about COVID-19. And in the country’s southern state of Karnataka, quarantined people are now required to download an app on their phones, through which they must take and send a selfie — which includes GPS coordinates in its metadata — every hour to government officials. US companies like Facebook and Google are discussing how to track infection hot spots using anonymized location data, while American leaders are asking if the coronavirus is the kind of emergency that requires setting aside privacy and civil liberties.

“A Greater Depression” The immediate effects of the pandemic — postponed weddings, canceled vacations, empty supermarket shelves, sinking housing prices, salary cuts, layoffs — suggest no one will come out of this period without losing something. But we are only at the beginning. Predicting how bad things will get economically is difficult. A viral outbreak of this scale has only happened once before in the industrialized world: the 1918 influenza pandemic that hit the world in two seasonal waves, killing 50 million people worldwide and 675,000 in the US. That pandemic occurred during World War I, which makes it hard to compare to now, even setting aside all the other changes in the past century. But according to a 2007 research paper on the economic effects of the 1918 pandemic, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the economic effects of the outbreak only lasted for a short time. “Many businesses, especially those in the service and entertainment industries, suffered double-digit losses in revenue,” the paper read. “Society as a whole recovered from the 1918 influenza quickly, but individuals who were affected by the influenza had their lives changed forever. Given our highly mobile and connected society, any future influenza pandemic is likely to be more severe in its reach, and perhaps in its virulence.” While the 1918 pandemic isn’t a perfect comparison to the modern coronavirus pandemic, Kevin Kruse, a history professor at Princeton University, told BuzzFeed News that last century's outbreak exacerbated national problems that were already building up. “The 1918 flu was part of a broader wave of disruptions and crises that rocked America. The spike in unemployment and inflation after World War I, the 1919 ‘bloody summer’ of race riots, major labor strikes that fall, the First Red Scare that winter,” Kruse said. “There was such a national sense of unease and uncertainty.” Two months into this current outbreak, massive layoffs have started, American industries have demanded bailouts, and unemployment rates have surged. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis are projecting total employment reductions of 47 million — an unemployment rate of 32.1%. According to Forbes, every sector of the American economy is shrinking: Hotel chain Marriott International is furloughing tens of thousands of workers, Landry’s, the parent company of Del Frisco’s and Bubba Gump Shrimp, laid off 40,000 workers. Air Canada plans to lay off 5,100 members of its cabin crew. Shoe retailer DSW put 80% of its workers on a temporary unpaid leave of absence. The US news industry’s advertising spending is in free fall. Digital outlets like BuzzFeed and Vice have already announced salary cuts, and the mass media company Gannett — which owns titles like USA Today, the Arizona Republic, and the Des Moines Register — announced many staffers will be furloughed for five days a month through June. The news media may receive low-interest loans, but airlines will receive nearly $60 billion in financial assistance as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which Trump signed into law last Friday, but there are already questions from industry leaders about whether that’s enough to keep the industry aloft. Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and cohost of the podcast Capitalisn’t, told BuzzFeed News that we don’t know yet how effective the CARES Act will be but added it wasn't targeted at the right industries. “I see this as purely an electoral move, which is not justified from an economic point of view,” he said. “The goal of the package is to redistribute and preserve the existing production capacity of the US economy.” He said one immediate issue is that no one knows how it will help gig workers, which make up about 7% of the country’s total employment. “My understanding is basically nobody knows,” he said. “Imagine I work as a cab driver and through this program I get paid my regular wage, but I work as an Uber driver and I get nothing.” American workers are already reacting to this economic downturn, striking and protesting. More fundamentally, the way we understand labor and class in this country is changing more than it has since the Great Depression.

“A Divided America” On Monday, a group of workers walked off the job at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island. An Amazon employee named Chris Smalls claimed the company fired him after he led a protest against its safety conditions. On Tuesday, Whole Foods Market workers held a “sick-out.” Members of the Industrial Division of Communication Workers of America protested Monday at the General Electric aviation facility in Lynn, Massachusetts, as well as its headquarters in Boston, demanding the company use its manufacturing resources to build more ventilators. Health care workers are protesting as well. Nurses across the country have begun to protest the shortages of personal protective equipment, which they say are putting their lives at risk. National Nurses United held a rally in front of Alta Bates Summit Medical Center in Oakland earlier this month. Last Saturday, more than two dozen nurses protested in front of Jacobi Hospital in the Bronx. And the fact that major American cities, including New York, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and St. Louis, have temporarily banned evictions hasn’t quelled the rumblings of a nationwide rent strike. Rent Strike 2020, the activist organization leading the push, is demanding a two-month freeze on the collection of rent, residential mortgages, and utility bills “to allow working families to do what is necessary to prepare for the difficult social measures required to flatten the outbreak curve,” the organization’s website reads. Peter Gowan, a researcher and resident fellow at the Democracy Collaborative's Next System Project, told BuzzFeed News that many Americans are learning that a lot of the economic policies they were told couldn’t be done following the 2008 financial crisis are actually possible. “You were seeing people say it's impossible to think about giving cash payments to everyone, it's impossible to increase unemployment benefits, that it's impossible to have the government tell companies what they need to be producing,” Gowan said. “But now you're seeing the Democratic Party and parts of the Republican Party telling President Trump that he needs to use the Defense Production Act to increase the production of ventilators.” But it’s not just strikes and protests; TikTok videos demonstrating Mark Zuckerberg's coronavirus donation — $25 million — compared to his total wealth — $55.1 billion — and the immediate public disgust at actor Gal Gadot’s star-studded “Imagine"" video reveal how quickly the pandemic has torn open the seams of American class consciousness. “I hope that in the coming months and years that we'll see a revitalized labor movement,” Gowan said. “I hope the left, and people in general, internalize that a lot of the things you're told are rules are actually just norms created for the preservation of property and the rights of capital.” Even though the way Americans think about the structure of their society and the value of labor is changing quickly, there are still two outbreaks in the US: One is a minor inconvenience suffered by the rich, who can abandon heavily affected urban areas for second homes, escape to “virus-free” retreats, and all seem to be getting tests. And there is a second outbreak, where delivery drivers and retail employees work under the constant threat of infection, where nurses have to use bleach to clean and reuse face masks, and where parking lots in Las Vegas are turned into homeless shelters, complete with spray-painted social distancing markers. Things are even worse for the incarcerated. At the Cook County Jail in Chicago, 134 inmates tested positive for COVID-19 this week. According to one legal organization’s analysis, coronavirus infections in New York City’s largest jail have skyrocketed to nearly 10 times the rate of the city’s residents. We are teetering dangerously close to a viral bomb going off inside ICE detention centers. A medical worker and a detainee have both tested positive for COVID-19 at a New Jersey facility earlier this month; last week, three unaccompanied immigrant children in the custody of a US refugee agency in New York tested positive for the virus. On Sunday, Trump walked back his Easter deadline for turning the economy back on, but the recent push to go back to work — pandemic or not — is still being trumpeted by prominent Republicans and right-wing media. As Trump continues prioritizing the market over human lives, his administration’s Lord of the Flies approach has left the country’s governors scrambling to fill in the gaps left by a impotent federal government — a grim fulfillment of writer James Fallows' prediction last year that America would soon be heading toward the disintegration that marked the end of the Roman Empire. Conspiracy theorists and far-right extremists are experimenting with how to use the coronavirus to their advantage. The QAnon movement and many other misinformation communities, like 5G truthers and anti-vaxxers have have been more active, latching on to the pandemic as proof of their paranoid worldviews. Tom Kawczynski, a white nationalist in Maine, is hosting a daily Coronavirus Central podcast that has been in Apple’s top 20 podcasts under the “Health & Fitness” category since the outbreak began. Last week, an international white supremacist group called the Hundred-Handers created a Twitter account claiming to be the regional arm of climate change activist group Extinction Rebellion; it tweeted photos of a fake campaign promoting the coronavirus as a natural “cure” to the human “disease.” We will exit this pandemic with a new understanding of how both our government and society work. Formerly fringe ideas on the left like universal basic income or universal health care are now household terms, online misinformation and disinformation are no longer abstract concepts but constant presences in our group chats, and malicious ideologies like ecofascism are taking root. We will need new stories, but it’s unclear who will tell them and how.

“We Live Online Now” Right now, for one of the first times in modern history, huge swaths of the Earth’s population are being told to stay indoors. Workers who can conduct business remotely are. Group videoconferencing platforms like Zoom and Houseparty have blossomed. We spend our days switching back and forth between different inboxes, emails, family group chats, Slack messages, WhatsApp groups, and Instagram DMs — the bad screen and the good screen are now the same screen. There is a strong possibility we will not suddenly revert back to full offices when the world turns back on. Christopher McKnight Nichols, history professor and director of the Center for the Humanities at Oregon State University, told BuzzFeed News that the 1918 pandemic’s biggest impact on American media was how seriously the press began to take public trust following the outbreak. “The lessons learned were largely about [news] coverage when the federal government is suppressing honest, open speech,” Nichols said. “There were rampant false cures and treatments peddled by large firms as well as those who could best be understood as charlatans. Attempting to crack down on advertising of some of this false medicine was a result.” This wave of mistrust is happening now as well. Except — contrary to the countless pieces fretting about an end to globalization, which cite the general breakdown in the rule-based global order and the deteriorating relationship between the US and China — we’re combating misinformation on a global scale we’ve never seen before. As the pandemic left China, an unverified video of a Chinese nurse overreporting the virus’s death toll spread from Chinese messaging platform WeChat to Twitter, where it was subtitled in English and then shared in huge numbers on YouTube. The same hoax about helicopters being used to disinfect cities was spotted in Italy, the Netherlands, the US, Turkey, and Argentina by fact-checkers. (While in Mumbai, workers really were being sprayed with an unknown chemical disinfectant.) Twitter's US-based moderation team took down two of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's tweets on Sunday for promoting the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which Trump has touted as a possible COVID-19 cure. By removing the ability to meet in person, by shuttering traditional entertainment, and because we are facing an increasingly undeniable and inescapable existential terror, the internet has become a global monoculture. But it’s not all hoaxes and conspiracy theories. The two most viral songs about the coronavirus outbreak are from Vietnam and the Dominican Republic. We go online to commiserate about whatever’s on Netflix (even if it’s a seven-part docuseries about a gay zookeeper who was arrested for murder-for-hire) or argue with each other about whether New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is hot (or has nipple piercings). This is not totally different to how we lived before — except there’s nothing else now.

On Monday , a bipartisan quartet of lawmakers urged Congress to include dedicated broadband funding for students and low-income families in the fourth coronavirus response package . In a letter to congressional leaders , two Republicans , Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and Rep. Roger Marshall of Kansas , and two Democrats , Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Rep. Peter Welch of Vermont , wrote that , absent legislation , “ small providers may be unable to continue to help ensure that the communities they serve can access distance learning and telehealth services . ”
Several studies have demonstrated a strong link between broadband access and economic prosperity . An analysis conducted by Microsoft published last April found that U.S. counties with the highest unemployment also had the lowest broadband usage .
“ Low-income areas tend to be more rural , ” says Tyler Cooper , BroadbandNow ’ s editor-in-chief . “ That creates sort of a vicious cycle . ”
Keith Srakocic/AP Workers install fiber-optic high-speed internet cable , March 28 , 2020 , in East Palestine , Ohio . The workers said the installation is a continuation of scheduled work that started before the current COVID-19 outbreak .
Municipal broadband initiatives , however , can help turn this vicious cycle into a virtuous one . Mr. Cooper cites Chattanooga , Tennessee , where , in 2010 , the city ’ s Electric Power Board began offering fiber-optic connections to all residents . Today , the city boasts download speeds of 1 gigabit per second , about 40 times the national average .
“ Ten years ago , that town was kind of a ghost town , ” says Mr. Cooper . “ When this network came into play , all of a sudden you had these really attractive prospects for companies . ”
Within five years , Chattanooga , whose population stands at about 180,000 , had generated between 2,800 and 5,200 new jobs , according to a study by the utility , and its lightning-fast broadband speeds had earned it a new nickname : “ Gig City . ”
Of course , having the option of purchasing high-speed internet is only part of the puzzle . You also need to be able to afford it . A recent study by the U.K. internet comparison site Cable found that prices in the United States , the country that created the internet , ranked 119th out of 195 nations , with an average internet package costing $ 67.69 a month . The same package in Mexico , by comparison , costs $ 33.15 , and in Canada it costs $ 34.86 .
The result is a sharp divide along racial and class lines over who has broadband ; one that , like all such divides , is becoming starker as the pandemic lockdown wears on . According to a 2015 Pew report , just 54 % of black Americans and 50 % of Hispanic residents have broadband at home , compared with 72 % of their white counterparts . According to the report , more Americans are relying on their smartphones to get online , which works fine for consuming content , but is difficult for , say , composing a résumé .
“ We ’ re all participating in this mass experiment . We ’ re shifting large amounts of our economy into this online world , ” says Mr. Cooper . “ Without a doubt this crisis will show us pretty definitively the importance of broadband in the home . ”
Meg Kinnard/AP Wi-Fi-enabled school buses – like this one seen at an apartment complex in Winnsboro , South Carolina , on March 27 , 2020 – are being sent to rural and lower-income areas around South Carolina to help homebound students with distance learning .
America ’ s digital divide is not just about access to technology , says Ms. West , but what she calls “ digital readiness , ” which she defines as “ the combination of skills , but also trust plus willingness ” to use technology .
“ It ’ s not just , can you click a button ? ” she says . “ It ’ s , do you understand how the systems work so that you can use the tools ? ”
“ The skills are one set of things you teach people , ” says Ms. West . “ But even if somebody told you how to do copy and paste , if you don ’ t know how to evaluate a website , or you don ’ t know how to go through all the hurdles of putting your credit card online , you ’ re in a not-as-ready position to do the things you need to do . ”
For students , the sudden shift to online learning can widen this gap . Now , some students are having their education streamed to them on home computers in their parents ’ home offices , while others are making do with their phones in crowded apartments .
“ Education was in some ways the great leveler for a universal basic level of study , ” says Ms. West . “ Everyone gets a clean bathroom and a meal they can afford and an education that is geared more or less toward everybody . ”
For Ms. Olsen , a librarian at the Lanpher Memorial Library in Hyde Park , Vermont , and the president of the Vermont Library Association , her lack of reliable internet access forced her family to make a wrenching choice : Her two children , students at the University of Vermont in Burlington , are spending the lockdown not back at home , but with friends who have broadband .
“ It was a hard decision , ” she says . “ I can call , but I can ’ t see their faces . ”
As the lockdown drags on , a number of internet service providers are attempting to ensure access . Comcast , for instance , has agreed not to disconnect anyone ’ s service or charge late fees . Along with Charter Communications , the company has agreed to open free Wi-Fi hotspots across the country . Comcast , Charter , and Spectrum are also offering free trial periods of 60 or 90 days to low-income households . And , around the country , many school districts are repurposing their buses as mobile Wi-Fi hotspots , to help ensure that their students stay connected .

Peter Welch of Vermont, wrote that, absent legislation, “small providers may be unable to continue to help ensure that the communities they serve can access distance learning and telehealth services.”

A vicious cycle

Several studies have demonstrated a strong link between broadband access and economic prosperity. An analysis conducted by Microsoft published last April found that U.S. counties with the highest unemployment also had the lowest broadband usage.

“Low-income areas tend to be more rural,” says Tyler Cooper, BroadbandNow’s editor-in-chief. “That creates sort of a vicious cycle.”

Keith Srakocic/AP Workers install fiber-optic high-speed internet cable, March 28, 2020, in East Palestine, Ohio. The workers said the installation is a continuation of scheduled work that started before the current COVID-19 outbreak.

Municipal broadband initiatives, however, can help turn this vicious cycle into a virtuous one. Mr. Cooper cites Chattanooga, Tennessee, where, in 2010, the city’s Electric Power Board began offering fiber-optic connections to all residents. Today, the city boasts download speeds of 1 gigabit per second, about 40 times the national average.

“Ten years ago, that town was kind of a ghost town,” says Mr. Cooper. “When this network came into play, all of a sudden you had these really attractive prospects for companies.”

Within five years, Chattanooga, whose population stands at about 180,000, had generated between 2,800 and 5,200 new jobs, according to a study by the utility, and its lightning-fast broadband speeds had earned it a new nickname: “Gig City.”

Of course, having the option of purchasing high-speed internet is only part of the puzzle. You also need to be able to afford it. A recent study by the U.K. internet comparison site Cable found that prices in the United States, the country that created the internet, ranked 119th out of 195 nations, with an average internet package costing $67.69 a month. The same package in Mexico, by comparison, costs $33.15, and in Canada it costs $34.86.

The result is a sharp divide along racial and class lines over who has broadband; one that, like all such divides, is becoming starker as the pandemic lockdown wears on. According to a 2015 Pew report, just 54% of black Americans and 50% of Hispanic residents have broadband at home, compared with 72% of their white counterparts. According to the report, more Americans are relying on their smartphones to get online, which works fine for consuming content, but is difficult for, say, composing a résumé.

“We’re all participating in this mass experiment. We’re shifting large amounts of our economy into this online world,” says Mr. Cooper. “Without a doubt this crisis will show us pretty definitively the importance of broadband in the home.”

Meg Kinnard/AP Wi-Fi-enabled school buses – like this one seen at an apartment complex in Winnsboro, South Carolina, on March 27, 2020 – are being sent to rural and lower-income areas around South Carolina to help homebound students with distance learning.

Prerequisite for modern life?

America’s digital divide is not just about access to technology, says Ms. West, but what she calls “digital readiness,” which she defines as “the combination of skills, but also trust plus willingness” to use technology.

“It’s not just, can you click a button?” she says. “It’s, do you understand how the systems work so that you can use the tools?”

“The skills are one set of things you teach people,” says Ms. West. “But even if somebody told you how to do copy and paste, if you don’t know how to evaluate a website, or you don’t know how to go through all the hurdles of putting your credit card online, you’re in a not-as-ready position to do the things you need to do.”

For students, the sudden shift to online learning can widen this gap. Now, some students are having their education streamed to them on home computers in their parents’ home offices, while others are making do with their phones in crowded apartments.

“Education was in some ways the great leveler for a universal basic level of study,” says Ms. West. “Everyone gets a clean bathroom and a meal they can afford and an education that is geared more or less toward everybody.”

For Ms. Olsen, a librarian at the Lanpher Memorial Library in Hyde Park, Vermont, and the president of the Vermont Library Association, her lack of reliable internet access forced her family to make a wrenching choice: Her two children, students at the University of Vermont in Burlington, are spending the lockdown not back at home, but with friends who have broadband.

“It was a hard decision,” she says. “I can call, but I can’t see their faces.”

As the lockdown drags on, a number of internet service providers are attempting to ensure access. Comcast, for instance, has agreed not to disconnect anyone’s service or charge late fees. Along with Charter Communications, the company has agreed to open free Wi-Fi hotspots across the country. Comcast, Charter, and Spectrum are also offering free trial periods of 60 or 90 days to low-income households. And, around the country, many school districts are repurposing their buses as mobile Wi-Fi hotspots, to help ensure that their students stay connected.

“It’s encouraging to see ISPs rising to the occasion,” says Mr. Cooper. “The internet is no longer a luxury. It’s really a prerequisite for participating in modern life.”

People would be preparing to rally near state capitols , in concerts , and at huge fairs to fill the air with thick , pungent smoke .
But April 20 this year , on Monday , doesn ’ t come during normal times . With a coronavirus pandemic still going , much of the United States and the rest of the world are staying at home as much as possible to avoid the spread of Covid-19 , the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus . That means the large crowds and rallies that have previously taken place in Denver , San Francisco , Washington , DC , and many other places around the world are not going to happen .
Yet 4/20 will go on . Before the big day , I got emails from marijuana companies asking , for example , if I was “ throwing a virtual 4/20 smoke sesh. ” ( No , I ’ m not . ) One such company advertised “ awesome marijuana-inspired Zoom backgrounds so you can tune in and drop out , immersing yourself fully in the 4/20 experience ” — in reference to the backgrounds that can be made for the video conferencing service , Zoom , used by workplaces globally and , apparently , marijuana users throwing virtual 4/20 parties .
My first reaction to all of this was , “ What is this world ? ” But these ads also speak to the broader commercialization and mainstreaming of pot , and its growing acceptance in new realms of American life , as the drug is legalized in much of the country . That people are creating cannabis-related images for software largely linked to modern workplaces shows how far pot has come from the days when it was mostly associated with hippies and a broader counterculture movement that decried greed , corporate influences , and , really , all things mainstream .
As marijuana is legalized in more states and countries , that kind of shift will continue , with more businesses trying to take advantage of the commercialization of cannabis and reach a growing base of consumers in a newly legal market .
What is 4/20 ? And why is it on April 20 ?
Why April 20 ? There are a few possible explanations for why marijuana enthusiasts ’ day of celebration landed on this day , but the real origin remains a bit of a mystery .
Steven Hager , a former editor of the marijuana-focused news outlet High Times , told the New York Times that the holiday came out of a ritual started by a group of high school students in the 1970s . As Hager explained , a group of California teenagers ritualistically smoked marijuana every day at 4:20 pm . The ritual spread , and soon 420 became code for smoking marijuana . Eventually , 420 was converted into 4/20 for calendar purposes , and the day of celebration was born . ( A group of Californians published documents giving this theory legitimacy , but it ’ s unclear if their claims are valid . )
One common belief is that 420 was the California police or penal code for marijuana , but there ’ s no evidence to support that claim .
Another theory is that there are 420 active chemicals in marijuana , hence an obvious connection between the drug and the number . But there are more than 500 active ingredients in marijuana , and only about 70 or so are cannabinoids unique to the plant , according to the Dutch Association for Legal Cannabis and Its Constituents as Medicine .
A lesser-known possibility comes from the 1939 short story “ In the Walls of Eryx ” by H.P . Lovecraft and Kenneth Sterling . The story describes “ curious mirage-plants ” that seemed fairly similar to marijuana and appeared to get the narrator high at , according to his watch , around 4:20 . Since the story is from 1939 , it ’ s perhaps the earliest written link between marijuana and 420 .
Whatever its origins , 4/20 has become a massive holiday for cannabis aficionados .
What 4/20 stands for varies from person to person . Some people just want to get high and have fun . Others see the day as a moment to push for legalization , or celebrate legalization now that more states are adopting it and popular opinion is behind it .
In the 1970s , 4/20 was part of a smaller counterculture movement that embraced marijuana as a symbol to protest against broader systemic problems in the US , like overseas wars and the power of corporations in America . “ Marijuana was the way you said you weren ’ t a suit , ” Keith Humphreys , a drug policy expert at Stanford University , previously told me .
In recent years , marijuana legalization activists have tried to bring a more formal aspect to the celebration , framing it as a moment to push their political agenda . Organizers for the 2014 Denver rally — during the first year marijuana sales were legal in the state — put out a statement comparing the battle for legal marijuana to “ the time when Jews fled from slavery in Egypt , ” a moment commemorated in Passover celebrations . “ This year ’ s rally represents the continuing fight for freedom from economic slavery for marginalized members of our community and a rebirth of creative genius that will get us there , ” they wrote .
Businesses are also trying to take advantage of the holiday . Eddie Miller , the CEO of Invest in Cannabis , which seeks to bring investment into the marijuana industry , told me in the early years of state-level legalization that his company was trying to build and sponsor major 4/20 gatherings around the country — similar to what other companies , some of which Miller has been involved with , have done with holidays like St. Patrick ’ s Day .
“ Our perspective is 4/20 is a real holiday — no smaller than St. Patrick ’ s Day or Halloween , ” Miller previously told me . “ It ’ s just nobody knows about it yet . And our company is going to let everyone know about it . ”
Of course , these kinds of massive celebrations aren ’ t going to happen — or at least shouldn ’ t happen — in the middle of a coronavirus pandemic in which everyone is being told to stay home as much as possible to flatten the curve . But that they ’ d certainly happen if we weren ’ t in the middle of a pandemic speaks to how much 4/20 and broader attitudes toward marijuana have changed .
Originally , 4/20 was a counterculture holiday to protest , at least in part , the social and legal stigmas against marijuana . Marijuana legalization undercuts that purpose : As big businesses and corporations begin to grow , sell , and market pot , marijuana is losing its status as a counterculture symbol — and that , Humphreys speculated , could bring the end of the traditional , countercultural 4/20 .
“ If a corporate marijuana industry adopts 4/20 , it would still be a celebrated event , but not with the same countercultural meaning , ” Humphreys said . “ People celebrated Christmas long before it became an occasion for an orgy of gift-buying and materialist consumption , but the meaning of the holiday for most people was different then than it is now . ”
Companies such as Invest in Cannabis admit they ’ re already leveraging the holiday as another opportunity to promote the industry and its products — much like beer and other alcohol companies now do with St. Patrick ’ s Day .
“ Our perspective is 4/20 is a real holiday — no smaller than St. Patrick ’ s Day or Halloween ”
“ The media is covering 4/20 as a consumer interest story , ” Miller of Invest in Cannabis said . “ But some portion of the media is covering 4/20 as a call to arms for the industry — so [ in 2015 ] there are multiple competitive business conferences that are happening in Denver , the [ San Francisco ] Bay Area , and Las Vegas . ”
The pot industry has also gotten directly involved in 4/20 events . The Cannabis Cup , for example , has become a major event at a selected city ’ s 4/20 rally , where hundreds of vendors show off their finest marijuana products to tens of thousands of attendees . The event has steadily grown over the years , featuring big concerts from notable musicians like Snoop Dogg , Soja , and 2 Chainz , as well as a wide collection of marijuana businesses as sponsors .
The Cannabis Cup has been only one of many events , which also include comedy shows ( like Cheech and Chong ) , marijuana-friendly speed dating , and trade shows for glass pipes and bongs , offering businesses and celebrities various opportunities to push their products and brands .
Things have changed this year : Due to the coronavirus , the Cannabis Cup , scheduled to take place in Oklahoma , was delayed until May 11 to 15 — and that ’ s still subject to further delays , depending on how the pandemic rolls on .
Now , that may not mean much to the people who are celebrating 4/20 more traditionally . Some people don ’ t attend public festivities at all , choosing instead to stay home and enjoy a joint ( or more ) with their friends . For them , 4/20 remains a more casual affair void of big sponsorships and marketing .
But in public , 4/20 has increasingly become a commercial holiday — with the coronavirus outbreak putting a pause on things for now .
The shift in 4/20 from a counterculture holiday to a more corporate one shows how legalization is changing marijuana .
To many legalizers , this is a sign of their success . Legalization campaigns often adopt the tagline “ regulate marijuana like alcohol. ” That this is actually happening as the cannabis industry takes a form similar to the alcohol industry is a sign that legalizers are winning .
This has been true even in the middle of a pandemic . Some states , for example , have deemed liquor stores “ essential ” through their stay-at-home orders and allowed them to stay open during lockdowns . Some of these states have made a similar determination for marijuana stores , allowing them to stay open despite stay-at-home orders . It ’ s another clear way that marijuana is increasingly treated like alcohol and other legal drugs .
To some drug policy experts and legalizers , though , this is all a cause for alarm . The concern is that a big marijuana industry will , similar to the tobacco and alcohol industries , irresponsibly market its drug to kids or users who already consume the drug excessively — with little care for public health and safety over the desire for profits .
To this end , many drug policy experts see alcohol as a warning , not something to be admired and followed for other drugs . For decades , big alcohol has successfully lobbied lawmakers to block tax increases and regulations on alcohol , all while marketing its product as fun and sexy in television programs , such as the Super Bowl , that are viewed by millions of Americans , including children . Meanwhile , alcohol is linked to 88,000 deaths each year in the US .
“ Marijuana was the way you said you weren ’ t a suit ”
If marijuana companies are able to act like the tobacco and alcohol industries have in the past , there ’ s a good chance they ’ ll convince more Americans to try or even regularly use marijuana , and some of the heaviest users may use more of the drug . And as these companies increase their profits , they ’ ll be able to influence lawmakers in a way that could stifle regulations or other policies that curtail cannabis misuse . All of that will likely prove bad for public health .
The situation almost certainly will not be as bad as alcohol , since alcohol is simply more dangerous than marijuana . Pot ’ s risks , for one , tend to be nonfatal or at least much less fatal than alcohol : addiction and overuse , accidents , nondeadly overdoses that lead to mental anguish and anxiety , and , in rare cases , potentially psychotic episodes . Marijuana has never been definitively linked to any serious ailments — not deadly overdoses or lung disease . And it ’ s much less likely — around one-tenth as likely , based on data for fatal car crashes — to cause deadly accidents than alcohol .
Given this , the focus for drug policy experts tends to be the risk of addiction and overuse . As Jon Caulkins , a drug policy expert at Carnegie Mellon University , has told me , “ At some level , we know that spending more than half of your waking hours intoxicated for years and years on end is not increasing the likelihood that you ’ ll win a Pulitzer Prize or discover the cure for cancer . ”
But these risks are still risks . Yet as the marijuana industry grows , it ’ s likely that the dangers will be issues the industry just doesn ’ t care much about — and it will market its products excessively for as much profit as possible , even if it means more public health or safety problems along the way .
The grim good news for those concerned with commercialization is that the coronavirus pandemic has forced a temporary halt on some of the commercial activity that could be expected around marijuana this 4/20 . The bad news is it ’ s only a pause as the pandemic plays out — because , as the past few years of 4/20 celebrations show , cannabis really has evolved from a counterculture symbol to another commodity that companies can make a lot of money from .

We’re staying. We’re a team.”

It certainly doesn’t always happen, but the professional ideal is clear, she concludes. “You can save lives. And when you can’t save lives you can be in the darkness with patients even if there is nothing to offer. You stay.”

Med schools are struggling to become more humane and less macho, more relationship-centered and less body-centered. But when you look at what’s happening across the country right now, you see the benefits of their tough training.

This week The Times Magazine ran a diary by an E.R. doctor named Helen Ouyang. To enter the E.R. with her in this crisis is to enter another world.

Normal procedures crumble under the crush of patients. A man dies unattended, sitting in a chair. A veteran physician feels stripped of his invincibility. The core of Ouyang’s diary is her acceptance that it’s impossible to do her work and still stay safe. “It seems impossible to avoid getting infected.”

Death and talk of death is everywhere. The virus seems to do whatever it wants. “We put our full minds and whole hearts into trying to save them. Then I see their bodies shut down anyway. They are alone.” Wearing the same masks for so long etches lines into her face, but she keeps going back in.

There’s absolutely no self-glorification here, just endurance. I’m reminded of Dr. Albert Schweitzer’s 1931 memoir. When hiring doctors for his hospital in the African jungle, he wrote, he never hired anyone who thought he was doing something grand and heroic. The only doctors who would last are those who thought what they were doing was as ordinary and necessary as doing the dishes: “There are no heroes of action — only heroes of renunciation and suffering.”",www.nytimes.com,left,YCPlhUzXA387uADv

The class war in our country isn’t a matter of the poor vs. the rich; it’s a matter of business class vs. first class, E-Class vs. S-Class.

Where the Left goes, squalor follows.

The scene in militia-occupied Seattle is entirely familiar, the same kind of theatrical filth that has been a part of American counterculture from Woodstock through Occupy Wall Street. These are the idiot children of the American ruling class, toy radicals and Champagne Bolsheviks playing Jacobin for a while until they go back to graduate school.

culture,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2020/7/3/21309935/qanon-supporters-winning-congressional-primaries-explained,"The QAnon supporters winning congressional primaries, explained",2020-07-03,"Cameron Peters, Rebecca Heilweil, Dylan Scott, Aja Romano, Ian Millhiser, German Lopez","“ Where we go one , we go all ” is a frequent slogan of adherents to QAnon , a fringe conspiracy theory that posits the existence of a pedophilic “ deep state ” working against President Donald Trump .
Now , it looks like at least a couple of them could be going to Washington .
On Tuesday , restaurateur Lauren Boebert defeated five-term incumbent Rep. Scott Tipton for the GOP nomination in Colorado ’ s Third District . Boebert is a conservative gun rights activist who touts her support for Trump , as well as her belief in “ personal freedom , citizen rights , and upholding the Constitution of the United States , ” on her campaign website .
She ’ s seemingly also on board with QAnon : In May , she told far-right personality and QAnon supporter Ann Vandersteel that the theory isn ’ t really her “ thing , ” but then later added , “ I hope that [ Q ] is real , because it only means America is getting stronger and better and people are returning to conservative values . ”
And in the traditionally Republican Colorado Third District — Tipton won by about 8 points in 2018 — Boebert is also the favorite to win in November .
If she does , odds are good she won ’ t be alone in her familiarity with QAnon when she gets to Congress . Marjorie Taylor Greene , a Georgia Republican , almost won her primary outright in Georgia ’ s 14th District , which lacks an incumbent , and she ’ s on track to win again in the August runoff . Greene is even more open in her support for the conspiracy theory : In a 2017 video discussing it — one of several first uncovered by Politico — she told supporters that “ there ’ s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles out , and I think we have the president to do it . ”
Boebert and Greene are the two QAnon-supporting candidates most likely to make it to Congress this November , but they ’ re not the only ones who have a shot . According to Media Matters , there are at least eight other QAnon-friendly candidates for Congress who have already won their primaries , as well as one more ( in addition to Greene ) who ’ s headed for a runoff .
It ’ s a surprising number of people to have successfully running for office while embracing an objectively wild conspiracy theory . But maybe not that surprising — after all , one of the president ’ s sons posted a QAnon graphic on Instagram just last month .
Candidates don ’ t need to explicitly endorse conspiracy theories to elevate them
According to Travis View , a QAnon expert and co-host of the podcast QAnon Anonymous , part of it is just politics , albeit a particularly Faustian variety . The fanatical dedication to QAnon that characterizes many of the conspiracy ’ s acolytes turns out to be very effective when it comes to spreading a particular candidate ’ s message — or , at least , it is if they think a candidate is on their side .
Of Boebert , View says , “ I feel like she ’ s being very crafty in that she seems aware of what she needs to say in order to give enough wink and acknowledgment to the QAnon community without out-and-out endorsing it . ”
We can now add Lauren Boebert to the ever-growing list of QAnon supporters who are running for Congress . https : //t.co/VJbFGkYKLx pic.twitter.com/m1bklAfikp — Right Wing Watch ( @ RightWingWatch ) May 18 , 2020
Boebert has continued to walk that fine line since her win on Tuesday . “ I ’ m glad the [ inspector general ] and the [ attorney general ] are investigating deep state activities that undermine the President , ” she said in a statement to ███ . “ I don ’ t follow QAnon . ”
But Graham Brookie , an expert on disinformation and the director of the Atlantic Council ’ s Digital Forensic Research Lab , says that whether candidates like Boebert officially lay claim to the conspiracy theory doesn ’ t matter too much .
“ She may not identify as an adherent of QAnon conspiracy theories , ” Brookie , a native of Colorado ’ s Third District , said in an interview with ███ , “ but she has certainly amplified them provably , and the impact is the same on the audience . ”
I also happen to run a nonpartisan center dedicated to identifying & explaining disinformation .
So let me explain this : Lauren Boebert is an unabashed conspiracy theorist , who spreads QAnon & is unfit for elected office . https : //t.co/CZX86BYSbR — Graham Brookie ( @ GrahamBrookie ) July 1 , 2020
QAnon supporters — and believers of other conspiracies — are “ primed to believe in code words and secrets , ” as ███ ’ s Jane Coaston explained :
Conspiracy theories create order out of chaos , attempting to make sense of events that don ’ t make sense . And researchers have found that fact-based arguments against them only serve to reinforce them in the minds of believers . That ’ s what makes QAnon or Sandy Hook trutherism or any other conspiracy theory so difficult to combat : Because conspiracy theories aren ’ t based on facts , conspiracy theorists aren ’ t receptive to them either .
Not all QAnon-friendly candidates are like Boebert , though : Some exist much closer to the Greene end of the spectrum .
Specifically , View describes some QAnon supporters as “ pragmatic ” in their embrace of the conspiracy theory : “ cynical grifters who see the QAnon community as a bunch of people who can be exploited for money or online audiences , ” or even to win a Republican primary .
But in other cases , he says , “ you see people who are genuinely radicalized by the QAnon story. ” For example , View says , Jo Rae Perkins , who won the Republican nomination for Senate in Oregon , appears to be a “ true believer ” ; she even made explicit reference to Q in her victory speech this May .
Tacit support for QAnon makes sense for some candidates in today ’ s GOP
When it comes to the recent surge in QAnon-supporting candidates , most of their voters — and there are about 600,000 of them , according to a calculation by the Washington Post — aren ’ t voting for Q directly . In fact , just over three-quarters of Americans have never heard of QAnon . But while QAnon encompasses a lot of truly wild conspiracies , at its heart , View says , is “ pervasive institutional distrust ” : a belief that “ the whole of mainstream media , the whole of the political system is entirely , irredeemably corrupt . ”

Now, it looks like at least a couple of them could be going to Washington.

On Tuesday, restaurateur Lauren Boebert defeated five-term incumbent Rep. Scott Tipton for the GOP nomination in Colorado’s Third District. Boebert is a conservative gun rights activist who touts her support for Trump, as well as her belief in “personal freedom, citizen rights, and upholding the Constitution of the United States,” on her campaign website.

She’s seemingly also on board with QAnon: In May, she told far-right personality and QAnon supporter Ann Vandersteel that the theory isn’t really her “thing,” but then later added, “I hope that [Q] is real, because it only means America is getting stronger and better and people are returning to conservative values.”

And in the traditionally Republican Colorado Third District — Tipton won by about 8 points in 2018 — Boebert is also the favorite to win in November.

If she does, odds are good she won’t be alone in her familiarity with QAnon when she gets to Congress. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, almost won her primary outright in Georgia’s 14th District, which lacks an incumbent, and she’s on track to win again in the August runoff. Greene is even more open in her support for the conspiracy theory: In a 2017 video discussing it — one of several first uncovered by Politico — she told supporters that “there’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles out, and I think we have the president to do it.”

Boebert and Greene are the two QAnon-supporting candidates most likely to make it to Congress this November, but they’re not the only ones who have a shot. According to Media Matters, there are at least eight other QAnon-friendly candidates for Congress who have already won their primaries, as well as one more (in addition to Greene) who’s headed for a runoff.

It’s a surprising number of people to have successfully running for office while embracing an objectively wild conspiracy theory. But maybe not that surprising — after all, one of the president’s sons posted a QAnon graphic on Instagram just last month.

Candidates don’t need to explicitly endorse conspiracy theories to elevate them

According to Travis View, a QAnon expert and co-host of the podcast QAnon Anonymous, part of it is just politics, albeit a particularly Faustian variety. The fanatical dedication to QAnon that characterizes many of the conspiracy’s acolytes turns out to be very effective when it comes to spreading a particular candidate’s message — or, at least, it is if they think a candidate is on their side.

Of Boebert, View says, “I feel like she’s being very crafty in that she seems aware of what she needs to say in order to give enough wink and acknowledgment to the QAnon community without out-and-out endorsing it.”

We can now add Lauren Boebert to the ever-growing list of QAnon supporters who are running for Congress. https://t.co/VJbFGkYKLx pic.twitter.com/m1bklAfikp — Right Wing Watch (@RightWingWatch) May 18, 2020

Boebert has continued to walk that fine line since her win on Tuesday. “I’m glad the [inspector general] and the [attorney general] are investigating deep state activities that undermine the President,” she said in a statement to Vox. “I don’t follow QAnon.”

But Graham Brookie, an expert on disinformation and the director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, says that whether candidates like Boebert officially lay claim to the conspiracy theory doesn’t matter too much.

“She may not identify as an adherent of QAnon conspiracy theories,” Brookie, a native of Colorado’s Third District, said in an interview with Vox, “but she has certainly amplified them provably, and the impact is the same on the audience.”

I was born & raised in #CO03.



This is my home.



I also happen to run a nonpartisan center dedicated to identifying & explaining disinformation.



So let me explain this: Lauren Boebert is an unabashed conspiracy theorist, who spreads QAnon & is unfit for elected office. https://t.co/CZX86BYSbR — Graham Brookie (@GrahamBrookie) July 1, 2020

QAnon supporters — and believers of other conspiracies — are “primed to believe in code words and secrets,” as Vox’s Jane Coaston explained:

Conspiracy theories create order out of chaos, attempting to make sense of events that don’t make sense. And researchers have found that fact-based arguments against them only serve to reinforce them in the minds of believers. That’s what makes QAnon or Sandy Hook trutherism or any other conspiracy theory so difficult to combat: Because conspiracy theories aren’t based on facts, conspiracy theorists aren’t receptive to them either.

Not all QAnon-friendly candidates are like Boebert, though: Some exist much closer to the Greene end of the spectrum.

Specifically, View describes some QAnon supporters as “pragmatic” in their embrace of the conspiracy theory: “cynical grifters who see the QAnon community as a bunch of people who can be exploited for money or online audiences,” or even to win a Republican primary.

But in other cases, he says, “you see people who are genuinely radicalized by the QAnon story.” For example, View says, Jo Rae Perkins, who won the Republican nomination for Senate in Oregon, appears to be a “true believer”; she even made explicit reference to Q in her victory speech this May.

Tacit support for QAnon makes sense for some candidates in today’s GOP

When it comes to the recent surge in QAnon-supporting candidates, most of their voters — and there are about 600,000 of them, according to a calculation by the Washington Post — aren’t voting for Q directly. In fact, just over three-quarters of Americans have never heard of QAnon. But while QAnon encompasses a lot of truly wild conspiracies, at its heart, View says, is “pervasive institutional distrust”: a belief that “the whole of mainstream media, the whole of the political system is entirely, irredeemably corrupt.”

And in the era of Donald Trump, that kind of populist messaging plays really, really well with the Republican primary electorate. (Not only with Republicans — as the Atlantic’s David A. Graham points out, voters of all stripes can be conspiracy-prone, and our current political environment isn’t helping. But the Satanic-pedophilia stuff is basically only a thing on the extreme fringes of the GOP.)

Tipton, the Republican incumbent Boebert defeated, was endorsed by Trump — but Brookie argues that endorsement was in name only.

Meanwhile , Chicago police and Mayor Rahm Emanuel continued to shout angrily about his alleged guilt .
Cook County prosecutors are not explaining why they did what they did , so the public is still in the dark about what happened and why . Officially , Smollett 's record is expunged but there 's already a history of police leaks in the case , so the public schadenfreude surrounding him is likely to linger . And the FBI is still investigating one aspect of the case .
So where does the Smollett go from here ? Back to `` Empire '' ? Quietly into the night ? We explore some possibilities :
There will be no resolution for `` Empire '' fans in the near future . The Fox drama wrapped Season 5 in mid-March after writing Smollett out of the final two episodes . With production dark and the show on hiatus until the fall , courtroom drama will stay off the `` Empire '' set .
But writers will reconvene in June to plot out Season 6 storylines . Will they include Smollett 's character , Jamal Lyon , the gay son of Cookie and Lucius ? Yes , since he has a standard six-year contract . If Fox still decides to cut him even after the charges were dropped , it could cost them .
`` The morals clauses that are in contracts generally apply if someone is convicted of something , '' says TV historian Tim Brooks . `` Not if they ’ re accused and the charges are dropped . So he could get a lot of money out of them if they really want to get rid of him . ''
A cheaper option , should Fox decide to downplay his role in the series , is to lessen his screen time .
`` The writers have so much leeway here . They can simply make somebody ’ s role smaller , '' says Brooks , noting that even if Smollett is guaranteed a certain number of episodes a season , `` you might be in a crowd scene in the background if they want to keep you out of sight . So they really have the upper hand in this . ''
Summer break means more time for Smollett to invest in a charm offensive . Though the charges were dropped , the actor was indicted on 16 counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report about being the victim of a hate crime attack .
And with police and politicians still protesting , those allegations will continue to cloud his reputation , says Ronn Torossian , a crisis manager who has represented clients such as Sean Combs , Snoop Dogg and Nick Cannon .
Torossian thinks Smollett 's career is over , at least from a public relations perspective . No brand will want to be affiliated with him , no show or program will want him , he maintains .
`` While his record will be wiped clean , his reputation will not , '' Torossian says . `` He is likely to be remembered solely for this incident , and I think his success in Hollywood is done . His reputation will never be fully restored in the public eye . ''
He 's lucky that the charges were dropped but the messy outcome is a `` career-halting problem which he has created , '' Torossian added .
`` Generally in the world of crisis , there 's two courts to worry about , the court of law and the court of public opinion . Despite his 'success ' in the court of law , the court of public opinion decided weeks ago that they will not support him . In today 's climate , I do n't believe the public will forgive him for this . ''
Howard Bragman , veteran public relations master and founder of LaBrea.Media , says the Smollett case is a true one-off in Hollywood scandals .
`` It 's a bizarre finish to what 's been a bizarre case , '' Bragman says . `` This one is an outlier , it does n't fit any category . It 's the first scandal we ’ ve seen of this sort and it 's probably the last . But that makes it hard to read the tea leaves based on this . ''
Still , he is optimistic about Smollett 's chances of emerging from the maelstrom relatively unscathed .
`` There 's always going to be a little question over him but at the same time , the one thing that 's undeniable about this kid is his talent , acting and musically , '' Bragman says . `` That matters in Hollywood . And time is a great healer . ''
It also helps that Smollett was consistent in sticking to his story that he was attacked by two men who shouted homophobic and racist abuse , threw bleach on him , beat him and dangled a noose around his neck while shouting President Donald Trump 's campaign slogan .
'It 's kind of like a big sporting event played to a tie . '
`` We live in this deeply polarized world . If you want to be a Smollett supporter and say I knew he would be vindicated , well now you can say , 'see , he ’ s vindicated , ' `` Bragman says . `` If you say it smelled funny from the start , you can believe that , too . It 's kind of like a big sporting event played to a tie . And nobody comes out really happy . ''
Eden Gillott , another leading crisis and reputation manager , agrees that attitudes toward Smollett depend on which camp you were already in .
`` He ’ s permanently damaged in the eyes of his skeptics , '' Gillott says . `` For those who were always in his corner , this is their ' I told you so ! ' moment . … But he can not expect for things to go back to normal . He ’ s going to have to start a full-on PR campaign to clear his name in the eyes of people who weren ’ t divided either way . ''
Certain scandals are career-defining and career-ruining , Bragman says : `` Violent crime , minors , racism – those are almost impossible to come back from . ''
For Smollett , it will depend on how many more years `` Empire '' is on TV . `` He should be happy if it goes two or three more years , to give people a longer chance to see him , '' Bragman says . `` And it allows time for ( producers ) : If it 's working they will keep him and if it is n't working , then they have a reason to drop him . ''
The FBI is still investigating a threatening letter that Smollett says was sent to him a few weeks before the attack . Chicago police believe Smollett sent himself the letter . So far , the FBI will not comment on the status of their probe or the news that state prosecutors dropped the charges against Smollett .
So is it really over ? Outraged police leaders and Mayor Emanuel angrily suggested at a press conference Tuesday that it should n't be . `` There ’ s real contention '' lingering over the case , says Brooks .
Also , Smollett continues to insist he was the victim of a hate crime . So will authorities turn their attention to the two brothers , Ola and Abel Osundairo , who were the main witnesses against him ? The brothers were initially detained as suspects , then became witnesses after they told police Smollett paid for an attack as a means to bump up his profile and his TV salary .
One of Smollett 's attorneys , Patricia Brown Holmes , pointedly noted to reporters Tuesday that the brothers have already admitted they did attack Smollett , but she declined to point the police in their direction . She said Smollett just wants the case over `` so he does n't have to continue to fight and continue with the disruption to his career . ''
Brooks says some scandals can blow over quickly , replaced by something else taking over the news cycle in a day or two . `` The faster he gets it off the front page , the better for him , and the better for Fox for that matter , '' Brooks says .
Meanwhile , the future of `` Empire '' is unclear . The show , which burst on the scene as a cultural sensation in 2015 , has declined in ratings in recent years , though it 's still Fox 's No . 2 drama among young-adult viewers .
If contracts are renewed for more seasons , will Smollett be welcome in the Lyon den ? He has mama bear Cookie Lyon in his corner . `` I 'm happy that the truth has finally been set free , because I knew it all along , '' Taraji P. Henson told ███ on Tuesday . `` We 're all happy for him , and thank God the truth prevailed . ''
She added that she knows Smollett well , and `` the type of activism this young man does in his community , I know that he 's a giver – he 's not an attention seeker .
`` When I know someone , there 's nothing you can say to make me flip on them , and that 's what we miss in this world , '' she says . `` We need people that stand by us . Whatever happened to that ? Why are we so easy to believe strangers over people we know ? ''","Andrea Mandell and Maria Puente

Now what, Jussie Smollett?

In the space of two months, the ""Empire"" star, 36, has gone from crime victim to indicted crime suspect and back to victim again, now claiming total exoneration after Chicago prosecutors abandoned their case against him Tuesday. Meanwhile, Chicago police and Mayor Rahm Emanuel continued to shout angrily about his alleged guilt.

Cook County prosecutors are not explaining why they did what they did, so the public is still in the dark about what happened and why. Officially, Smollett's record is expunged but there's already a history of police leaks in the case, so the public schadenfreude surrounding him is likely to linger. And the FBI is still investigating one aspect of the case.

So where does the Smollett go from here? Back to ""Empire""? Quietly into the night? We explore some possibilities:

First things first: 'Empire' is over, until the fall.

There will be no resolution for ""Empire"" fans in the near future. The Fox drama wrapped Season 5 in mid-March after writing Smollett out of the final two episodes. With production dark and the show on hiatus until the fall, courtroom drama will stay off the ""Empire"" set.

But writers will reconvene in June to plot out Season 6 storylines. Will they include Smollett's character, Jamal Lyon, the gay son of Cookie and Lucius? Yes, since he has a standard six-year contract. If Fox still decides to cut him even after the charges were dropped, it could cost them.

""The morals clauses that are in contracts generally apply if someone is convicted of something,"" says TV historian Tim Brooks. ""Not if they’re accused and the charges are dropped. So he could get a lot of money out of them if they really want to get rid of him.""

A cheaper option, should Fox decide to downplay his role in the series, is to lessen his screen time.

""The writers have so much leeway here. They can simply make somebody’s role smaller,"" says Brooks, noting that even if Smollett is guaranteed a certain number of episodes a season, ""you might be in a crowd scene in the background if they want to keep you out of sight. So they really have the upper hand in this.""

What about his image?

Summer break means more time for Smollett to invest in a charm offensive. Though the charges were dropped, the actor was indicted on 16 counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report about being the victim of a hate crime attack.

And with police and politicians still protesting, those allegations will continue to cloud his reputation, says Ronn Torossian, a crisis manager who has represented clients such as Sean Combs, Snoop Dogg and Nick Cannon.

Torossian thinks Smollett's career is over, at least from a public relations perspective. No brand will want to be affiliated with him, no show or program will want him, he maintains.

""While his record will be wiped clean, his reputation will not,"" Torossian says. ""He is likely to be remembered solely for this incident, and I think his success in Hollywood is done. His reputation will never be fully restored in the public eye.""

He's lucky that the charges were dropped but the messy outcome is a ""career-halting problem which he has created,"" Torossian added.

""Generally in the world of crisis, there's two courts to worry about, the court of law and the court of public opinion. Despite his 'success' in the court of law, the court of public opinion decided weeks ago that they will not support him. In today's climate, I don't believe the public will forgive him for this.""

But maybe there's still hope.

Howard Bragman, veteran public relations master and founder of LaBrea.Media, says the Smollett case is a true one-off in Hollywood scandals.

""It's a bizarre finish to what's been a bizarre case,"" Bragman says. ""This one is an outlier, it doesn't fit any category. It's the first scandal we’ve seen of this sort and it's probably the last. But that makes it hard to read the tea leaves based on this.""

Still, he is optimistic about Smollett's chances of emerging from the maelstrom relatively unscathed.

""There's always going to be a little question over him but at the same time, the one thing that's undeniable about this kid is his talent, acting and musically,"" Bragman says. ""That matters in Hollywood. And time is a great healer.""

It also helps that Smollett was consistent in sticking to his story that he was attacked by two men who shouted homophobic and racist abuse, threw bleach on him, beat him and dangled a noose around his neck while shouting President Donald Trump's campaign slogan.

'It's kind of like a big sporting event played to a tie.'

""We live in this deeply polarized world. If you want to be a Smollett supporter and say I knew he would be vindicated, well now you can say, 'see, he’s vindicated,' "" Bragman says. ""If you say it smelled funny from the start, you can believe that, too. It's kind of like a big sporting event played to a tie. And nobody comes out really happy.""

Eden Gillott, another leading crisis and reputation manager, agrees that attitudes toward Smollett depend on which camp you were already in.

""He’s permanently damaged in the eyes of his skeptics,"" Gillott says. ""For those who were always in his corner, this is their 'I told you so!' moment. … But he cannot expect for things to go back to normal. He’s going to have to start a full-on PR campaign to clear his name in the eyes of people who weren’t divided either way.""

Certain scandals are career-defining and career-ruining, Bragman says: ""Violent crime, minors, racism – those are almost impossible to come back from.""

For Smollett, it will depend on how many more years ""Empire"" is on TV. ""He should be happy if it goes two or three more years, to give people a longer chance to see him,"" Bragman says. ""And it allows time for (producers): If it's working they will keep him and if it isn't working, then they have a reason to drop him.""

The story could still change

The FBI is still investigating a threatening letter that Smollett says was sent to him a few weeks before the attack. Chicago police believe Smollett sent himself the letter. So far, the FBI will not comment on the status of their probe or the news that state prosecutors dropped the charges against Smollett.

So is it really over? Outraged police leaders and Mayor Emanuel angrily suggested at a press conference Tuesday that it shouldn't be. ""There’s real contention"" lingering over the case, says Brooks.

Also, Smollett continues to insist he was the victim of a hate crime. So will authorities turn their attention to the two brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, who were the main witnesses against him? The brothers were initially detained as suspects, then became witnesses after they told police Smollett paid for an attack as a means to bump up his profile and his TV salary.

One of Smollett's attorneys, Patricia Brown Holmes, pointedly noted to reporters Tuesday that the brothers have already admitted they did attack Smollett, but she declined to point the police in their direction. She said Smollett just wants the case over ""so he doesn't have to continue to fight and continue with the disruption to his career.""

Brooks says some scandals can blow over quickly, replaced by something else taking over the news cycle in a day or two. ""The faster he gets it off the front page, the better for him, and the better for Fox for that matter,"" Brooks says.

But Cookie's in his corner

Meanwhile, the future of ""Empire"" is unclear. The show, which burst on the scene as a cultural sensation in 2015, has declined in ratings in recent years, though it's still Fox's No. 2 drama among young-adult viewers.

If contracts are renewed for more seasons, will Smollett be welcome in the Lyon den? He has mama bear Cookie Lyon in his corner. ""I'm happy that the truth has finally been set free, because I knew it all along,"" Taraji P. Henson told USA TODAY on Tuesday. ""We're all happy for him, and thank God the truth prevailed.""

She added that she knows Smollett well, and ""the type of activism this young man does in his community, I know that he's a giver – he's not an attention seeker.

""When I know someone, there's nothing you can say to make me flip on them, and that's what we miss in this world,"" she says. ""We need people that stand by us. Whatever happened to that? Why are we so easy to believe strangers over people we know?""

The weeks-long investigation into the alleged hate crime attack –- an alarming account that sizzled with a spectrum of hot button issues ranging from race , sexuality and politics to crime and celebrity -- riveted and distressed a deeply-divided nation .
Standing before Cook County Circuit Court Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke , Jr. , Smollett appeared to remain steadfast in his refutation of the felony charge against him . He has repeatedly insisted that the attack was real and that he was merely a victim , not a perpetrator . If convicted of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false report , the actor faces up to three years in prison .
When first assistant state attorney Risa Lanier told Lyke that the actor had picked up two brothers who authorities say carried out the staged attack on him at his direction and showed them the location of where he wanted to be attacked , Smollett shook his head in disagreement .
When Lyke told Smollett that the allegations , if true , are `` utterly outrageous , '' the actor nodded his head in agreement -- doing so again when Lyke said the noose detail would be the most despicable part of the alleged scheme .
The judge also ordered pre-trial monitoring of the actor , and ordered him to stay away from the two brothers he allegedly conspired with to stage the hoax attack , according to police .
The tense courtroom appearance followed on the heels of a morning press conference at which a visibly angry Johnson castigated the actor for betraying his race and his city with such an incendiary false claim .
`` Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career , '' a visibly angry Johnson said . “ I am left hanging my head asking ‘ why ? ’ . Why would anyone , especially an African-American man , use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations ? ... How can an individual who 's been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in the city in the face with these false claims ? ''
Johnson charged that Smollett , an actor on the hit show 'Empire ' who has consistently denied any role in staging the alleged attack , orchestrated it because he was `` dissatisfied with his salary . ''
In addition to staging the attack , officials said , Smollett also sent himself a hate-filled letter to the Fox studio where the hit show is filmed .
Smollett turned himself in at 5:15 a.m. local time and made a statement to police before being taken into custody . His lawyers , Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson , were not present at the time but they released a statement the night before .
`` Like any other citizen , Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence , particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information , both true and false , has been repeatedly leaked . Given these circumstances , we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense . ''
Thursday evening , the attorneys released a statement criticizing law enforcement 's handling of the case .
`` Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system . The presumption of innocence , a bedrock in the search for justice , was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably , on the eve of a Mayoral election , '' the statement read . `` Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing . ''
Police add that Smollett gave no statement to police after turning himself in and that his lawyers had reached out to them Wednesday night to discuss his surrender . Smollett wanted to turn himself in near midnight , but authorities suggested he come in at 5 a.m. instead , to avoid spending the night in jail . Smollett arrived early Thursday morning accompanied by a female lawyer and an entourage of five or six people .
Smollett was silent as he went through the motions of being booked and processed .
By late morning on Thursday , the backlash against the actor began at the top , with an angry tweet from the President of the United States .
`` . @ JussieSmollett - what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments ! ? # MAGA '' President Donald Trump wrote in a tweet after the press conference .
In an earlier interview with ███ , Smollett was asked why he thought he was targeted and he replied that he is a strident critic of the Trump administration .
“ I come really really hard against 45 , '' he said . referring to Trump , the 45th U.S. president . `` I come really really hard against his administration , and I don ’ t hold my tongue . ”

During a press briefing later Thursday morning , Chicago law enforcement officials said that Chicago police detectives interviewed more than 100 people and reviewed dozens of police cameras trying to get to the bottom of Smollett 's claims .
“ ” How can an individual who 's been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in the city in the face with these false claims ?
Johnson , a well-regarded and popular big city police chief and Chicago native , appeared genuinely aggrieved as he described how , he said , Smollett took advantage of the pain of racism to advance his career .
`` Why would anyone use the symbol of a noose '' to further his `` own public profile , '' Johnson wondered aloud .
`` I 'm offended by what happened and I 'm angry , '' Johnson continued . `` This publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn ’ t own and certainly didn ’ t deserve . ''
Johnson , who oversees one of the nation 's largest police departments in one of its most violent cities , seemed disheartened by all the attention paid to the Smollett affair .
“ The accusation within this phony attack received national attention for weeks , ” Johnson told reporters during a press conference . “ Celebrities , news commentators and even presidential candidates weighed in on something that was choreographed by an actor . ''
`` When you get the opportunity , '' he said with a mixture of derision and frustration , `` the shooting victims and their families ? Give them the same amount of attention . ''

“ ” Chicago trusted this young man . We loved 'Empire , ' and we took this very seriously that something this hateful could happen in our city .
In an interview with `` Good Morning America '' anchor Robin Roberts , Smollett said he was heartbroken when he found out that people questioned his story .
Asked why he would leave the rope draped around his neck until police arrived because he `` wanted them to see . ''
`` I was looking at myself , just like checking myself out , '' he told Roberts . `` I saw the bruise on my neck , you know , like the little -- the rope burn around my neck . So when the police came I kept the clothes on , I kept the rope on me . ... I mean , it was n't , like , wrapped around . But , yeah , it was around because I wanted them to see . ''
Asked why he wait until the second interview to tell police that the assailants yelled “ MAGA country ” at him during the attack , Smollett seemed to take offense at the insinuation .
`` For me , the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story , you know ?

What’s happening

The coronavirus pandemic forced millions of U.S. workers to abruptly transition from office life to working from home. With no end to the outbreak in sight, companies and their employees are preparing for several more months of remote work. The prolonged absence from the office has raised the question of whether some workers will ever go back.

Though the technology for large-scale remote work has existed for years, less than 4 percent of the U.S. workforce did their jobs from home before the pandemic. In a matter of weeks, that number grew to include roughly a third of all workers in the country.

A number of large companies, especially in the tech sector, have extended their work-from-home periods until the end of the year. On Tuesday, Twitter became the first major firm to allow employees to do their jobs away from the office permanently, if they choose.

Why there’s debate

The sudden mass migration of the white-collar workforce into home offices has been so transformative that a significant portion of workers will never come back, many industry experts say. The most important reason the change may become permanent is it seems to offer benefits to everyone involved. Employees are spared the time and expense of commuting and have more opportunities to see their families. Many report they have been more productive at home than in the office.

Companies could see major financial benefits from cutting their spending on expensive real estate and reducing the cost of maintaining office space — especially with the extra safety measures that will likely need to be implemented.

Employers that had been reluctant to allow remote work have seen that many concerns about lost productivity and harm to company culture are unfounded, labor analysts say. The pandemic also forced companies to tackle the expense and logistical challenges that may have been barriers to broad work-from-home policies.

Others are skeptical that the pandemic will lead to permanent changes. While working from home may be better for some employees, it has been an enormous strain for others. Extended periods of remote work could result in a surge in depression and loneliness, trends that may not have manifested in the short period since lockdown orders were put in place. Certain industries that rely on creativity and problem-solving may fear that work will suffer without in-person collaboration. Other firms might be reluctant to surrender the control that comes from having all employees in the same place.

“The economic impact of the pandemic will likely force many employers to cut costs. For companies to reduce their rent obligations by letting workers work from home is an easy solution, one that’s less painful than layoffs.” — Rani Molla, Vox

Employers are seeing how counterproductive traditional office culture is

“Executives and managers have the opportunity to choose quality work over quantity of work. They can value the creative ideas that emerge after a midday hike or meditation session, rather than putting in face time at the office. They can stop rewarding the faster response over the better response, or the longer workday over a more productive workday.” — Bobbi Thomason and Heather Williams, Harvard Business Review

High unemployment will reduce workers’ power to insist on working from home

“As we sink into a recession, the job market will be tight for everyone. That means that while employers could offer benefits like working from home, they might not feel the need to. Sure, an employee might feel safer and happier if they don’t expose themselves to germs on the subway and in the office. But with fewer job openings, a company can probably find someone else who doesn’t mind coming in.” — Olga Khazan, the Atlantic",www.news.yahoo.com,center,fA39ISsv594cvhZE

Good news, America: We're living longer!

Life expectancy in the USA rose in 2012 to 78.8 years – a record high.

That was an increase of 0.1 year from 2011 when it was 78.7 years, according to a new report on mortality in the USA from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics.

The news is a little better for women, a little worse for men. Life expectancy for females is 81.2 years; for males, it's 76.4 years. That difference of 4.8 years is the same as in 2011.

Those life expectancy estimates are for people born in 2012 and represent ""the average number of years that a group of infants would live if the group was to experience throughout life the age-specific death rates present in the year of birth,"" the report says.

The average life expectancy for a person who was 65 years old in 2012 is 19.3 years – 20.5 years for women and 17.9 years for men. The difference in life expectancy at 65 years between males and females increased 0.1 year from 2.5 years in 2011 to 2.6 years in 2012.

It's not that a person born in 2012 is expected to have a shorter life span than a person who was 65 in 2012, says Jiaquan Xu, a medical doctor and lead author of the report. But the averages for people born in 2012 includes those who will be subject to infant mortality and teen mortality, which are higher than for a group of older people.

As far as the life expectancy difference between the sexes, Xu says it's not clear whether genetics plays a role, but behavior probably does. ""Men usually take more risks, and they participate in risky outdoor activities like climbing and scuba diving,"" he says. ""Also, teenage boys do more high-risk activities, and they get in more car wrecks, than girls.""

Among other findings of the 2012 mortality report:

•The age-adjusted death rate for the USA decreased 1.1% from 2011 to 2012 to a record low of 732.8 per 100,000 population. The report attributes much of the recent improvement in both death rates and life expectancy to reductions in deaths from such major illnesses as heart disease, cancer and stroke.

""I think the health of the U.S. population is improving,"" Xu says. ""The death rates for heart disease and cancer, the two leading causes of death that account for 46.5% of all deaths, have been falling since 1999.""

•The 10 leading causes of death in 2012 were the same as in 2011: heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, stroke, unintentional injuries, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, influenza and pneumonia, kidney disease and suicide. Those 10 causes accounted for 73.8% of all deaths in the USA.

However, from 2011 to 2012, age-adjusted death rates declined significantly for 8 of the 10 leading causes of death. The rate for suicide rose and the rate for unintentional injuries was unchanged.

•The infant mortality rate decreased 1.5% from 2011 to 2012 to a historic low of 597.8 infant deaths per 100,000 live births. The 10 leading causes of infant death, which accounted for 69.8% of all infant deaths, remained unchanged. They are: congenital malformations, low birth weight, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), maternal complications, unintentional injuries, cord and placental complications, bacterial sepsis of newborn, respiratory distress of newborn, diseases of the circulatory system and neonatal hemorrhage.

The infant mortality rate for SIDS decreased 12% from 48.3 infant deaths per 100,000 live births in 2011 to 42.5 in 2012; mortality rates for the other leading causes of death showed no significant change.

•Black males have the highest death rates, and black females have higher death rates than white females. Xu says African Americans have higher rates of heart disease than other races and have double the rate of hypertension as non-Hispanic whites; the rate of homicide, considered an unintentional injury, for blacks is 5.2 per 100,000 population, compared to 2.5 for non-Hispanic whites, he says.",www.usatoday.com,center,n94b4V7pwZlex5Jw

''
The provocation came in the middle of a storm of commentary sparked by the revelations that Facebook had been purposefully manipulating its users ' emotions by tinkering with its news feed . Rudder contended that such tweaking was commonplace and normal . In OkCupid 's case , the company had temporarily adjusted its matching algorithm so that some people ended up with recommendations that the algorithm would normally have considered bad matches -- and vice versa , some people whom the algorithm should have concluded were good matches were told they were a bad fit . There was no ill will involved ; from Rudder 's perspective , it was just an experiment designed to serve the larger goal of improving the overall OkCupid user experience .
The Internet reacted harshly . But in an unplanned twist , the post turned out to be good publicity for Rudder 's new book , `` Dataclysm : Who We Are When We Think No One 's Looking . '' Case in point : I had an advance review copy of the book sitting on my desk , but it was only after the hoopla over Rudder 's blog post that I took a closer look and decided it was a must-read .
And indeed it is . `` Dataclysm '' is a well-written and funny look at what the numbers reveal about human behavior in the age of social media . It 's both profound and a bit disturbing , because , sad to say , we 're generally not the kind of people we like to think -- or say -- we are .
Rudder begins his book with a distressing opening salvo : two charts that reveal what age groups men and women generally find attractive . From age 20 to 50 , women are consistent -- they 're drawn to men who are in roughly the same age cohort . Men are equally consistent : From age 20-50 , they are attracted to 20-year-olds . The discussion is over : Men are dogs .
Rudder 's data on race leads to similar implications -- prejudice is alive and well on online dating states , and what we say -- and do n't say -- in our profiles offers impressive support for cultural stereotyping . Rudder does the math on what different groups are most or least likely to say in their profiles : Black men , for example , hardly ever mention Belle and Sebastian , snorkeling or `` Dr Horrible 's Sing Along Blog . '' White women do n't talk about slow jams , j-pop or Malcolm X . White guys , however , are really into mentioning their `` blue eyes , '' brewing beer , and Robert Heinlein . Asian men frequently say `` tall for an Asian , '' `` gangnam style '' and `` noodle soup . '' )
Rudder treats these insights into the human condition with bemused -- and very useful -- intelligence . We 're only just beginning to understand how much we can learn about ourselves and others from the data that is constantly being harvested from us . The more we know , the better armed we are to navigate the future .
Rudder spoke by phone to ███ from OkCupid 's offices in New York .
The more you look at the data , the more it does confirm the cynics ' intuition about humanity . People online are free to act out their worst impulses with very little incentive to act out their best . I guess it just goes to show how politeness or propriety keeps us decent human beings . Offline , society actually has a very good effect on behavior in a very large sense .
That raises an uncomfortable question : Does our wholesale move online undermine how society traditionally keeps us in line ?
I 'm not qualified to give a real opinion on where society as a whole is headed , but I think when you look at stuff like rage storms on Twitter , or even the thing that happened yesterday -- the celebrity nude photos being leaked -- you see that there are definitely some disgusting impulses that the Internet can gratify instantaneously . In the same way Cool Ranch Doritos gratify certain taste receptors that are probably not very good for my digestive tract , things like Twitter or Reddit or even OkCupid gratify our tastes in ways that should probably best be left unsated .
How does that make you feel as a researcher ? Have you become more cynical as a result of what you 've learned by watching how people behave on OkCupid ?
I definitely have a certain amount of ambivalence about the Internet generally and what we do at OkCupid . OkCupid does a lot of great things . We do find people love , we do create marriage and children and happiness in a pure sense , in a way that , say , Amazon does not . But there is a downside : In the process of finding that love or sex or whatever they 're looking for , people are able to be more judgmental . It 's a fraught thing . I can see the good and the bad in all this , but where it all comes out in the end , I 'm not sure . I think the existence of the Internet is a good thing , but I do wish people exercised more humanity in using these tools .
I 'd like to break the format of the typical Q & A a bit , and just read some lines from your book that jumped out at me , and see if I can prompt you to elaborate on them . For example , you wrote that `` the Internet will democratize our fundamental narrative . '' What does that mean ?
What I meant was that the Internet will enable , on a mass scale , something like what Howard Zinn was doing in his `` People 's History of the United States . '' Zinn 's trying to reach for what the common person thought about World War I or the Civil War , or go back and find out what a housewife in 1970 was thinking about her life . But by and large he had to put it all together from a few diaries and a ton of leg work and obviously there 's a lot of selection bias involved .
But in the future , as people continue to live out their lives through these technologies , all of our lives are almost by definition going to be captured . The computer that is crunching all that stuff pulls us all together . In a very real sense , we are all given the same weight in any of these calculations .
I guess that connects directly to another sentence that caught my eye : `` With data , history can become deeper , it can become more . ''
How about , `` It 's when people do n't understand their own hearts I get interested '' ?
I like it when you are able to look at a behavior in two ways . One : what people think they are doing or wish they were doing , and two : what they actually do . At OkCupid we have a great mechanism for looking at that : We have all these match questions where we ask people what they believe or what they think , and then we can go in and measure exactly what they are actually doing . I just think that the space between self-image and action is very interesting .
Well , the most obvious thing is racial messaging patterns . We asked people about race and everybody is like , yeah , interracial marriage is totally great . Something like 96 percent are totally fine with it , or support it . We also asked people questions like `` would you ever date someone who told a racist joke '' and the answers are very strongly liberal in the way you would expect . Everybody is fine with it , blah blah blah . But then you go out and look at what people do or who they choose for themselves , and you see that this is just not the case . Race is a huge factor and certain types of interracial relationships -- I would n't say are taboo , but certainly in the aggregate they are less desirable .
Again this gets back to what we were talking about at the very beginning . If that 's what I want why do n't I just put that into the form ? It would work better , if I was just honest with OkCupid and myself about what I wanted .
You mention Naomi Wolf 's `` The Beauty Myth '' and you wrote , `` for the beauty myth , social media signifies judgment day . '' Is this just a reflection of the fact that women who are considered highly attractive get by far the most messages from men ?
I was having a little bit of fun . There 's just so much judgment that goes on in social media . If most myths are built around some kind of cataclysm or apocalypse , then for the beauty myth , Ragnarok is social media . Men who are free to judge photos without conforming to social norms go crazy clicking girls in bikinis .
Maybe the most discomfiting point you make in your book is your acknowledgment that the kind of people who work for the NSA crunching our data are much smarter than you are and have access to far more information . Eventually , the sophistication of the algorithms will become so great that pretty much everything important about us will be inferred from just a few data points . That 's scarily determinist . Do we even have free will when our data trail tells employers or the government or prospective mates exactly who we are ?
That is a great question , and I do n't think I can give an answer that is both hopeful and honest . The tech industry side of me wants to say that this is n't just a problem of social media -- the same thing happens with your credit score , for example . But you are right . It is scary . There will always be highly motivated , powerful entities using this data for their own good , which often implies an adversarial relationship against you . I will say one thing : If we consider Facebook as stand-in for all this stuff , I think people have generally approached these social media networks with a level of naiveté that is changing . We 're beginning to understand the pitfalls of volunteering all this data about ourselves .
That 's why a book like `` Dataclysm '' is important . The more we know about what you guys are finding out , the easier it will be to set societal guidelines for how this information can be used , and to become masters of our information .
Exactly right . It 's a strange time for me and I 'm sure for you too and anybody else working in this milieu . The technologies are pervasive but comprehension of them is not .
Which leads me to my final question . Let 's revisit that experiment in which you tweaked the matching algorithm . I think for a lot of people that smacked of manipulation that crossed over the line . It seemed different than just changing the layout of a page to see what works better . It seemed like you were messing with people 's minds . Why did you do it ?
Let me just step back and add a little more context . So , we tweaked an algorithm . Now , some algorithms can be considered as a sort of fact . If you are trying to pull a record out of a database there is a canonical or fastest way or best way to do it and to deviate from that would be silly or would be wrong in a real sense . But when we describe people as good or bad matches -- the truth is for any two people on OkCupid , we just do n't know . We 're making a guess ; our algorithm is a version of a guess . It 's not a fact .
There are tons of different ways to bring people together . We often use common interests , like how well you and I satisfy each other . But there are other potentially workable heuristics , like , for example , `` opposites attract . '' The test I wrote about in that blog post was on a continuum of those kinds of tests : We were really genuinely trying to figure out what works best , how to improve the user experience .
What we were doing was different , to me , than `` lying . '' Lying would be distorting matters of fact , rather than opinion . I have no idea what your sexual orientation is , but just imagine if you were gay , and I go and tell people that you are straight . That 's very clearly false , and possibly harmful . We would never do that because that is altering a fact about people ... But with any algorithm that is about how to recommend something -- there is no canonical perfect way to do it . So we treat it sort of like an opinion .
But does n't that enter a fuzzy area ? A selling point of OkCupid is supposed to be that it actually works , which implies that your `` opinions '' as to who is a good match are actually facts ...
For sure . For sure . But part of what makes us sure that we can give people the best match , and that we can make good guesses about what two people are going to get along , is that we are constantly working on refining our methods .
Look , I definitely understand the feelings about what we did . Especially given the way that I first laid it out , and then later , in the way I reacted to the media . Both my presentation and reaction were flawed . But we did not do it to mess with people . Everything we do at OkCupid is done with discretion , and , I hope , some level of emotional intelligence .","In late July, Christian Rudder, a co-founder of the online dating site OkCupid, plunged himself into the middle of an Internet maelstrom when he published a post with a classic poke-the-anthill headline: ""We Experiment on Human Beings!""

We would never do that because that is altering a fact about people ... But with any algorithm that is about how to recommend something -- there is no canonical perfect way to do it. So we treat it sort of like an opinion.

But doesn't that enter a fuzzy area? A selling point of OkCupid is supposed to be that it actually works, which implies that your ""opinions"" as to who is a good match are actually facts ...

For sure. For sure. But part of what makes us sure that we can give people the best match, and that we can make good guesses about what two people are going to get along, is that we are constantly working on refining our methods.

Look, I definitely understand the feelings about what we did. Especially given the way that I first laid it out, and then later, in the way I reacted to the media. Both my presentation and reaction were flawed. But we did not do it to mess with people. Everything we do at OkCupid is done with discretion, and, I hope, some level of emotional intelligence.",www.salon.com,left,LCvdQQ4K5CSWmqrF

As the number of coronavirus cases across the US continues to grow, everyone from restaurant owners and musicians to the elderly and those with chronic illness have been affected.

On Tuesday, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 4,226 confirmed cases, including 75 deaths. For the people who are able, there perhaps has never been a more important time to give to those in need.

You can start by following guidelines on social distancing and local restrictions for self-quarantine. But here are some other ways to support your own community and those struggling all across the country:

Support local businesses and not-for-profits

In an effort to curb the spread of coronavirus, governors in at least nine states have announced the closure of eat-in restaurants and bars, while local officials have made sweeping bans on large gatherings.

Dozens of well-known restaurants have opted to wait out this virus behind closed doors. Others are still open, and are asking the community to support them by ordering pick-up or delivery, and making sure to tip the staff as much as they can.

Canlis, a fine-dining hotspot in Seattle, temporarily converted its restaurant into a drive-in burger eatery, bagel shed and family meal delivery service. Jessica Powers, spokeswoman for the restaurant, said the response from the community had been amazing. She encouraged anyone who wants to support the restaurant, but doesn’t want this more casual dining experience, to buy a gift card and make future bookings.

The arts sector has also been hit especially hard, with a wide array of performances and concerts canceled across the country. Theaters and orchestras are encouraging people who have tickets to a canceled performance to not ask for a refund and even consider donating further to the organization.

Look up your local businesses and not-for-profits online, and find out if there are ways you can still buy from them or donate.

Contribute to local social service organizations

There are plenty of groups and organizations helping those negatively impacted by coronavirus. The Center for Disaster Philanthropy recommends directing donations to free clinics in areas hit hardest by the outbreak, and also contributing to supplies of protective equipment and educational outreach initiatives about the virus.

Those people who were already vulnerable before the outbreak will probably feel its effects hardest and longest, so the center recommends contributing to food banks. But try not to just make it a single donation, as the impacts of this outbreak will probably be felt long into the future.

Paul Ash, executive director of the San Francisco-Marin Food Bank, said they are especially in need of volunteers in their warehouses and people who can help them open additional pantries.

Donate blood

With thousands of blood drives across the country canceled because of the outbreak, the American Red Cross and America’s Blood Centers announced on Tuesday that the US is facing a “severe blood shortage”. The organizations encouraged anyone who is healthy and eligible to give blood or platelets, to make an appointment to donate through the Red Cross.

The Red Cross’s leaders said they are taking additional steps to keep all donors safe, including checking the temperature of staff and donors and having plenty of hand sanitizer available.

“We understand why people may be hesitant to come out for a blood drive but want to reassure the public that blood donation is a safe process, and that we have put additional precautions in place at our blood drives to protect the health of safety of our donors and staff,” Gail McGovern, president and chief executive officer, American Red Cross, said in a statement.

Reach out to family and friends

Simply reaching out to those most severely affected by coronavirus can be a big help in such a turbulent time. For people older than 60 years and those with chronic illness or weakened immune systems, the virus can cause very severe issues.

These people may be stuck in their homes and need food deliveries, or simply looking for some emotional support.

Those living in converted Abbeys could keep their marriages together, but 65 percent of Ireland's population was unmarried at the same time, the highest portion in the Western world of that era. There's just more incentive to hold together the ""estate of marriage"" when the married couple have property that might qualify as an estate.

It's a downer, I know. But far from a trendline of unqualified marital bliss, the prospects for marriage look bleak. And the improved prospects for a certain class of married person may not be caused by liberal values at all, but may be a side effect of concentrated inequality.

The real trend is that marriage is for richer, not poorer. And our only proximate hope is that the rest of America will try to imitate the slightly better marriage patterns of the rich and famous.",www.theweek.com,center,KOU14g0GXTsifjTy

Why has this happened?

There are any number of reasons. Increased use of illicit drugs and prescription drug abuse, and less human interaction because of constant cellphone use are two widely offered, valid explanations. Less valid explanations include competition, grades anxiety, capitalism and income inequality. And then there are young people's fears that because of global warming, they have a bleak, and perhaps no, future.

But the biggest reason may be the almost-complete loss of values and meaning over the last half-century.

Let's begin with values.

America -- and much of the rest of the West, but I will confine my discussion to America -- was founded on two sets of values: Judeo-Christian and American. This combination created the freest, most opportunity-giving, most affluent country in world history. This is not chauvinism. It is fact. And it was regarded as such throughout the world. That is why France gave America -- and only America -- the Statue of Liberty. That's why people from every country on Earth so wanted to immigrate to America -- and still do.

Chief among American values was keeping government as small as possible. This enabled nongovernmental institutions -- Kiwanis International, Rotary International and Lions Clubs International; book clubs; the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts; bowling leagues; music societies; and, of course, churches -- to provide Americans with friends and to provide the neediest Americans with help. But as government has gotten ever larger, many of these nongovernmental groups have dwindled in number or simply disappeared.

Another set of values is what is referred to as ""middle-class"" or ""bourgeois"" values. These include getting married before one has a child; making a family; getting a job so as to be self-sustaining and sustain one's family; self-discipline; delayed gratification; and patriotism.

All of these have been under attack by America's elites, with the following results:

One in 5 young Americans has no contact with his or her father (not including fathers who have died).

In 2011, 72% of black children were born to unmarried mothers. In 1965, it was 24%. In 2012, 29% of white children were born to unmarried women. In 1965, it was 3.1%.

The majority of births to millennials are to unmarried women. Yet, according to a 2018 Cigna study, single parents are generally the loneliest Americans.

Marriage and family are the single greatest sources of happiness for most people. Yet, the percentage of American adults who have never been married is at a historic high.

Pete Davidson and his ""Saturday Night Live"" boss Lorne Michaels are coming under fire after the comedian mocked a former Navy SEAL-turned-congressional candidate who lost his eye in war.

During the final pre-election episode of ""Saturday Night Live, the newly single Davidson stopped by the ""Weekend Update"" desk to offer his ""first impressions"" on several ""gross"" candidates running for office in Tuesday's midterms.

After cracking jokes about Florida Gov. Rick Scott and U.S. Rep. Peter King (New York), Davidson took aim at Republican Dan Crenshaw, whose picture appeared on the screen.

""You may be surprised to hear he’s a congressional candidate in Texas and not a hitman in a porno movie,"" the comedian said, fighting back laughter. ""I’m sorry, I know he lost his eye in war, or whatever. Whatever.”

Crenshaw, who's vying to become the representative for Texas’ 2nd Congressional District, lost his right eye to an IED blast in Afghanistan during his third deployment in 2012. The SEAL was deployed twice more overseas in 2014 and 2016 after regaining sight in his badly damaged left eye, according to his website.

The war veteran responded to Davidson's comments on Sunday.

""Good rule in life: I try hard not to offend; I try harder not to be offended,"" Crenshaw tweeted. ""That being said, I hope @nbcsnl recognizes that vets don’t deserve to see their wounds used as punchlines for bad jokes.""

The same day, Crenshaw elaborated on his feelings to TMZ.

While he said it would ""very healthy"" for the country as a whole ""to get away from this culture where we demand apologies every time someone misspeaks,"" he did want ""SNL"" to acknowledge one thing: That ""veterans across the country probably don't feel as though the wounds they received in battle should be the subject of a bad punchline for a bad joke.""

""This is not apologetic,"" Spicer continued. ""These people mocked a combat veteran, and this is what they think is funny these days? Lorne Michaels should be fired.""

NBC declined comment.

Davidson also took shots at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to ""look fair,"" before making fun of Republican congressional candidate Greg Pence, Vice President Mike Pence's older brother, and even himself.

Regardless of the circumstances of their dilemmas , the beheaded rarely win sympathy from the mob . Coliseum-like roars of approval greet their abrupt change of fortune from their past exalted status .
So , for example , perhaps few feel sorry for anchor Megyn Kelly , recently all but fired by NBC and now walking away with most of her $ 69 million salary package as a severance payout .
Kelly was let go ostensibly for making a sloppy but not malicious morally equivalent comparison between whites at Halloween dressing up in costumes as blacks , and blacks likewise appearing as whites . But she sealed her fate by uttering the historically disparaging word “ black face ” as some sort of neutral bookend to her use of “ white face. ” Her fatal crime , then , was insensitive thought and speech and historical ignorance .
For someone so familiar with the rules of our electronic French Revolution and the felonies of speech and thought , Kelly proved surprisingly naïve in a variety of ways .
First , she should have known that there are revolutionary canons surrounding victimization indemnities . And for all her success , she is actually protected by few of them , given that she is fabulously well paid , attractive , still young , white — and at one time conservative and a former Fox News anchor person .
So when Kelly said something historically dense and insensitive , she should have grasped that she , despite being an emancipated coastal female , was immediately ( and ratings-wise ) expendable , even if expensively expendable .
Had Kelly been unapologetically progressive ( especially one deemed vital to the cause ) , like Elizabeth Warren , who fabricated and profited from an entire minority identity , then she might well have survived the incident . Perhaps had she been a minority , such as Sarah Jeong , and written ( rather than spoken off the cuff ) far more racially offensive things about whites , she would have kept her job — as did Jeong on the New York Times editorial board after her racist tweets surfaced , such as this , from 2014 : “ Dumbass f * * * * * * white people marking up the internet with their opinions like dogs pissing on fire hydrants . ”
Instead , Kelly was hauled to the electronic guillotine in a now familiar routine . An elite luminary ( the mob has little concern with the thoughtcrimes of hoi polloi ) , sometimes even in sloppy and inadvertent rather than mean-spirited fashion , says something deemed illiberal or insensitive or even ideologically incorrect . Other elites in journalism , politics , and academia pounce and rush to social media to post their outrage in an endless internecine battle among ( mostly white ) virtue-signalers .
A competition ensues to prove who can play Robespierre best , by being either the most cleverly outraged or sincerely aggrieved , or the most vicariously victimized , or the most conniving to find advantage in the denunciation . A brief investigatory lull of a few minutes is often needed to sort out relative exemptions , much as Hébert and Danton , before heading to the guillotine , had their earlier revolutionary credentials nullified or recalibrated .
Millions of Internet sleuth volunteers play the 18th-century role of the shouting mob in the street , as they google the condemned person ’ s name in search of a prior quote from YouTube , Facebook , Twitter , or any random outlet that can prove a “ pattern ” of incorrect expression or counterrevolutionary behavior .
Within minutes , all sorts of earlier evidence of Kelly ’ s alleged illiberal or incorrect thought reappeared . In Kelly ’ s brief electronic trial , we were told in a nanosecond that she had once claimed that the Jewish Jesus was white and that St. Nicholas ( the precursor to our cherubic Germanic Santa Claus ) was as well — a mortal sin given that later Western representations of both as northern Europeans were cultural misappropriations of their Mediterranean Jewish and likely Greek identities . Thus , within an hour or so , a telltale fingerprint of Kelly ’ s supposedly longtime racism was discovered by the collective crime lab . At that point , the only suspense left was her small odds of escaping to some sort of victim refuge — at least beyond being a wealthy privileged white female in a wealthy white privileged male world of network news .
After the doomed wrongdoer is formally rounded up on the Internet , charged , and condemned , he or she begs the inquisitors for forgiveness . Tears and physical signs of real regret occasionally attest to weakness and are further proof of crimes to be punished ; the contrition is never enough to earn forgiveness or magnanimity .
So Megyn Kelly confessed : “ I realize now that such behavior is indeed wrong , and I am sorry . The history of blackface in our culture is abhorrent , the wounds too deep . ”
A final reprieve is sometimes found in expressing a desire to enter revolutionary reeducation camp or at least correct-thought remediation . Next , Kelly threw herself on the mercy of her accusers by confessing her ignorance of the history of minstrel stereotyping : “ I learned that , given the history of blackface being used in awful ways by racists in this country , it is not okay for that to be part of any costume , Halloween or otherwise . ”
By contrast , recall the recent case of former astronaut Scott Kelly . When he tweeted admiration for Winston Churchill , exposing his felonious ignorance of Churchill ’ s crimes , he was almost virtually guillotined . He escaped the wrath of the Internet mob by swearing that he would reexamine the hitherto unknown dark side of Winston Churchill and thereby reeducate himself about Churchill ’ s mortal sins of colonialism and imperialism : “ My apologies . I will go and educate myself further on his atrocities , racist views which I do not support. ” And so he escaped the “ national razor. ” No doubt the twitter and Facebook mob posed a greater peril to Kelly ’ s well-being than having been strapped to a volatile , fuel-laden rocket and blasted into outer space .
At some point , an employer or high official , then , like a French revolutionary judge , weighs in with the condemnatory sentence , most fearful that ordering anything less than a trip to the ultimate barber is a window into his own dark and counterrevolutionary soul .
So the trick is for the boss or the corporation — in this case NBC chairman Andy Lack —to voice “ shock ” and “ dismay ” and to do so in such terms as to ensure to the revolutionary mob that the miscreant most certainly did not learn such racist , insensitive , sexist , or subversive views from his or her superiors . Often the key is to denounce the accused in even stronger terms than the initial accusers ’ and thereby not be the next head to drop in the basket . Lack proved equal to the challenge , intoning : “ There is no other way to put this , but I condemn those remarks . There is no place on our air or in this workplace for them . Very unfortunate . ”
Once fired and humiliated , the person is erased for a time from our revolutionary memories ( we suddenly could not easily buy Garrison Keillor ’ s books , and Paula Deen seemed to vanish from television ) . Megyn Kelly will probably go into opulent seclusion and find herself disinvited from ceremonial appearances and speaking events , guillotined as a racist , with no more sympathy than a once privileged , beheaded Bourbon .
We now fear the lethal wrath of the Internet ’ s Committee of Public Safety . But beware of fickle revolutionary temperament . Soon our 21st-century Robespierres may become so promiscuous and obnoxious in their beheading that they wear out even the mob — and find themselves next in line on a counterrevolutionary chopping block .","Megyn Kelly in 2015 (Brendan McDermid / Reuters)

Modern-day Robespierres send counterrevolutionaries to the virtual chopping block. They should recall his fate.

At that point, the only suspense left was her small odds of escaping to some sort of victim refuge — at least beyond being a wealthy privileged white female in a wealthy white privileged male world of network news.

After the doomed wrongdoer is formally rounded up on the Internet, charged, and condemned, he or she begs the inquisitors for forgiveness. Tears and physical signs of real regret occasionally attest to weakness and are further proof of crimes to be punished; the contrition is never enough to earn forgiveness or magnanimity.

So Megyn Kelly confessed: “I realize now that such behavior is indeed wrong, and I am sorry. The history of blackface in our culture is abhorrent, the wounds too deep.”

A final reprieve is sometimes found in expressing a desire to enter revolutionary reeducation camp or at least correct-thought remediation. Next, Kelly threw herself on the mercy of her accusers by confessing her ignorance of the history of minstrel stereotyping: “I learned that, given the history of blackface being used in awful ways by racists in this country, it is not okay for that to be part of any costume, Halloween or otherwise.”

By contrast, recall the recent case of former astronaut Scott Kelly. When he tweeted admiration for Winston Churchill, exposing his felonious ignorance of Churchill’s crimes, he was almost virtually guillotined. He escaped the wrath of the Internet mob by swearing that he would reexamine the hitherto unknown dark side of Winston Churchill and thereby reeducate himself about Churchill’s mortal sins of colonialism and imperialism: “My apologies. I will go and educate myself further on his atrocities, racist views which I do not support.” And so he escaped the “national razor.” No doubt the twitter and Facebook mob posed a greater peril to Kelly’s well-being than having been strapped to a volatile, fuel-laden rocket and blasted into outer space.

At some point, an employer or high official, then, like a French revolutionary judge, weighs in with the condemnatory sentence, most fearful that ordering anything less than a trip to the ultimate barber is a window into his own dark and counterrevolutionary soul.

So the trick is for the boss or the corporation — in this case NBC chairman Andy Lack —to voice “shock” and “dismay” and to do so in such terms as to ensure to the revolutionary mob that the miscreant most certainly did not learn such racist, insensitive, sexist, or subversive views from his or her superiors. Often the key is to denounce the accused in even stronger terms than the initial accusers’ and thereby not be the next head to drop in the basket. Lack proved equal to the challenge, intoning: “There is no other way to put this, but I condemn those remarks. There is no place on our air or in this workplace for them. Very unfortunate.”

Once fired and humiliated, the person is erased for a time from our revolutionary memories (we suddenly could not easily buy Garrison Keillor’s books, and Paula Deen seemed to vanish from television). Megyn Kelly will probably go into opulent seclusion and find herself disinvited from ceremonial appearances and speaking events, guillotined as a racist, with no more sympathy than a once privileged, beheaded Bourbon.

We now fear the lethal wrath of the Internet’s Committee of Public Safety. But beware of fickle revolutionary temperament. Soon our 21st-century Robespierres may become so promiscuous and obnoxious in their beheading that they wear out even the mob — and find themselves next in line on a counterrevolutionary chopping block.",www.nationalreview.com,right,EBhOJJmL8V7AKwy5

By day ’ s end , organizers expect 1,500 total protests in cities ranging from Los Angeles , Calif. , to Wasilla , Alaska , including arrests in nine cities : Seacaucus , New Jersey ; Alexandria , Virginia ; Dallas ; Minneapolis ; Chicago ; Seattle ; and Ontario , San Leandro , and Sacramento , California .
`` Like my mom always said , 'You see something that 's not right , it 's your turn to fix it , '' said 45-year-old Chicago Wal-Mart employee Myron Byrd , who plans to be arrested in his first act of civil disobedience today . `` And you ca n't do it by yourself -- you have to do it with others . '' Byrd said he was driven to action by `` high school '' -level pay and workplace disrespect , and inspired by the courage of fellow workers and his mother 's civil rights legacy . `` I 'm sacrificing myself , along with others , to do this , '' he told me , `` to show Wal-Mart that hey , I 'm not afraid , they not afraid , we not afraid . '' In an e-mail to reporters , Wal-Mart spokesperson David Tovar said that `` planned arrests '' were `` just another way to make these orchestrated events seem newsworthy , '' and that `` these are n't real protests by real Walmart associates . ''
Whether today 's action is bigger than last year ’ s “ Black Friday ” showdown remains to be seen , and likely depends on how you count : Would more protests , and more protesters , make up for a retaliation-fueled reduction in the number of Wal-Mart employees who go on strike to join them ?
Wal-Mart ’ s first 50 years were free of Black Friday strikes – indeed , free of any coordinated walkouts in the United States . Then , 14 months ago , a wave of Wal-Mart supply chain strikes that started with crawfish-peeling guest workers and subcontracted warehouse workers spread to include the corporation ’ s retail employees , first in Southern California and then in cities across the country . Strikers were members of OUR Walmart , a fledgling non-union workers group that first announced itself in 2011 ; it draws funding , staffing and direction from the United Food & Commercial Workers union .
For the UFCW , Wal-Mart poses an existential threat , driving down standards for competitors and endangering hard-fought gains . “ Our companies are saying , ‘ If Wal-Mart can get away with it , why can ’ t we ? ' ” an employee from a unionized Safeway told me as she prepared to join a Black Friday protest at a Maryland Wal-Mart last year . But the Wal-Mart challenge extends far beyond the company ’ s 1.3 million U.S. employees , or the UFCW ’ s 1.3 million members . By pioneering tactics to cut labor costs and avert labor organizing , and instigating imitation among suppliers , subcontractors , competitors and admirers across industries , Wal-Mart is hastening a transformation in U.S. work , toward an ever-more-present future in which workers – whether fast food cashiers or adjunct professors -- lack living wages , workplace democracy , job security or even legal recognition as employees .
Faced with a future of declining leverage and relevance , U.S. unions have taken up a range of tactics on full display in the Wal-Mart effort , including “ comprehensive campaigns ” that wield political , legal and media weapons against a company ’ s brand , growth ambitions and consumer loyalty ; “ minority union ” tactics in which smaller numbers of workers take bold public action to embarrass management and engage more reticent co-workers ; organizing in solidarity across supply chains and national borders ; short-term strikes designed to maximize public engagement and minimize the risk of retaliatory firings ; and working with or through “ alt-labor ” groups that aim to transform workplaces without seeking collective bargaining .
Together , these tactics have forged the most serious challenge to Wal-Mart ’ s control over its U.S. workforce since the company was founded in 1962 . It ’ s far outpaced the previous decade ’ s well-funded but anemic union-backed anti-Wal-Mart efforts , which involved bloggers and presidential candidates but comparatively little in the way of Wal-Mart employees . But the current campaign still faces nearly impossible obstacles , some of which have only become more visible in the year since 400-some strikers and thousands of supporters pulled off Black Friday 2012 .
Chief among the challenges is this : While U.S. law generally bans companies from punishing workers for organizing ( whether toward unionization or as part of a non-union effort like OUR Walmart ) , it does precious little to avert or avenge such retaliation when companies are dead set on maintaining control . In the months after 100-some strikers staged a several-day work stoppage and protest caravan to Wal-Mart ’ s June 2013 shareholder meeting , 23 of them were fired – exactly the scenario that ’ s kept many Wal-Mart workers on the sidelines . While “ I do not think I have ever hated any one thing in my life ” as much as Wal-Mart , one employee told me shortly before those firings began , he ’ d be keeping his mouth shut because “ Wal-Mart does not tolerate dissenters . ”
Wal-Mart denies that it retaliated for striking ( but not that it punished some strikers for violating its attendance policy , a pretty specious distinction ) . The federal National Labor Relations Board announced this month that it was prepared to issue a complaint – similar to an indictment – against the company for illegally trying to restrain strikes ; that ’ s a symbolic victory for the campaign and one step in a potentially years-long legal process that could ultimately see fired employees returned to work .
But what neither Wal-Mart nor OUR Walmart can come out and say is this : While core activists say they ’ re only emboldened by the fear campaign , by all appearances Wal-Mart threats and firings have so far succeeded in stemming the growth of Wal-Mart strikes . ( Alternate explanation , per Wal-Mart : “ The opportunity is incredible ... We ’ ve never held a good person back. ” ) Organizers have declined to say whether today ’ s protests will see more employees out on strike than last year , but touted growth in total protests , civil disobedience actions , worker support and community backing . ( Wal-Mart employee participation in a September 2013 day of civil disobedience and protests – not strikes – also numbered in the hundreds , according to the campaign . )
Placerville Wal-Mart employee Dorothy Halvorson told me she was stirred to get more active with OUR Walmart when she saw the company crack down on her co-workers . But she said such retaliation `` has put fear back into some of the people that were thinking about joining us . '' When three activists were fired in her store , said Halvorson , others `` stepped back into like , 'Oh no , we 've got to be careful -- we might be fired too . ' '' She said that because of the NLRB 's planned complaint against Wal-Mart , `` people are starting to feel more empowered again about doing it . ''
“ My sense is that all the firings and stuff that took place last year ; I mean I think that scared people , ” said Kim Bobo , whose group Interfaith Worker Justice has adopted 150 stores for protests this year . “ I mean , that was the intent , and I think it was effective. ” But Bobo , who told me back in June that OUR Walmart would have to get “ fifty times bigger , probably ” in order to win , said she believed the NLRB ’ s move “ will give the organizing a real lift , ” and that “ I don ’ t think the only way workers organize and show solidarity and push the company is by striking. ” UFCW President Joe Hansen told me in September that it would be “ unrealistic ” to expect that “ somebody ’ s going to get 500,000 Wal-Mart workers to walk off their job , “ but that “ what I think is happening , and I think Wal-Mart hates this as much as anything else , is it ’ s calling publicity to how they treat workers. ” Similarly , asked Wednesday whether victory would require thousands of Wal-Mart workers to join protests , the Rev . Jesse Jackson told me that `` the success may be in enough people saying , ' I respect their mission ' and shopping someplace else ... The success of the Montgomery Bus Boycott was that people stopped trying to ride . ''
OUR Walmart and its allies can point to real victories from their already unprecedented activism , from a single store that paid workers for time they spent on strike , to a public commitment to improve scheduling nationwide . Last week ’ s media onslaught over one Wal-Mart ’ s employee-to-employee charity collection and last summer ’ s high-profile showdown over a passed-but-vetoed D.C. “ large retailer ” living wage bill both show that comprehensive campaign tactics can pack some punch . But it was workers ’ strikes that laid groundwork and fueled momentum for both . As past failed union-backed efforts proved , Wal-Mart would sooner concede money than power , and public scrutiny and embarrassment alone stand little chance of dislodging real decency or democracy without a serious threat of escalating Wal-Mart worker uprisings .
So the pressing question , for those concerned with the Wal-Mart-ization of U.S. work , is whether some combination of brave and savvy worker-to-worker organizing , bold minority activism and legal/political/media/consumer/community pressure can partially disarm or counteract the weapons Wal-Mart uses to inculcate a well-founded fear in its workforce . We ’ ll know more once we see what goes down today – and how Wal-Mart ’ s still-silent majority responds in the weeks and months to come .","Defying the nation’s top employer and a business model that defines the new U.S. economy, Wal-Mart employees and allies will try to oust shopping headlines with strike stories, and throw a retail giant off its heels on what should be its happiest day of the year.

That traditional Girl Scout song has been sung by generations of young children in America, where school kids grasp the warm hands of each other even if they’ve just met. Strangers become instant friends.

Children are born unafraid to connect with other children. It’s how God made us.

We’re also born without phones in our hands, but now we grasp our devices like the stuffed animals we clung to as toddlers. We’re glued. In our connected world, we are not connecting. My own frustration with this navel-gazing mobile hypocrisy makes me want to scream “LOOK UP! LOOK UP!” at all the hunched-over humans I see staring down at their glowing screens.

My phone addiction frustration reached a fever pitch when I heard the slogan ""If you see something, say something” blaring over the loudspeakers on a New York City subway platform. Living in a city on high terror alert, I came to a realization. With everyone, including me, looking at our phones, and with our ears plugged up with earbuds, how can we possibly see or hear anything around us, whether suspicious activity or the more likely scenario – something truly wonderful?

I vowed to put my phone away when I was in public places, and what a difference. Now, on my downtown rides to my book publishing office right next to the 9/11 Memorial, I use that gift of time as an opportunity. It’s given me unexpected blessings. I’ve been making new friends!

My new friends have come from all over the world. Most are immigrants. They hail from as far away as Egypt, Bangladesh, China, Korea, Ecuador, Trinidad and Scotland, and as nearby as Long Island, Queens and Harlem.

The Census Bureau announced on Wednesday that it will suspend its field operations for at least two weeks to protect the safety of workers and respondents . But medical experts say measures to control the spread of the virus will likely be required for much longer , leaving groups like the NAACP concerned that minority communities , which are already regularly undercounted , will be devastated even further if field workers are unable to go door-to-door .
The Census Bureau conducts a count of the United States population once every decade . The count helps determine how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state gets and determines how the federal government doles out trillions in spending .
The bureau sends out mailers asking people to submit forms online , by mail , or by phone , and then sends out an army of 500,000 field workers to go door-to-door to track down people that failed to respond . These field workers also distribute forms to unconventional addresses like those at many Native American reservations and in remote locations . They also perform a count of about half a million people in homeless shelters . Some of these workers were already in the field , though the operation does not fully ramp up until the end of May .
The Census Bureau initially responded to the spread of COVID-19 by instructing field workers to keep their distance from respondents and providing them with sanitizer . But Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham said on Wednesday that field operations would be suspended until at least April 1 as the agency determines the best way to protect workers and respondents .
`` The public is strongly encouraged to respond to the 2020 Census online using a desktop computer , laptop , smartphone , or tablet , and can also respond by phone or mail , '' Dillingham said .
The move came after a census field supervisor tested positive for COVID-19 , requiring a number of other employees to self-quarantine , according to NPR .
Margo Anderson , a census historian at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee , told the Associated Press that the move was unprecedented .
`` I do n't think I 've ever heard of such a suspension , nationwide , '' she said . `` We 're in uncharted territory on the census , as well as everything else since last Friday . ''
Terri Ann Lowenthal , a consultant on census issues for advocacy groups pushing for an accurate count , told The New York Times that any delay threatens to affect the count .
`` The bureau clearly hopes to resume operations as previously planned , but nobody has a crystal ball , '' she said . `` The more the Census Bureau has to shift and modify operations and deviate from its plans , the harder it will be to have an acceptable outcome . ''
Steve Jost , a former spokesman for the Census Bureau , agreed that any delay `` greatly increases the risk to the accuracy and completeness of the count . ''
The accuracy will also be challenged by colleges requiring students to vacate their dormitories and restrictions on access to elderly residential facilities , where residents face a high risk of severe illness from the virus .
The bureau has also scrapped in-person training for workers , according to The Times , and lawmakers are increasingly concerned that the COVID-19 outbreak will result in staffing shortages due to concerns over the spread and because many parents have had to stay home after schools around the country were shuttered .
Census officials told USA Today that the bureau is on track to meet its hiring goals in many cities and that it reached their goal of more than 2.6 million applicants .
`` But there is still uncertainly as to whether the bureau will be able to hire and retain enough qualified census takers to collect information from households that did n't respond on their own , '' Lowenthal told the outlet .
At this point in 2010 , the bureau had already hired around 600 percent more workers than it is currently paying , CNN reported .
`` We are really stressed right now , '' David Lee , who heads a network of nonprofits that provide census-related outreach , told the outlet . `` We are very behind in hiring , having difficulty hiring staff and outreach workers . Some anecdotally attribute that to fear of exposure to the virus . ''
Rep. Steven Horsford , D-Nev. , told USA Today that he is particularly concerned about the Native Americans , African Americans , Latinos , and Asian Americans in his district .
`` Making sure that every one of our communities receive the outreach necessary has been a big priority for us , '' he said .
Rep. Lacy Clay , D-Mo. , explained that a key factor in reaching out to traditionally undercounted communities is hiring people who know the areas and look like the people that live there . Census officials previously said they believe the bureau undercounted 1.5 million African Americans and Latinos in the 2010 census .
`` That 's why I 'm all in , '' Clay said , adding that he has promoted census job fairs and recorded PSAs urging so black communities `` feel a part of it and you get the buy-in from average citizens . ''
But NAACP President Derrick Johnson told the outlet he worries that the Trump administration 's delayed response to the COVID-19 pandemic would disproportionately affect communities of color and extend to the census count .
`` It is impacting all of our governing functions , including the census , '' he said . `` We are in a very gray area , so we do n't know what to expect . ''
It 's unclear what , if anything , the bureau can do to provide better protections for workers and respondents so it can carry out the count . Many people have already lost their jobs due to the pandemic , which could boost census hiring , but some applicants said the bureau definitely was not doing enough to ensure their safety .
`` I asked what about the safety of folks like me who come to work for you , not to mention the public , and they had no answer for that , '' North Carolina 's Adam Matza , who got a call this week about a census job he applied to months earlier , told USA Today . `` They said they 're operating as though there 's no virus ... That 's not really good enough for me . The irresponsibility in that is just astounding . ''
Democrats have sounded the alarm on the staffing shortages for months .
`` There are grave challenges facing this year 's Census and , to be honest , I do n't have full confidence that the administration is equipped to handle them , '' House Oversight and Reform Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney , D-N.Y. , said during a hearing in February .
The hearing came after a Government Accountability Office report warned that `` without timely and appropriate actions , the challenges ... could adversely affect the cost , accuracy , schedule and security of the enumeration . ''
But even as the Census Bureau raced to staff up in time , the ongoing pandemic has set it back weeks .
William Frey , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , said times like this is exactly why hard to count groups are `` the exact communities that may require face-to-face interaction . ''
`` This is one of the reasons we take the census , '' he told the Los Angeles Times . `` It 's the basis for these government and private sector programs that help vulnerable populations in a time like this . ''
The government relies on accurate data by the census to `` make plans for providing supplies and enough food and other items for their populations , '' added Arturo Vargas , chief executive of NALEO Educational Fund .
`` Anybody who is marginalized in society in any way , '' he said , `` by poverty , by language , by housing situation — I think this [ virus ] exponentially complicates ability to count those populations . ''
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross , whose department oversees the Census Bureau , downplayed the concerns during a Senate appropriations subcommittee hearing last week .
`` We 'll just have to play it by ear , '' he said , adding that his department has `` done as much as we can to be ready for whatever contingency comes up . ''
Senate Democrats unsatisfied with the department 's response demanded that Dillingham , the bureau director , detail contingency plans to ensure an accurate count of minority communities in a letter earlier this month .
`` We particularly want to know what contingency plans are when we get to the face to face interview part of the census , '' the letter said . `` We know that the risk of being undercounted disproportionately falls on communities of color and low income communities and Native American communities .

(CNN) The Oscars took place Sunday night under torrential rain so heavy that it threatened to rip through the white tent sheltering the celebrity fabulousness on the red carpet. You'd be excused if you assumed this downpour to be a symbol of the sweeping cultural changes to which the Motion Picture Academy, and Hollywood in general, have failed to fully adapt. In the lead up to the award show, we wondered: Would this be another year focused on pale-as-snow slates of winners, celebrating stories that elevate the privilege of white English-speaking protagonists, narratives, settings and history?

The answer: A resounding no.

From its very earliest moments to the shocking, exultant Best Picture victory by ""Parasite"" -- the first foreign language film to win Best Picture and the first Korean film nominated for Best Picture, let alone win — these Oscars felt like the long-awaited arrival of an inflection point for an institution desperately in need of one.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has not lacked self-awareness. Since 2015's viral hashtag #OscarsSoWhite , the Academy has been under near-constant assault for its failure to address its historic sidelining or erasure of people of color, of women, of LGBTQ+ individuals, and most recently, of global talent.

This year's show seemed at last to take these critiques to heart. Janelle Monáe opened the show with Billy Porter and performed the anodyne theme song to ""Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood"" on a nostalgic version of the show's set. She was then joined on stage by an army of dancers dressed as characters from films — many of which starred people of color.

She ended her performance by paying homage to ""all the women who directed phenomenal films"" — none of whom were nominated — and announcing that she was ""so proud to stand here as a black queer artist telling stories. Happy Black History Month!""

Chris Rock and Steve Martin, two former Oscars hosts who jokingly mourned their ""demotion"" to mere introducers, also called attention to the criticism.

""So many great directors nominated this year!"" said Rock.

""I don't know, Chris. I thought there was something missing,"" responded Martin.

""Vaginas?""

""Yes, yes.""

Rock then called out Best Actress nominee Cynthia Erivo: ""Cynthia did such a great job in 'Harriet' hiding black people that the Academy got her to hide all the black nominees.""

""In 1929, there were no black acting nominees,"" replied Martin.

""And now, in 2020, we got one,"" joked Rock.

""Amazing growth,"" snarked Martin.

But the overdue acknowledgment of the diversity issue would've meant nothing if the show's major winners had simply been the expected ones — big, expensive studio movies showcasing the trials and tribulations of straight white men -- like ""Joker,"" ""Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,"" ""1917"" and ""The Irishman.""

Signs that this year would be different came early, when Matthew A. Cherry's brilliant short film ""Hair Love"" — which began as a Kickstarter project and turned into a powerful picture -- won for Best Animated Short.

As Karen Rupert Toliver, the film's co-producer, said in her acceptance speech , ""It was a labor of love...because we have a firm belief that representation matters deeply, especially in cartoons because in cartoons that's when we first see our movies.""

The recognition that cartoons are a vital lens through which we encounter the world and ourselves continued with the performance of ""Frozen 2""'s Best Song nominee ""Into the Unknown,"" which featured not just the English-language original Elsa, Idina Menzel, but 10 of her Elsa counterparts from around the world, singing verses of the song in languages from Japanese to Polish.

But ultimately, it was the truly historic recognition of director Bong Joon-ho and his film ""Parasite"" that did the most to make these Oscars feel so fundamentally different. Many wrote off the film's success because of Americans' reluctance to watch a movie with subtitles, so it was widely assumed that it would, at most, receive an Original Screenplay win and victory in the newly renamed Best International Feature category.

This is, indeed, a very opportune moment in history — for the Oscars, for America and for the world. It's a moment when power is shifting and disaggregating as we head toward a future where opportunity lies not in the shrinking middle, but in the emerging edges.

While there remains much work to be done, the Academy might just have finally embraced the lesson that activists -- like April Reign , creator of #OscarsSoWhite, and Ava DuVernay , a filmmaker who has been outspoken about the lack of diversity in Hollywood -- have been patiently trying to teach. It's a lesson declaimed in freestyle verse onstage by rapper and ""Pitch Perfect"" actor Utkarsh Ambudkar, in his delightfully weird mid-Oscars rap recap:

""You've been a long time trying to be colorblind

What you see right in front of you is a sign of the times...

It's been a rough Monday, Short Listers. Let's just dive right in.

But first, don’t microwave that: This video dishes on the five foods chefs say they never nuke. Hint: Put that pizza back.

'Everything is burning': History ablaze at Notre Dame

The famed Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris went up in flames Monday as shocked crowds gathered in the streets to watch one of the globe's most iconic churches burn. Smoke flowed from the 850-year-old structure before the cathedral's spire tumbled over, engulfed by flames. The fire burned basically unabated for hours despite hundreds of firefighters' efforts. It continued to glow when darkness fell. French President Emmanuel Macron summed up the emotions: ""I am sad tonight to see this part of all of us burn.""

Notre Dame spokesman Andre Finot told Le Figaro newspaper, ""Everything is burning.""

But perhaps not everything: City officials said late Monday that they are optimistic the church's iconic main towers can be saved.

Here's why Notre Dame is so important:

Its world-renowned architecture: The cathedral dates back almost 1,000 years. Construction began in 1163 and took almost 200 years to complete. The building is one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture in the world.

The cathedral dates back almost 1,000 years. Construction began in 1163 and took almost 200 years to complete. The building is one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture in the world.

Other relics include a fragment believed to be part of Jesus' cross and a nail believed to have been used in the crucifixion. Salvage efforts were underway to recover precious artifacts.

More Mueller report drops Thursday

Attorney General William Barr plans to release the final 400-page report of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation Thursday. The report, anticipated since last month after Barr offered only a scant summary of its major conclusions, will head to Congress and go public at about the same time. Parts of the report will stay secret, Barr said. Democrats demanded for weeks that Barr make the full, unredacted report available while President Donald Trump seized on its conclusions to declare “complete vindication.” The report could detail connections between the Russia and Trump's campaign that did not produce criminal charges.

Lori Loughlin won't stand down

Lori Loughlin plans to fight charges against her in the college admissions cheating case. The ""Full House"" actress and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, filed federal documents Monday pleading not guilty and waiving their right to appear in court for an arraignment. Last week, Loughlin, Giannulli and other parents charged in the cheating scheme were indicted on an additional felony count of money laundering, on top of other fraud counts they were charged with last month. Other indicted parents entered not guilty pleas, indicating they plan to challenge the government's case against them at trial.

Noted golf fan Donald Trump will honor Tiger Woods

President Trump announced he would award Tiger Woods the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the wake of Woods’ Masters victory Sunday. Woods’ one-shot victory at Augusta National capped off an amazing and lengthy comeback from personal setbacks and physical ailments, earning his fifth green jacket and 15th major championship. Before Woods, golfers Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus received Medals of Freedom, and President Barack Obama presented another to pioneering black golfer Charlie Sifford in 2014.

A college 'rite of passage' killed her

A Fordham University senior climbing up the campus' bell tower fell to her death in a tragic accident Sunday. Sydney Monfries, 22, fell through an opening in a stairway landing, plummeting about 30 feet, school officials said. Fordham University's student newspaper reported that climbing the tower is a kind of ""rite of passage"" before graduation. The tower on the Bronx, New York, campus is off-limits to students and locked at night. It was locked before Monfries entered the building, according to the university.

culture,FEE.org,2,https://fee.org/articles/youtube-s-censorship-of-dissenting-doctors-will-backfire/,YouTube’s Censorship of Dissenting Doctors Will Backfire,2020-04-30,,"YouTube has been removing videos of a press briefing in which two doctors criticize the sweeping “ shelter-at-home ” edicts that governments have imposed throughout the world in response to the COVID-19 outbreak . One of the videos had over 5 million views before it was taken down .
The original videos were posted by an ABC news affiliate in Bakersfield , California . When the affiliate reached out to YouTube about the removal , a company spokesperson issued a statement that offered the following justification :
“ We quickly remove flagged content that violate [ sic ] our Community Guidelines , including content that explicitly disputes the efficacy of local health authority recommended guidance on social distancing that may lead others to act against that guidance . ( ... ) From the very beginning of the pandemic , we ’ ve had clear policies against COVID-19 misinformation and are committed to continue providing timely and helpful information at this critical time . ”
The claims of the physicians ( Dr. Daniel W. Erickson and Dr. Artin Massihi , owners of Accelerated Urgent Care in Bakersfield ) have been the subject of furious debate . Many health experts and organizations have denounced their remarks as unscientific and reckless . Even fellow critics of shelter-in-place who agree with much of the rest of their analysis have questioned some of their statistical inferences .
Whatever the veracity of the doctors ’ claims , YouTube ’ s censorship of unorthodox ideas in the name of protecting the public from misinformation is misguided and counter-productive . Sheltering the public from ideas , even bad ones , only makes society more susceptible to dangerous error .
One of the censored doctors ’ critiques of shelter-at-home provides an apt metaphor for the folly of censorship . Dr. Erickson said :
“ I ’ d like to go over some basic things about how the immune system functions so people have a good understanding . The immune system is built by exposure to antigens : viruses , bacteria . When you ’ re a little child crawling on the ground , putting stuff in your mouth , viruses and bacteria come in . You form an antigen antibody complex . You form IgG IgM . This is how your immune system is built . You don ’ t take a small child , put them in bubble wrap in a room , and say , “ go have a healthy immune system . This is immunology , microbiology 101 . This is the basis of what we ’ ve known for years . When you take human beings and you say , “ go into your house , clean all your counters—Lysol them down you ’ re gon na kill 99 % of viruses and bacteria ; wear a mask ; don ’ t go outside , ” what does it do to our immune system ? Our immune system is used to touching . We share bacteria . Staphylococcus , streptococcal , bacteria , viruses . Sheltering in place decreases your immune system . And then as we all come out of shelter in place with a lower immune system and start trading viruses , bacteria—what do you think is going to happen ? Disease is going to spike . And then you ’ ve got diseases spike—amongst a hospital system with furloughed doctors and nurses . This is not the combination we want to set up for a healthy society . It doesn ’ t make any sense . ”
Just as “ local health authorities ” are ostensibly trying to protect the public from COVID-19 through “ shelter-at-home ” policies , YouTube is seeking to shelter the public from “ misinformation. ” The following characterizes the perspective of YouTube and the “ health authorities ” that YouTube is serving in a metaphorical nutshell :
Their message “ may lead others to act ” against official guidance ; in other words , their bad ideas are contagious .
The video had already “ gone viral ” ( over 5 million views ) and risked becoming a misinformation pandemic which could result in worsening the physical pandemic .
By cutting the doctors off from communicating their message to the public , YouTube is quarantining them to limit the public ’ s exposure to their “ mind viruses ” and to nip the misinformation pandemic in the bud , or to at least “ flatten its curve . ”
This is in keeping with the policy that YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki announced days ago , that YouTube would remove any content that contradicts the World Health Organization on COVID-19 .
Even assuming all the doctors ’ ideas are indeed bad , such a policy doesn ’ t work , and only makes things worse .
Just as human immune systems are built up through exposure to viruses and other pathogens ( as Dr. Erickson explained above ) , our intellectual defenses against error are strengthened through exposure to bad ideas .
When you encounter a bad idea , what can conceivably happen ? You can :
Reject or ignore it . Investigate it . Adopt it . Adopt it and implement it .
In the case of # 1 , there is no problem . Next , let ’ s consider # 4 , since that is the outcome that censors are most trying to avoid .
What happens when you adopt and implement a bad idea in your life ? In the worst-case scenario , it could destroy you . But that is far less common in life than scaremongers would have us believe . More often , we suffer but do not die . And that is a very memorable way to learn that the idea implemented was indeed bad . We learn from experience , from failure , from the “ school of hard knocks. ” That is one of the reasons why “ what does not kill you makes you stronger , ” as the saying goes .
But not everybody needs to suffer to benefit from the lessons of suffering . That brings us to # 2 : we can investigate the idea . Through investigation , we can discover the accounts ( whether first- or second-hand ) of experiments with the bad idea and their bad results . Ideally , these would be rigorously scientific experiments whenever possible .
Finally , we have # 3 , which is adopting the bad idea without implementing it . What would be the point of doing that ? Well , it could mean adopting it just enough to advocate it . And arguing for an idea is one of the most efficient ways to investigate it ( making # 3 really a subset of # 2 ) . That is because argument elicits counter-argument . And true , effective counter-arguments are , by definition , antithetical to bad ideas . Even if the apologist of the bad idea holds fast to his belief , the counter-arguments that emerge can arm debate spectators against error .
In all of the above cases , exposure to bad ideas strengthens our defenses against bad ideas . We come away equipped with truths—facts , information , and counter-arguments—drawn ultimately from experience , whether our own or that of others . These good counter-ideas are like antibodies that we develop through exposure to bad ideas . Bad ideas are not just pathogens , but antigens . We thus develop immunity , not only to those specific bad ideas , but to similar ones , because we learn to recognize the basic logical fallacies that they share .
The mind , like our immune system and our muscles , is “ antifragile ” to use the term coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb . It grows stronger through exposure to adversity .
The flipside of that is also true . Just as sheltering from antigens can lead to immunodeficiency , sheltering from bad ideas ultimately makes us more susceptible to them .
When paternalistic censors seal us up in a sterile bubble of ideas for our own “ protection , ” they deprive us of the chance to develop through experience our own ability to identify and grapple with bad ideas . As soon as a bad idea penetrates our bubble , we have no defences against it . Our lack of experience with the responsibilities of intellectual independence has left us naive , credulous , and gullible .
The more that self-appointed gatekeepers like YouTube and its allied “ health authorities ” “ protect ” us from ideas they disapprove of , the more susceptible we will be to falsehood and error ( including falsehoods foisted on us by our “ protectors ” themselves ) . This vulnerability will in turn be used to justify still more such “ protection. ” Such is the vicious cycle of sheltering .
Ironically , many secular leftists who support public-health “ influence sheltering ” probably fully understand the dangers of that practice in another instance .
The classic critique of a sheltered upbringing is that it deprives the child of experience grappling with potentially “ bad influences ” and so ultimately leaves her more vulnerable to them . The stereotypical example of this is a child raised in an exclusively religious and traditional environment , without exposure to non-traditionalist peers , popular movies and music , and tempting situations . Once this naif inevitably leaves home , perhaps to go off to college or “ the big city , ” she has no defenses against the wave of “ bad influences ” that she must then face all at once with little support , and so the wave engulfs her .
The same principle applies generally : sheltering backfires , whether the “ bad influences ” are cultural or medical .
This is one reason why open discourse is so important and censorship is so debilitating and disrespectful . We need to be allowed the responsibility and practice of identifying and guarding against falsehood to be any good at it .
Now , all of the above takes for granted , for the sake of argument , that the purported “ bad ideas ” are in fact bad , and that the censors are in possession of good ideas . However , that is often not the case . Heresies often turn out to be right , and orthodoxies often turn out to be wrong : and this includes scientific paradigms that wound up in the ash heap of history . Our “ protectors ” may be sheltering us from the truth and forcing falsehood upon us . Wrong orthodoxies are far more dangerous than wrong heresies , simply as a matter of the scale of the error ’ s impact .
That is yet another reason why open discourse is so vital . For the sake of human welfare , orthodox falsehoods need to be overthrown , and heretical truths need to spread .
The remarks of the Bakersfield doctors are probably a mix of good ideas and bad , truths and falsehoods . Taking down the video does us a disservice regarding both sides of the coin .
To the extent that they are wrong , their errors should be aired out and refuted . Any mistake the doctors made will probably be made again , since the human mind tends to fall prey to the same basic fallacies . By developing and disseminating counter-arguments ( mental antibodies ) to them , we develop our immunity to these and similar errors .
By taking down the videos , YouTube has limited the extent to which that social learning can happen and insulated the error from debunking . If anything , YouTube ’ s censorship has lent additional credence to whatever mistakes they made by feeding into the narrative that the powers-that-be fear its truth . The debunking is being drowned out by outrage over the censorship . And the Streisand Effect ( how censorship can boost something ’ s publicity ) is causing it to spread even more .
Moreover , even if the physicians are wrong in some ways ( like in their statistical claims ) , they may be right in other important ways .
Whether or not sheltering bodies is a wise policy for the spread of COVID-19 , sheltering minds is surely a bad policy for the spread of ideas .","YouTube has been removing videos of a press briefing in which two doctors criticize the sweeping “shelter-at-home” edicts that governments have imposed throughout the world in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Whatever the veracity of the doctors’ claims, YouTube’s censorship of unorthodox ideas in the name of protecting the public from misinformation is misguided and counter-productive. Sheltering the public from ideas, even bad ones, only makes society more susceptible to dangerous error.

Quarantining Ideas

One of the censored doctors’ critiques of shelter-at-home provides an apt metaphor for the folly of censorship. Dr. Erickson said:

“I’d like to go over some basic things about how the immune system functions so people have a good understanding. The immune system is built by exposure to antigens: viruses, bacteria.

And then you’ve got diseases spike—amongst a hospital system with furloughed doctors and nurses. This is not the combination we want to set up for a healthy society. It doesn’t make any sense.”

Just as “local health authorities” are ostensibly trying to protect the public from COVID-19 through “shelter-at-home” policies, YouTube is seeking to shelter the public from “misinformation.” The following characterizes the perspective of YouTube and the “health authorities” that YouTube is serving in a metaphorical nutshell:

The dissenting doctors are infected with harmful ideas.

Their message “may lead others to act” against official guidance; in other words, their bad ideas are contagious.

The video had already “gone viral” (over 5 million views) and risked becoming a misinformation pandemic which could result in worsening the physical pandemic.

By cutting the doctors off from communicating their message to the public, YouTube is quarantining them to limit the public’s exposure to their “mind viruses” and to nip the misinformation pandemic in the bud, or to at least “flatten its curve.”

This is in keeping with the policy that YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki announced days ago, that YouTube would remove any content that contradicts the World Health Organization on COVID-19.

Even assuming all the doctors’ ideas are indeed bad, such a policy doesn’t work, and only makes things worse.

The Intellectual Immune System

Just as human immune systems are built up through exposure to viruses and other pathogens (as Dr. Erickson explained above), our intellectual defenses against error are strengthened through exposure to bad ideas.

When you encounter a bad idea, what can conceivably happen? You can:

Reject or ignore it. Investigate it. Adopt it. Adopt it and implement it.

In the case of #1, there is no problem. Next, let’s consider #4, since that is the outcome that censors are most trying to avoid.

What happens when you adopt and implement a bad idea in your life? In the worst-case scenario, it could destroy you. But that is far less common in life than scaremongers would have us believe. More often, we suffer but do not die. And that is a very memorable way to learn that the idea implemented was indeed bad. We learn from experience, from failure, from the “school of hard knocks.” That is one of the reasons why “what does not kill you makes you stronger,” as the saying goes.

But not everybody needs to suffer to benefit from the lessons of suffering. That brings us to #2: we can investigate the idea. Through investigation, we can discover the accounts (whether first- or second-hand) of experiments with the bad idea and their bad results. Ideally, these would be rigorously scientific experiments whenever possible.

Finally, we have #3, which is adopting the bad idea without implementing it. What would be the point of doing that? Well, it could mean adopting it just enough to advocate it. And arguing for an idea is one of the most efficient ways to investigate it (making #3 really a subset of #2). That is because argument elicits counter-argument. And true, effective counter-arguments are, by definition, antithetical to bad ideas. Even if the apologist of the bad idea holds fast to his belief, the counter-arguments that emerge can arm debate spectators against error.

In all of the above cases, exposure to bad ideas strengthens our defenses against bad ideas.

These good counter-ideas are like antibodies that we develop through exposure to bad ideas. Bad ideas are not just pathogens, but antigens. We thus develop immunity, not only to those specific bad ideas, but to similar ones, because we learn to recognize the basic logical fallacies that they share.

The mind, like our immune system and our muscles, is “antifragile” to use the term coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. It grows stronger through exposure to adversity.

The Dangerous Safety of the Bubble

The flipside of that is also true. Just as sheltering from antigens can lead to immunodeficiency, sheltering from bad ideas ultimately makes us more susceptible to them.

When paternalistic censors seal us up in a sterile bubble of ideas for our own “protection,” they deprive us of the chance to develop through experience our own ability to identify and grapple with bad ideas. As soon as a bad idea penetrates our bubble, we have no defences against it. Our lack of experience with the responsibilities of intellectual independence has left us naive, credulous, and gullible.

This vulnerability will in turn be used to justify still more such “protection.” Such is the vicious cycle of sheltering.

This is one reason why open discourse is so important and censorship is so debilitating and disrespectful. We need to be allowed the responsibility and practice of identifying and guarding against falsehood to be any good at it.

Protected from the Truth

Now, all of the above takes for granted, for the sake of argument, that the purported “bad ideas” are in fact bad, and that the censors are in possession of good ideas. However, that is often not the case. Heresies often turn out to be right, and orthodoxies often turn out to be wrong: and this includes scientific paradigms that wound up in the ash heap of history. Our “protectors” may be sheltering us from the truth and forcing falsehood upon us. Wrong orthodoxies are far more dangerous than wrong heresies, simply as a matter of the scale of the error’s impact.

Moreover, even if the physicians are wrong in some ways (like in their statistical claims), they may be right in other important ways.

E. Cupp, Sun-Times Wire, Georgia Nicols, ""Michael OBrien"", Mitch Dudek, Sun-Times Staff, Lynn Sweet","Like thousands and thousands of others , I spent two-and-a-half hours on Friday night watching the streaming version of “ Hamilton ” on Disney+ with my family for the first time .
I had a hunch that I ’ d like it — I ’ m a fan of most musicals and , until recently , a regular theatergoer . But I surprised even myself . I didn ’ t like it , I loved it .
Lin-Manuel Miranda ’ s masterpiece was everything a terrific musical should be : stirring , witty , inspiring , anthemic , singable , quotable , dazzling . I ’ m only mad I didn ’ t make it a point to see it in the theater , and that I waited so long to add “ You ’ ll Be Back ” to my shower repertoire .
Columnists In-depth political coverage , sports analysis , entertainment reviews and cultural commentary .
Because of COVID-19 , art , like expensive Broadway musicals , feature films , even opera and art installations , is being delivered to our living rooms . That incredible democratization , even if by default and not design , is a great thing — but with it comes the increased scrutiny of a wider audience , and at a time when America is collectively reexamining nearly everything we ’ ve ever made over the course of our history .
In the case of “ Hamilton , ” the very recent history . Miranda ’ s musical is just five years old , and yet , through today ’ s eyes is rubbing some as insufficiently honest about the Founding Fathers ’ roles in slavery .
It doesn ’ t avoid the issue — there are plenty of references to slavery throughout the musical . In one song , Hamilton raps scoldingly at Thomas Jefferson :
“ Your debts are paid ’ cause you don ’ t pay for labor/
We plant seeds in the South . We create . Yeah , keep ranting/
Nonetheless , some have criticized the glorification of George Washington , who himself owned slaves , and the non-acknowledgment that Hamilton was friends with and married into slave-owning families , leading of course to a # CancelHamilton trending topic on Twitter .
Miranda has responded to calls for its “ cancellation , ” or ex-communication from polite society , by politely admitting , “ All the criticisms are valid . The sheer tonnage of complexities & failings of these people I couldn ’ t get . Or wrestled with but cut . I took 6 years and fit as much as I could in a 2.5-hour musical . Did my best . It ’ s all fair game . ”
He ’ s right , of course . No art should be above criticism , and there are certainly ways to see “ Hamilton ” as glossing over that ugly history . But that ’ s also OK — it ’ s not the job of art to be honest .
The debates we ’ re having over Confederate statues , monuments , military bases and high schools are very different than any we might indulge over “ Hamilton. ” These memorials were meant to honor men we now roundly agree were in fact dishonorable , traitors and the losers of a war that tore our country apart . Our monuments must be reflective not only of the nation we once were , but the nation we strive to be . Because they are earnest reflections of our aspirations , they must be honest .

S.E . Cupp is the host of “ S.E . Cupp Unfiltered ” on CNN .","Like thousands and thousands of others, I spent two-and-a-half hours on Friday night watching the streaming version of “Hamilton” on Disney+ with my family for the first time.

I was gobsmacked.

I had a hunch that I’d like it — I’m a fan of most musicals and, until recently, a regular theatergoer. But I surprised even myself. I didn’t like it, I loved it.

Lin-Manuel Miranda’s masterpiece was everything a terrific musical should be: stirring, witty, inspiring, anthemic, singable, quotable, dazzling. I’m only mad I didn’t make it a point to see it in the theater, and that I waited so long to add “You’ll Be Back” to my shower repertoire.

Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.

Because of COVID-19, art, like expensive Broadway musicals, feature films, even opera and art installations, is being delivered to our living rooms. That incredible democratization, even if by default and not design, is a great thing — but with it comes the increased scrutiny of a wider audience, and at a time when America is collectively reexamining nearly everything we’ve ever made over the course of our history.

In the case of “Hamilton,” the very recent history. Miranda’s musical is just five years old, and yet, through today’s eyes is rubbing some as insufficiently honest about the Founding Fathers’ roles in slavery.

It doesn’t avoid the issue — there are plenty of references to slavery throughout the musical. In one song, Hamilton raps scoldingly at Thomas Jefferson:

“Your debts are paid ’cause you don’t pay for labor/

We plant seeds in the South. We create. Yeah, keep ranting/

We know who’s really doing the planting.”

Nonetheless, some have criticized the glorification of George Washington, who himself owned slaves, and the non-acknowledgment that Hamilton was friends with and married into slave-owning families, leading of course to a #CancelHamilton trending topic on Twitter.

Miranda has responded to calls for its “cancellation,” or ex-communication from polite society, by politely admitting, “All the criticisms are valid. The sheer tonnage of complexities & failings of these people I couldn’t get. Or wrestled with but cut. I took 6 years and fit as much as I could in a 2.5-hour musical. Did my best. It’s all fair game.”

He’s right, of course. No art should be above criticism, and there are certainly ways to see “Hamilton” as glossing over that ugly history. But that’s also OK — it’s not the job of art to be honest.

The debates we’re having over Confederate statues, monuments, military bases and high schools are very different than any we might indulge over “Hamilton.” These memorials were meant to honor men we now roundly agree were in fact dishonorable, traitors and the losers of a war that tore our country apart. Our monuments must be reflective not only of the nation we once were, but the nation we strive to be. Because they are earnest reflections of our aspirations, they must be honest.

Art faces no such burden. Art can lie, it can cheat, it can steal. It can manipulate you, trick you, tease you. Some of the best art is uncomfortable, often offensive, and thought-provoking. Miranda’s musical is — and is allowed to be — all of those things.

Art is under no obligation to be complete, either. Even in the telling of true stories, requiring them to be consummate would be ludicrous, and turn works like “Evita,” “Miss Saigon” and “Les Miserables” into dreary, pedantic, didactic history lessons. Art is incomplete. Art is a collection of decisions. Art is versions.

Art, for the record, is also allowed to be “bad.” From Edgar Degas’ “Little Dancer,” which was detested by the French salons of the time, to Marcel Duchamp’s “Fountain,” excluded from the Society of Independent Artists inaugural exhibit, art need not be pleasing to anybody.

Finally, art is never finished. Miranda’s take on the Founding Fathers isn’t the first, nor should it be the last. There’s room for countless more takes. In this way, the debate over “Hamilton” and whether it covers slavery sufficiently opens the door for something new — a musical that tells that story instead. But leave this one alone.

Silicon Valley, we have a problem.

Over the pandemic-filled last four months , one thing ’ s become clear : Face masks can slow the spread of coronavirus and help to flatten the curve . The only issue ? Mask-wearing is starting to look like a giant collective action problem — and many Americans are refusing to cooperate .
For months , scientists and doctors waffled about the usefulness of masks . The Centers for Disease Control , or CDC , repeatedly told Americans not to buy or wear them if they had no COVID-19 symptoms ; in March , Anthony Fauci , one of the top White House advisors on the pandemic , told 60 Minutes that “ there ’ s no reason to be walking around with a mask . ”
But that messaging began to change as new research emerged on masks ’ efficacy , and as countries with widespread mask use — like Japan and South Korea — appeared to squash the outbreak more quickly . In early April , the CDC reversed their recommendation , encouraging “ cloth face coverings ” as a voluntary health measure . Earlier this month , the World Health Organization did the same , advising the general public to wear “ non-medical masks ” wherever there is widespread transmission of the virus .

According to a growing consensus , the coronavirus travels in droplets spewed from peoples ’ mouths when they talk , cough , or breathe . And the latest research indicates that while homemade masks don ’ t protect the wearer much from virus-laden particles coming in , they do keep those droplets from spilling out . ( Medical-grade masks like N95s , on the other hand , do both . )
“ If you ’ re wearing a mask , you ’ re mainly doing it to protect everybody else around you , ” said Jay Van Bavel , associate professor of psychology and neural science at New York University . We would be better off if everyone wore masks , but there ’ s a small cost to each person that wears them : fogged-up glasses , irritated skin , or just the annoyance of putting it on and taking off . That means there ’ s an incentive to “ free-ride ” — if everyone else wears a mask , their caution keeps you safe and spares you the trouble of having to wear one yourself . But the more people free-ride , the more everyone is at risk .
In psychology , this type of scenario is known as a collective action problem , or social dilemma . These problems have plagued society for decades , particularly when it comes to the environment . The ecologist Garrett Hardin famously wrote about the “ tragedy of the commons , ” or the dangers that result when everyone tries to free-ride on one shared resource , like an open pasture or a lake full of fish . Climate change , meanwhile , may be the most notorious collective action problem of all , since it requires the cooperation of every country on the planet .
America has a patchy record with collective action . It may not be a coincidence that the United States is the only country in the world that ’ s trying to withdraw from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement , which calls on nations to cooperate to fight dangerous climate change , or that we have an uneven history of vaccinating children . Americans , it seems , don ’ t always like being told what to do , even if it ’ s in the best interest of their communities .
Part of the problem is the deep partisan divisions in the U.S. Republicans are more likely to be individualists , valuing personal choice and freedoms ; Democrats are more likely to look at how communities will be affected as a whole .
These divisions have shown up during the pandemic , sometimes in unexpected ways . According to an analysis by Peter Sharkey , professor of sociology at Princeton University , one of the strongest predictors of compliance with social distancing is belief in climate change — those who accept that climate change is happening , and is human-caused , are more likely to stay at home . Similarly , an April poll by Morning Consult found that climate skeptics are much less likely to wear masks than those “ concerned ” about climate change . People worried about one collective action problem ( climate change ) appear more likely to be worried about another ( COVID-19 ) .
Van Bavel , the psychology professor , says that polarization doesn ’ t automatically mean that these problems can ’ t be addressed . In many cases , social norms and sanctions ( think public shaming ) can encourage cooperation . For example , secondhand smoke is a collective action problem , but one that has , at least to some extent , been “ solved ” : Nonpartisan norms and regulations control where and how individuals can smoke so that they don ’ t create respiratory problems for others .
Another way to encourage cooperation is through role-modeling . “ If somebody you look to and respect and trust is wearing a mask , lots of research suggests you ’ re going to be more likely to wear one , ” Van Bavel said . Unfortunately , though , that trend cuts both ways — elite figures can also undermine cooperation when they eschew social norms .
That has been the case for many prominent Republican leaders during the crisis . President Trump , for example , has repeatedly refused to wear a mask in front of cameras , even though reports say that he sometimes wears one in private ; in a rambling interview with the Wall Street Journal last week , he also claimed that Americans wear masks not to protect themselves , but to signal disapproval of him .
But as evidence accumulates in support of masks , some Republicans are changing their tune . In Texas , Governor Greg Abbott spent months refusing calls by mayors to allow mandates for mask-wearing in public spaces , saying that it might infringe on personal liberties . But , in light of Texas ’ skyrocketing coronavirus cases and a desire to keep businesses open , he has reversed this position . Many other governors across the country have also recommended or mandated the use of masks .
Now , the U.S. seems to be moving into a new stage of the coronavirus pandemic : Counties and states are focusing less on forced social cohesion through stay-at-home orders and more on individual assessments of risk . As stores and restaurants reopen , people are encouraged to make decisions for themselves about how — and when — to leave their homes .
But mask-wearing can ’ t be boiled down to a personal decision if we want to slow the spread of the coronavirus . It ’ s not the first collective action problem to stymie the country , and unfortunately , it won ’ t be the last . According to Sharkey , the roots of Americans ’ stubbornness on collective action go much deeper than COVID-19 . It might take better role models , firmer regulations , and stronger social norms , but to address the pandemic — and combat even larger issues , like climate change — Americans are going to have to figure out a way to put society ’ s interests above their own .","News on climate in the time of coronavirus Subscribe today

To the establishment Left, led by the New York Times, the El Paso shooter operated as if he were a white nationalist acting on orders from Donald Trump. Some on the right, meantime, linked the Dayton shooter’s actions to Antifa. In a healthy political environment, Americans, regardless of political views, would consider these tragedies the heinous actions of disturbed people, motivated mostly by a dangerous combination of madness and ideology. But in our warped political climate, everyone assumes that their enemies want to kill them.

Robinson, Robert Greene Ii, Lyta Gold, Piper French, Alexander Kolokotronis","Donald Trump ’ s Independence Day speech at Mount Rushmore was a call to arms to take on the evil mob destroying our beloved country ’ s values . It was a thunderous condemnation of the political left , and a promise to seize the country from the “ totalitarian ” proponents of “ social justice ” who are destroying our culture of “ free and open debate , ” replacing it with “ cancel culture and speech codes ” :
In our schools , our newsrooms , even our corporate boardrooms , there is a new far-left fascism that demands absolute allegiance . If you do not speak its language , perform its rituals , recite its mantras , and follow its commandments , then you will be censored , banished , blacklisted , persecuted , and punished… One of their political weapons is “ Cancel Culture ” — driving people from their jobs , shaming dissenters , and demanding total submission from anyone who disagrees . This is the very definition of totalitarianism , and it is completely alien to our culture and our values , and it has absolutely no place in the United States of America . This attack on our liberty , our magnificent liberty , must be stopped , and it will be stopped very quickly . We will expose this dangerous movement , protect our nation ’ s children , end this radical assault , and preserve our beloved American way of life .
Trump ’ s picture of what is going on in the country is totally detached from reality . Totalitarianism involves guns and concentration camps . The “ radical left ” in the United States has two members of Congress , Bernie Sanders and AOC . ( Perhaps Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib . ) This is the same conservative persecution complex we have heard for decades ; some of the richest and most powerful people in the world complaining that the “ far left ” are totalitarians . The left is permanently tarred as Stalinist thought police trying to put dissenters in the gulag—even as the contemporary left is trying to dismantle both police and prisons and reduce the power of the carceral state .
It should be clear what ’ s going on here . Trump ’ s much-vaunted economy has tanked . Well over 100,000 people have died of coronavirus and cases are on the rise . Eight out of 10 people report that they are dissatisfied with the direction the country is going , and Joe Biden is outpolling Trump consistently . Americans have only gotten more sympathetic to immigrants over time , so he can ’ t run on scapegoating Mexicans like he did in 2016 . Trump has one approach left : try to reignite the culture wars and convince people that a censorious P.C . left is trying to destroy our freedom .
But Trump is not the only one who sees the left as a threat to freedom . Rolling Stone journalist Matt Taibbi has said that the “ American left has lost its mind , ” and that “ leaders of this new movement are replacing traditional liberal beliefs about tolerance , free inquiry , and even racial harmony with ideas so toxic and unattractive that they eschew debate , moving straight to shaming , threats , and intimidation. ” Yesterday , Harper ’ s magazine—which previously fired an editor for criticizing an anti-MeToo essay , and gave the world a 7,000 word self-pitying rant from an NPR host dismissed for sexual harassment and incompetence—published a short open letter on “ Justice and Open Debate ” co-signed by a motley assortment of luminaries , arguing that free speech is under attack :
The free exchange of information and ideas , the lifeblood of a liberal society , is daily becoming more constricted . While we have come to expect this on the radical right , censoriousness is also spreading more widely in our culture : an intolerance of opposing views , a vogue for public shaming and ostracism , and the tendency to dissolve complex policy issues in a blinding moral certainty . We uphold the value of robust and even caustic counter-speech from all quarters . But it is now all too common to hear calls for swift and severe retribution in response to perceived transgressions of speech and thought . More troubling still , institutional leaders , in a spirit of panicked damage control , are delivering hasty and disproportionate punishments instead of considered reforms . Editors are fired for running controversial pieces ; books are withdrawn for alleged inauthenticity ; journalists are barred from writing on certain topics ; professors are investigated for quoting works of literature in class ; a researcher is fired for circulating a peer-reviewed academic study ; and the heads of organizations are ousted for what are sometimes just clumsy mistakes . Whatever the arguments around each particular incident , the result has been to steadily narrow the boundaries of what can be said without the threat of reprisal .
When I say the collection of co-signers was motley , I mean it . Included were :
( Ironically , several of the signatories have previously been publicly involved in efforts to get people ’ s careers ruined over their speech . )
The statement itself is framed as a vague and unobjectionable endorsement of free speech , and several signatories had evidently assumed that ’ s what they were endorsing . But it is very clearly mainly a warning about censoriousness coming from the left . This is clear not only from the it ’ s not just the right anymore framing , but from the examples the letter uses to support its case . These are vague ( “ editors are fired , ” “ journalists are barred from writing , ” “ professors are investigated for quoting works of literature , ” “ a researcher is fired ” ) , and the letter specifically declines to litigate the facts of individual incidents . But a book attacked for “ inauthenticity ” is probably American Dirt ( though it was not withdrawn and is a bestseller ) , an editor fired is probably James Bennet , who resigned from the New York Times op-ed page after printing an op-ed by far right politician Tom Cotton calling for crushing protesters with military force . ( Though it could also refer to Ian Buruma , a signatory to the letter , the New York Review of Books editor who had to leave the publication after publishing a serial rapist ’ s excuses for his crimes . ) The “ professor investigated ” might well be the UCLA professor investigated for reading the n-word aloud in “ Letter from Birmingham Jail ” after his Black students asked him not to say it . The “ researcher fired ” was almost certainly David Shor , who may or may not ( he has never claimed he was ) have been fired for posting a study encouraging protesters to be nonviolent .
The letter appeared on the surface to be a fairly uncontroversial statement in support of tolerance and open discussion . Fredrik deBoer even argues that anyone who objects to the letter must be objecting to free speech itself , because all the letter is is a statement that free speech is good . But the letter actually goes further : It implies that the theory of a widespread culture of repression and censoriousness on the left is accurate , and there is a serious issue with people being persecuted in the name of social justice .
Anyone should be able to agree that openness is good , due process is good , and arbitrary firings are bad . The more controversial question is whether there is , in fact , a dangerous leftist “ cancel culture ” that threatens our liberty of thought . The American right believes there is . Trump is staking his reelection on the hope that the public agrees . And if it ’ s true , there is a serious problem with the left .
But when you look at the actual incidents , usually the case swiftly begins to crumble . There ’ s a reason the letter kept the charges vague and did not provide links . Most of the actual incidents are more complicated than the “ political correctness gone mad ” framework suggests . If I tell you a professor was investigated for reading a historical document aloud , you might be outraged . But if I add some more facts , namely that the professor had been told by his Black students that they ’ d prefer he not say the n-word , and he disregarded them , the complaint seems slightly less insane . If I tell you that Ian Buruma was fired over “ printing the wrong article , ” you might cry “ censorship ! ” But I haven ’ t told you that the article in question was a sex criminal lying about his crimes in an effort to manipulate the public into sympathizing with him—a strange piece of writing to appear in the New York Review of Books .
Critical facts are almost always left out . In 2017 , Third World Quarterly pulled an article called “ The Case for Colonialism , ” after a petition calling for its removal . The writer said a “ Maoist ” “ hate mob ” had “ tried to silence me , ” and in the conservative press he was presented as a victim of the Pervasive Liberal Bias on campus . Left out , though , was the fact that the article was appallingly bad as a piece of scholarship . Even an article from the libertarian Cato Institute said it was “ empirically and historically inaccurate ” and “ misuses existing postcolonial scholarship. ” The arguments it made were really , really bad . It was like publishing an article denying the Holocaust . If a peer-reviewed journal had published an article denying the Holocaust , would calls to retract it be seen as “ politically correct ” “ Maoist ” thought policing , or a reasonable demand for scholarship to conform to basic intellectual and moral standards ?
Frequently , there is far more justice in the charges made by “ social justice warriors ” than their critics want to admit . There was , for instance , always good reason why students thought Charles Murray and Milo Yiannopoulos were not figures worthy of the honor of being invited to speak at a prestigious college . But just as importantly , the “ outrage mobs ” that “ come for ” people are usually relatively powerless . Charles Murray , after all , ended up getting to speak successfully at Harvard and Yale . As Osita Nwanevu documents in an excellent essay on the myths around “ cancel culture , ” generally speaking the main thing the “ social justice mobs ” can do to people is yell at them on Twitter . And while nobody likes getting yelled at on Twitter , invoking the specter of “ lynch mobs , ” “ Robespierre , ” and “ Maoism ” is an insult to the millions of historical victims of actual violent repression by actual powerful oppressors . Nwanevu shows that generally , the “ problematic ” people end up doing just fine . They suffer reputational consequences sometimes , meaning part of the public doesn ’ t like them . But the actual people who end up being “ silenced ” tend not to be those who say “ politically incorrect ” things , but rather leftist dissidents who question the power structure . The suggestion that “ both sides ” are Totalitarian is willfully oblivious to who really has power in this country . We hear constantly from anti-P.C . types who are Just Asking Questions about the Forbidden Issues . The voices that vanish from discussions , on the other hand , are immigrants in detention facilities , or incarcerated men and women in Covid-ridden prisons . Far more Orwellian than anything the left does is the way the American media presented a right-wing coup in Bolivia as a restoration of democracy or the assassination of an Iranian official as something other than an international crime .
Conservatives do not want us to talk about the actual “ manufacturing of consent ” in this country , so they spin a tale about a topsy-turvy world in which college students , Black and transgender people hold all the power and rich white men are persecuted and sent to the gulag . This story should be easy to see through , because it ’ s so laughably at odds with reality . But when “ liberal ” academics sign onto it , as with the Harper ’ s letter , the “ moral panic ” around P.C . culture is given new legitimacy .
Of course , there is a problem in this country with “ people getting fired over speech , ” like the Black Lives Matter supporter recently fired from Deloitte over a TikTok video . But the big problem here is at-will employment , not “ cancel culture. ” American workplaces are dictatorships , meaning your boss can fire you for any reason . So , if there ’ s even a slight controversy around you , no matter how small it is , your boss may well just can you to avoid the headache . This means that even if it ’ s a misunderstanding and the person accusing you deletes their accusation , you will still be let go and have no recourse , because capitalism does not give a shit whether you live or die .
The solution , of course , is unions . The way to prevent arbitrary firings is to make arbitrary firings impossible , by ensuring that all workers receive due process and can ’ t be let go except for just cause . A person ’ s livelihood is incredibly important , which is why the unequal bargaining power between employers and the employed is so unfair . Arguments that “ P.C . culture ” is the problem blame the left for problems that result from institutional hierarchies and imbalances of power . Our side should not accept the blame , because we are the ones who are trying to reduce the reach of police , prisons , and bosses .
It is frustrating when people who are not right-wing lunatics echo the language used by Donald Trump about the left . Donald Trump has risen to power by spinning tales about an America that doesn ’ t exist , one plagued by marauding hordes of immigrants , vandals , and Stalinists . He promises the public that he will restore a better America , one that also never existed . It is our job to expose these fictions for what they are , and provide a better vision of what could be . Having liberals and leftists endorse the right-wing myth about Totalitarian Leftist Mobs feeds into Trump ’ s culture war re-election strategy . We should refuse to concede , then , that the grotesque caricature of social justice movements is true . We should demand that the full facts of these “ canceling ” incidents , rather than vague innuendos and selective details , be put on the table and evaluated fairly . And we need to point to the real problems in this country , which do not come from angry anti-racists on Twitter—who mostly just tweet—but from a government that is letting its people die , and a class of oligarchs that couldn ’ t care how much ordinary people suffer so long as the stock market keeps going up .","Donald Trump’s Independence Day speech at Mount Rushmore was a call to arms to take on the evil mob destroying our beloved country’s values.

These are vague (“editors are fired,” “journalists are barred from writing,” “professors are investigated for quoting works of literature,” “a researcher is fired”), and the letter specifically declines to litigate the facts of individual incidents. But a book attacked for “inauthenticity” is probably American Dirt (though it was not withdrawn and is a bestseller), an editor fired is probably James Bennet, who resigned from the New York Times op-ed page after printing an op-ed by far right politician Tom Cotton calling for crushing protesters with military force. (Though it could also refer to Ian Buruma, a signatory to the letter, the New York Review of Books editor who had to leave the publication after publishing a serial rapist’s excuses for his crimes.) The “professor investigated” might well be the UCLA professor investigated for reading the n-word aloud in “Letter from Birmingham Jail” after his Black students asked him not to say it. The “researcher fired” was almost certainly David Shor, who may or may not (he has never claimed he was) have been fired for posting a study encouraging protesters to be nonviolent.

The letter appeared on the surface to be a fairly uncontroversial statement in support of tolerance and open discussion. Fredrik deBoer even argues that anyone who objects to the letter must be objecting to free speech itself, because all the letter is is a statement that free speech is good. But the letter actually goes further: It implies that the theory of a widespread culture of repression and censoriousness on the left is accurate, and there is a serious issue with people being persecuted in the name of social justice.

Anyone should be able to agree that openness is good, due process is good, and arbitrary firings are bad. The more controversial question is whether there is, in fact, a dangerous leftist “cancel culture” that threatens our liberty of thought. The American right believes there is. Trump is staking his reelection on the hope that the public agrees. And if it’s true, there is a serious problem with the left.

But when you look at the actual incidents, usually the case swiftly begins to crumble. There’s a reason the letter kept the charges vague and did not provide links. Most of the actual incidents are more complicated than the “political correctness gone mad” framework suggests. If I tell you a professor was investigated for reading a historical document aloud, you might be outraged. But if I add some more facts, namely that the professor had been told by his Black students that they’d prefer he not say the n-word, and he disregarded them, the complaint seems slightly less insane. If I tell you that Ian Buruma was fired over “printing the wrong article,” you might cry “censorship!” But I haven’t told you that the article in question was a sex criminal lying about his crimes in an effort to manipulate the public into sympathizing with him—a strange piece of writing to appear in the New York Review of Books.

Critical facts are almost always left out. In 2017, Third World Quarterly pulled an article called “The Case for Colonialism,” after a petition calling for its removal. The writer said a “Maoist” “hate mob” had “tried to silence me,” and in the conservative press he was presented as a victim of the Pervasive Liberal Bias on campus. Left out, though, was the fact that the article was appallingly bad as a piece of scholarship. Even an article from the libertarian Cato Institute said it was “empirically and historically inaccurate” and “misuses existing postcolonial scholarship.” The arguments it made were really, really bad. It was like publishing an article denying the Holocaust. If a peer-reviewed journal had published an article denying the Holocaust, would calls to retract it be seen as “politically correct” “Maoist” thought policing, or a reasonable demand for scholarship to conform to basic intellectual and moral standards?

Frequently, there is far more justice in the charges made by “social justice warriors” than their critics want to admit. There was, for instance, always good reason why students thought Charles Murray and Milo Yiannopoulos were not figures worthy of the honor of being invited to speak at a prestigious college. But just as importantly, the “outrage mobs” that “come for” people are usually relatively powerless. Charles Murray, after all, ended up getting to speak successfully at Harvard and Yale. As Osita Nwanevu documents in an excellent essay on the myths around “cancel culture,” generally speaking the main thing the “social justice mobs” can do to people is yell at them on Twitter. And while nobody likes getting yelled at on Twitter, invoking the specter of “lynch mobs,” “Robespierre,” and “Maoism” is an insult to the millions of historical victims of actual violent repression by actual powerful oppressors. Nwanevu shows that generally, the “problematic” people end up doing just fine. They suffer reputational consequences sometimes, meaning part of the public doesn’t like them. But the actual people who end up being “silenced” tend not to be those who say “politically incorrect” things, but rather leftist dissidents who question the power structure. The suggestion that “both sides” are Totalitarian is willfully oblivious to who really has power in this country. We hear constantly from anti-P.C. types who are Just Asking Questions about the Forbidden Issues. The voices that vanish from discussions, on the other hand, are immigrants in detention facilities, or incarcerated men and women in Covid-ridden prisons. Far more Orwellian than anything the left does is the way the American media presented a right-wing coup in Bolivia as a restoration of democracy or the assassination of an Iranian official as something other than an international crime.

Conservatives do not want us to talk about the actual “manufacturing of consent” in this country, so they spin a tale about a topsy-turvy world in which college students, Black and transgender people hold all the power and rich white men are persecuted and sent to the gulag. This story should be easy to see through, because it’s so laughably at odds with reality. But when “liberal” academics sign onto it, as with the Harper’s letter, the “moral panic” around P.C. culture is given new legitimacy.

Of course, there is a problem in this country with “people getting fired over speech,” like the Black Lives Matter supporter recently fired from Deloitte over a TikTok video. But the big problem here is at-will employment, not “cancel culture.” American workplaces are dictatorships, meaning your boss can fire you for any reason. So, if there’s even a slight controversy around you, no matter how small it is, your boss may well just can you to avoid the headache. This means that even if it’s a misunderstanding and the person accusing you deletes their accusation, you will still be let go and have no recourse, because capitalism does not give a shit whether you live or die.

The solution, of course, is unions. The way to prevent arbitrary firings is to make arbitrary firings impossible, by ensuring that all workers receive due process and can’t be let go except for just cause. A person’s livelihood is incredibly important, which is why the unequal bargaining power between employers and the employed is so unfair. Arguments that “P.C. culture” is the problem blame the left for problems that result from institutional hierarchies and imbalances of power. Our side should not accept the blame, because we are the ones who are trying to reduce the reach of police, prisons, and bosses.

It is frustrating when people who are not right-wing lunatics echo the language used by Donald Trump about the left. Donald Trump has risen to power by spinning tales about an America that doesn’t exist, one plagued by marauding hordes of immigrants, vandals, and Stalinists. He promises the public that he will restore a better America, one that also never existed. It is our job to expose these fictions for what they are, and provide a better vision of what could be. Having liberals and leftists endorse the right-wing myth about Totalitarian Leftist Mobs feeds into Trump’s culture war re-election strategy. We should refuse to concede, then, that the grotesque caricature of social justice movements is true. We should demand that the full facts of these “canceling” incidents, rather than vague innuendos and selective details, be put on the table and evaluated fairly. And we need to point to the real problems in this country, which do not come from angry anti-racists on Twitter—who mostly just tweet—but from a government that is letting its people die, and a class of oligarchs that couldn’t care how much ordinary people suffer so long as the stock market keeps going up.",www.currentaffairs.org,left,u5vzsSJWVbUnm7gt

What’s happening

One of the most challenging pieces of guidance to help stem the spread of the coronavirus has been advising people to limit in-person interactions to those they live with. For some, that means being stuck inside with only family members for weeks on end. For those who live alone, it means complete solitude at home.

Limiting close contact with others is the most important step in containing the number of infections. But sticking to those restrictions can carry a heavy mental health toll.

Social bubbles are essentially partnerships between groups of people who all agree to limit their in-person contact to others within the group. This arrangement, in theory, could satisfy people’s social needs while adding only a small amount of infection risk.

While no formal rules around shared household bubbles exist in the U.S., some American families have joined forces to alleviate the strain of lockdown.

Why there’s debate

Advocates for social bubbles say letting people expand their circle of friends may be an important step in establishing a sustainable way of life amid the ongoing pandemic. Strict isolation, while the most effective means of containing the virus, may not be something most people can maintain much longer. Bubbles could provide the social nourishment people need — plus some much-needed help with day-to-day needs like shopping and childcare — with only a slight increase in risk, if members stay within their groups.

Bubbles may even prove necessary to avoid more dangerous outcomes if people become overwhelmed by “quarantine fatigue” and abandon distancing measures altogether, some psychologists say. “There must be a middle ground between all of us staying at home and all of us meeting the people we want in the ways we want to,” a British researcher studying the feasibility of bubbles told CNN. Contained social circles would also make it easier to limit isolated outbreaks before they spread to the broader population.

Skeptics of social bubbles argue that they may create more risk. The more people in a group, the more opportunities for someone to become infected. If someone does contract the virus, they risk passing it to a larger number of people. Social bubbles rely on a level of commitment that may be unrealistic to expect people to maintain over a long period of time, some argue.

The state is “a gang of thieves writ large,” economist Murray Rothbard is said to have remarked. I’ve always viewed that sort of comment with a bit of skepticism. But now I’m beginning to wonder.

I wonder more when I read things like this report from the Washington Examiner: “The CIA's inspector general is claiming it inadvertently destroyed its only copy of a classified, three-volume Senate report on torture, prompting a leading senator to ask for reassurance that it was in fact ‘an accident.’”

Here’s a hint: It very likely wasn’t.

Is that unfair? I mean, it could have been an accident, right? Yeah it could have been. But it wasn’t. Accidents like that just don’t happen — or, when they do, they’re generally not accidents. And it’s right for people who have custody of evidence to know that any convenient “accidents” will give rise to the presumption that they had something pretty awful to hide, and that they hid it.

But, of course, the CIA’s “accident” was only the latest in a long rash of “accidental” losses of incriminating information in this administration. The IRS — whose Tea Party-targeting scandal is now over 1,100 days old without anyone being charged or sent to jail — seems to have a habit of ”accidentally” destroying hard drives containing potentially incriminating evidence. It has done so in spite of court orders, in spite of Congressional inquiries and in spite of pretty much everyone’s belief that these “accidents” were actually the deliberate, illegal destruction of incriminating evidence to protect the guilty.

Then there’s Hillary’s email scandal, in which emails kept on a private unsecure server — presumably to avoid Freedom of Information Act disclosures — were deleted. Now emails from Hillary’s IT guy, who is believed to have set up the server, have gone poof.

“Destroy the evidence, and you’ve got it made,” said an old frozen dinner commercial. But now that appears to be the motto of the United States government.

So why do the rest of us bother to obey the law? And, yes, that’s an increasingly serious question.

People follow the law for a mix of reasons. First, they may simply fear punishment. That undoubtedly motivates a lot of people, though in fact the risk of punishment is usually pretty low, and people, in general, obey the law even when the risk of being caught is negligible.

People may also obey the law because they agree with it: I don’t need to worry about the likelihood of punishment for torturing kittens because I think that’s wrong, and I wouldn’t do it anyway.

And people may obey the law because they think that being law-abiding is an important part of maintaining a viable society. But that’s the kind of law-abiding behavior that’s at risk when people at the top treat the law with unconcealed contempt.

Being law-abiding for its own sake is a traditional part of bourgeois culture, and our ruling class has lately treated the bourgeoisie with contempt as well. Which raises the risk that this contempt will be returned.

Back in the midst of the financial crisis, Gonzalo Lira looked at how people were responding to the mortgage meltdown and warned of a coming middle-class anarchy. He wrote:

“A terrible sentence, when a law-abiding citizen speaks it: Everybody else is doing it — so why don’t we? ... What’s really important is that law-abiding middle-class citizens are deciding that playing by the rules is nothing but a sucker’s game.”

America has been — and, for the moment, remains — a high-trust society. In high-trust societies, people extend trust to strangers and follow rules for the most part even when nobody is watching. In low-trust societies, trust seldom extends beyond close family, and everybody cheats if they can get away with it.

High-trust societies are much nicer places to live than low-trust ones. But a fish rots from the head and the head of our society is looking pretty rotten. As Lira says, “I’m like Wayne Gretsky: I don’t concern myself with where the puck has been — I look for where the puck is going to be.” Where will our society be in a decade if these trends continue? And what can we do to ensure that they don’t?

“ Instead of blaming the people who are processing 80 % of the meat right now , why don ’ t we enable their competition to flourish ? ” asks GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky , who introduced the PRIME Act with his Democratic colleague Chellie Pingree of Maine and has attracted 42 co-sponsors , from libertarian Justin Amash to progressive Rashida Tlaib .
The solution is simple , they say : Give states the option of allowing smaller producers , who can ’ t afford USDA inspection , to take their livestock to local butchers and sell the meat directly to local restaurants and supermarkets .
But now , with bottlenecks at USDA-inspected facilities resulting in farmers euthanizing their animals while grocery shelves stand empty , some of today ’ s Republicans are looking for workarounds to the law . They say it favors big producers and has made the system less resilient and flexible in a crisis .
If the U.S. Army hadn ’ t served rotten beef when Teddy Roosevelt fought in the Spanish-American War , perhaps he wouldn ’ t have pressed Congress to pass the 1906 Meat Inspection Act – a law that has made U.S. meat one of the most trusted brands in the world .
When the “ most hated man in Washington ” suddenly gains 20 new co-sponsors for his bill , it must signal a pressing need . And among the countless problems created or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic , perhaps one of the most urgent has been the strain on America ’ s meat supply chain .
With dozens of meat plants temporarily shut down , farmers across the country have had to euthanize tens of thousands of animals , and face the wrenching prospect of far larger culling . Meanwhile , U.S. weekly red meat production has dropped by as much as 34.9 % compared with last year , causing prices to surge and grocery store shelves to lie empty .
The crisis has lately prompted nearly two dozen lawmakers to add their names to legislation put forward by Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky , an MIT-educated Republican who owns 63 cattle and became persona non grata among his colleagues in the early weeks of the pandemic after he forced them all to come back to the nation ’ s capital for a key vote .
Five years ago , he and Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine first introduced the PRIME Act , designed to create more flexibility and resiliency in the meat supply system . The bill would allow smaller meat producers to utilize local butchers and sell their products directly to consumers , restaurants , and grocery stores , rather than getting funneled through USDA-inspected facilities and the handful of corporations that make up 80 % of America ’ s meat market .
“ What you ’ re seeing right now is not the result of an efficient capitalist system , ” says Representative Massie , who faults U.S. regulations for creating a “ monopoly ” of big meat companies . He says removing some of the red tape will enable their competition to flourish , paving the way for shuttered or new local butchers to open and existing ones to expand to meet growing consumer demand for locally raised meat .
The bill , which now has 42 co-sponsors from libertarians to progressives , is one of a growing number of alternative models to industrial meat production that have been gaining traction in recent years , driven by everything from animal welfare and “ eat local ” movements to constitutional concerns about federal overreach . Now , COVID-19 ’ s intense strain on the supply chain is generating wider interest in rethinking the system . Representative Massie admits the bill ’ s chances at passing were slim five years ago , but says they have “ increased exponentially ” this month as consumers learn more about how the food supply pipeline works . “ Because the people are now interested , the congressmen are getting interested , ” he says .
Still , it ’ s unclear how much such initiatives would alleviate the current bottlenecks , with many local butchers already booked into 2021 and freezer space largely maxed out . And while federal inspection is undoubtedly more burdensome for smaller producers and processors , it ’ s just one aspect of a larger equation involving economies of scale . Above all , America has spent years building a sterling reputation for meat safety among its trade partners – and some say it would be shortsighted to undermine in any way the federal oversight on which that trust is founded .
“ Am I in favor of less red tape that would add flexibility to the supply chain ? Yes , ” says Glynn Tonsor , a professor of agricultural economics at Kansas State University in Manhattan , Kansas . He says the PRIME Act would help , but cautions , “ It ’ s not a magic bullet . ”
If the U.S. Army hadn ’ t served rotten beef to Teddy Roosevelt when he was a colonel in the Spanish-American War , perhaps he wouldn ’ t have pressed as hard for Congress to pass the Meat Inspection Act during his presidency .
The rotten beef scandal precipitated a series of hearings on meat safety , federal inspection practices ( or lack thereof ) , and unsanitary conditions in meatpacking plants , further exposed in Upton Sinclair ’ s 1906 novel “ The Jungle . ”
Sinclair , who sought to spark a socialist movement in support of plant workers , instead galvanized public demands for increased government regulation to ensure meat safety . “ I aimed at the public ’ s heart , ” he wrote , “ and by accident I hit it in the stomach . ”
Roosevelt , after sending investigators to the packinghouses to verify Sinclair ’ s depiction , used the ensuing report to push the stalled Meat Inspection Act through Congress in 1906 .
Under that law , all meat sold across state lines must be processed in a USDA-inspected facility , where an inspector is on hand at all times to examine livestock , ensure humane slaughtering practices , and observe the processing of meat . Meat for sale within a state can be processed at a state-inspected facility , provided its standards are at least as stringent as the U.S. Department of Agriculture ’ s . Currently , the only exemption to that inspection regime is for owners of livestock who get meat processed at custom processors for their own consumption , or to share with family , employees , and nonpaying guests .
With a limited number of USDA-inspected facilities , smaller producers often have to drive their livestock hundreds of miles to get their meat processed , adding substantially to the cost and running the risk that their product could be mingled with industrially produced meat .
This spring , Wyoming passed a pioneering law that would allow ranchers to sell meat to their neighbors – while the cattle are still alive . By buying shares in a herd , customers would be considered “ owners ” at the time of slaughter and thus allowed to consume the meat without inspection by the USDA .
“ I don ’ t think [ the USDA is ] this nefarious organization plotting in the deep state or trying to prevent grandmothers from buying T-bone steaks from their next-door neighbors , ” says state Rep. Tyler Lindholm , who spearheaded the bill . But , he adds , citing the 10th Amendment of the Constitution , “ What authority do you have to tell Wyoming citizens that [ they ] can ’ t sell steak to each other ? ”
The PRIME Act , short for Processing Revival and Intrastate Meat Exemption , seeks to go one step further than Wyoming ’ s law by giving states the option of permitting custom-slaughtered meat to be sold not only to individual consumers but also to restaurants , grocery stores , and other outlets within their borders .
Introduced in May 2019 for the third time in four years , the bill has yet to move forward . In a May 14 letter , Representative Pingree urged Speaker Nancy Pelosi to take up the bill in response to the current processing and supply shortages .
“ I am not advocating for relaxing the standards that the USDA has set , ” wrote the Maine congresswoman , an organic farmer who raises vegetables , pigs , and chickens . “ I am simply asking that we address the needs of communities in a way that supports them both economically and morally during this unprecedented time , by allowing America ’ s family farms to do what they do best – feed their neighbors . ”
Still , many in the meat industry caution against such a move .
Colin Woodall , CEO of the National Cattlemen ’ s Beef Association , says the association opposes the PRIME Act because of how it could undermine years of investment in making USDA-inspected meat the “ gold standard ” around the globe . “ If there is a food safety issue that breaks out ... that ’ s not going to be the problem of Johnny ’ s local [ meat ] locker ; that ’ s a beef industry problem , ” he says .
A central aspect of the debate is about who is responsible for ensuring safety . Advocates of less regulation say that greater transparency in packaging , such as where meat was raised and processed , could give consumers the opportunity to make informed decisions about the food they ’ re purchasing , rather than depending solely on the government .
“ Our founders never intended government to be so ingrained in our life that it became ... the preserver of safety , ” says Ben Adams , a Marine running for the Idaho state legislature as a Republican , who has been in touch with state Representative Lindholm about using Wyoming ’ s new law as a model for his state .
Critics of federal regulations also call into question aspects of USDA inspection they see as excessive – such as a requirement that all USDA inspectors be furnished with an office and a bathroom for their exclusive use . Many also see the current rules as arbitrary .
“ Right now , I could step out on my deck and butcher 1,000 chickens on my deck ... and I could sell those directly to consumers without any inspection , labeling , or licensing . But I can ’ t sell one T-bone steak , ” says state Representative Lindholm in Wyoming . “ It ’ s not actually about safety anymore ; it ’ s about protecting a monopoly . ”
Others say only the federal government is in a position to guarantee consistency of standards and comprehensive oversight , both of which are key for trade relationships .
Darci Vetter , who grew up eating uninspected meat on her family farm in Nebraska and served as chief agricultural negotiator for the U.S. trade representative under President Barack Obama , says it ’ s vital not to put exports at risk . As of 2017 , the United States exported nearly 13 % of the beef and 27 % of the pork it produced , with market development activities in more than 80 countries .
“ From a former trade negotiator perspective , what we don ’ t want is for a major destination for U.S. meat to say , ‘ Hey , wait a minute , ... How do I know if the rules are actually being followed ? ’ ” says Ms. Vetter , now the vice chair for food and agriculture at Edelman North America .
The 2003 outbreak of BSE ( popularly referred to as mad cow disease ) in the U.S. prompted nearly all international markets to stop accepting American beef , incurring losses of $ 16 billion over a decade . “ It ’ s 17 years later , and we can still feel the effects from those markets being closed to us . You can understand the hesitation , ” she says .
In addition , the World Trade Organization prohibits member nations from creating preferential markets for domestic products . If local producers are seen as gaining an advantage over foreign exporters of meat to the U.S. , such as being exempted from the cost of USDA inspection , that could run afoul of WTO rules .
Some cattlemen say the system is stacked against them . But Trent Loos , a sixth-generation farmer in Nebraska and radio show host with a wide following out West , says that while deep-pocketed corporations have a greater ability to hire lobbyists , he doesn ’ t buy the idea that American cattlemen are disadvantaged .
“ I just think we ’ re not loud enough . I think we got ta get louder , ” says Mr. Loos , before meeting with a Nebraska state senator interested in Wyoming ’ s model .
Even under the current USDA inspection regime , some local meat markets are finding ways to thrive . Walden Meat , which delivers locally raised meat to customers across New England and New York , has seen a tenfold increase in the rate of new customer sign-ups over the past couple of months .
They co-own and operate a regional slaughterhouse in Vermont , and everything they sell is USDA-inspected , which CEO Charley Cummings says lends their product a certain credibility .
“ We really value the USDA as a partner in that regard , and see them as playing a really important role in establishing universal standards , ” he says . “ We have not found it overly constraining to the viability of a farm-to-consumer business. ” He notes , however , that such a model wouldn ’ t be workable in a less densely populated area like Wyoming .
Mr. Cummings says Walden Meat , which aims to price its products at 10 % to 15 % less than Whole Foods , delivers 55 cents to farmers and butchers per dollar of meat sold , compared with 10 to 11 cents in the commodity world .
“ We ’ re all for everything that delivers more dollars to farmers ’ pockets , ” he says . “ What this crisis has laid bare is that we have prioritized efficiency in meat production above all else – animal welfare , environment , farmers , processors , and employees in every step of that value chain . ”
As customers have increasingly sought local meat , whether out of animal welfare concerns or nutritional considerations , they have found creative ways to work within the USDA law – such as going in with a friend on a pig or a cow before it ’ s slaughtered , and then splitting the meat . Wyoming ’ s state Representative Lindholm has made that somewhat easier with his herd share law , which allows an unlimited number of people to “ own ” the animal .
But Representative Massie says such workarounds are cumbersome . Plus , he says , the USDA exemption is regressive ; not everyone has $ 1,000 or the necessary freezer space . He argues there ’ s an untapped potential for local producers to make a far greater contribution , and bring local meat within the reach of average Americans .

“ You ’ re forcing people that should be able to engage in legitimate commerce to come up with these crazy constructs to do it , ” he says . “ You shouldn ’ t feel like you ’ re exploiting a loophole to sell your neighbor a hamburger . ”","It’s one of several alternative meat models gaining traction, but questions remain about the efficacy, feasibility, safety, and impact on U.S. meat exports.

“Instead of blaming the people who are processing 80% of the meat right now, why don’t we enable their competition to flourish?” asks GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who introduced the PRIME Act with his Democratic colleague Chellie Pingree of Maine and has attracted 42 co-sponsors, from libertarian Justin Amash to progressive Rashida Tlaib.

The solution is simple, they say: Give states the option of allowing smaller producers, who can’t afford USDA inspection, to take their livestock to local butchers and sell the meat directly to local restaurants and supermarkets.

But now, with bottlenecks at USDA-inspected facilities resulting in farmers euthanizing their animals while grocery shelves stand empty, some of today’s Republicans are looking for workarounds to the law. They say it favors big producers and has made the system less resilient and flexible in a crisis.

If the U.S. Army hadn’t served rotten beef when Teddy Roosevelt fought in the Spanish-American War, perhaps he wouldn’t have pressed Congress to pass the 1906 Meat Inspection Act – a law that has made U.S. meat one of the most trusted brands in the world.

Teddy Roosevelt’s run-in with rotten beef

If the U.S. Army hadn’t served rotten beef to Teddy Roosevelt when he was a colonel in the Spanish-American War, perhaps he wouldn’t have pressed as hard for Congress to pass the Meat Inspection Act during his presidency.

The rotten beef scandal precipitated a series of hearings on meat safety, federal inspection practices (or lack thereof), and unsanitary conditions in meatpacking plants, further exposed in Upton Sinclair’s 1906 novel “The Jungle.”

Sinclair, who sought to spark a socialist movement in support of plant workers, instead galvanized public demands for increased government regulation to ensure meat safety. “I aimed at the public’s heart,” he wrote, “and by accident I hit it in the stomach.”

Carusone and Media Matters , which openly pine for the destruction of Fox News , have justified the left-wing boycott campaign by pointing to a number of statements that Carlson made on a radio shock jock show between 2006 and 2011 .
But Carusone has his own track record of inflammatory statements . Carusone ’ s now-defunct blog included degrading references to “ trannies , ” “ jewry ” and Bangladeshis , records maintained by the Internet Archive ’ s Wayback Machine show . ( RELATED : Media Matters Gave MSNBC Host Joy Reid A Pass )
Carusone posted a lengthy diatribe in November 2005 about a Bangladeshi man who was robbed by “ a gang of transvestites , ” as Carusone described it . Carusone was offended that the gang was described as “ attractive ” in an article .
“ Did you notice the word attractive ? What the fuck is that doing in there ? Is the write [ r ] a tranny lover too ? Or , perhaps he ’ s trying to justify how these trannies tricked this Bangladeshi in the first place ? Look man , we don ’ t need to know whether or not they were attractive . The fucking guy was Bangladeshi , ” Carusone wrote . “ And while we ’ re out , what the hell was he doing with $ 7,300 worth of stuff . The guy ’ s Banladeshi ! [ sic ] ”
Carusone also chided police for not advising the public to “ stay away from tranny bars , stay away from places [ sic ] where Eddie Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. have/are visiting , don ’ t fucking kiss a transvestite , don ’ t bring a group of transvestites back to your room , etc… ”
The future Media Matters president titled his post , “ Tranny Paradise . ”

Carusone and Media Matters, which openly pine for the destruction of Fox News, have justified the left-wing boycott campaign by pointing to a number of statements that Carlson made on a radio shock jock show between 2006 and 2011.

But Carusone has his own track record of inflammatory statements. Carusone’s now-defunct blog included degrading references to “trannies,” “jewry” and Bangladeshis, records maintained by the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine show. (RELATED: Media Matters Gave MSNBC Host Joy Reid A Pass)

Carusone posted a lengthy diatribe in November 2005 about a Bangladeshi man who was robbed by “a gang of transvestites,” as Carusone described it. Carusone was offended that the gang was described as “attractive” in an article.

“Did you notice the word attractive? What the fuck is that doing in there? Is the write[r] a tranny lover too? Or, perhaps he’s trying to justify how these trannies tricked this Bangladeshi in the first place? Look man, we don’t need to know whether or not they were attractive. The fucking guy was Bangladeshi,” Carusone wrote. “And while we’re out, what the hell was he doing with $7,300 worth of stuff. The guy’s Banladeshi! [sic]”

Carusone also chided police for not advising the public to “stay away from tranny bars, stay away from places [sic] where Eddie Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. have/are visiting, don’t fucking kiss a transvestite, don’t bring a group of transvestites back to your room, etc…”

The future Media Matters president titled his post, “Tranny Paradise.”

In another post that same month, Carusone downplayed a male basketball coach’s alleged sexual and physical abuse of his female players, adding, “lighten up Japs,” using what is considered an ethnic slur.

In another November 2005 blog post, Carusone praised former Democratic West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd, a former grandmaster of the Klu Klux Klan, as one of his ten favorite public figures. “In his lunacy, we trust,” Carusone wrote of Byrd.

Carusone made anti-Semitic comments on his blog as well.

He wrote in one October 2005 post that “despite his jewry, you KNOW he’s adorable,” referring to his boyfriend.

In another post, Carusone claimed that his boyfriend only leaned conservative “as a result of his possession of several bags of Jewish gold.”

Carusone did not return an inquiry from TheDCNF asking whether he sees any contradiction between his boycott campaigns and his own past comments.

Carusone previously dismissed concerns about his past anti-Semitic comments on the grounds that his longtime partner is Jewish.

Prominent conservatives have rallied behind Carlson.

Ben Shapiro derided Media Matters as “a political smear factory designed to perform precisely that function against anyone to the right of Hillary Clinton.”

“Our nation cannot maintain its culture of free speech if we continue to reward those who seek to destroy careers rather than rebut ideas,” National Review’s David French wrote in a column on Monday.

“And when you reward a Media Matters search-and-destroy fishing expedition with calls for boycotts or reprisals, then you are doing your part to destroy debate. It’s vengeful. It’s cowardly. And it’s exactly the online world that spiteful partisans want to build,” French added.

Robinson, Cate Root","If you wanted to pinpoint an exact date when the United States became destined to be a global superpower—a nation rich beyond its wildest dreams , able to enforce its will around the world—you could do worse than February 2 , 1848 . With a few quick pen-strokes on the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , the Mexican-American War ended , and the landmass of the United States grew by 25 percent . Importantly , that 25 percent included the territory that had , up to that point , been known as Alta California .
The central valley of California has fairly unique geography . It ’ s been subject to millennia of flooding , leaving hundreds of thousands of acres of top grade soil . It ’ s also extremely sunny—nearly 300 days of sunshine a year—but compensates for the lack of rain with snowmelt from the uniquely tall and snowy Sierra Nevada mountains . The combination of these factors—along with huge aquifers of groundwater , more than one deep water port , some navigable rivers , abundant fish and fur stocks , hundreds of miles of desirable oceanfront property , and some gold to boot—all but guaranteed significant wealth for whatever industrializing nation included California .
This potential , though not yet realized , was an open secret in the 1840s . The United States attempted to buy New Mexico and California from Mexico in 1842 , but Mexico refused . Undeterred , the United States invaded Mexico on the flimsiest of pretenses and , on February 2 , 1848 , took more than half of Mexico ’ s land mass essentially at gunpoint .
Thus was born the U.S. ’ s southern border . ( Well , sort of . The Treaty of Mesilla , aka the Gadsden Purchase , added southwest New Mexico and southern Arizona , including Tucson , in 1854 , at a price of around $ 12 an acre in 2018 dollars . ) And thus was the land area formerly known as Alta California transferred from Mexico to the United States . In that instant , approximately 80,000 people went from living in Mexico to living in the United States without moving a muscle . Alta California was destined to be the fifth largest economy in the world , with a GDP more than three times Mexico ’ s national GDP . Through this successful conquest , the United States was propelled on its path to unprecedented national wealth , and future generations of Mexicans were consigned to the now-pitiable position of being , in the ( attributed ) words of Porfirio Diaz , “ so far from God , so close to the United States . ”
At first , when this particular portion of the U.S.-Mexico border was drawn , it was—like all borders in the United States , and most in the world—radically open . People came and went as they pleased . The line determined jurisdiction for various important political and civil questions , like legal regimes and taxes , but it wasn ’ t a physical barrier . People could ( and did ) stroll across the border at will to grocery shop , visit friends and relatives , work , sell goods—you name it . There were important differences between living in Juarez and El Paso , and different rights and duties imposed on people living within a few hundred feet of each other , but there was no physical wall between them .
What ultimately ended up setting the United States down the path toward a militarized border—maintained via a gigantic bureaucracy willing to inflict violence on anyone with the gall to attempt a crossing—was old-fashioned American racism . In 1875 , the United States enacted its first set of restrictive immigration laws aimed at preventing Chinese people from entering . This particular brand of racism , as is often the case , went hand-in-hand with exploitation . The railroad industry was happy to use Chinese immigrants as cheap labor but the United States couldn ’ t tolerate the Chinese community building any wealth or power , and therefore barred Chinese people from entering the country . The federal government detained and then left Chinese immigrants to languish , sometimes for years , on Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay even when they had previously gotten permission to enter . This was the beginning of the end for our de facto national policy of open borders .
Exploitation of other nations and people , both foreign and domestic , was far from new in U.S. history ( see slavery , Native genocide , etc. ) . But it ’ s interesting that immigration restrictions rose simultaneously with the U.S. ’ s foreign imperialist activities . Over the following decades , immigration quotas were established as U.S. corporations gobbled up land in Central and South America and meddled in the Mexican Revolution . Unauthorized immigration was criminalized just as the United States threatened to invade Colombia on behalf of the United Fruit Company . Anti-Latin American sentiment soared as the United States toppled democratically elected governments in Guatemala and Chile out of fear that they would nationalize industries profitable for American companies . Ronald Reagan railed against immigrants and asylees as he funded the death squads who murdered their families to protect U.S. business interests . The 20th century was an incredibly prosperous time for the United States—that prosperity largely built the wealth that the nation enjoys today—but a substantial portion of this wealth was built on the backs and corpses of people in other countries , particularly ( although far from exclusively ) in Central and South America .
It ’ s worth keeping this historical context in mind when we turn to Open Borders : The Science and Ethics of Immigration , an illustrated book published by libertarian economist Bryan Caplan and cartoonist Zach Weinersmith . The book portrays itself as comprehensive : it purports to cover all moral and philosophical arguments in favor of open borders , and to neutralize all potential opposing arguments . In practice , the book focuses largely on one “ fairness ” argument—that restrictive borders are discriminatory and arbitrary—and one “ outcomes ” argument—that restrictive borders stifle ( economic ) growth . A cartoon version of Caplan walks the reader , panel by panel , through his arguments and their support .
The first thing to say about the book is that it ’ s mostly lovely . Caplan is an engaging and persuasive writer—in his other works , he can be charming even when advocating for terrible things ( like massively defunding public education ) . Here , he ’ s advocating for open borders , a morally unimpeachable policy . Weinersmith ’ s illustrations are delightful , and the tone of the text nicely matches that of the illustrations . The second thing to say about the book is that we mostly agree with it . That is , we believe restrictive borders constitute a grave injustice , and that the world would be a better place if people were free to cross between Mexico and the United States just as they ’ re free to cross between Colorado and Nebraska .
But despite the book ’ s clear writing , fun drawings , and correct ( in our view ) conclusion , it must be treated with some caution , as with the rest of Caplan ’ s work . Bryan Caplan is a committed and staunch libertarian economist . He seems to be an earnest libertarian economist , in that he appears to have some intellectual integrity and is willing to follow his arguments to their logical conclusions , even when those are at odds with the status quo and the consensus in his profession . But we must be careful to agree with him only where his underlying reasoning , assumptions , and principles are defensible , and not only because we reach the same conclusion .
This is particularly important when it comes to open borders . There are strains of left and socialist thinking , both historical and current , that are very hostile to open borders . The ( purportedly ) left arguments against open borders run from protectionist ( immigrants harm the interests of domestic labor ) to supposedly benevolent but extremely misguided ( like Angela Nagle ’ s infamous 2018 article , “ The Left Case Against Open Borders , ” which makes the unconvincing argument that it is better for would-be immigrants to be kept in their home countries by force so that they can organize their way out of oppression . ) Unconvincing as most of these arguments are , they have a kernel that should be taken seriously . Some big businesses do want open borders . Libertarian economists want open borders . Given these unsavory bedfellows , are we sure that we , as leftists , want open borders ? Should Bryan Caplan ’ s support for our position give us pause ?
Caplan ’ s case for open borders largely rests on two underlying premises : first , that closed borders are unethical , and second , that capitalism is good and open borders will only make it work more effectively . ( “ Socialism ” is definitely one of the major bogeymen of his book : each mention of the dread word is accompanied by a cartoon panel of goose-stepping Reds . ) Caplan ’ s case for the moral wrongness of borders is compelling , and strongly-stated . The first chapter of his book is called “ Global Apartheid , ” and the opening image shows the outline of a looming black wall topped with barbed wire . “ Immigration laws tell peaceful people where they ’ re allowed to live and work , ” a cartoon version of the Statue of Liberty informs us . “ Immigration laws don ’ t merely allow discrimination . They require it . It ’ s wrong to tell people where they can live or work because they ’ re black , or women , or Jews . Why isn ’ t it equally wrong to tell people where they can live or work because they were born in Mexico , or Haiti , or India ? ”
This line of argument is the biggest strength of Caplan ’ s book . He appears to sincerely believe that free migration is an essential human freedom , and correctly characterizes immigration laws , of their very nature , as fundamentally oppressive . In this sense , Caplan is a much clearer moral thinker than , say , the all-too-common kind of liberal who likes the feel-goodery of belonging to a “ nation of immigrants , ” but balks at the idea of large numbers of poor immigrants moving into their neighborhood ; who tells themselves that immigrants are necessarily “ better off ” in their home countries than working in the United States , and believes that a “ secure ” border is a necessary condition to any discussion of further immigration reform .
But there ’ s something that feels wrong , or at any rate incomplete , about the context in which Caplan enfolds these important truths . The rest of his argument about the moral necessity of open borders boils down , essentially , to the following : some parts of the world are rich , and their residents enjoy many luxuries . Others are desperately poor , and their residents struggle to survive . If poor people could move to rich countries and get jobs there , they could vastly improve their outcomes . Thus , why should governments have the right to prevent people from physically moving from these impoverished hellholes and coming to countries where they can reap the ample benefits of living in more “ developed ” societies ? Caplan anticipates—probably correctly—that his readers ’ biggest objections will center around possible downsides that this immigration will bring to the receiving countries , and so the bulk of the book centers around showing that there will be limited negative impacts—and , in fact , substantial net gains—for native-born populations in a world where immigration is increased . ( Economic data does seem to bear this out , although it ’ s hard to feel extremely confident about what these studies tell us , given the inherent difficulty of disentangling when an economic outcome is “ caused , ” or caused primarily , by “ immigration , ” or the extent to which the net economic benefits of immigration are premised on the fact that many immigrant workers have even less bargaining power than citizen workers . ) Caplan tries to show that closed borders , in addition to trapping poor people in countries where they can ’ t hope to improve their standard of living , also “ trap [ s ] talent at the outskirts of the world economy ” and thus “ impoverishes us all . ”
What Caplan doesn ’ t explore in very much detail is why certain parts of the world are rich and others are poor . Caplan puts forward an image of the United States as a magnet for immigration because the United States is simply a good country to live in . He doesn ’ t dwell on the fact that one very substantial reason rich countries like the United States have so much abundance is precisely because they exploit the resources of poorer countries , or that the conditions of poverty and violent insecurity that drive many immigrants to move to more prosperous countries are directly influenced by rich countries ’ economic and foreign policy decisions—to say nothing of the much longer history of imperial conquest and political meddling pursued by the United States and other powerful nations . This , by itself , doesn ’ t alter the validity of Caplan ’ s argument that restricting the free movement of people is immoral . But Caplan situates an immigrant ’ s decision to move in a kind of historical vacuum of rational cost-benefit analysis . For a libertarian , the logic of the free market dictates that people should be allowed to move where they can get work , because it ’ s only “ fair. ” But for a leftist , unfairness is inherent not only the immigration restrictions that prevent people from moving who wish to move , but in the unequal global hierarchy that forces people to leave their countries who otherwise would not wish to . At various points in the book , Caplan also declares himself to be a “ fanboy of Western culture ” ( which apparently boils down to favoring “ reason ” and “ enlightenment ” ) and does some slightly creepy IQ comparisons across various countries , suggesting that worldwide IQ will rise if people are able to migrate to better-resourced areas—avoiding any serious analysis of power by vaguely implying that there ’ s a cultural explanation for the “ West ’ s ” economic success .
Even if we agree with Caplan that open borders are a moral imperative , how should we think about his second premise—that opening up borders will bolster the existing capitalist world order , which is presumed by Caplan to be a good thing ? Perhaps , if we feel strongly enough that immigration restrictions are immoral and should be abolished , we should be willing to countenance the “ open borders is compatible with global capitalism ” argument as a means of bringing some of our political opponents around to our side . ( Admittedly , most of our political opponents aren ’ t ideologically rigorous libertarians , but are ordinary oligarchs with a vague Ayn Rand gloss—so it ’ s hard to say how far they ’ d be persuaded by these arguments anyhow . ) But adopting some of Caplan ’ s assumptions feels icky , and possibly dangerous . Caplan views immigration , in an economic sense , as “ economic trade in labor , ” which he thinks should be free in the same way that he thinks trade in goods should be free , and writes that “ progress always hurts someone , but the secret to mass consumption is mass production. ” To illustrate the economic boons of immigration , cartoonist Zach Weinersmith has drawn giant globes made of cash that will presumably be generated by immigrants multiplying their wages through relocation . Even if you think Caplan is right about these things , it feels like typical capitalist magical thinking that treats laborers as statistics and infinite growth as an inherent good , without exploring its long-term environmental viability or actual quality-of-life improvements for ordinary people . Also , accepting the premise that “ progress always hurts someone ” feels like a license to play utilitarian games with ( other ) human beings ’ lives .
Certainly , insofar as available economic evidence suggests that immigration hasn ’ t had the catastrophic effects on wages that many anti-immigration propagandists want you to believe , the potential economic benefits of immigration aren ’ t something we necessarily want to deemphasize . But at the same time , if you think that the global economy is deeply unfair , we don ’ t want to become too enthusiastic about arguing that opening up borders is the mystical solution that , without more action , will somehow cause the global economy to become fair . Rather , many leftists have envisioned open borders as something that—even if it won ’ t be the singular cause of the dismantlement of unjust economic systems—can increase worker power by allowing greater solidarity and organizing across national lines . Caplan , by contrast , wants to assuage public fears that increased immigration is likely to result in any significant political changes . He extensively cites studies that show that immigrants assimilate quickly , vote at slightly lower rates than the general population , and possess political views that are pretty close to the median ( albeit slightly more “ fiscally liberal ” and “ socially conservative ” than average . ) But those studies , to the extent we think they ’ re reliable , are based upon the present-day pool of immigrants , which is much more limited than what ’ s envisioned under an open borders regime . It ’ s hard to say if this is a good predictor of how a much larger influx of immigrants would affect U.S. politics , for example—and ideally , we on the left would want an influx of working-class immigrants to affect U.S. politics , with workers from different parts of the world joining unions and bringing their own political and organizing traditions to bear on U.S. debates .
It ’ s also worth mentioning that although Caplan writes predominantly from a libertarian perspective , he pitches open borders as something that pretty much anyone of any ideological persuasion can find moral and practical reasons to support . His goal is to shift the baseline assumption “ immigration must be restricted except under X conditions ” to “ immigration should be open , and any exceptions should be tailored to the specific immigration-related problems a country believes would need to be prevented. ” Caplan calls these restrictions to assuage public anxiety “ keyhole solutions ” : his idea being that any increase in immigration is good , so we should be willing to countenance ( at least in the short term ) new or ongoing immigration restrictions of various kinds , provided we can gradually increase the number of total people who are allowed to immigrate . Some examples of keyhole solutions he proposes are a ) taxing immigrants ’ income to offset any negative economic impact on native citizen workers , b ) restricting immigrants ’ eligibility for all but emergency government services , c ) requiring English fluency or cultural literacy tests , and d ) raising proportional levels of immigration from non-Muslim countries ( i.e . calming Islamophobes ’ anxieties about the prospect of a North American caliphate by simply admitting more non-Muslim than Muslim immigrants , so that Muslims perpetually remain a minority group . )
Caplan concedes that he doesn ’ t think these keyhole solutions are “ fair , ” but emphasizes that as long as more people are able to immigrate , the result will still be an improvement on the status quo . There ’ s a sense in which this is perhaps true—but it ’ s also rather naïve to believe that these keyhole solutions are a natural stepping-stone to eventual open borders . There ’ s an equally good chance that these kinds of concessions will just result in the continuing entrenchment of immigrants ’ second-class status : by explicitly legislating their position as go-to economic scapegoats for capitalism ’ s ravages on the vulnerable , by encouraging restrictions that are tailored to favor more “ productive ” and educated immigrants over the kinds of immigrants Caplan thinks most desperately need to immigrate , by feeding the notion that certain “ cultures ” are inherently superior to others and that some “ dangerous ” cultures need to be artificially restricted , regulated , and monitored . A case for open borders that touts these kinds of keyhole solutions as incremental progress toward the eventual goal , rather than as compromises that could derail the movement entirely by authorizing lawmakers to develop even more intricately discriminatory policies than before , doesn ’ t feel quite adequate .
One thing that rich , successful people love to tell themselves is that they are rich because of their intelligence , their discipline , and their good habits . It ’ s a comfortable , self-reinforcing myth . Wealth proves virtue , and everyone else ’ s lack of wealth proves their lack of virtue . It ’ s much more comfortable than confronting the fact that vast wealth is accumulated , under the best of circumstances , via blind luck and more commonly by outright theft . The history of the United States and Mexico shows this clearly : the trajectories of our nations ’ respective fortunes depended so heavily upon a contingent moment in history , where one nation took a rich territory that had previously belonged to another—a contingency that was then reinforced by many dozens , even hundreds , of additional contingencies , leading the United States to gradually view the hardening of the southern border as politically advantageous . A case for open borders that fails to reckon with past and present exploitation is necessarily going to feel like something between a Pollyanna pipe-dream and a smokescreen for further violent depredations . That ’ s not to say that Caplan ’ s arguments have no merit , or that there ’ s no common ground to be found between leftist and libertarian advocates for open borders . But—in the same way that Caplan ’ s comic book occasionally throws out a cautionary vision of a closed-borders world of tightly-sealed , totalitarian socialist states—leftist open borders advocates have a mirror nightmare vision , of a world homogenized and subjugated to the whims of the global rich , where people are free to move where they will but their autonomy in each new place only increases by negligible fractions . If we believe that most countries in the world mistreat the poor , then allowing the poor to move from country to country only gets us so far . Open borders are not the solution to global injustice : they are simply a rectification of one injustice among many , creating the opportunity for a more fully international community to tackle other injustices wholesale .","If you wanted to pinpoint an exact date when the United States became destined to be a global superpower—a nation rich beyond its wildest dreams, able to enforce its will around the world—you could do worse than February 2, 1848.

Thus, why should governments have the right to prevent people from physically moving from these impoverished hellholes and coming to countries where they can reap the ample benefits of living in more “developed” societies? Caplan anticipates—probably correctly—that his readers’ biggest objections will center around possible downsides that this immigration will bring to the receiving countries, and so the bulk of the book centers around showing that there will be limited negative impacts—and, in fact, substantial net gains—for native-born populations in a world where immigration is increased. (Economic data does seem to bear this out, although it’s hard to feel extremely confident about what these studies tell us, given the inherent difficulty of disentangling when an economic outcome is “caused,” or caused primarily, by “immigration,” or the extent to which the net economic benefits of immigration are premised on the fact that many immigrant workers have even less bargaining power than citizen workers.) Caplan tries to show that closed borders, in addition to trapping poor people in countries where they can’t hope to improve their standard of living, also “trap[s] talent at the outskirts of the world economy” and thus “impoverishes us all.”

What Caplan doesn’t explore in very much detail is why certain parts of the world are rich and others are poor. Caplan puts forward an image of the United States as a magnet for immigration because the United States is simply a good country to live in. He doesn’t dwell on the fact that one very substantial reason rich countries like the United States have so much abundance is precisely because they exploit the resources of poorer countries, or that the conditions of poverty and violent insecurity that drive many immigrants to move to more prosperous countries are directly influenced by rich countries’ economic and foreign policy decisions—to say nothing of the much longer history of imperial conquest and political meddling pursued by the United States and other powerful nations. This, by itself, doesn’t alter the validity of Caplan’s argument that restricting the free movement of people is immoral. But Caplan situates an immigrant’s decision to move in a kind of historical vacuum of rational cost-benefit analysis. For a libertarian, the logic of the free market dictates that people should be allowed to move where they can get work, because it’s only “fair.” But for a leftist, unfairness is inherent not only the immigration restrictions that prevent people from moving who wish to move, but in the unequal global hierarchy that forces people to leave their countries who otherwise would not wish to. At various points in the book, Caplan also declares himself to be a “fanboy of Western culture” (which apparently boils down to favoring “reason” and “enlightenment”) and does some slightly creepy IQ comparisons across various countries, suggesting that worldwide IQ will rise if people are able to migrate to better-resourced areas—avoiding any serious analysis of power by vaguely implying that there’s a cultural explanation for the “West’s” economic success.

Even if we agree with Caplan that open borders are a moral imperative, how should we think about his second premise—that opening up borders will bolster the existing capitalist world order, which is presumed by Caplan to be a good thing? Perhaps, if we feel strongly enough that immigration restrictions are immoral and should be abolished, we should be willing to countenance the “open borders is compatible with global capitalism” argument as a means of bringing some of our political opponents around to our side. (Admittedly, most of our political opponents aren’t ideologically rigorous libertarians, but are ordinary oligarchs with a vague Ayn Rand gloss—so it’s hard to say how far they’d be persuaded by these arguments anyhow.) But adopting some of Caplan’s assumptions feels icky, and possibly dangerous. Caplan views immigration, in an economic sense, as “economic trade in labor,” which he thinks should be free in the same way that he thinks trade in goods should be free, and writes that “progress always hurts someone, but the secret to mass consumption is mass production.” To illustrate the economic boons of immigration, cartoonist Zach Weinersmith has drawn giant globes made of cash that will presumably be generated by immigrants multiplying their wages through relocation. Even if you think Caplan is right about these things, it feels like typical capitalist magical thinking that treats laborers as statistics and infinite growth as an inherent good, without exploring its long-term environmental viability or actual quality-of-life improvements for ordinary people. Also, accepting the premise that “progress always hurts someone” feels like a license to play utilitarian games with (other) human beings’ lives.

Certainly, insofar as available economic evidence suggests that immigration hasn’t had the catastrophic effects on wages that many anti-immigration propagandists want you to believe, the potential economic benefits of immigration aren’t something we necessarily want to deemphasize. But at the same time, if you think that the global economy is deeply unfair, we don’t want to become too enthusiastic about arguing that opening up borders is the mystical solution that, without more action, will somehow cause the global economy to become fair. Rather, many leftists have envisioned open borders as something that—even if it won’t be the singular cause of the dismantlement of unjust economic systems—can increase worker power by allowing greater solidarity and organizing across national lines. Caplan, by contrast, wants to assuage public fears that increased immigration is likely to result in any significant political changes. He extensively cites studies that show that immigrants assimilate quickly, vote at slightly lower rates than the general population, and possess political views that are pretty close to the median (albeit slightly more “fiscally liberal” and “socially conservative” than average.) But those studies, to the extent we think they’re reliable, are based upon the present-day pool of immigrants, which is much more limited than what’s envisioned under an open borders regime. It’s hard to say if this is a good predictor of how a much larger influx of immigrants would affect U.S. politics, for example—and ideally, we on the left would want an influx of working-class immigrants to affect U.S. politics, with workers from different parts of the world joining unions and bringing their own political and organizing traditions to bear on U.S. debates.

It’s also worth mentioning that although Caplan writes predominantly from a libertarian perspective, he pitches open borders as something that pretty much anyone of any ideological persuasion can find moral and practical reasons to support. His goal is to shift the baseline assumption “immigration must be restricted except under X conditions” to “immigration should be open, and any exceptions should be tailored to the specific immigration-related problems a country believes would need to be prevented.” Caplan calls these restrictions to assuage public anxiety “keyhole solutions”: his idea being that any increase in immigration is good, so we should be willing to countenance (at least in the short term) new or ongoing immigration restrictions of various kinds, provided we can gradually increase the number of total people who are allowed to immigrate. Some examples of keyhole solutions he proposes are a) taxing immigrants’ income to offset any negative economic impact on native citizen workers, b) restricting immigrants’ eligibility for all but emergency government services, c) requiring English fluency or cultural literacy tests, and d) raising proportional levels of immigration from non-Muslim countries (i.e. calming Islamophobes’ anxieties about the prospect of a North American caliphate by simply admitting more non-Muslim than Muslim immigrants, so that Muslims perpetually remain a minority group.)

Caplan concedes that he doesn’t think these keyhole solutions are “fair,” but emphasizes that as long as more people are able to immigrate, the result will still be an improvement on the status quo. There’s a sense in which this is perhaps true—but it’s also rather naïve to believe that these keyhole solutions are a natural stepping-stone to eventual open borders. There’s an equally good chance that these kinds of concessions will just result in the continuing entrenchment of immigrants’ second-class status: by explicitly legislating their position as go-to economic scapegoats for capitalism’s ravages on the vulnerable, by encouraging restrictions that are tailored to favor more “productive” and educated immigrants over the kinds of immigrants Caplan thinks most desperately need to immigrate, by feeding the notion that certain “cultures” are inherently superior to others and that some “dangerous” cultures need to be artificially restricted, regulated, and monitored. A case for open borders that touts these kinds of keyhole solutions as incremental progress toward the eventual goal, rather than as compromises that could derail the movement entirely by authorizing lawmakers to develop even more intricately discriminatory policies than before, doesn’t feel quite adequate.

One thing that rich, successful people love to tell themselves is that they are rich because of their intelligence, their discipline, and their good habits. It’s a comfortable, self-reinforcing myth. Wealth proves virtue, and everyone else’s lack of wealth proves their lack of virtue. It’s much more comfortable than confronting the fact that vast wealth is accumulated, under the best of circumstances, via blind luck and more commonly by outright theft. The history of the United States and Mexico shows this clearly: the trajectories of our nations’ respective fortunes depended so heavily upon a contingent moment in history, where one nation took a rich territory that had previously belonged to another—a contingency that was then reinforced by many dozens, even hundreds, of additional contingencies, leading the United States to gradually view the hardening of the southern border as politically advantageous. A case for open borders that fails to reckon with past and present exploitation is necessarily going to feel like something between a Pollyanna pipe-dream and a smokescreen for further violent depredations. That’s not to say that Caplan’s arguments have no merit, or that there’s no common ground to be found between leftist and libertarian advocates for open borders. But—in the same way that Caplan’s comic book occasionally throws out a cautionary vision of a closed-borders world of tightly-sealed, totalitarian socialist states—leftist open borders advocates have a mirror nightmare vision, of a world homogenized and subjugated to the whims of the global rich, where people are free to move where they will but their autonomy in each new place only increases by negligible fractions. If we believe that most countries in the world mistreat the poor, then allowing the poor to move from country to country only gets us so far. Open borders are not the solution to global injustice: they are simply a rectification of one injustice among many, creating the opportunity for a more fully international community to tackle other injustices wholesale.",www.currentaffairs.org,left,6iZ2QMBcAdxrVANu

According to US News, 80 percent of New Year’s resolutions don’t live to see the light of day by the second week of February. With just eight percent of resolution-makers actually following through, it’s clear that the odds are not in your favor if you choose to join the fad.

Year after year, however, people insist on encouraging them.

Companies in the fitness and diet industries offer special packages to those determined to lose weight, while regulators urge cigarette smokers to turn their back to nicotine as the new year rolls in. Despite their efforts, the results mostly fail to meet expectations, and resolution-makers who fail feel demoralized in the end.

“Is there anyone who actually lives up to their own New Year’s resolution expectations?” the discouraged resolution-maker may ask himself, only to realize that whatever the answer is, it doesn’t matter.

Realistically speaking, setting monthly goals makes more sense, not just because short-term goals are more easily attainable but also because as you set yourself to accomplish smaller tasks, you also build up your self-esteem, raising the bar as you move forward.

If you’re still not convinced, here’s the definitive list of reasons why you should ditch the never-ending New Year’s resolution fad for good.

Resolutions Are for Show, Yet Nobody Cares

Literally nobody—yet we’re told that resolutions are important and that pushing ourselves to reach unrealistic goals will boost our morale.

Just ask your family and closest friends if they remember your last New Year’s resolutions and if they have any idea whether you accomplished them or not. Better yet, ask yourself if you remember any of your close friends’ resolutions. Did they live up to them? Did you ever bother to ask?

Resolutions Are (Almost) Always Unattainable

According to an Inc. report, 71 percent of Americans resolved to eat healthier in 2019. Following closely behind were exercising more and losing weight, saving money, learning a new skill, quitting smoking, and reading more.

While some of these goals are attainable in theory, the fact that we set a goal for an entire year without checking our progress regularly makes a mockery of our hopes.

By definition, a goal entails work, but when you set a goal that must be met sometime next year, you’re telling yourself that that goal isn’t truly worth the effort. When you focus on the prize monthly, on the other hand, you put up barriers you must crush before setting your focus on the next step.

In other words, resolutions are unattainable because they give your brain too many incentives to quit before you even start.

Resolutions Don’t Prompt Us to Attain Necessary Skills

Many of us are guilty of resolving to “save more money.” Regardless of where we are professionally, “saving more” means little when we tell ourselves that “next year, I’ll save more,” all the while paying bills and failing to pay attention to our finances. That’s why it’s so important to think of money pragmatically, and that means coming to terms with the fact that you might not be making much more than what you already make when the coming year ends. So how do you go about saving more?

Set up a budget.

Know how much money you make and write that down. Assess how much you require to cover your monthly bills and any other regular payments you make.

Aside from important bills like a mortgage, student loans, water, electricity, gas, internet, etc., check whether you have any subscriptions you don’t use as much as you would like.

Are you too ambitious holding both a Hulu and a Netflix account? Do you really need Amazon Prime just for a couple of purchases every few months? How about YouTubeTV? Do you really need to ditch the ads to watch a 15-minute video?

Once you figure out what you can and cannot live without, slash subscriptions that aren’t necessary.

Do the same with things like gym memberships, trips to the coffee shop, or even how often you hire a cleaning crew for your one-bedroom apartment, and write all that down. Is it realistic to slash some of those expenses or are you going to live miserably if you do so?

Once you look at how much you bring in and how much you spend regularly and set a goal to keep your expenses contained, you will never have to make a money-related New Year’s resolution again.

Resolutions Don’t Improve Accountability

When switching from a New Year’s resolution to a month-to-month goal schedule, the key to being successful is accountability—and nothing helps us acquire better eating habits than increasing accountability.

Before going on some crazy diet because you read about it online and decided that in 2020 you will wear the bikini you always dreamed of is not just irresponsible, but it’s also (nearly) impossible. Instead, go to a nutritionist and discuss your habits. Find out what kind of diet would work better with your lifestyle and start off by setting a modest weight loss goal.

Become more involved with the food you eat by cooking at home more often, and keep the bar somewhat low in the first couple of months. Once you’ve gotten better at keeping up with your new habits, set a higher standard for the following months, and watch as changes take shape right before your eyes.

Whatever you do, do not embrace the elusive New Year’s resolution just because that’s what everyone does. Be realistic, and remember: you are your own worst critic—but you should also give yourself time and room for improvement without losing track of your schedule.

Mccarthy, Tobias Hoonhout, Bill Corsair, Jason Richwine","Damage to a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee at Duke University ’ s Duke Chapel in Durham , N.C. , in 2017 . ( Jonathan Drake/Reuters )
Destroying history will not make you feel good about the present .
The 21st century is in danger of becoming an era of statue smashing and historical erasure . Not since the iconoclasts of the Byzantine Empire or the epidemic of statue destruction during the French Revolution has the world seen anything like the current war on the past .
In 2001 , the primeval Taliban blew up two ancient Buddha statues in Afghanistan on grounds that their very existence was sacrilegious to Islam .
In 2015 , ISIS militants entered a museum in Mosul , Iraq , and destroyed ancient , pre-Islamic statues and idols . Their mute crime ? These artifacts predated the prophet Mohammed .
The West prides itself on the idea that liberal societies would never descend into such nihilism . Think again .
In the last two years there has been a rash of statue toppling throughout the American South , aimed at wiping out memorialization of Confederate heroes . The pretense is that the Civil War can only be regarded as tragic in terms of the present oppression of the descendants of Southern slaves — 154 years after the extinction of the Confederate states .
There is also a renewed crusade to erase the memory of Italian explorer Christopher Columbus . Los Angeles removed a Columbus statue in November based on the premise that his 1492 discovery of the Americas began a disastrous genocide in the Western Hemisphere .
Last month , the Northern California town of Arcata did away with a statue of former president William McKinley because he supposedly pushed policies detrimental to Native Americans .
There have been some unfortunate lessons from such vendettas against the images and names of the past .
One , such attacks usually revealed a lack of confidence . The general insecurity of the present could supposedly be remedied by destroying mute statutes or the legacies of the dead , who could offer no rebuttal .
The subtext of most current name changing and icon toppling is that particular victimized groups blame their current plight on the past . They assume that by destroying long-dead supposed enemies , they will be liberated — or at least feel better in the present .
Yet knocking down images of Columbus will not change the fact that millions of indigenous people in Central America and Mexico are currently abandoning their ancestral homelands and emigrating northward to quite different landscapes that reflect European and American traditions and political , economic , and cultural values .
Two , opportunism , not logic , always seems to determine the targets of destruction .
This remains true today . If mass slaughter in the past offered a reason to obliterate remembrance of the guilty , then certainly sports teams should drop brand names such as “ Aztecs. ” Likewise , communities should topple statues honoring various Aztec gods , including the one in my own hometown : Selma , Calif .
After all , the Aztec Empire annually butchered thousands of innocent women and children captives on the altars of their hungry gods . The Aztecs were certainly far crueler conquerors , imperialists , and colonialists than was former President McKinley . Yet apparently the Aztecs , as indigenous peoples , earn a pass on the systematic mass murder of their enslaved indigenous subjects .
Stanford University has changed the name of two buildings and a mall that had been named for Father Junipero Serra , the heroic 18th-century Spanish founder of the California missions . Serra was reputed to be unkind to the indigenous people whom he sought to convert to Christianity .
Stanford students and faculty could have found a much easier target in their war against the dead : the eponymous founder of their university , Leland Stanford himself . Stanford was a 19th-century railroad robber baron who brutally imported and exploited Asian labor and was explicit in his low regard for non-white peoples .
Yet it is one thing to virtue-signal by renaming a building and quite another for progressive students to rebrand their university — and thereby lose the prestigious Stanford trademark that is seen as their gateway to career advancement .
Third , in the past there usually has been a cowardly element to historical erasure . Destruction was often done at night by roving vandals or was sanctioned by extremist groups who bullied objectors .
So too in the present . Many Confederate statues were torn down or defaced at night . City councils voted to change names or remove icons after being bullied by small pressure groups and media hysteria . They rarely referred the issue to referenda .

Destroying history will not make you feel good about the present.

The 21st century is in danger of becoming an era of statue smashing and historical erasure. Not since the iconoclasts of the Byzantine Empire or the epidemic of statue destruction during the French Revolution has the world seen anything like the current war on the past.

In 2001, the primeval Taliban blew up two ancient Buddha statues in Afghanistan on grounds that their very existence was sacrilegious to Islam.

In 2015, ISIS militants entered a museum in Mosul, Iraq, and destroyed ancient, pre-Islamic statues and idols. Their mute crime? These artifacts predated the prophet Mohammed.

The West prides itself on the idea that liberal societies would never descend into such nihilism. Think again.

In the last two years there has been a rash of statue toppling throughout the American South, aimed at wiping out memorialization of Confederate heroes. The pretense is that the Civil War can only be regarded as tragic in terms of the present oppression of the descendants of Southern slaves — 154 years after the extinction of the Confederate states.

There is also a renewed crusade to erase the memory of Italian explorer Christopher Columbus. Los Angeles removed a Columbus statue in November based on the premise that his 1492 discovery of the Americas began a disastrous genocide in the Western Hemisphere.

Last month, the Northern California town of Arcata did away with a statue of former president William McKinley because he supposedly pushed policies detrimental to Native Americans.

There have been some unfortunate lessons from such vendettas against the images and names of the past.

One, such attacks usually revealed a lack of confidence. The general insecurity of the present could supposedly be remedied by destroying mute statutes or the legacies of the dead, who could offer no rebuttal.

The subtext of most current name changing and icon toppling is that particular victimized groups blame their current plight on the past. They assume that by destroying long-dead supposed enemies, they will be liberated — or at least feel better in the present.

Yet knocking down images of Columbus will not change the fact that millions of indigenous people in Central America and Mexico are currently abandoning their ancestral homelands and emigrating northward to quite different landscapes that reflect European and American traditions and political, economic, and cultural values.

Two, opportunism, not logic, always seems to determine the targets of destruction.

This remains true today. If mass slaughter in the past offered a reason to obliterate remembrance of the guilty, then certainly sports teams should drop brand names such as “Aztecs.” Likewise, communities should topple statues honoring various Aztec gods, including the one in my own hometown: Selma, Calif.

After all, the Aztec Empire annually butchered thousands of innocent women and children captives on the altars of their hungry gods. The Aztecs were certainly far crueler conquerors, imperialists, and colonialists than was former President McKinley. Yet apparently the Aztecs, as indigenous peoples, earn a pass on the systematic mass murder of their enslaved indigenous subjects.

Stanford University has changed the name of two buildings and a mall that had been named for Father Junipero Serra, the heroic 18th-century Spanish founder of the California missions. Serra was reputed to be unkind to the indigenous people whom he sought to convert to Christianity.

Stanford students and faculty could have found a much easier target in their war against the dead: the eponymous founder of their university, Leland Stanford himself. Stanford was a 19th-century railroad robber baron who brutally imported and exploited Asian labor and was explicit in his low regard for non-white peoples.

Yet it is one thing to virtue-signal by renaming a building and quite another for progressive students to rebrand their university — and thereby lose the prestigious Stanford trademark that is seen as their gateway to career advancement.

Third, in the past there usually has been a cowardly element to historical erasure. Destruction was often done at night by roving vandals or was sanctioned by extremist groups who bullied objectors.

So too in the present. Many Confederate statues were torn down or defaced at night. City councils voted to change names or remove icons after being bullied by small pressure groups and media hysteria. They rarely referred the issue to referenda.

Four, ignorance both accompanies and explains the arrogance of historical erasure, past and present.

Recently, vandals in North Carolina set fire to a statue of General Lee. But they got the wrong Lee. Their target was not a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, but a statue of World War II major general William C. Lee, who campaigned for the creation of a U.S. Army airborne division and helped plan the invasion of Normandy.

The past is not a melodrama but more often a tragedy. Destroying history will not make you feel good about the present. Studying and learning from it might.

While many Americans are filled with fear , Melissa Ackison says the coronavirus pandemic has filled her with anger . The stay-at-home orders are government overreach , the conservative Ohio state Senate candidate says , and the labeling of some workers as “ essential ” arbitrary .
“ It enrages something inside of you , ” said Ackison , who was among those who protested Republican Gov . Mike DeWine ’ s orders at the statehouse in Columbus with her 10-year-old son . She has “ no fear whatsoever ” of contracting the virus , she said Thursday , dismissing it as hype .
The Ohio protest was among a growing number staged outside governors ’ mansions and state Capitols across the country . In places like Oklahoma , Texas and Virginia , small-government groups , supporters of President Donald Trump , anti-vaccine advocates , gun rights backers and supporters of right-wing causes have united behind a deep suspicion of efforts to shut down daily life to slow the spread of the coronavirus . As their frustration with life under lockdown grows , they ’ ve started to openly defy the social distancing rules in an effort to put pressure on governors to ease them .
Some of the protests have been small events , promoted via Facebook groups that have popped up in recent days and whose organizers are sometimes difficult to identify . Others are backed by groups funded by prominent Republican donors , some with ties to Trump . The largest so far , a rally of thousands that jammed the streets of Lansing , Michigan , on Wednesday , looked much like one of the president ’ s rallies — complete with MAGA hats or Trump flags — or one of the tea party rallies from a decade ago .
The signs of frustration come as Trump has pushed for easing stay-at-home orders and tried to look ahead to restarting the economy . He unveiled a framework for governors to follow on Thursday , but acknowledged the governors will have the final say on when their state is ready . Health experts have warned that lifting restrictions too quickly could result in a surge of new cases of the virus .
But the president and some of his supporters are impatient . Thousands of people in their cars packed the streets of Lansing to protest Democratic Gov . Gretchen Whitmer ’ s stay-at-home order and other restrictions . Outside the Capitol , some chanted “ Lock her up , ” a throwback to Trump ’ s calls during the 2016 election about his rival Hillary Clinton . One woman held a sign reading “ Heil Witmer . ”
Asked about the protesters , Trump on Thursday expressed sympathy with their frustration — “ They ’ re suffering ... they want to get back ” — and dismissed concerns about the health risks of ignoring state orders and potentially exposing themselves to the virus .
“ I think they ’ re listening . I think they listen to me , ” he said . “ They seem to be protesters that like me and respect this opinion , and my opinion ’ s the same as just about all of the governors . Nobody wants to stay shut . ”
On Friday , he egged the protesters on , tweeting for supporters to “ LIBERATE ” three states with Democratic governors : Michigan , Virginia and Minnesota , where a an afternoon protest was being held outside the governor ’ s residence .
Polls show the protesters ’ views are not widely held . An AP-NORC survey earlier this month found large majorities of Americans support a long list of government restrictions , including closing schools , limiting gatherings and shuttering bars and restaurants . Three-quarters of Americans backed requiring people to stay in their homes . And majorities of both Democrats and Republicans gave high marks for the state and city governments .
But the protests expose resilient partisan divisions , particularly in battleground Michigan . The protest there was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition , a group founded by a pro-Trump state representative and his wife , Meshawn Maddock , who is on the advisory board for an official Trump campaign group called “ Women for Trump ” and is also the co-founder of Michigan Trump Republicans .
Another group that promoted the event , the Michigan Freedom Fund , is run by Greg McNeilly , a longtime political adviser to the DeVos family , who are prolific Republican donors and have funded conservative causes across the state for decades . McNeilly was campaign manager for Dick DeVos , the husband of current U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos , during his failed bid for governor in 2006 .
Whitmer was among the governors who expressed concern about the gatherings , saying it put people at risk and could have prolonged the shutdown . Michigan had recorded over 2,000 deaths from COVID-19 as of Thursday , and close to 30,000 confirmed cases of people infected with the virus . Roughly one-quarter of the state ’ s workforce has filed for unemployment .
But it ’ s not just Democratic governors feeling the heat . A procession of cars swarmed around the Republican-dominated statehouse in Oklahoma City on Wednesday , with messages written on windows or signs that said “ stop killing our economy , ” “ we need our church ” and “ time 2 work . ”
Carol Hefner , who previously served as an Oklahoma co-chair of Trump ’ s 2016 campaign , was a major organizer of the event . She differentiated it from many of the others , characterizing it as a “ rally ” rather than a protest .
“ We ’ re not New York . Their problems are not our problems , ” Hefner said . “ We are rallying around our governor and our state to encourage the opening up of our businesses and the restoration of our state in a timely fashion . ”
Other gatherings have links to fringe groups . A protest Thursday in the Texas capital of Austin , where protesters chanted “ Free Texas ” and “ Make America Free Again , ” was broadcast live by InfoWars TV , part of a company owned by conspiracy theorist and radio host Alex Jones .
The Ohio event earlier this week brought together a collection of anti-vaccine advocates , Second Amendment supporters , tea party activists and other anti-government activists . A Columbus Dispatch photo of Ackison and other protesters yelling through glass doors of the statehouse rocketed around the internet .
Ackison said that while she views DeWine ’ s efforts as constitutional overreach , she would be fine if Trump were to act with similar authority to force governors to bring the states back on line .
“ As patriots , we put President Trump in office for a reason , ” she said . “ If he ’ s not able to give a convincing enough argument to these governors that they need to open up , then he needs to do something to take action . ”
The protests were advertised on Facebook by groups such as Reopen Virginia and End the Lockdown PA. A protest in Richmond , Virginia , on Thursday grew out of a conversation in the Facebook group Virginians for Medical Freedom , organizer Gary Golden said . The group often turns out at the Capitol in Richmond to oppose vaccine-related measures . Golden said Friday that he ’ s concerned about a loss of civil liberties , and isn ’ t swayed by what Trump says or tweets , adding , “ Politics has nothing to do with it . ”
Kelly Mullin said she brought her sons to the event to teach them a lesson about liberty . Mullin said that she thought the risk posed by the coronavirus depends on an individual ’ s health and that people can take basic steps to protect themselves , including getting enough sleep , eating organic produce and getting outside .
“ I mean , that ’ s where our tax dollars should be going . Eat broccoli , ” she said .
Infectious-disease specialists say there is no evidence that eating specific foods can prevent or kill the virus . Most people with the coronavirus experience mild or moderate symptoms , and people with health issues such as asthma and older people are at greater risk of death from COVID-19 .","FILE - In this April 13, 2020, file photo Ohio state senate candidate Melissa Ackison, left, and other protesters stand outside the Statehouse Atrium where reporters listen during the State of Ohio's Coronavirus response update at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus, Ohio.

As the year winds down, we’ll walk you through some other recent trends to get you up to speed before you’re inevitably barraged with new ones in 2020.

1. From drag queens to VSCO girls

Two new language features—“sksksk” and “and I oop”—are often talked about together. That’s because VSCO girls—largely white, teenage, middle class girls who promote a certain style and aesthetic on social media—have popularized their use.

The first, “sksksk,” is a popular keysmash, representing someone furiously hitting the “S” and “K” keys back and forth.

It can mean laughter, excitement or nervousness. As Buzzfeed explained, “It’s sort of like saying ‘I can’t even’ as if it were still 2013.”

What helped it catch on? The two keys are spaced fairly far apart on mobile devices with a more crowded keyboard layout, so they’re easier to smash back and forth with each thumb. And it’s more pronounceable than a traditional keysmash—“as;ldfkjls”—so it can be said out loud. However, this out-loud pronunciation is often used for mockery—so use it carefully.

The next, “and I oop,” comes from a video that went viral in 2019. In it, drag queen Jasmine Masters—a competitor on “RuPaul’s Drag Race”—interjects an “oop!” mid-sentence, after “and I…” She explained that the interjection occurred because she’d painfully hit her testicles.

The phrase became widely used in a similar fashion: to acknowledge—and lighten the mood after—an embarrassing or jarring situation.

Neither “sksksk” nor “and I oop” was born in 2019. “sksksk” has been around since at least 2014, while Masters’ video clip that “and I oop” originates from first streamed in 2015.

But that’s how language trends proceed. They aren’t widespread and popular immediately.

Like a lot of language innovations, these two can trace their origins to queer people of color and Black English. So there’s an element of appropriation. As they become more widely used—and associated with speakers like VSCO girls—their origins are forgotten.

2. A generational eye-roll

“OK Boomer” might be the most discussed and debated 2019 language trend. There’s a lot under the hood of this phrase, which is a signpost for intergeneration sociopolitical tension.

It gained traction through the “OK Boomer” song, recorded by Peter Kuli & Jedwill, that TikTok users started including in their videos. It then spread as a hashtag on social media platforms like Twitter.

Vox does a good job distilling the meaning of the phrase: It’s intended to convey “the perceived irony that while Boomers nitpick and judge younger generations for their specific choices, it’s the Boomers’ own choices that created the bleak socioeconomic landscape that Millennials and Gen Z currently face.”

It can be deployed simultaneously as a prod—for Boomers to think about the political tension and their role in it—and as a deflection, stopping the conversation to indicate “You already have all the power.”

Other times, it’s simply used derisively to indicate that someone is out of touch with technology, pop culture or current events.

3. yOu’Re TyPiNg AlL wRoNg!

We’ll often see people use all caps for emphasis.

But recently, people have started using alternating capital letters to express a different kind of intonation: mockery or exasperation.

While you might argue, “That’s technically from 2017,” I might just say “ThAt’S tEchNiCaLly FrOm 2017!” back at you.

Yes, this was mainly popularized a couple of years ago in a SpongeBob SquarePants meme. (And it likely originated even earlier, assuming an even snobbier tone.)

But this year, it’s broken from its original meme mold. It doesn’t have to include repetition, nor does it need an accompanying SpongeBob image. But it stills signals mockery, outrage or exasperation.

As we move into 2020 and beyond, we’ll have a sense of which of these trends have stuck around, and which were passing fads. Next year will surely have its own quirky trends that might make you go “sksksk.”

culture,Yahoo! The 360,1,https://news.yahoo.com/can-the-developing-world-endure-the-coronavirus-185508009.html,Can the developing world endure the coronavirus?,2020-06-30,Mike Bebernes,"“ The 360 ” shows you diverse perspectives on the day ’ s top stories and debates .
When the coronavirus first began spreading from China to the rest of the world , public health experts issued dire warnings about the toll the virus would take on poor countries . The United Nations predicted in early April that as many as 3.3 million people in Africa may die from COVID-19 . Philanthropist Melinda Gates warned of “ bodies out on the street ” on the continent . Similarly dire forecasts were made about developing nations in Latin America , Asia and elsewhere .
In March and April , however , the worst impacts of the pandemic were concentrated in wealthy countries in North America and Europe , while the bulk of the developing world reported remarkably low numbers of infections . At the end of April , low-income countries accounted for just 14 percent of global COVID-19 deaths despite being home to 84 percent of the world ’ s population .
That trend has shifted significantly over the past two months . Rich countries , with the obvious exception of the United States , have gradually gotten their outbreaks under control . At the same time , the situation has gotten much worse in developing countries . Latin America is now the global epicenter of the pandemic , driven by major outbreaks in Brazil , Chile , Peru and Mexico . The number of new daily cases in India has skyrocketed as lockdown measures there are being lifted .
Some experts are concerned that developing nations are seeing the beginnings of the worst-case scenarios that were predicted in the early stages of the pandemic . Many of these countries are home to incredibly densely populated cities with limited access to sanitation and poor public health infrastructure — conditions that could lead to a devastating outbreak . It ’ s also possible that limited testing has underrepresented the true size of the outbreak until recently .
While reduced travel from Western countries may have delayed the spread of the virus , it appears now to have taken hold in several vulnerable countries , epidemiologists say . Poorer nations also are particularly at risk of severe economic consequences of the pandemic , which may compel their governments to relax lockdown measures in order to avoid food crises within their borders .
While the situation in some places appears dire , there are reasons for optimism , some experts argue . For all the challenges they face , many developing nations have done an excellent job containing the spread of the virus . Years spent combating diseases like HIV , malaria and Ebola mean that the epidemic response in some countries is much more sophisticated than people in the West might expect . Conditions on the ground may also help limit the severity of the outbreak in some places . Insufficient roads and lack of public transport can make it difficult for the virus to travel from one community to another .

What’s happening

When the coronavirus first began spreading from China to the rest of the world, public health experts issued dire warnings about the toll the virus would take on poor countries. The United Nations predicted in early April that as many as 3.3 million people in Africa may die from COVID-19. Philanthropist Melinda Gates warned of “bodies out on the street” on the continent. Similarly dire forecasts were made about developing nations in Latin America, Asia and elsewhere.

In March and April, however, the worst impacts of the pandemic were concentrated in wealthy countries in North America and Europe, while the bulk of the developing world reported remarkably low numbers of infections. At the end of April, low-income countries accounted for just 14 percent of global COVID-19 deaths despite being home to 84 percent of the world’s population.

That trend has shifted significantly over the past two months. Rich countries, with the obvious exception of the United States, have gradually gotten their outbreaks under control. At the same time, the situation has gotten much worse in developing countries. Latin America is now the global epicenter of the pandemic, driven by major outbreaks in Brazil, Chile, Peru and Mexico. The number of new daily cases in India has skyrocketed as lockdown measures there are being lifted.

Why there’s debate

Some experts are concerned that developing nations are seeing the beginnings of the worst-case scenarios that were predicted in the early stages of the pandemic. Many of these countries are home to incredibly densely populated cities with limited access to sanitation and poor public health infrastructure — conditions that could lead to a devastating outbreak. It’s also possible that limited testing has underrepresented the true size of the outbreak until recently.

While reduced travel from Western countries may have delayed the spread of the virus, it appears now to have taken hold in several vulnerable countries, epidemiologists say. Poorer nations also are particularly at risk of severe economic consequences of the pandemic, which may compel their governments to relax lockdown measures in order to avoid food crises within their borders.

While the situation in some places appears dire, there are reasons for optimism, some experts argue. For all the challenges they face, many developing nations have done an excellent job containing the spread of the virus. Years spent combating diseases like HIV, malaria and Ebola mean that the epidemic response in some countries is much more sophisticated than people in the West might expect. Conditions on the ground may also help limit the severity of the outbreak in some places. Insufficient roads and lack of public transport can make it difficult for the virus to travel from one community to another. Developing nations also tend to have much younger populations than wealthy countries — the median age in Africa is 20 years old — which could mean fewer deaths even if there is a high number of cases.

What’s next

The next several weeks will be critical in deciding how bad the pandemic gets in the developing world. Countries that are already being hit hard, like Brazil and India, could see their outbreaks grow to rival the U.S. for worst in the world if trends continue. Nations that have so far contained the virus, like Vietnam and Uruguay, may not experience significant outbreaks at all.

Yet the country’s political environment is far different in 2020 than it was during Trump’s inaugural victory. And Floyd’s death has prompted a national reckoning on systemic racism, providing a very different context than four years ago.

Cultural revolutionaries attack the very referents of our daily lives. The Jacobins' so-called Reign of Terror during the French Revolution slaughtered Christian clergy, renamed months and created a new supreme being Reason.

Mao cracked down on supposed Western decadence like the wearing of eyeglasses and made peasants forge pot iron and intellectuals wear dunce caps.

The current Black Lives Matter Revolution has ""canceled"" certain movies, television shows and cartoons, toppled statues, tried to create new autonomous urban zones, and renamed streets and plazas. Some fanatics shave their heads. Others have shamed authorities into washing the feet of their fellow revolutionaries.

But inevitably cultural revolutions die out when they turn cannibalistic. Once the Red Guard started killing party hacks too close to Mao, it began to wane.

If toppling Confederate statues is required, what then about Nancy Pelosi's own mayor father, who once as Baltimore's mayor dedicated honorific statues to Confederate generals?

If racists understandably do not deserve their names on national shrines, what to do with the iconic liberal graduate program at Princeton, the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs? It was named for a president who did more to further segregation and racial prejudice than any chief executive of the 20th century.

Stanford and Yale, coveted brand names of the progressive professional classes, are named after what protestors now deem racists.

It is easier to target Fort Bragg, the iconic military base named after a Confederate general, racist and military mediocrity than to see one's MBA or PhD lose its Yale luster, or to confess that a liberal presidential icon perpetuated racism.

Once a cultural revolution gets going, there can be no contextualization of the past, no allowance for human frailty, no consideration of weighing evil vs. good.

Eventually, the architects of cultural upheavals always make two miscalculations.

One, they presume that destroying things will never apply to themselves, given their loud virtue signaling.

Two, if they are fingered by the mob, they assume they can somehow use their clout and influence to win exemption.

In other words, once cultural revolutions turn anarchic and eat their own, they lose support. When quiet sympathizers conclude that they too may targeted, to survive they turn on their former icons.

We are seeing that now. Liberal sympathetic bystanders are wondering whether downtown arson and looting will go private and reach their suburban homes.

When a liberal mayor or black police chief or progressive governor or white leftist who diverges from the party line is targeted by the mob, then who really is safe?

Answer? No one. And so the cultural revolution sputters to irrelevance.

What deflated the MeToo movement was the high toll that the accusations took among the Hollywood and cultural elite. Suddenly, progressive celebrities began demanding evidence and insisting on presumed innocence when their careers were destroyed.

What burns out these cultural upheavals is that today's revolutionary can be denounced as tomorrow's sell-out. No leader wants to share Robespierre's rendezvous with his own guillotine.

There is one caveat.

Sometimes cultural revolutions don't die out -- if they are hijacked by a thug or killer.

The National Socialist movement was an irrelevant nihilist mob of crazies until Adolf Hitler turned it into his personal genocidal cult. A murderous Stalin resuscitated the absurdities of Lenin's failing Bolshevism.

The present madness will wane like a virus, as it eats its own and terrifies its sympathizers that they may be next -- unless, of course, a would-be Napoleon uses a ""whiff of grapeshot"" and turns the mob into his personal cult.

The armed rapper Raz Simone, who some say lords over the ""Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone"" in downtown Seattle, so far has neither the diabolic talent nor the resources to spread his anarchy.

Dissident generals may be misguided, but they remain patriots. So far, we have seen no Napoleon emerge to claim that he is only the man who can lead today's urban revolutionaries to victory.

culture,Yahoo! The 360,1,https://news.yahoo.com/are-masks-the-next-front-in-the-coronavirus-culture-war-182414248.html,Are masks the next front in the coronavirus culture war?,2020-05-11,Mike Bebernes,"“ The 360 ” shows you diverse perspectives on the day ’ s top stories and debates .
Debates over masks and other face coverings have been at the center of discussion since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. For much of that time , the conversation focused largely on practical matters , like how effective masks are at stemming the spread of the virus and questions about shortages for health care workers .
The debate has shifted in recent weeks . There are no longer questions about whether masks prevent infection . Experts agree that even homemade ones help . The current conversation is more contentious . Those who refuse to wear masks have been accused of ignorance or selfishness while the mandates that they be worn outside or in shops have been painted as violations of civil liberties .
The discontent over masks has been strong enough to force some politicians to change their policies . Ohio Gov . Mike DeWine , who has been praised for his early and aggressive response to the virus , has lifted the state ’ s order requiring masks be worn inside stores , saying , “ People were not going to accept the government telling them what to do. ” The city of Stillwater , Okla. , rescinded its mask policy after employees at some stores faced threats of violence .
The disagreements over masks have even turned violent . In Michigan a security guard was killed after reportedly demanding a patron wear a mask .
How did the discussion of masks morph from a conversation about their medical merits to a clash over politics and liberty ?

What’s happening

Debates over masks and other face coverings have been at the center of discussion since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. For much of that time, the conversation focused largely on practical matters, like how effective masks are at stemming the spread of the virus and questions about shortages for health care workers.

The debate has shifted in recent weeks. There are no longer questions about whether masks prevent infection. Experts agree that even homemade ones help. The current conversation is more contentious. Those who refuse to wear masks have been accused of ignorance or selfishness while the mandates that they be worn outside or in shops have been painted as violations of civil liberties.

The discontent over masks has been strong enough to force some politicians to change their policies. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who has been praised for his early and aggressive response to the virus, has lifted the state’s order requiring masks be worn inside stores, saying, “People were not going to accept the government telling them what to do.” The city of Stillwater, Okla., rescinded its mask policy after employees at some stores faced threats of violence.

The disagreements over masks have even turned violent. In Michigan a security guard was killed after reportedly demanding a patron wear a mask.

Why there’s debate

How did the discussion of masks morph from a conversation about their medical merits to a clash over politics and liberty?

One of the most obvious answers is the partisan divide over how best to respond to the pandemic. After facing criticism for his administration’s actions during the onset of the outbreak, President Trump has turned his focus to reopening the country and accused skeptics of his largely unpopular plan of playing politics. Declining to wear a mask could be, for many, a gesture of support for the president and his vision that it’s time to start returning to normal.

Trump may have solidified this view by refusing to wear a mask at recent public appearances despite the administration’s recommendations for U.S. residents.

Wearing a mask can be a symbol of trust in leaders and scientists who set health policies. Refusing to wear one suggests a rejection of that authority. The mishmash of laws from state to state combined with confusing messaging from medical authorities like the World Health Organization may be contributing to doubts about the importance of face coverings.

The intensity of the disagreement may have more emotional roots, some psychiatrists say. In times of difficulty, humans are wired to look for someone to blame for the challenges they face. Mask wearers may see the bare-faced as responsible for exacerbating the health risks of the outbreak. Non-wearers might believe that overzealous restrictions are causing severe economic pain. For these groups, masks can be a symbol of a disagreement that goes much deeper than whether someone has a piece of cloth over their face.

Masks have become more about politics than health

The debate over masks triggers resentment and defensiveness

“The way we do things is right. The way others do things is wrong. Usually the gulf between the two is a matter merely of frustration; now it’s also a matter of fear. And for those of us who are told we’re not being careful enough when we’re convinced we’re being very careful indeed, it’s a matter of resentment tinged with guilt.” — Molly Roberts, Washington Post

Not a body . Just some already-fallen branches . Nonetheless , the onlooker called the cops .
Officers interrogated the boy , who said he was trying to build a fort for himself and his friends . A local news site reports the police then `` took the tools for safekeeping to be returned to the boy 's parents . ''
Elsewhere in America , preschoolers at the Learning Collaborative in Charlotte , North Carolina , were thrilled to receive a set of gently used playground equipment . But the kids soon found out they would not be allowed to use it , because it was resting on grass , not wood chips . `` It 's a safety issue , '' explained a day care spokeswoman . Playing on grass is against local regulations .
And then there was the query that ran in Parents magazine a few years back : `` Your child 's old enough to stay home briefly , and often does . But is it okay to leave her and her playmate home while you dash to the dry cleaner ? '' Absolutely not , the magazine averred : `` Take the kids with you , or save your errand for another time . '' After all , `` you want to make sure that no one 's feelings get too hurt if there 's a squabble . ''
The principle here is simple : This generation of kids must be protected like none other . They ca n't use tools , they ca n't play on grass , and they certainly ca n't be expected to work through a spat with a friend .
And this , it could be argued , is why we have `` safe spaces '' on college campuses and millennials missing adult milestones today . We told a generation of kids that they can never be too safe—and they believed us .
We 've had the best of intentions , of course . But efforts to protect our children may be backfiring . When we raise kids unaccustomed to facing anything on their own , including risk , failure , and hurt feelings , our society and even our economy are threatened . Yet modern child-rearing practices and laws seem all but designed to cultivate this lack of preparedness . There 's the fear that everything children see , do , eat , hear , and lick could hurt them . And there 's a newer belief that has been spreading through higher education that words and ideas themselves can be traumatizing .
How did we come to think a generation of kids ca n't handle the basic challenges of growing up ?
Beginning in the 1980s , American childhood changed . For a variety of reasons—including shifts in parenting norms , new academic expectations , increased regulation , technological advances , and especially a heightened fear of abduction ( missing kids on milk cartons made it feel as if this exceedingly rare crime was rampant ) —children largely lost the experience of having large swaths of unsupervised time to play , explore , and resolve conflicts on their own . This has left them more fragile , more easily offended , and more reliant on others . They have been taught to seek authority figures to solve their problems and shield them from discomfort , a condition sociologists call `` moral dependency . ''
This poses a threat to the kind of open-mindedness and flexibility young people need to thrive at college and beyond . If they arrive at school or start careers unaccustomed to frustration and misunderstandings , we can expect them to be hypersensitive . And if they do n't develop the resources to work through obstacles , molehills come to look like mountains .
This magnification of danger and hurt is prevalent on campus today . It no longer matters what a person intended to say , or how a reasonable listener would interpret a statement—what matters is whether any individual feels offended by it . If so , the speaker has committed a `` microaggression , '' and the offended party 's purely subjective reaction is a sufficient basis for emailing a dean or filing a complaint with the university 's `` bias response team . '' The net effect is that both professors and students today report that they are walking on eggshells . This interferes with the process of free inquiry and open debate—the active ingredients in a college education .
And if that 's the case already , what of the kids still in grammar school , constantly reminded they might accidentally hurt each other with the wrong words ? When today 's 8-year-olds become the 18-year-olds starting college , will they still view free speech as worthy of protecting ? As Daniel Shuchman , chairman of the free speech-promoting Foundation for Individual Rights in Education ( FIRE ) , puts it , `` How likely are they to consider the First Amendment essential if they start learning in fifth grade that you 're forbidden to say—or even think—certain things , especially at school ? ''
Parents , teachers , and professors are talking about the growing fragility they see . It 's hard to avoid the conclusion that the overprotection of children and the hypersensitivity of college students could be two sides of the same coin . By trying so hard to protect our kids , we 're making them too safe to succeed .
If you 're over 40 , chances are good that you had scads of free time as a child—after school , on weekends , over the summer . And chances are also good that , if you were asked about it now , you 'd go on and on about playing in the woods and riding your bike until the streetlights came on .
Today many kids are raised like veal . Only 13 percent of them even walk to school . Many who take the bus wait at the stop with parents beside them like bodyguards . For a while , Rhode Island was considering a bill that would prohibit children from getting off the bus in the afternoon if there was n't an adult waiting to walk them home . This would have applied until seventh grade .
As for summer frolicking , campers do n't just have to take a buddy with them wherever they go , including the bathroom . Some are now required to take two—one to stay with whoever gets hurt , the other to run and get a grown-up . Walking to the john is treated like climbing Mt . Kilimanjaro .
After school , kids no longer come home with a latchkey and roam the neighborhood . Instead , they 're locked into organized , supervised activities . Youth sports are a $ 15 billion business that has grown by 55 percent since just 2010 . Children as young as third grade are joining traveling teams—which means their parents spend a lot of time in the car , too . Or they 're at tutoring . Or they 're at music lessons . And if all else fails , they are in their rooms , online .
Even if parents want to shoo their kids outside—and do n't come home till dinner ! —it 's not as easy as it once was . Often , there are no other children around to play with . Even more dishearteningly , adults who believe it 's good for young people to run some errands or play kickball down the street have to think twice about letting them , because busybodies , cops , and social workers are primed to equate `` unsupervised '' with `` neglected and in danger . ''
You may remember the story of the Meitivs in Maryland , investigated twice for letting their kids , 10 and 6 , walk home together from the park . Or the Debra Harrell case in South Carolina , where a mom was thrown in jail for allowing her 9-year-old to play at the sprinkler playground while she worked at McDonald 's . Or the 8-year-old Ohio boy who was supposed to get on the bus to Sunday school , but snuck off to the Family Dollar store instead . His dad was arrested for child endangerment .
These examples represent a new outlook : the belief that anytime kids are doing anything on their own , they are automatically under threat . But that outlook is wrong . The crime rate in America is back down to what it was in 1963 , which means that most of today 's parents grew up playing outside when it was more dangerous than it is today . And it has n't gotten safer because we 're hovering over our kids . All violent crime is down , including against adults .
And yet it does n't feel safer . A 2010 study found `` kidnapping '' to be the top parental fear , despite the fact that merely being a passenger in a car is far more dangerous . Nine kids were kidnapped and murdered by strangers in 2011 , while 1,140 died in vehicles that same year . While Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker writes in 2011 's The Better Angels of Our Nature that life in most countries is safer today than at any time in human history , the press keeps pushing paranoia . This makes stepping back feel doubly risky : There 's the fear of child kidnappers and the fear of Child Protective Services .
At times , it seems like our culture is conjuring dangers out of thin air , just to have something new to worry about . Thus , the Boulder Public Library in Colorado recently forbade anyone under 12 to enter without an adult , because `` children may encounter hazards such as stairs , elevators , doors , furniture , electrical equipment , or other library patrons . '' Ah , yes , kids and library furniture . Always a lethal combo .
Happily , the library backed off that rule , perhaps thanks to merciless mocking in the media . But saner minds do n't always prevail . At Mesa Elementary School , which also happens to be in Boulder , students got a list of the items they could not bring to the science fair . These included `` chemicals , '' `` plants in soil , '' and `` organisms ( living or dead ) . '' And we wonder why American children score so low on international tests .
But perhaps the single best example of how fantastically fearful we 've become occurred when the city of Richland , Washington , got rid of all the swings on its school playgrounds . The love of swinging is probably older than humanity itself , given our arboreal origins . But as a school district spokesman explained , `` Swings have been determined to be the most unsafe of all the playground equipment on a playground . ''
You may think your town has avoided such overkill , but is there a merry-go-round at your local park , or a see-saw ? Most likely they , too , have gone the way of lawn darts . The Consumer Product Safety Commission even warns parks of `` tripping hazards , like…tree stumps and rocks , '' a fact unearthed ( so to speak ) by Philip Howard , author of 2010 's Life Without Lawyers .
The problem is that kids learn by doing . Trip over a tree stump and you learn to look down . There 's an old saying : Prepare your child for the path , not the path for your child . We 're doing the opposite .
Ironically , there are real health dangers in not walking , or biking , or hopping over that stump . A Johns Hopkins study this summer found that the typical 19-year-old is as sedentary as a 65-year-old . The Army is worried that its recruits do n't know how to skip or do somersaults .
But the cost of shielding kids from risks goes well beyond the physical , as a robust body of research has shown .
A few years ago , Boston College psychology professor emeritus Peter Gray was invited by the head of counseling services at a major university to a conference on `` the decline in resilience among students . '' The organizer said that emergency counseling calls had doubled in the last five years . What 's more , callers were seeking help coping with everyday problems , such as arguments with a roommate . Two students had dialed in because they 'd found a mouse in their apartment . They also called the police , who came and set a mousetrap . And that 's not to mention the sensitivity around grades . To some students , a B is the end of the world . ( To some parents , too . )
Free play has little in common with the `` play '' we give children today . In organized activities , adults run the show . It 's only when the grown-ups are n't around that the kids get to take over . Play is training for adulthood .
Part of the rise in calls could be attributed to the fact that admitting mental health issues no longer carries the stigma it once did , an undeniably positive development . But it could also be a sign , Gray realized , that failing at basic `` adulting '' no longer carries the stigma it once did . And that is far more troubling .
Is this outcome the apotheosis of participation-trophy culture ? It 's easy to scoff at a society that teaches kids that everything they do deserves applause . But more disturbing is the possibility that those trophies taught kids the opposite lesson : that they 're so easily hurt , they ca n't handle the sad truth that they 're not the best at something .
Not letting your kid climb a tree because he might fall robs him of a classic childhood experience . But being emotionally overprotective takes away something else . `` We have raised a generation of young people who have not been given the opportunity to…experience failure and realize they can survive it , '' Gray has said . When Lenore 's son came in eighth out of nine teams in a summer camp bowling league , he got an eighth-place trophy . The moral was clear : We do n't think you can cope with the negative emotions of finishing second-to-last .
Of course , it 's natural to want to see kids happy . But the real secret to happiness is n't more high fives ; it 's developing emotional resilience . In our mania for physical safety , coupled with our recent tendency to talk about `` emotional safety , '' we have systematically deprived our children of the thousands of challenging—and sometimes upsetting—experiences that they need in order to learn that resiliency . And in our quest to protect them , we have stolen from children the best resilience training known to man : free play .
All mammals play . It is a drive installed by Mother Nature . Hippos do backflips in the water . Dogs fetch sticks . And gazelles run around , engaging in a game that looks an awful lot like tag .
Why would they do that ? They 're wasting valuable calories and exposing themselves to predators . Should n't they just sit quietly next to their mama gazelles , exploring the world through the magic of PBS Kids ?
It must be because play is even more important to their long-term survival than simply being `` safe . '' Gray 's main body of research is on the importance of free play , and he stresses that it has little in common with the `` play '' we give kids today . In organized activities—Little League , for example—adults run the show . It 's only when the grown-ups are n't around that the kids get to take over . Play is training for adulthood .
In free play , ideally with kids of mixed ages , the children decide what to do and how to do it . That 's teamwork , literally . The little kids desperately want to be like the bigger kids , so instead of bawling when they strike out during a sandlot baseball game , they work hard to hold themselves together . This is the foundation of maturity .
The older kids , meanwhile , throw the ball more softly to the younger ones . They 're learning empathy . And if someone yells , `` Let 's play on just one leg ! `` —something they could n't do at Little League , with championships ( and trophies ! ) on the line—the kids discover what it means to come up with and try out a different way of doing things . In Silicon Valley terms , they `` pivot '' and adopt a `` new business model . '' They also learn that they , not just grown-ups , can collectively remake the rules to suit their needs . That 's called participatory democracy .
Best of all , without adults intervening , the kids have to do all the problem solving for themselves , from deciding what game to play to making sure the teams are roughly equal . Then , when there 's an argument , they have to resolve it themselves . That 's a tough skill to learn , but the drive to continue playing motivates them to work things out . To get back to having fun , they first have to come up with a solution , so they do . This teaches them that they can disagree , hash it out , and—perhaps with some grumbling—move on .
These are the very skills that are suddenly in short supply on college campuses .
`` Free play is the means by which children learn to make friends , overcome their fears , solve their own problems and generally take control of their own lives , '' Gray writes in 2013 's Free to Learn ( Basic Books ) . `` Nothing we do , no amount of toys we buy or 'quality time ' or special training we give our children , can compensate for the freedom we take away . The things that children learn through their own initiatives , in free play , can not be taught in other ways . ''
Unstructured , unsupervised time for play is one of the most important things we have to give back to kids if we want them to be strong and happy and resilient .
It 's not just that kids are n't playing much on their own . These days , they 're not doing much of anything on their own . In an article in The Atlantic , Hanna Rosin admits that `` when my daughter was 10 , my husband and I suddenly realized that in her whole life , she had probably not spent more than 10 minutes unsupervised by an adult . ''
In earlier generations , this would have seemed a bizarre and wildly overprotective upbringing . Society had certain age-related milestones that most people agreed on . Kids might be trusted to walk to school by first grade . They might get a latchkey at 8 , take on a newspaper route around 10 , start babysitting at 12 . But over the past generation or so , those milestones disappeared—buried by fears of kidnapping , the rise of supervised activities , and the pre-eminence of homework . Parents today know all about the academic milestones their kids are supposed to reach , but not about the moments when kids used to start joining the world .
It 's not necessarily their fault . Calls to eight newspapers in North Carolina found none that would take anyone under the age of 18 to deliver papers . A police chief in New Albany , Ohio , went on record saying kids should n't be outside on their own till age 16 , `` the threshold where you see children getting a little bit more freedom . '' A study in Britain found that while just under half of all 16- to 17-year-olds had jobs as recently as 1992 , today that number is 20 percent .
The responsibility expected of kids not so long ago has become almost inconceivable . Published in 1979 , the book Your 6-Year-old : Loving and Defiant includes a simple checklist for what a child entering first grade should be able to do : Can he draw and color and stay within the lines of the design being colored ? Can he ride a small two-wheeled bicycle without helper wheels ? Can he travel alone in the neighborhood ( four to eight blocks ) to a store , school , playground , or friend 's home ?
It 's tempting to blame `` helicopter parents '' for today 's less resilient kids . But when all the first-graders are walking themselves to school , it 's easy to add yours to the mix . When your child is the only one , it 's harder . And that 's where we are today . Norms have dramatically changed . The kind of freedom that seemed unremarkable a generation ago has become taboo , and in some cases even illegal .
In Waynesboro , Georgia , `` trick or treaters '' must be 12 or younger ; they must be in a costume ; and they must be accompanied by an adult at least 21 years of age . So if you have kids who are 15 , 10 , and 8 , you ca n't send them out together . The 15-year-old is not allowed to dress up , yet she wo n't be considered old enough to supervise her siblings for another six years . And this is on the one night of the entire year we traditionally let children pretend to be adults .
Other schools and community centers now send letters home asking parents not to let their children wear scary costumes . Some even organize `` trunk or treats '' —cars parked in a circle , trunks open and filled with candy , thus saving the kids from having to walk around the neighborhood or knock on doors . ( That would be tiring and terrifying . ) If this is childhood , is it any wonder college kids also expect to be micromanaged on Halloween ?
At Yale in 2015 , after 13 college administrators signed a letter outlining appropriate vs. inappropriate costume choices for students , the childhood development expert and campus lecturer Erika Christakis suggested that it would be better to allow kids to think for themselves . After all , Halloween is supposed to be about pushing boundaries . `` Is there no room anymore for a child or young person to be a little obnoxious…or , yes , offensive ? '' she wrote . `` Have we lost faith in young people 's capacity—your capacity—to ignore or reject things that trouble you ? ''
Apparently , yes . Angry students mobbed her husband , the professor Nicholas Christakis , surrounding him in the courtyard of the residential college where he served as master . They screamed obscenities and demanded he apologize for believing , along with his wife , that college students are in fact capable of handling offensive costumes on Halloween . `` Be quiet ! '' a student shouted at him at one point . `` As master , it is your job to create a place of comfort and home for the students ! '' She did not take kindly to his response that , to the contrary , he sees it as his job to create a space where students can grow intellectually .
As it turns out , Halloween is the perfect Petri dish for observing what we have done to childhood . We did n't think anything was safe enough for young people . And now we are witnessing the results .
When parents curtail their kids ' independence , they 're not just depriving the younglings of childhood fun . They are denying themselves the grown-up joy of seeing their kids do something smart , brave , or kind without parental guidance .
It 's the kind of joy described by a Washington Post columnist who answered the phone one day and was shocked to find her 8-year-old son on the other end . He 'd accidentally gone home when he was supposed to stay after school . Realizing she was n't there , he decided to walk to the store a few blocks away—his first time . The mom raced over , fearing God knows what , and rushed in only to find her son happily helping the shopkeeper stock the shelves with meat . He 'd had a snack and done his homework , too . It was an afternoon he 'd never forget , and neither would his very proud mother .
When we do n't let our kids do anything on their own , we do n't get to see just how competent they can be—and is n't that , ultimately , the greatest reward of parenting ? We need to make it easier for grown-ups to let go while living in a society that keeps warning them not to . And we need to make sure they wo n't get arrested for it .
By trying to keep children safe from all risks , obstacles , hurt feelings , and fears , our culture has taken away the opportunities they need to become successful adults . In treating them as fragile—emotionally , socially , and physically—society actually makes them so .
To combat this problem , we have established a new nonpartisan nonprofit , the Let Grow Foundation . Our goal is to restore resilience by overthrowing the culture of overprotection . We teamed up with Gray , the professor whose research we highlighted above , and FIRE 's Shuchman , a New York investment fund manager who is now our chairman .
We are building an organization that seeks to change the social norms , policies , and laws that pressure and intimidate parents , schools , and towns into coddling their kids . We will research the effects of excessive caution , study the link between independence and success , and launch projects to give kids back some free time and free play . Most of all , the Let Grow Foundation will reject the assumption of fragility and promote intellectual , physical , and emotional resilience .
Children know that their parents had more freedom to roam than they do , and more unscheduled time to read or tinker or explore . They also realize that older generations were trusted to roll with some punches , at school and beyond . We hope kids today will start demanding that same independence and respect for themselves . It 's their freedom that has been chiseled away , after all .
We want them to insist on their right to engage not just with the physical world , but also with the world of ideas . We want them to hear , read , and voice opinions that go against the grain . We want them to be insulted by the assumption that they and their classmates are so easily hurt that arguments must stop before they start . To this end , we hope to encourage their skepticism about the programs and policies that are ostensibly there to `` protect '' them from discomfort .
If this effort is successful , we 'll soon see kids outside again . Common setbacks will be considered `` resilience moments '' rather than traumas . Children will read widely , express themselves freely , and work through disagreements without automatically calling on authority figures to solve their problems for them . The more adults step back , the more we believe kids will step up , growing brave in the face of risk and just plain happy in their independence .
Children today are safer and smarter than this culture gives them credit for . They deserve the freedom we had . The country 's future prosperity and freedom depend on it .","One day last year, a citizen on a prairie path in the Chicago suburb of Elmhurst came upon a teen boy chopping wood. Not a body. Just some already-fallen branches. Nonetheless, the onlooker called the cops.

Officers interrogated the boy, who said he was trying to build a fort for himself and his friends. A local news site reports the police then ""took the tools for safekeeping to be returned to the boy's parents.""

Elsewhere in America, preschoolers at the Learning Collaborative in Charlotte, North Carolina, were thrilled to receive a set of gently used playground equipment. But the kids soon found out they would not be allowed to use it, because it was resting on grass, not wood chips. ""It's a safety issue,"" explained a day care spokeswoman.

After all, ""you want to make sure that no one's feelings get too hurt if there's a squabble.""

The principle here is simple: This generation of kids must be protected like none other. They can't use tools, they can't play on grass, and they certainly can't be expected to work through a spat with a friend.

And this, it could be argued, is why we have ""safe spaces"" on college campuses and millennials missing adult milestones today. We told a generation of kids that they can never be too safe—and they believed us.

Safety First

We've had the best of intentions, of course. But efforts to protect our children may be backfiring. When we raise kids unaccustomed to facing anything on their own, including risk, failure, and hurt feelings, our society and even our economy are threatened. Yet modern child-rearing practices and laws seem all but designed to cultivate this lack of preparedness. There's the fear that everything children see, do, eat, hear, and lick could hurt them. And there's a newer belief that has been spreading through higher education that words and ideas themselves can be traumatizing.

How did we come to think a generation of kids can't handle the basic challenges of growing up?

Beginning in the 1980s, American childhood changed. For a variety of reasons—including shifts in parenting norms, new academic expectations, increased regulation, technological advances, and especially a heightened fear of abduction (missing kids on milk cartons made it feel as if this exceedingly rare crime was rampant)—children largely lost the experience of having large swaths of unsupervised time to play, explore, and resolve conflicts on their own. This has left them more fragile, more easily offended, and more reliant on others. They have been taught to seek authority figures to solve their problems and shield them from discomfort, a condition sociologists call ""moral dependency.""

This poses a threat to the kind of open-mindedness and flexibility young people need to thrive at college and beyond. If they arrive at school or start careers unaccustomed to frustration and misunderstandings, we can expect them to be hypersensitive. And if they don't develop the resources to work through obstacles, molehills come to look like mountains.

This magnification of danger and hurt is prevalent on campus today. It no longer matters what a person intended to say, or how a reasonable listener would interpret a statement—what matters is whether any individual feels offended by it. If so, the speaker has committed a ""microaggression,"" and the offended party's purely subjective reaction is a sufficient basis for emailing a dean or filing a complaint with the university's ""bias response team."" The net effect is that both professors and students today report that they are walking on eggshells. This interferes with the process of free inquiry and open debate—the active ingredients in a college education.

And if that's the case already, what of the kids still in grammar school, constantly reminded they might accidentally hurt each other with the wrong words? When today's 8-year-olds become the 18-year-olds starting college, will they still view free speech as worthy of protecting? As Daniel Shuchman, chairman of the free speech-promoting Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), puts it, ""How likely are they to consider the First Amendment essential if they start learning in fifth grade that you're forbidden to say—or even think—certain things, especially at school?""

Parents, teachers, and professors are talking about the growing fragility they see. It's hard to avoid the conclusion that the overprotection of children and the hypersensitivity of college students could be two sides of the same coin. By trying so hard to protect our kids, we're making them too safe to succeed.

Children on a Leash

If you're over 40, chances are good that you had scads of free time as a child—after school, on weekends, over the summer. And chances are also good that, if you were asked about it now, you'd go on and on about playing in the woods and riding your bike until the streetlights came on.

Today many kids are raised like veal. Only 13 percent of them even walk to school. Many who take the bus wait at the stop with parents beside them like bodyguards. For a while, Rhode Island was considering a bill that would prohibit children from getting off the bus in the afternoon if there wasn't an adult waiting to walk them home. This would have applied until seventh grade.

As for summer frolicking, campers don't just have to take a buddy with them wherever they go, including the bathroom. Some are now required to take two—one to stay with whoever gets hurt, the other to run and get a grown-up. Walking to the john is treated like climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro.

After school, kids no longer come home with a latchkey and roam the neighborhood. Instead, they're locked into organized, supervised activities. Youth sports are a $15 billion business that has grown by 55 percent since just 2010. Children as young as third grade are joining traveling teams—which means their parents spend a lot of time in the car, too. Or they're at tutoring. Or they're at music lessons. And if all else fails, they are in their rooms, online.

Even if parents want to shoo their kids outside—and don't come home till dinner!—it's not as easy as it once was. Often, there are no other children around to play with. Even more dishearteningly, adults who believe it's good for young people to run some errands or play kickball down the street have to think twice about letting them, because busybodies, cops, and social workers are primed to equate ""unsupervised"" with ""neglected and in danger.""

You may remember the story of the Meitivs in Maryland, investigated twice for letting their kids, 10 and 6, walk home together from the park. Or the Debra Harrell case in South Carolina, where a mom was thrown in jail for allowing her 9-year-old to play at the sprinkler playground while she worked at McDonald's. Or the 8-year-old Ohio boy who was supposed to get on the bus to Sunday school, but snuck off to the Family Dollar store instead. His dad was arrested for child endangerment.

These examples represent a new outlook: the belief that anytime kids are doing anything on their own, they are automatically under threat. But that outlook is wrong. The crime rate in America is back down to what it was in 1963, which means that most of today's parents grew up playing outside when it was more dangerous than it is today. And it hasn't gotten safer because we're hovering over our kids. All violent crime is down, including against adults.

Danger Things

And yet it doesn't feel safer. A 2010 study found ""kidnapping"" to be the top parental fear, despite the fact that merely being a passenger in a car is far more dangerous. Nine kids were kidnapped and murdered by strangers in 2011, while 1,140 died in vehicles that same year. While Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker writes in 2011's The Better Angels of Our Nature that life in most countries is safer today than at any time in human history, the press keeps pushing paranoia. This makes stepping back feel doubly risky: There's the fear of child kidnappers and the fear of Child Protective Services.

At times, it seems like our culture is conjuring dangers out of thin air, just to have something new to worry about. Thus, the Boulder Public Library in Colorado recently forbade anyone under 12 to enter without an adult, because ""children may encounter hazards such as stairs, elevators, doors, furniture, electrical equipment, or other library patrons."" Ah, yes, kids and library furniture. Always a lethal combo.

Happily, the library backed off that rule, perhaps thanks to merciless mocking in the media. But saner minds don't always prevail. At Mesa Elementary School, which also happens to be in Boulder, students got a list of the items they could not bring to the science fair. These included ""chemicals,"" ""plants in soil,"" and ""organisms (living or dead)."" And we wonder why American children score so low on international tests.

But perhaps the single best example of how fantastically fearful we've become occurred when the city of Richland, Washington, got rid of all the swings on its school playgrounds. The love of swinging is probably older than humanity itself, given our arboreal origins. But as a school district spokesman explained, ""Swings have been determined to be the most unsafe of all the playground equipment on a playground.""

You may think your town has avoided such overkill, but is there a merry-go-round at your local park, or a see-saw? Most likely they, too, have gone the way of lawn darts. The Consumer Product Safety Commission even warns parks of ""tripping hazards, like…tree stumps and rocks,"" a fact unearthed (so to speak) by Philip Howard, author of 2010's Life Without Lawyers.

The problem is that kids learn by doing. Trip over a tree stump and you learn to look down. There's an old saying: Prepare your child for the path, not the path for your child. We're doing the opposite.

Ironically, there are real health dangers in not walking, or biking, or hopping over that stump. A Johns Hopkins study this summer found that the typical 19-year-old is as sedentary as a 65-year-old. The Army is worried that its recruits don't know how to skip or do somersaults.

But the cost of shielding kids from risks goes well beyond the physical, as a robust body of research has shown.

Of Trophies and Traumas

A few years ago, Boston College psychology professor emeritus Peter Gray was invited by the head of counseling services at a major university to a conference on ""the decline in resilience among students."" The organizer said that emergency counseling calls had doubled in the last five years. What's more, callers were seeking help coping with everyday problems, such as arguments with a roommate. Two students had dialed in because they'd found a mouse in their apartment. They also called the police, who came and set a mousetrap. And that's not to mention the sensitivity around grades. To some students, a B is the end of the world. (To some parents, too.)

Free play has little in common with the ""play"" we give children today. In organized activities, adults run the show. It's only when the grown-ups aren't around that the kids get to take over. Play is training for adulthood.

Part of the rise in calls could be attributed to the fact that admitting mental health issues no longer carries the stigma it once did, an undeniably positive development. But it could also be a sign, Gray realized, that failing at basic ""adulting"" no longer carries the stigma it once did. And that is far more troubling.

Is this outcome the apotheosis of participation-trophy culture? It's easy to scoff at a society that teaches kids that everything they do deserves applause. But more disturbing is the possibility that those trophies taught kids the opposite lesson: that they're so easily hurt, they can't handle the sad truth that they're not the best at something.

Not letting your kid climb a tree because he might fall robs him of a classic childhood experience. But being emotionally overprotective takes away something else. ""We have raised a generation of young people who have not been given the opportunity to…experience failure and realize they can survive it,"" Gray has said. When Lenore's son came in eighth out of nine teams in a summer camp bowling league, he got an eighth-place trophy. The moral was clear: We don't think you can cope with the negative emotions of finishing second-to-last.

Of course, it's natural to want to see kids happy. But the real secret to happiness isn't more high fives; it's developing emotional resilience. In our mania for physical safety, coupled with our recent tendency to talk about ""emotional safety,"" we have systematically deprived our children of the thousands of challenging—and sometimes upsetting—experiences that they need in order to learn that resiliency. And in our quest to protect them, we have stolen from children the best resilience training known to man: free play.

Play's the Thing

All mammals play. It is a drive installed by Mother Nature. Hippos do backflips in the water. Dogs fetch sticks. And gazelles run around, engaging in a game that looks an awful lot like tag.

Why would they do that? They're wasting valuable calories and exposing themselves to predators. Shouldn't they just sit quietly next to their mama gazelles, exploring the world through the magic of PBS Kids?

It must be because play is even more important to their long-term survival than simply being ""safe."" Gray's main body of research is on the importance of free play, and he stresses that it has little in common with the ""play"" we give kids today. In organized activities—Little League, for example—adults run the show. It's only when the grown-ups aren't around that the kids get to take over. Play is training for adulthood.

In free play, ideally with kids of mixed ages, the children decide what to do and how to do it. That's teamwork, literally. The little kids desperately want to be like the bigger kids, so instead of bawling when they strike out during a sandlot baseball game, they work hard to hold themselves together. This is the foundation of maturity.

The older kids, meanwhile, throw the ball more softly to the younger ones. They're learning empathy. And if someone yells, ""Let's play on just one leg!""—something they couldn't do at Little League, with championships (and trophies!) on the line—the kids discover what it means to come up with and try out a different way of doing things. In Silicon Valley terms, they ""pivot"" and adopt a ""new business model."" They also learn that they, not just grown-ups, can collectively remake the rules to suit their needs. That's called participatory democracy.

Best of all, without adults intervening, the kids have to do all the problem solving for themselves, from deciding what game to play to making sure the teams are roughly equal. Then, when there's an argument, they have to resolve it themselves. That's a tough skill to learn, but the drive to continue playing motivates them to work things out. To get back to having fun, they first have to come up with a solution, so they do. This teaches them that they can disagree, hash it out, and—perhaps with some grumbling—move on.

These are the very skills that are suddenly in short supply on college campuses.

""Free play is the means by which children learn to make friends, overcome their fears, solve their own problems and generally take control of their own lives,"" Gray writes in 2013's Free to Learn (Basic Books). ""Nothing we do, no amount of toys we buy or 'quality time' or special training we give our children, can compensate for the freedom we take away. The things that children learn through their own initiatives, in free play, cannot be taught in other ways.""

Unstructured, unsupervised time for play is one of the most important things we have to give back to kids if we want them to be strong and happy and resilient.

Where Have All the Paperboys Gone?

It's not just that kids aren't playing much on their own. These days, they're not doing much of anything on their own. In an article in The Atlantic, Hanna Rosin admits that ""when my daughter was 10, my husband and I suddenly realized that in her whole life, she had probably not spent more than 10 minutes unsupervised by an adult.""

In earlier generations, this would have seemed a bizarre and wildly overprotective upbringing. Society had certain age-related milestones that most people agreed on. Kids might be trusted to walk to school by first grade. They might get a latchkey at 8, take on a newspaper route around 10, start babysitting at 12. But over the past generation or so, those milestones disappeared—buried by fears of kidnapping, the rise of supervised activities, and the pre-eminence of homework. Parents today know all about the academic milestones their kids are supposed to reach, but not about the moments when kids used to start joining the world.

It's not necessarily their fault. Calls to eight newspapers in North Carolina found none that would take anyone under the age of 18 to deliver papers. A police chief in New Albany, Ohio, went on record saying kids shouldn't be outside on their own till age 16, ""the threshold where you see children getting a little bit more freedom."" A study in Britain found that while just under half of all 16- to 17-year-olds had jobs as recently as 1992, today that number is 20 percent.

The responsibility expected of kids not so long ago has become almost inconceivable. Published in 1979, the book Your 6-Year-old: Loving and Defiant includes a simple checklist for what a child entering first grade should be able to do: Can he draw and color and stay within the lines of the design being colored? Can he ride a small two-wheeled bicycle without helper wheels? Can he travel alone in the neighborhood (four to eight blocks) to a store, school, playground, or friend's home?

Hang on. Walk to the store at 6—alone?

It's tempting to blame ""helicopter parents"" for today's less resilient kids. But when all the first-graders are walking themselves to school, it's easy to add yours to the mix. When your child is the only one, it's harder. And that's where we are today. Norms have dramatically changed. The kind of freedom that seemed unremarkable a generation ago has become taboo, and in some cases even illegal.

A Very Hampered Halloween

In Waynesboro, Georgia, ""trick or treaters"" must be 12 or younger; they must be in a costume; and they must be accompanied by an adult at least 21 years of age. So if you have kids who are 15, 10, and 8, you can't send them out together. The 15-year-old is not allowed to dress up, yet she won't be considered old enough to supervise her siblings for another six years. And this is on the one night of the entire year we traditionally let children pretend to be adults.

Other schools and community centers now send letters home asking parents not to let their children wear scary costumes. Some even organize ""trunk or treats""—cars parked in a circle, trunks open and filled with candy, thus saving the kids from having to walk around the neighborhood or knock on doors. (That would be tiring and terrifying.) If this is childhood, is it any wonder college kids also expect to be micromanaged on Halloween?

At Yale in 2015, after 13 college administrators signed a letter outlining appropriate vs. inappropriate costume choices for students, the childhood development expert and campus lecturer Erika Christakis suggested that it would be better to allow kids to think for themselves. After all, Halloween is supposed to be about pushing boundaries. ""Is there no room anymore for a child or young person to be a little obnoxious…or, yes, offensive?"" she wrote. ""Have we lost faith in young people's capacity—your capacity—to ignore or reject things that trouble you?""

Apparently, yes. Angry students mobbed her husband, the professor Nicholas Christakis, surrounding him in the courtyard of the residential college where he served as master. They screamed obscenities and demanded he apologize for believing, along with his wife, that college students are in fact capable of handling offensive costumes on Halloween. ""Be quiet!"" a student shouted at him at one point. ""As master, it is your job to create a place of comfort and home for the students!"" She did not take kindly to his response that, to the contrary, he sees it as his job to create a space where students can grow intellectually.

As it turns out, Halloween is the perfect Petri dish for observing what we have done to childhood. We didn't think anything was safe enough for young people. And now we are witnessing the results.

No Fun and No Joy

When parents curtail their kids' independence, they're not just depriving the younglings of childhood fun. They are denying themselves the grown-up joy of seeing their kids do something smart, brave, or kind without parental guidance.

It's the kind of joy described by a Washington Post columnist who answered the phone one day and was shocked to find her 8-year-old son on the other end. He'd accidentally gone home when he was supposed to stay after school. Realizing she wasn't there, he decided to walk to the store a few blocks away—his first time. The mom raced over, fearing God knows what, and rushed in only to find her son happily helping the shopkeeper stock the shelves with meat. He'd had a snack and done his homework, too. It was an afternoon he'd never forget, and neither would his very proud mother.

When we don't let our kids do anything on their own, we don't get to see just how competent they can be—and isn't that, ultimately, the greatest reward of parenting? We need to make it easier for grown-ups to let go while living in a society that keeps warning them not to. And we need to make sure they won't get arrested for it.

What Is To Be Done?

By trying to keep children safe from all risks, obstacles, hurt feelings, and fears, our culture has taken away the opportunities they need to become successful adults. In treating them as fragile—emotionally, socially, and physically—society actually makes them so.

To combat this problem, we have established a new nonpartisan nonprofit, the Let Grow Foundation. Our goal is to restore resilience by overthrowing the culture of overprotection. We teamed up with Gray, the professor whose research we highlighted above, and FIRE's Shuchman, a New York investment fund manager who is now our chairman.

We are building an organization that seeks to change the social norms, policies, and laws that pressure and intimidate parents, schools, and towns into coddling their kids. We will research the effects of excessive caution, study the link between independence and success, and launch projects to give kids back some free time and free play. Most of all, the Let Grow Foundation will reject the assumption of fragility and promote intellectual, physical, and emotional resilience.

Children know that their parents had more freedom to roam than they do, and more unscheduled time to read or tinker or explore. They also realize that older generations were trusted to roll with some punches, at school and beyond. We hope kids today will start demanding that same independence and respect for themselves. It's their freedom that has been chiseled away, after all.

We want them to insist on their right to engage not just with the physical world, but also with the world of ideas. We want them to hear, read, and voice opinions that go against the grain. We want them to be insulted by the assumption that they and their classmates are so easily hurt that arguments must stop before they start. To this end, we hope to encourage their skepticism about the programs and policies that are ostensibly there to ""protect"" them from discomfort.

If this effort is successful, we'll soon see kids outside again. Common setbacks will be considered ""resilience moments"" rather than traumas. Children will read widely, express themselves freely, and work through disagreements without automatically calling on authority figures to solve their problems for them. The more adults step back, the more we believe kids will step up, growing brave in the face of risk and just plain happy in their independence.

Children today are safer and smarter than this culture gives them credit for. They deserve the freedom we had. The country's future prosperity and freedom depend on it.",www.reason.com,right,yuf619rIC1hs93EG

Developments over the weekend ""shifted the trajectory"" of the investigation into the Jan. 29 attack on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett.

The actor told police last month he was attacked in Chicago in the early hours of the morning by two masked men who shouted ""racial and homophobic slurs."" Police said Smollett described the assailants punching him in the face, pouring a chemical on him and wrapping a rope around his neck.

Police are still waiting to hear from the actor regarding a follow-up interview so they can ask him questions relating to the claim of two brothers who say they were paid by the actor to orchestrate the attack.

Here are the most recent developments in the case:

On Sunday, Guglielmi confirmed that detectives had requested a follow-up interview with the actor, tweeting, ""There are some developments in this investigation and detectives have some follow-ups to complete which include speaking to the individual who reported the incident.""

Pamela Sharp, Smollett’s spokeswoman, issued a statement to USA TODAY Monday from her client's attorneys, Todd S. Pugh and Victor P. Henderson, who said Smollett had no plans to meet with authorities that day.

“There are no plans for Jussie Smollett to meet with Chicago police today,"" the statement read. ""Any news reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. Smollett's attorneys will keep an active dialogue going with Chicago police on his behalf. We have no further comment today.”

Fox rejects theory Smollett staged attack to avoid being written off 'Empire'

In a statement issued late Thursday, the network shot down a story by ABC7 Chicago alleging the actor was trying to garner sympathy to convince the network not to write him off the show.

""The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of 'Empire' is patently ridiculous,"" the network told USA TODAY Thursday. ""He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.""

Backlash grows

In a lengthy interview with ""Good Morning America"" host Robin Roberts Thursday, Smollett spoke of his frustration not just with his assailants but those who have attacked him in the press and on social media, saying that they not only ""don't believe this is the truth"" but ""don't even want to see this is the truth.""

However, his doubters grew louder over the weekend following the announcement that the police are now actively investigating the hoax angle.

Former Obama strategist David Axelrod summed up the fears of many Sunday when he tweeted, ""The racist/homophobic attack @JussieSmollett alleged was horrific. But if this story turns out to be a hoax, orchestrated by Smollett to boost his career, he will have cynically betrayed supporters across the country.""

REGARDLESS OF SMOLLETT: Crimes against blacks, gays are up, according to FBI (Jan. 31)

Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr. went after Smollett, whom he said ""tried to manufacture a hate crime"" to make his father's supporters look bad and the media who, ""not only uncritically accepted his lies as facts for weeks, but attacked those who questioned the validity of his false story."" He also took aim at 2020 Democratic contender Sen. Kamala Harris and various ""Hollywood and media types,"" asking if they still wanted ""#JusticeforJussie.""

Director Ava DuVernay said Sunday that despite any inconsistencies in Smollett's story, she ""can't blindly believe the Chicago PD"" given its handling of Laquan McDonald's shooting death and its past use of torture.

""He might have lied. He might not have. I don’t know. But what I do know?"" the ""Wrinkle in Time"" director wrote. ""I never believe police on general principle just ‘cause they say so. My experience, our history, makes it impossible for me to do so.""

Dear Reader ( Including those poor benighted souls who think hot dogs are sandwiches ) ,
When I was a youngish teenager , I went to the bank one day . ( This was pre-ATM machines , kids . ) I stood in line behind a very old , very properly dressed white lady , complete with the sort of fancy hat that I still don ’ t know the proper name for . When she got to the teller , I didn ’ t pay attention at first but , very quickly , my ears perked up .
She earned my attention because this prim old woman was passionately raining racial epithets at the bank teller , who was an Asian-American woman . I have no idea what the bank teller ’ s specific ethnicity was . But the old lady seemed to roam the waterfront between “ nips , ” “ gooks , ” “ slants , ” etc .
“ You damn gooks killed my husband and my son ! ” I distinctly remember her saying . The whole thing was shocking to me , and to everyone else at the bank . The teller handled it very well , as did the manager who ushered the obviously distraught woman out of the bank as quickly as possible .
The old lady was wrong to do what she did . She may have had plenty of rationalizations and explanations for why she tormented that young woman — but none of them added up to an excuse .
I haven ’ t thought of that incident in years , but it came back to me when I read this defense of Sarah Jeong in the Washington Post on Friday morning :
“ Part of the reason it was so easy for the outrage to be manufactured in the first place was it was completely decontextualized and ahistorified , ” said Nolan L. Cabrera , an associate professor at the University of Arizona who will publish a book in the fall about racial attitudes held by white college students . “ Then it was easy to drum up anger and say it looks like she hates white people . That only makes sense if you are willfully ignorant of 400 to 500 years ’ history and contemporary social context and also the context from which the tweets were sent . ”
It seems to me that the old lady at the bank had more “ reason ” to hate Asians than Jeong has to hate white people . But the simple fact remains that the individual American of Asian descent that the old lady at the bank attacked didn ’ t do anything wrong .
Sometimes I am well and truly baffled about why this sort of thing is so complicated . I mean , it ’ s not that the Left doesn ’ t understand my point .
For instance , when an Islamic terrorist murders people , there ’ s an instant rush to fret over and condemn any sort of “ anti-Muslim backlash. ” Never mind that such backlashes have been vastly rarer than we ’ re usually told , the principle is correct : It is wrong to blame innocent Muslims for the things other Muslims did .
Or just think about how much ink has been spilled arguing that it is unfair and unjust to assume that one black youth is a criminal or a threat just because he resembles in some way a negative stereotype . I ’ m not mocking this argument ; I am agreeing with it .
As I ’ ve been saying until I ’ m blue in the face on my book tour , one of the greatest things about this country is the ideal — always in tension with the lesser devils of our natures — that says we should take people as we find them . My objection to identity politics is that it reduces millions of people to a single attribute or grievance . It assumes that , simply by accident of birth , some people are more noble or more evil than others .
If you think that all you need to know about an African-American person to size up his character or humanity is his skin color , then you ’ re a racist . Imagine some guy named Joe emerges from a block of ice and is trying to catch up on the news by talking to the first person he meets , David .
It shouldn ’ t take a genius to see that David ’ s a pretty hardcore racist .
You can run similar thought experiments about virtually any group . If all you need to know about Oscar Wilde is that he was a gay dude , just like Richard Simmons or Milo what ’ s-his-name , you ’ re a bigot . If Meyer Lansky and Albert Einstein are merely two Jews to you , you ’ re an anti-Semite . If Margaret Thatcher , Joan of Arc , and Lizzie Borden are just three chicks , you ’ re a sexist .
And again , historically , this is mostly a left-wing or liberal ( both in the classical and modern senses of the word ) insight . But for some bizarre reason , for many people , this idea evaporates like water off a hot skillet when you replace any of these categories with “ white ” or , very often , “ male . ”
Suddenly fancy words and phrases fly like sawdust from a wood chipper : “ structures of oppression ! ” “ decontextualized ! ” “ ahistoricized ! ” etc . It ’ s all so clever and complicated . The same people who take to the streets at the slightest suggestion that Muslims can be judged by the evil deeds of other Muslims will lecture and harangue you for hours , mob you on Twitter , or condescendingly dismiss you for not understanding that all white people have it coming .
I am not denying the history of white racism in America . I ’ m more than eager to acknowledge it . But what these people are basically saying is that you can say bigoted things about all white people based on things other white people have done . And spare me the argument that some 70-hour-a-week truck driver in Appalachia has it coming because he ’ s a grand beneficiary of white supremacy .
Again , the old lady at the bank had a historically grounded reason to be bigoted against people of Asian descent . If we take the gobbledygook about “ personal truth ” even remotely seriously — and I ’ m not saying we should — she has a better set of grievances against Asians than Sarah Jeong has against whites , including against the bigots who trolled her , or , for that matter , than Ta-Nehisi Coates has against whites . ( Coates ’ s one example of personal grievance in his book boils down to a white woman being rude to his son in an elevator . )
The upshot of almost all the defenses of anti-white rhetoric boil down to an argument about power .
A lot of people on the internet today confusing the expressive way anti-racists and minorities talk about `` white people '' with actual race-based hatred , for some unfathomable reason — Zack Beauchamp ( @ zackbeauchamp ) August 2 , 2018
Dear white people : 1 . Racism is abt the powerful keeping down the powerless 2 . We ( generally ) are the powerful 3 . `` White ppl '' is n't a slur 4 . `` Fag '' and the N word are slurs , because they subordinate 5 . Your moral equivalence is nonsense 6 . `` Reverse racism '' is n't a thing — David S. Joachim ( @ davidjoachim ) August 2 , 2018
the sarah jeong stuff is a fun reminder that white people like to see racism as a question manners rather than like , reflecting institutional power — Graham MacAree ( @ MacAree ) August 2 , 2018
I don ’ t think all of these arguments are ridiculous . There is a serious argument that white racism is different contextually from , say , black racism . What I ’ m saying is that these people are ridiculously changing the argument in order to justify glib bigotry .
It is likely true , as many have pointed out , that if any minority group were substituted in the place of white people into Jeong ’ s statements , she would not have kept her job . Some edited Jeong ’ s tweets to hammer home that idea , replacing the words “ white people ” in her tweets with “ black people ” and “ Jewish people. ” But Cabrera said the idea was “ a complete false equivalence , ” noting that whiteness isn ’ t a cultural identity the way being black , Japanese American or Jewish is . . . . “ You hear that all the time : Substitute white and put in minority group x , ” Cabrera said . “ The term ‘ racism ’ is not the equivalence of prejudice or bigotry . It ’ s an analysis of social inequality along the color lines and an analysis of power dynamics and social oppression . None of which has ever been in the hands of people of color or communities of color : There ’ s never been the social structure to be able to oppress white people . ”
Culture and history are indeed complicated and complex . We invest different values and frequencies in different historical narratives and events . For many Jews , the constant analogies to the Holocaust that proliferate in contemporary debates are grotesque , because they belittle the unique evil of the Holocaust ( we ’ re not marching Central American children to gas chambers ) .
For instance , I have nothing but sympathy for Ukrainians who bemoan that the Holodomor doesn ’ t have a fraction of the cultural power of the Holocaust . But a couple of points need to be made . It ’ s an entirely valid view , certainly from a Jewish perspective , that the Holocaust was “ worse ” than the Holodomor ( and vice versa ) . But arguing that the Holocaust was “ worse ” than the Holodomor is not an argument for saying that the forced starvation of millions of Ukrainians ( and the deliberate erasure of so much of their history ) wasn ’ t profoundly evil , too . Family separation at the border can be really bad without rising to the level of Auschwitz .
If you want to say that white racism is worse than black , or Asian , or Hispanic anti-white racism , that ’ s a fine argument as far as I ’ m concerned . What I can ’ t get my head around is the supplemental argument : that anti-white racism is just fine , if not something to encourage .
Similarly , the conservative argument against double standards sometimes misses this point . The point needn ’ t be that all forms of racism or bigotry are equally bad . The point is that all forms of racism and bigotry are bad , even if some are worse than others .
Last , if you ’ re going to claim that racism is solely about power and structures of oppression , then you ’ re going to need to come up with another word for what most non-woke academics and social-justice warriors mean by racism . In other words , if black people can ’ t be racist , can we say that a black person can hate white people ? No ? Why not ?
But identity-politics leftists don ’ t want to find that word . They want to have their cake and eat it too , claiming it ’ s always fine for them to be bigots because white people are just different . That is simply , structurally , historically , and logically a racist — sorry , “ bigoted ” — argument . “ Oh , I ’ m very open-minded , I just think all Jews ( or blacks , or Aborigines , or whatever ) are different . ”
But there ’ s a bigger problem . The social science is mounting every day that the more often people make these arguments , the more they are making white people think of themselves as white people . Please read this essay by Shari Berman , no screaming right-winger , in the Guardian . Berman writes :
Rather than being directly translated into behavior , psychologists tell us beliefs can remain latent until “ triggered ” . In a fascinating study , Karen Stenner shows in The Authoritarian Dynamic that while some individuals have “ predispositions ” towards intolerance , these predispositions require an external stimulus to be transformed into actions . Or , as another scholar puts it : “ It ’ s as though some people have a button on their foreheads , and when the button is pushed , they suddenly become intensely focused on defending their in-group . . . . But when they perceive no such threat , their behavior is not unusually intolerant . So the key is to understand what pushes that button. ” What pushes that button , Stenner and others find , is group-based threats . In experiments researchers easily shift individuals from indifference , even modest tolerance , to aggressive defenses of their own group by exposing them to such threats . Maureen Craig and Jennifer Richeson , for example , found that simply making white Americans aware that they would soon be a minority increased their propensity to favor their own group and become wary of those outside it . ( Similar effects were found among Canadians . Indeed , although this tendency is most dangerous among whites since they are the most powerful group in western societies , researchers have consistently found such propensities in all groups . )
Liberals despise any argument that claims that they are part of the reason we “ got Trump. ” But for decades now , numerous liberals have acted like members of a cult awaiting the fulfillment of a demographic prophecy that , one day soon , whites will be a minority in this country . When that happens , various versions of this prophecy foretell , white power and culture will be wiped away . This analysis has always been deeply flawed on a number of fronts , but that ’ s a topic for another day . My point here is that the rhetoric associated with this hope is profoundly dangerous because it flips the switch on whites to suddenly see themselves as white . As I discuss in my book , economic issues had far less to do with Trump ’ s success than feelings of cultural displacement . And Trump ’ s margin of victory stemmed in large part from triggering or activating many voters who invest large parts of their identity in being white .
You can come up with as many polysyllabic explanations as you like for why it ’ s okay for you to mock , demonize , or ridicule white people . You can prattle on to your Ph.D. adviser ’ s content about how whiteness is a social construct that needs to be dismantled . But maybe you should have the simple decency and common sense to understand that many people won ’ t see it that way , because the net effect of your “ counter-trolling ” is that it leads to the opposite of your stated goal : You are making white people feel threatened , and , as a result , you ’ re making at least some of them more racist . You are making whiteness a thing . And you are blaming today ’ s white people for things they never did . Just as the old lady at the bank did to that poor bank teller .

Dear Reader (Including those poor benighted souls who think hot dogs are sandwiches),

When I was a youngish teenager, I went to the bank one day. (This was pre-ATM machines, kids.) I stood in line behind a very old, very properly dressed white lady, complete with the sort of fancy hat that I still don’t know the proper name for.

She earned my attention because this prim old woman was passionately raining racial epithets at the bank teller, who was an Asian-American woman. I have no idea what the bank teller’s specific ethnicity was. But the old lady seemed to roam the waterfront between “nips,” “gooks,” “slants,” etc.

“You damn gooks killed my husband and my son!” I distinctly remember her saying. The whole thing was shocking to me, and to everyone else at the bank. The teller handled it very well, as did the manager who ushered the obviously distraught woman out of the bank as quickly as possible.

What’s the point of this story?

The old lady was wrong to do what she did. She may have had plenty of rationalizations and explanations for why she tormented that young woman — but none of them added up to an excuse.

It’s Okay When We Do It

I haven’t thought of that incident in years, but it came back to me when I read this defense of Sarah Jeong in the Washington Post on Friday morning:

“Part of the reason it was so easy for the outrage to be manufactured in the first place was it was completely decontextualized and ahistorified,” said Nolan L. Cabrera, an associate professor at the University of Arizona who will publish a book in the fall about racial attitudes held by white college students. “Then it was easy to drum up anger and say it looks like she hates white people.

It seems to me that the old lady at the bank had more “reason” to hate Asians than Jeong has to hate white people. But the simple fact remains that the individual American of Asian descent that the old lady at the bank attacked didn’t do anything wrong.

Bigotry for Thee, Justice for Me

Sometimes I am well and truly baffled about why this sort of thing is so complicated. I mean, it’s not that the Left doesn’t understand my point.

For instance, when an Islamic terrorist murders people, there’s an instant rush to fret over and condemn any sort of “anti-Muslim backlash.” Never mind that such backlashes have been vastly rarer than we’re usually told, the principle is correct: It is wrong to blame innocent Muslims for the things other Muslims did.

If you think that all you need to know about an African-American person to size up his character or humanity is his skin color, then you’re a racist. Imagine some guy named Joe emerges from a block of ice and is trying to catch up on the news by talking to the first person he meets, David.

Joe: “Who is Barack Obama?”

David: “Oh, he’s a black guy.”

Joe: “Who’s Thomas Sowell?”

David: “Another black guy.”

Joe: “Who’s O. J. Simpson?”

David: “Black guy.”

Joe: “And this Willie Horton fella?”

David: “Typical black guy.”

It shouldn’t take a genius to see that David’s a pretty hardcore racist.

You can run similar thought experiments about virtually any group. If all you need to know about Oscar Wilde is that he was a gay dude, just like Richard Simmons or Milo what’s-his-name, you’re a bigot.

A zebra can’t change its stripes, but a donkey can

This purchase is a head scratcher. And a head cutter

I’ll take a large coffee with cream and sugar and no cleaning fluid

What if Earth turned into a giant blueberry?

Guard pig foils robbery

The world’s largest cheeseboard

What zip codes stand for

A solid in-vest-ment

One of the few pieces of good news about the coronavirus — which has caused more than 100,000 deaths worldwide — is that children , though not immune , appear to face substantially less risk of developing severe symptoms .
A decreased threat from infection does not mean that kids are protected from the impacts of the virus . Like everyone else , their lives have been upended by social distancing measures aimed at controlling the outbreak . Schools have closed , activities have been canceled and in-person visits with friends have been put on pause .
The lockdown has imposed an unprecedented social experiment on the country ’ s children that could have lingering effects long after the pandemic has been contained .
The isolation caused by stay-at-home orders has caused a spike in mental health challenges among adults , especially those with preexisting conditions . The impact that social distancing has on kids is less understood . In some ways children are particularly vulnerable to the trauma of having their lives turned upside down because their social lives are so reliant on school and other activities . Depending on their age , missing out on daily interactions with peers and teachers can stunt their emotional and social development , child psychologists say . Children may not fully understand the details of what ’ s happening but can grasp the fear and stress they witness around them .
Research on kids who experienced traumatic events like Hurricane Katrina and the 2008 financial collapse suggests the emotional weight can stay with them for many years . The impact will likely vary significantly based on a child ’ s situation . School-age children and adolescents are likely to be affected the most , experts say . Children in unstable home situations are particularly vulnerable .
While some kids will certainly struggle through this period , parents shouldn ’ t assume their own children are destined to be traumatized by social distancing , child development experts say . Research shows that children can be extremely resilient when faced with changes in their lives . There also may be some positive impacts . Kids learn important skills like the ability to adapt , creativity and persistence when forced into imperfect circumstances , experts say . Time at home can also promote important connections with parents and siblings that can have a lasting positive effect on children .
Some experts believe the duration of the lockdown will matter significantly in how kids are able to cope . A few weeks of isolation may not have much of an effect , but months of extended isolation could be problematic . It ’ s unclear how long social distancing measures might be required , but lawmakers in some parts of the country have begun discussing plans for how best to reopen normal activities .
Children are experiencing the same level of trauma as adults
“ If the world has learned anything in the past week , it ’ s that mortality is only one risk of this crisis . ... This is likely a once-in-a-generation disaster , and it will affect every domain of human life . It will be traumatic . And trauma always falls hardest on the youngest among us. ” — Vann R. Newkirk II , Atlantic
“ Children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to stress created by news media coverage of negative events and frightening rhetoric . Parents and other close adults serve as models for how children and youth will react , even if those adults don ’ t recognize or want that responsibility . If adults around them are panicking , young people are likely to do so as well. ” — Ralph Cash , South Florida Sun-Sentinel
“ The kids who are likely to suffer the most are in late childhood and adolescence . Young children are learning the basics of being social beings , and their parents and siblings can provide most of the input they need , while older children and adolescents are learning to navigate complex social groups of peers. ” — Developmental psychologist Amy Learmonth to Healthline","“The 360” shows you diverse perspectives on the day’s top stories and debates.

What’s happening

One of the few pieces of good news about the coronavirus — which has caused more than 100,000 deaths worldwide — is that children, though not immune, appear to face substantially less risk of developing severe symptoms.

A decreased threat from infection does not mean that kids are protected from the impacts of the virus. Like everyone else, their lives have been upended by social distancing measures aimed at controlling the outbreak. Schools have closed, activities have been canceled and in-person visits with friends have been put on pause.

The lockdown has imposed an unprecedented social experiment on the country’s children that could have lingering effects long after the pandemic has been contained.

Why there’s debate

The isolation caused by stay-at-home orders has caused a spike in mental health challenges among adults, especially those with preexisting conditions. The impact that social distancing has on kids is less understood. In some ways children are particularly vulnerable to the trauma of having their lives turned upside down because their social lives are so reliant on school and other activities. Depending on their age, missing out on daily interactions with peers and teachers can stunt their emotional and social development, child psychologists say. Children may not fully understand the details of what’s happening but can grasp the fear and stress they witness around them.

Research on kids who experienced traumatic events like Hurricane Katrina and the 2008 financial collapse suggests the emotional weight can stay with them for many years. The impact will likely vary significantly based on a child’s situation. School-age children and adolescents are likely to be affected the most, experts say. Children in unstable home situations are particularly vulnerable.

While some kids will certainly struggle through this period, parents shouldn’t assume their own children are destined to be traumatized by social distancing, child development experts say. Research shows that children can be extremely resilient when faced with changes in their lives. There also may be some positive impacts. Kids learn important skills like the ability to adapt, creativity and persistence when forced into imperfect circumstances, experts say. Time at home can also promote important connections with parents and siblings that can have a lasting positive effect on children.

What’s next

Some experts believe the duration of the lockdown will matter significantly in how kids are able to cope. A few weeks of isolation may not have much of an effect, but months of extended isolation could be problematic. It’s unclear how long social distancing measures might be required, but lawmakers in some parts of the country have begun discussing plans for how best to reopen normal activities.

Perspectives

Challenges

Children are experiencing the same level of trauma as adults

“If the world has learned anything in the past week, it’s that mortality is only one risk of this crisis. ...This is likely a once-in-a-generation disaster, and it will affect every domain of human life. It will be traumatic. And trauma always falls hardest on the youngest among us.” — Vann R. Newkirk II, Atlantic

Kids internalize the stress they see around them

“Children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to stress created by news media coverage of negative events and frightening rhetoric. Parents and other close adults serve as models for how children and youth will react, even if those adults don’t recognize or want that responsibility. If adults around them are panicking, young people are likely to do so as well.” — Ralph Cash, South Florida Sun-Sentinel

School-age children face the most significant challenges

“The kids who are likely to suffer the most are in late childhood and adolescence. Young children are learning the basics of being social beings, and their parents and siblings can provide most of the input they need, while older children and adolescents are learning to navigate complex social groups of peers.” — Developmental psychologist Amy Learmonth to Healthline",www.news.yahoo.com,center,aFiIw8kPlyh8d2M8

culture,American Spectator,2,https://spectator.org/the-lefts-collusion-with-harvey-weinstein/,The Left’s Collusion with Harvey Weinstein,,"George Neumayr, E. Donald Elliott, Geoff Shepard, J.T. Young, John C. Wohlstetter","The fleshy , repellent , sinister look of Harvey Weinstein , akin to the brutal indifference on the face of an overfed badger before devouring his prey , is proof of the unity between body and soul . If beauty adorns virtue , ugliness adorns vice .
The horror stories about Weinstein continue to multiply and now include tales of criminal flashing and sexual assault . Out of the mushrooming scandal has come a blast of dirt , from which particles are settling on top officials in the Democratic Party , starting with the Clintons and the Obamas .
Pundit Frank Rich wonders why such “ exemplary parents ” as the Obamas would dispatch their daughter to intern with Harvey Weinstein . He calls this a “ mystery , ” given that many knew about Weinstein ’ s loutishness . But what exactly is the mystery ? The Obamas had the coziest of relationships with corrupt Hollywood . Before they had their daughter intern with Weinstein , they thought it “ cool ” to send her off to hang out on the set of the outré HBO show Girls . They considered that a morally formative experience too .
Having spent so much time hobnobbing with stars in the libertine , boundary-defying world of Hollywood and debauched Palm Springs ( the first stop after the Obamas left office , with kids in tow ) , they were no doubt loath to shun Harvey Weinstein . Besides , he and his cronies had given them so much money . And was he , they probably asked themselves , really any different from that old lunger Ted Kennedy , whose early support clinched Obama ’ s primary victories in 2008 ?
The friendship between the Clintons and Weinstein isn ’ t a mystery either . Naturally , Hillary , usually quick off the draw on Twitter about current events , fell silent over the weekend . Weinstein had hosted countless birthday parties and fundraisers for her . Bill Clinton and Harvey Weinstein were of course boon companions , with Bill showing his esteem in among other ways by letting the mogul interview him on CNN and confer upon him awards at LGBT events .
Still , the revelations have put them in an annoyingly awkward spot . In due course , they will all release carefully worded condemnations of Weinstein , with the possible exception of Bill , who may follow the example of the taciturn Ted Kennedy at the Clarence Thomas hearings and maintain a prudent silence .
It appears that some of the silence , especially in Hollywood circles , is due to doubts about whether or not the monster is dead . SNL ‘ s Lorne Michaels , who has become every inch of the rich phony his show is supposed to skewer , killed any jokes about Weinstein on the unconvincing grounds that Americans didn ’ t care about a “ New York thing. ” The more likely explanation is that he didn ’ t want to offend a powerful peer to whom he owed innumerable favors . Other hosts , dependent on the good graces of the brothers gross at the Weinstein Company for guests , also shied away from any jokes , as they waited to see if the monster was dead .
Meanwhile , big liberal stars are playing dumb about Weinstein ’ s widely known goatish reputation . Meryl Streep had her platoon of publicists craft a wooden statement denying any knowledge of her patron ’ s misdeeds . St. Streep wanted it known that she stood with “ the women , ” but primarily she sought to inoculate herself from the scandal . Judi Dench also issued a wooden statement . Weinstein used to brag that Dench had his initials “ tattooed on her ass ” ( such was her gratitude to him for launching so many of her movies ) . Maybe Dench will bill the Weinstein Company for tattoo removal .
Streep ’ s protestations of ignorance would make her the least informed member of Hollywood . Was her entourage too busy researching Trump to inform her that she was working with a creep ? A who ’ s who of female stars , from Paltrow to Jolie , are now coming forward to say Weinstein harassed them . Did Streep never talk to them ? She is some mentor to the younger generation of female stars .
The dirt slide coming off the mountainous Weinstein is tripping up a slew of liberal phonies : from Gloria Allred ’ s money-grubbing daughter Lisa Bloom ( who served as Weinstein ’ s feminist beard ) to Clinton apologist Lanny Davis to the Mao-admiring Obama aide Anita Dunn . Then there are the abortion champions who took Weinstein ’ s money to set up this or that bogus program , with which Weinstein hoped to wash his sins .
In the blood of Planned Parenthood , he sought atonement , and in the righteous and enlightened company of the Obamas he hoped to come clean — a fitting end to the Hollywood sham of virtue-signaling without virtue .","The fleshy, repellent, sinister look of Harvey Weinstein, akin to the brutal indifference on the face of an overfed badger before devouring his prey, is proof of the unity between body and soul. If beauty adorns virtue, ugliness adorns vice.

The horror stories about Weinstein continue to multiply and now include tales of criminal flashing and sexual assault. Out of the mushrooming scandal has come a blast of dirt, from which particles are settling on top officials in the Democratic Party, starting with the Clintons and the Obamas.

Pundit Frank Rich wonders why such “exemplary parents” as the Obamas would dispatch their daughter to intern with Harvey Weinstein. He calls this a “mystery,” given that many knew about Weinstein’s loutishness. But what exactly is the mystery? The Obamas had the coziest of relationships with corrupt Hollywood. Before they had their daughter intern with Weinstein, they thought it “cool” to send her off to hang out on the set of the outré HBO show Girls. They considered that a morally formative experience too.

Having spent so much time hobnobbing with stars in the libertine, boundary-defying world of Hollywood and debauched Palm Springs (the first stop after the Obamas left office, with kids in tow), they were no doubt loath to shun Harvey Weinstein. Besides, he and his cronies had given them so much money. And was he, they probably asked themselves, really any different from that old lunger Ted Kennedy, whose early support clinched Obama’s primary victories in 2008?

The friendship between the Clintons and Weinstein isn’t a mystery either. Naturally, Hillary, usually quick off the draw on Twitter about current events, fell silent over the weekend. Weinstein had hosted countless birthday parties and fundraisers for her. Bill Clinton and Harvey Weinstein were of course boon companions, with Bill showing his esteem in among other ways by letting the mogul interview him on CNN and confer upon him awards at LGBT events.

Still, the revelations have put them in an annoyingly awkward spot. In due course, they will all release carefully worded condemnations of Weinstein, with the possible exception of Bill, who may follow the example of the taciturn Ted Kennedy at the Clarence Thomas hearings and maintain a prudent silence.

It appears that some of the silence, especially in Hollywood circles, is due to doubts about whether or not the monster is dead. SNL‘s Lorne Michaels, who has become every inch of the rich phony his show is supposed to skewer, killed any jokes about Weinstein on the unconvincing grounds that Americans didn’t care about a “New York thing.” The more likely explanation is that he didn’t want to offend a powerful peer to whom he owed innumerable favors. Other hosts, dependent on the good graces of the brothers gross at the Weinstein Company for guests, also shied away from any jokes, as they waited to see if the monster was dead.

Meanwhile, big liberal stars are playing dumb about Weinstein’s widely known goatish reputation. Meryl Streep had her platoon of publicists craft a wooden statement denying any knowledge of her patron’s misdeeds. St. Streep wanted it known that she stood with “the women,” but primarily she sought to inoculate herself from the scandal. Judi Dench also issued a wooden statement. Weinstein used to brag that Dench had his initials “tattooed on her ass” (such was her gratitude to him for launching so many of her movies). Maybe Dench will bill the Weinstein Company for tattoo removal.

Streep’s protestations of ignorance would make her the least informed member of Hollywood. Was her entourage too busy researching Trump to inform her that she was working with a creep? A who’s who of female stars, from Paltrow to Jolie, are now coming forward to say Weinstein harassed them. Did Streep never talk to them? She is some mentor to the younger generation of female stars.

The dirt slide coming off the mountainous Weinstein is tripping up a slew of liberal phonies: from Gloria Allred’s money-grubbing daughter Lisa Bloom (who served as Weinstein’s feminist beard) to Clinton apologist Lanny Davis to the Mao-admiring Obama aide Anita Dunn. Then there are the abortion champions who took Weinstein’s money to set up this or that bogus program, with which Weinstein hoped to wash his sins.

One of the first great medicines of the antibiotic era , sulfanilamide was a miracle drug at a time when curing pneumonia with a quick trip to the pharmacy seemed akin to walking on water . When a sweet , raspberry-flavored liquid version appeared in stores in early September of 1937 , it was a no-brainer prescription for doctors whose sick young patients were still picky enough they might reject even Jesus himself if he returned in the form of a bitter-tasting pill .
By the end of October , more than 100 of those patients had died and regulators were scrambling to figure out why .
All of this has happened before , and all of this will happen again . Today , medical experts and federal regulators are struggling to understand a mysterious lung disease linked to the use of electronic cigarettes . As of Sept. 17 , 530 people have been diagnosed across the country , seven of whom have died . Neither the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention nor the Food and Drug Administration can definitively say what is causing the illness or why a device that was supposed to help people stop smoking cancer-causing cigarettes has , itself , turned deadly .
Regardless of why e-cigs have turned toxic , historians and consumer law advocates see lessons in the sulfanilamide disaster of 1937 — ones that go beyond the obvious surface similarities of poisonous , fruit-flavored liquids . Both cases highlight the way consumer protections in this country are reactive , cropping up in response to disease and death , rather than preventing it .
“ There ’ s insanely heartbreaking letters from these doctors who had prescribed [ sulfanilamide elixir ] and then watched kids die , ” said Deborah Blum , author of “ The Poison Squad , ” a book about the founding of the FDA . Those deaths were painful and prolonged , stretching out over days and weeks of convulsions , nausea , kidney failure and stupor . “ No one had any idea what was going on . The FDA was desperately sending scientists around the country , ” she told me .
Eventually , a Kansas City FDA inspector confirmed that eight children and one adult who died in his area had all taken the same medication , prepared by S.E . Massengill Co. , based in Tennessee . Chemists broke the concoction down , molecule by molecule , and discovered that Massengill had blended its antibiotic with diethylene glycol . In other words , it had taken medicine and raspberry flavoring and mixed it up with antifreeze .
A similarly desperate cross-country investigation is happening now with the vaping-related lung deaths , but pinning down a cause is proving harder in this case . There ’ s no tell-tale chemical turning up in every sample . Eighty-four percent of the 53 patients whose cases were reported in a study published by the New England Journal of Medicine did admit to using e-cigarette pods that contained THC , the chemical in pot that gets you high . But that ’ s a small and geographically isolated sampling . Other than vaping , itself , there ’ s no single behavior all the victims share . There ’ s no Massengill in our modern story , no single company glowing ominously like a lit cigarette in a dark alley .
More frustratingly , said Anne Schuchat , principal deputy director of the CDC , there are several reasons why patients might not be giving doctors an accurate account of what they ’ ve used and how . Some are too sick . Some might not want to talk to the government about their THC use . The state of Illinois has begun an anonymous survey of healthy e-cigarette users , hoping to spot some differences between the people who have gotten sick and those who haven ’ t .

Lots of people are making and selling e-liquids and some of them are amateurs , working off the books . That ’ s especially true of liquids containing THC .
But this isn ’ t just about a contaminated black market . Even the e-liquids with the most professional pedigrees haven ’ t been subject to stringent safety regulations , said Desmond Jensen , an attorney with the Public Health Law Center at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law . In 1937 , Blum said , pro-regulation advocates had already been warning people for years that there were too many loopholes in FDA rules . And the same is true in this case . There were no FDA regulations at all on e-cigarettes until 2016 , and the regulations that exist now are more like swiss cheese than solid cheddar , Jensen said .
“ When you say a product is regulated , the average person thinks about pesticides , food or drugs , ” he told me . “ There ’ s someone making sure it ’ s not tainted , or making sure it won ’ t make us sick . That ’ s not what it means here. ” Instead , the FDA requires sellers and manufacturers of e-cigarettes and e-liquids to register with and disclose ingredients to the agency . But that isn ’ t the same as quality or safety testing , Jensen said . And a lot of companies haven ’ t registered in the two years those regulations have been in effect . Safety testing regulations do exist — but their implementation keeps getting scooched back under pressure from vaping companies . Currently , products that were on the market before 2016 won ’ t have to be reviewed for safety until May of 2020 . Manufacturers who don ’ t sell directly to consumers haven ’ t had to register or disclose ingredients at all .
In 1937 , it was completely legal to sell antifreeze-sweetened medicine to children . The only crime the Massengill company could be charged with was misbranding its liquid as an “ elixir , , which legally had to contain alcohol , rather than as a “ solution , ” Blum said . ( In fact , this distinction was the only thing that allowed the FDA to get involved and recover the tainted medicine from consumers to begin with . ) The sulfanilamide disaster changed everything about consumer safety . Within a year , we had a new Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act that , for the first time , gave the FDA the power to demand companies prove a drug was safe before it could be sold .
And that ’ s effectively the problem we have with e-cigarettes today , Jensen said . The pre-sale approval process exists , but there are thousands of products it doesn ’ t yet apply to . Meanwhile , it ’ s legal to sell e-cigarette liquids that contain chemicals we ’ ve banned as food additives , or that contain chemicals nobody has even thought to list in a database because they form in the package after the ingredients have been mixed together . And while states have begun to ban flavored e-liquids in response to the lung disease outbreak ( and the federal government may do the same ) , that doesn ’ t solve consumer protection problems that aren ’ t related to flavoring , such as liquid nicotine that contains far more of the drug than is claimed on the label , or e-cigarette devices manufactured in China that aren ’ t being held to any kind of safety standards .
But it ’ s no real surprise we ’ ve ended up here , said Marian Moser Jones , a public health professor at the University of Maryland . Our laws aimed at stopping products from poisoning people have usually come in reaction to deaths and illness , rather than before .
Ultimately , Moser Jones said , you can look on both historical poisoning cases and the current vaping crisis as a direct result of consumer product safety policy that often favors a right to sell over a right to know that what is being sold is safe . “ In other countries there ’ s less of a question about whether the government has a right to interfere with commerce , ” she said . When the careful balance between retailers rights and consumers tips too far to one side , people die .

culture,National Review,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2018/05/14/victim-mentality-identity-politics-dominate-modern-left/,The Church of Grievance,2018-05-14,"Michael Brendan Dougherty, Ramesh Ponnuru, Andrew C. Mccarthy, Mark Krikorian, Jay Nordlinger, Kyle Smith, John J. Miller, Robert Verbruggen, Nr Symposium, Yuval Levin","In the days and weeks after the awful massacre at Stoneman Douglas High School , a number of students put themselves forward , to the front of America ’ s ceaselessly reiterated debate about gun rights . That they would have an immediate — even urgent — prominence is predictable . But it is the predictable exception to American political debate , which is usually conducted under the pretense that all its participants — politicians , experts , journalists , and news addicts — belong to a cult of policy expertise . Victims have a unique and growing role in our political culture .
Conservatives also make rhetorical use of victims . The families of 9/11 victims were solicited for their views on everything from intelligence gathering to foreign policy . President Donald Trump , whose political success comes from his intuitive understanding of America ’ s mass culture , made very effective use of victim politics in his 2018 State of the Union address , drawing attention to , among others , the parents of two teenagers , Nisa Mickens and Kayla Cuevas , who were murdered in 2016 ( MS-13 gang members have been charged with the crime ) .
The most obvious reasons for deploying victims in our political life in this way are that tragic news events drive public conversation and that suffering commands human attention and sympathy . Faced with human suffering , we fall silent , or at least think we should . And silence is a reasonable enough proxy for consent . It ’ s good enough for an activist who wants to achieve reforms , even at the price of cutting deliberation short .
But something is changing in victim politics . It is no longer an emotive call for political reform , or restitution for wrongs done . The young activists whom conservatives call “ social-justice warriors ” practice politics in a form that looks spiritual , and their Marxoid political theories are effulgent with longings and aspirations that point far beyond what we normally think of as politics .
It ’ s worth examining the change . At this point , conservative complaints about the political use of victims are a generation old . Twenty-six years ago , in his book A Nation of Victims , Charlie Sykes documented the shift in the American political imagination . Sykes was especially preoccupied with spurious claims of victimhood . Drawing from Tocqueville ’ s observation that Americans “ are forever brooding over advantages they do not possess , ” he noted the way in which displeased customers inflated their trivial grievances into oppressions and how some Americans recast their debilitating personal habits as disabilities . My gambling isn ’ t a moral problem , it ’ s a disease ! The burn from my coffee isn ’ t the predictable result of my clumsiness , but the fault of McDonald ’ s . “ A community of interdependent citizens has been displaced by a society of resentful , competing , and self-interested individuals who have dressed their private annoyances in the garb of victimism , ” Sykes wrote .
He traced the victim mentality to a number of sources , even back to Jean-Jacques Rousseau , and to our novel belief that no harm can befall us that ’ s not in some way the fault of society , and that therefore every one of life ’ s misfortunes calls for recompense from the treasury of resources common to society , or at least from the closest source of wealth .
Although Sykes ’ s account is thorough , he could not fully anticipate the mutation of victim politics into something even larger and more destabilizing . Some conservatives have tried to explain the preeminence of the victim in our politics as the result of cultural Marxism and the teachings of the Frankfurt school . Faced with the manifest failure of the proletariat to take up its assigned role as the true sovereign of history after the Bolshevik Revolution , a group of left-wing theorists built on the work of Italian Communist Antonio Gramsci and came up with a new proletarian class , or classes . Sometimes called “ the subaltern , ” other times simply “ the oppressed , ” this new proletariat was defined by its exclusion from hegemonic cultural power . This cultural hegemony has many names , and we encounter them constantly , in a less sophisticated form , when feminists denounce the patriarchy , when sexual minorities critique heteronormativity , and when racial minorities define their mission as the upending of white supremacy .
The new dominance of victim politics has exerted a gravitational effect on all of American political discourse . The shift in Marxist rhetoric from the proletariat to the subaltern has foreshadowed shifts in American politics writ large . In the 20th century , Americans often claimed their rights and privileges as members of the middle class , demanding what was owed to “ people who work hard and play by the rules. ” Many Americans who were a bit poorer or a bit richer than the middle class still politically identified with that great mass of citizens . It was a rhetoric built around the idea that the middle class works to create wealth and deserves its share of it .
Now , Americans group themselves into ever smaller and more-besieged minorities . “ Any man more right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one already , ” Thoreau said . In our world , anyone more micro-aggressed than his neighbors constitutes a minority of one . Unsurprisingly , this form of politics is best suited to young people , preferably in college , who live in a world where they are still shaping their identity and their labor is just a notional feature of their life in the future .
Our political vocabulary is now about what is owed to each individual or group , regardless of the value of the work performed by that person or group . And claims for rights are made in a corporate persona . Instead of each person ’ s speaking for himself , people now issue political demands “ as a member of ” this or that community . It ’ s almost as if each individual finds meaning only insofar as he conforms to an abstracted or imagined political model . “ Speaking as a woman ” simply can not be done by a female who is not a feminist .
If the abstruse theories of a handful of Marxists could move the world on their own , this magazine wouldn ’ t exist . But the new victim politics has taken off because it fulfills certain needs of its practitioners . It allows an alternative entry into the heavily guarded political discussion of America ’ s ruling class . And it offers a sense of purpose and identity that , in another age , would have been found in religion .
The American ruling class broadcasts its soulless utilitarianism when it comes to politics . It tries to make every political problem into a mere technical policy challenge . But there is a loophole for those who are not initiated into this highly abstract form of political discourse . Utilitarianism admits just one criterion for allocating sympathy , resources , and attention : suffering .
So if you want to participate in political debate , but you don ’ t want to master all the academic studies on your particular problem or interest , take account of all the methodological biases of these studies , and then find a platform where you can make your case — if , in short , you don ’ t want to become a nerd — your only chance of having a public voice is to become , or represent , a victim . This is the only chance to put passion — or spiritedness — back into a political conversation that is usually lifeless and technical .
It is also likely that the new victim politics is channeling energy that would otherwise express itself in other projects . The ever-narrowing mission of the art world is a likely culprit .

Social-justice seekers long sincerely for transcendence

In the days and weeks after the awful massacre at Stoneman Douglas High School, a number of students put themselves forward, to the front of America’s ceaselessly reiterated debate about gun rights. That they would have an immediate — even urgent — prominence is predictable. But it is the predictable exception to American political debate, which is usually conducted under the pretense that all its participants — politicians, experts, journalists, and news addicts — belong to a cult of policy expertise. Victims have a unique and growing role in our political culture.

Conservatives also make rhetorical use of victims. The families of 9/11 victims were solicited for their views on everything from intelligence gathering to foreign policy. President Donald Trump, whose political success comes from his intuitive understanding of America’s mass culture, made very effective use of victim politics in his 2018 State of the Union address, drawing attention to, among others, the parents of two teenagers, Nisa Mickens and Kayla Cuevas, who were murdered in 2016 (MS-13 gang members have been charged with the crime).

The most obvious reasons for deploying victims in our political life in this way are that tragic news events drive public conversation and that suffering commands human attention and sympathy. Faced with human suffering, we fall silent, or at least think we should. And silence is a reasonable enough proxy for consent. It’s good enough for an activist who wants to achieve reforms, even at the price of cutting deliberation short.

But something is changing in victim politics. It is no longer an emotive call for political reform, or restitution for wrongs done. The young activists whom conservatives call “social-justice warriors” practice politics in a form that looks spiritual, and their Marxoid political theories are effulgent with longings and aspirations that point far beyond what we normally think of as politics.

It’s worth examining the change. At this point, conservative complaints about the political use of victims are a generation old. Twenty-six years ago, in his book A Nation of Victims, Charlie Sykes documented the shift in the American political imagination. Sykes was especially preoccupied with spurious claims of victimhood. Drawing from Tocqueville’s observation that Americans “are forever brooding over advantages they do not possess,” he noted the way in which displeased customers inflated their trivial grievances into oppressions and how some Americans recast their debilitating personal habits as disabilities. My gambling isn’t a moral problem, it’s a disease! The burn from my coffee isn’t the predictable result of my clumsiness, but the fault of McDonald’s. “A community of interdependent citizens has been displaced by a society of resentful, competing, and self-interested individuals who have dressed their private annoyances in the garb of victimism,” Sykes wrote.

He traced the victim mentality to a number of sources, even back to Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and to our novel belief that no harm can befall us that’s not in some way the fault of society, and that therefore every one of life’s misfortunes calls for recompense from the treasury of resources common to society, or at least from the closest source of wealth.

Although Sykes’s account is thorough, he could not fully anticipate the mutation of victim politics into something even larger and more destabilizing. Some conservatives have tried to explain the preeminence of the victim in our politics as the result of cultural Marxism and the teachings of the Frankfurt school. Faced with the manifest failure of the proletariat to take up its assigned role as the true sovereign of history after the Bolshevik Revolution, a group of left-wing theorists built on the work of Italian Communist Antonio Gramsci and came up with a new proletarian class, or classes. Sometimes called “the subaltern,” other times simply “the oppressed,” this new proletariat was defined by its exclusion from hegemonic cultural power. This cultural hegemony has many names, and we encounter them constantly, in a less sophisticated form, when feminists denounce the patriarchy, when sexual minorities critique heteronormativity, and when racial minorities define their mission as the upending of white supremacy.

The new dominance of victim politics has exerted a gravitational effect on all of American political discourse. The shift in Marxist rhetoric from the proletariat to the subaltern has foreshadowed shifts in American politics writ large. In the 20th century, Americans often claimed their rights and privileges as members of the middle class, demanding what was owed to “people who work hard and play by the rules.” Many Americans who were a bit poorer or a bit richer than the middle class still politically identified with that great mass of citizens. It was a rhetoric built around the idea that the middle class works to create wealth and deserves its share of it.

Now, Americans group themselves into ever smaller and more-besieged minorities. “Any man more right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one already,” Thoreau said. In our world, anyone more micro-aggressed than his neighbors constitutes a minority of one. Unsurprisingly, this form of politics is best suited to young people, preferably in college, who live in a world where they are still shaping their identity and their labor is just a notional feature of their life in the future.

Our political vocabulary is now about what is owed to each individual or group, regardless of the value of the work performed by that person or group. And claims for rights are made in a corporate persona. Instead of each person’s speaking for himself, people now issue political demands “as a member of” this or that community. It’s almost as if each individual finds meaning only insofar as he conforms to an abstracted or imagined political model. “Speaking as a woman” simply cannot be done by a female who is not a feminist.

If the abstruse theories of a handful of Marxists could move the world on their own, this magazine wouldn’t exist. But the new victim politics has taken off because it fulfills certain needs of its practitioners. It allows an alternative entry into the heavily guarded political discussion of America’s ruling class. And it offers a sense of purpose and identity that, in another age, would have been found in religion.

The American ruling class broadcasts its soulless utilitarianism when it comes to politics. It tries to make every political problem into a mere technical policy challenge. But there is a loophole for those who are not initiated into this highly abstract form of political discourse. Utilitarianism admits just one criterion for allocating sympathy, resources, and attention: suffering.

So if you want to participate in political debate, but you don’t want to master all the academic studies on your particular problem or interest, take account of all the methodological biases of these studies, and then find a platform where you can make your case — if, in short, you don’t want to become a nerd — your only chance of having a public voice is to become, or represent, a victim. This is the only chance to put passion — or spiritedness — back into a political conversation that is usually lifeless and technical.

It is also likely that the new victim politics is channeling energy that would otherwise express itself in other projects. The ever-narrowing mission of the art world is a likely culprit. Haunted by the corruption of commercialism and disillusioned with the pursuit of genius for its own sake, almost the entire artistic world has looked to politics to find a new purpose. And so every field, from abstract sculpture to film to stand-up comedy, has started to mimic the hectoring voice and social goals of progressive politics. Those seeking to express or sublimate their deepest longings almost inevitably turn away from contemplation and creation and toward activism. Tragedy and comedy are supposed to offer catharsis and make living in an imperfect world easier. But, given an overtly political role, these forms now essentially withhold that salve; their mission is agitation in the service of social reform. We have an art world that satisfies us less and diverts more dissatisfaction into the political realm.

Borrowing from the thought of Polish philosopher Leszek Kolakowski, the Christian social critic Alan Jacobs showed that “woke” social-justice activists often don’t use political terms when talking about the imperatives of their identity politics. Instead, they invoke mythic ones. This partly explains why their response to unwelcome campus speakers takes on the form of an exorcism, with chants repeated in a loud, prayer-like cadence. Sometimes the shouts are enacted as an antiphony — a call and response. At other times, an exemplar is pulled forward to speak and the entire supportive group amplifies that voice by repeating the person’s words.

Here victim politics recasts disagreement as desecration and defilement. Someone who walks into these environments looking for the intellectual parry and thrust of debate is instead told, “Your job is to listen.” The expectation that no one would dare to interject or question the personal testimony of the victim of oppression is not so different from the expectation of silence during the reading of the Gospel in a church service, or during a homily. Your job is to listen.

And it is here, I would suggest, that the politics of the victim touch something deep in the soul of modern man. They are in some ways the residue of Christian thought and ritual in a Western world that offers little traditional religious education or formation. The premise of victim politics is like a mirror image of devotion to the Suffering Servant. Just as in Christianity, so in social-justice politics: The wounds of the primordial victim testify to the broken state of human nature and society at large. For Christians, the cross is a kind of throne, and the crown of thorns becomes a sign of authority. The paradox of Christianity is that the Lord reigns as King precisely because he offered himself as Victim.

Putting this Victim at the center of the social order, in ritual or in preaching, begins the redemption of all humanity. The faithful confess to the ways their sins contributed to the fate of the victim. The ritual is meant to moralize and inspire those who witness it and motivate them to more fully participate in the effort of redemption. It can also provide its adherents with a demonology that fills the world with invisible oppressors and tormentors, making them oversensitive and fearful.

The religious aspect should be evident to anyone who offers a rational critique of some identity-politics shibboleth only to be told “You’re denying my identity” or “You’re erasing my existence.” It’s a mysterious response at first. You offer an argument and are told that you disbelieve in someone’s existence. It sounds like an accusation of atheism, for a good reason: You’re being charged with heresy, and if you do not desist, you reveal yourself as morally reprobate, as one who would, with full knowledge, repeat the Crucifixion. Or if you prefer the current academese, you are one who “reifies the structures of oppression.” You love yourself more than you love the victim-god standing before you, the one exposing his wounds and offering you forgiveness on condition that you recognize his pain, confess your unearned privilege, and promise obedience.

Either way, we are not here contending over something exclusively political.

And so we must be careful. An anti-PC politics that takes the form of mockery will win converts only among those who are already primed to be disillusioned.

COVID-19 primarily spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets from coughing , sneezing and talking , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , including by asymptomatic and “ pre-symptomatic ” individuals .
In a reversal from its earlier guidance , the agency recommended in April that Americans wear cloth face coverings while in public places that make physical distance difficult to maintain . A number of states and businesses also now require mask-wearing in some capacity .
Surveys suggest that many people are complying with such directives : More than two-thirds of respondents to a mid-May HuffPost/YouGov poll , for example , said they either always or mostly wore a face covering while in public and close to other people . Some 83 % said they did not view that act as a sign of weakness , and 69 % said they saw it as a sign of respectfulness .

“ The first thing is to be a role model , and to wear your mask and to wear it properly , ” said Zeke Emanuel , a University of Pennsylvania oncologist and bioethicist who helped craft the Affordable Care Act and now advises Joe Biden ’ s presidential campaign . “ It ’ s important for average people ; it ’ s especially important for celebrities , political leaders , business leaders. ” Setting this example helps establish social norms and expectations , he told ███ .
David Abrams , a professor of social and behavioral science at the NYU School of Global Public Health , said that each individual who wore a mask was “ helping contribute to the new normal. ” “ Observational learning is extremely powerful , and therefore whether it ’ s one-on-one or a few people or someone in a leadership position , anybody wearing a mask is strongly helping other people to wear one , ” he said .
You can also offer positive reinforcement to people who do wear masks . “ How about saying , ‘ Thank you for wearing a mask , ’ or ‘ I appreciate that you ’ re wearing a mask ’ ? ” suggested Gretchen Chapman , a professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon University .
Cite a rule or policy to make it less personal
If a customer at your workplace is flouting the rules , try deferring to an external authority , said Emma Frances Bloomfield , an assistant professor of communication studies at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas who studies scientific skepticism and misinformation . Explain that your workplace mandates mask-wearing for everybody and it ’ s your job to enforce the rules , she said , “ so it ’ s less about attacking them and their specific decision . ”
It can also help to direct the person to resources , like extra masks , she said . Whole Foods AMZN , -0.71 % , for example , announced in late April that it would offer free disposable masks to customers .
Chapman said that if a student came to her office hours without a face covering , she would appeal to Carnegie Mellon ’ s guidance that everyone on campus wear one — that way , the student would be less likely to take it personally .
“ Even if that university rule weren ’ t there , I could say , ‘ I have a personal rule that I ’ ll only meet with people when we ’ re all wearing masks , so could you put on a mask ? ’ ” she said . Publicizing the rules ahead of time isn ’ t a bad idea , she added .
Bloomfield advised against engaging with strangers who aren ’ t wearing masks in a store or outside . “ If you don ’ t have any power or authority in a situation , people probably aren ’ t going to react kindly or openly to being policed by others , ” she said . “ Direct confrontation with people you don ’ t know is not a good idea. ” ( This person might also not be wearing a mask for reasons you don ’ t know about , like a disability . )
If you do engage with someone , use “ I ” messages rather than “ you ” messages , ask questions , study the person ’ s nonverbal behavior for emotional cues , and try to empathize with their reason for not wearing a mask , Abrams said . Stay calm , firm and neutral , he added , and “ be curious about them rather than impose your will on them . ”
“ Attacking someone , criticizing them for not doing the right thing — that almost never works , ” Emanuel added .
Friends and family members will be easier to talk to since you share a personal connection , Bloomfield said . If you know the person , “ you could certainly appeal to common values and experiences , ” she added . “ Perhaps you know people in common who are particularly at risk for contracting the disease . ”
It ’ s important to “ make it easy for people to do the right thing , ” said Emanuel . “ In an ideal world , we would have lots of masks that are free or very cheap , ” he said . On an individual level , increasing ease might look like carrying around extra masks to give to people who need them , he said , or sewing or buying masks for your relatives or roommates . Keep masks near the door so they ’ re easy to grab when your family goes out .
In the workplace , he added , you could “ encourage — maybe even demand — that your employer provide suitable masks. ” “ That ’ s what it means to operate a safe work environment these days , ” Emanuel said .
You might be able to cultivate norms about mask-wearing in your workplace or organization , Chapman said , including by having a discussion beforehand in which everyone signs on to the idea of wearing a mask .
If you ’ re meeting up with a friend for a socially distanced coffee , Bloomfield said , set ground rules ahead of time and plan for both of you to wear face coverings . And if you live with someone , lay down rules and expectations for your communal living space . “ If you live in the same household , it ’ s not just your decisions affecting your own personal space — it ’ s affecting everyone ’ s space , ” she said .
If the person isn ’ t sold on wearing a mask , Bloomfield suggested asking them to just go along with it : “ Maybe I ’ m overreacting , but humor me — I ’ d rather be safe than sorry. ” “ You ’ re asking the person to compromise for your concerns and well-being , even if it ’ s not something they ’ re particularly concerned about , because you want to maintain the friendship or the relationship , ” she said .
“ To a large extent , you can control what situation you ’ re in , ” Chapman said . “ You can leave the store or walk farther away from the person . You could make up whatever excuse you need to walk away from the situation . ”
“ If you don ’ t have authority over the space , we can ’ t really tell people what they can and can not do , ” Bloomfield said . “ It ’ s best to just control your own well-being and what you feel comfortable with , and create the rules for your own spaces as best you can . ”
Consider , Chapman added , that there are all sorts of situations not involving COVID-19 in which people have different approaches to risky situations . “ You might be somewhat judgmental of people who binge drink or don ’ t wear seat belts all the time , but you ’ re not going to be mortal enemies with them because of that — you ’ re going to try to protect yourself , ” she said .","You can’t exactly force friends, neighbors or strangers to wear a face covering to slow the spread of coronavirus, but experts prescribe a few approaches to help nudge them in the right direction — and keep yourself safe.

Avoid the unexpected by not confronting strangers

Bloomfield advised against engaging with strangers who aren’t wearing masks in a store or outside. “If you don’t have any power or authority in a situation, people probably aren’t going to react kindly or openly to being policed by others,” she said. “Direct confrontation with people you don’t know is not a good idea.” (This person might also not be wearing a mask for reasons you don’t know about, like a disability.)

It’s important to “make it easy for people to do the right thing,” said Emanuel. “In an ideal world, we would have lots of masks that are free or very cheap,” he said. On an individual level, increasing ease might look like carrying around extra masks to give to people who need them, he said, or sewing or buying masks for your relatives or roommates.

In the workplace, he added, you could “encourage — maybe even demand — that your employer provide suitable masks.” “That’s what it means to operate a safe work environment these days,” Emanuel said.

Establish norms and ground rules ahead of time

You might be able to cultivate norms about mask-wearing in your workplace or organization, Chapman said, including by having a discussion beforehand in which everyone signs on to the idea of wearing a mask.

If you’re meeting up with a friend for a socially distanced coffee, Bloomfield said, set ground rules ahead of time and plan for both of you to wear face coverings. And if you live with someone, lay down rules and expectations for your communal living space. “If you live in the same household, it’s not just your decisions affecting your own personal space — it’s affecting everyone’s space,” she said.

Ask them to compromise or to humor you

If the person isn’t sold on wearing a mask, Bloomfield suggested asking them to just go along with it: “Maybe I’m overreacting, but humor me — I’d rather be safe than sorry.” “You’re asking the person to compromise for your concerns and well-being, even if it’s not something they’re particularly concerned about, because you want to maintain the friendship or the relationship,” she said.

Remember that you turn around and walk away

“To a large extent, you can control what situation you’re in,” Chapman said. “You can leave the store or walk farther away from the person. You could make up whatever excuse you need to walk away from the situation.”

“If you don’t have authority over the space, we can’t really tell people what they can and cannot do,” Bloomfield said. “It’s best to just control your own well-being and what you feel comfortable with, and create the rules for your own spaces as best you can.”

It threatens not only people’s jobs and livelihoods, but the very structure of our civic life. It calls out for an amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.

The victims aren’t targeted over their race, sex, sexual orientation or even gender identity (that last category now being recognized as covered under the act by a recent decision of the Supreme Court). All those groups already have protection. The epidemic I’m talking about is workplace discrimination against people whose political views are distasteful to the newly energized and apparently ascendant woke mob.

Our current crisis has revealed the significance of Lent and reminded us of how desperately we need Easter.

At the beginning of Holy Week one year ago, we watched in horror as the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris seemed to be going up in smoke right before our eyes. Though the damage didn’t end up being as catastrophic as we feared, what I wrote at the time, while the church was still lit up with flames, is a poignant reminder as we face an entirely different sort of tragedy this Easter:

Watching this holy place slowly collapse at the start of Holy Week — which will culminate in the commemoration of Jesus’s passion, death, and resurrection — is of undeniable significance. Notre Dame has fallen, the way everything in the earthly city must. She will not rise from these ashes as she was.

As I reread these words this week, and as we prepare for a Triduum without public Masses or our typical celebrations, they take on new significance. For Catholics, this Lent has asked far more of us than we’re accustomed to. Giving up the snooze button or a morning cup of coffee pales in comparison to losing access to everything our churches offer, especially at a time of year when we commemorate the centrality of the sacraments in a particular way.

Though many priests and parishes have developed clever ways of hearing confessions, continuing to host Adoration, or livestreaming daily Masses, there’s not much that can compensate for the fact that most U.S. Catholics will celebrate Easter, the most important holy day of our faith, without the Eucharist. For many, experiencing this time of year without extended family or a parish community might be a particular type of hardship.

That we are living through this crisis during Lent and Easter not only helps us better understand the trials facing our country but also brings new light to the truth of what these liturgical seasons mean.

It is an invitation, first of all, to recall the suffering of the Church around the world, to unite our much smaller trials with those who live with little access to the sacraments, who face imprisonment, torture, and death for practicing the faith. As we celebrate this Sunday in our homes, let’s recall in a special way the Christians who have lost their lives in terrorist attacks, targeted for their worship on Easter Sunday.

On a deeper level, the spiritual significance of Lent and Easter take on new meaning in light of the current tragedy. At the start of Lent, we are marked with ashes and called to remember that we are dust and to dust we shall return. What is this period of sickness and suffering, if not a painful reminder that the world is not our final home and death cannot be put off forever?

Throughout Lent, we are asked to renounce our own will so that we might better conform ourselves to what God asks of us. Watching our country buckle under this virus has offered us a new lens through which to see that it is God, not us, who controls our fate. We are asked to cooperate with Him and to make the best available choices in our given circumstances, but ultimately, it is His plan, not ours, that is being worked out in the world.

But within that large share , some notable differences emerge by age – particularly among those following news most closely .
Those differences are most pronounced between the youngest and oldest Americans , according to survey data that is part of ███ ’ s Election News Pathways project . More than two-thirds of adults ages 65 or older ( 69 % ) said they were following news of the pandemic very closely . At the other end of the spectrum , about four-in-ten Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 ( 42 % ) said they were paying as much attention to COVID-19 news . Those adults ages 30 to 49 and ages 50 to 64 fall in between .
Furthermore , these differences persist over time . Even as the public ’ s attention to news about the coronavirus outbreak grew from the first half to the second half of March , that growth did not occur equally across all age groups , with attention among the youngest cohort remaining behind others .
Americans were asked how closely they are following coronavirus news , first in a survey administered from March 10-16 , 2020 , among 8,914 U.S. adults and again in a survey from March 19-24 among 11,537 adults . ( All survey participants are members of the Center ’ s American Trends Panel . ) In that short period of time – when reported U.S. COVID-19 cases and fatalities quickly mounted and efforts by government and public health experts to respond to the outbreak intensified – overall attention to news about the outbreak remained extremely high , with the share following it very closely rising from 51 % to 57 % over this period .
Some age groups intensified their attention , while others did not . The portion of those ages 30 to 49 and ages 50 to 64 following the news very closely grew about 10 percentage points . On the other hand , the portion of those ages 18-29 and 65 and older following coronavirus news very closely remained largely unchanged .

It is difficult to recall an event that has commanded as much public attention for as extended a period of time as the current COVID-19 outbreak .
In a first survey conducted March 10-16 , fully 89 % of U.S. adults said they were fairly or very closely following coverage of the story . The other 11 % said they were following it not too closely or not at all closely .
A second survey was conducted just a short while later , from March 19-24 . In that time , news and events related to the virus occurred at a breakneck pace : the U.S. neared having the most confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide , New York City became the epicenter of the virus , professional sports teams , public schools closed in many areas across the country and many governors began ordering state residents to stay at home , while reported cases and confirmed deaths in the U.S. about tripled .
During this period , the portion of Americans who said they were following news about the coronavirus fairly or very closely remained extremely high , at 92 % , with some increase in those expressing the greatest intensity . Roughly half ( 51 % ) reported following the news very closely in mid-March , a figure that grew to 57 % later that month .

Attention among those ages 65 and older did not change much between the two time periods , but this may largely be due to their very high level of interest from the outset . Even during the first survey , fully two-thirds said they were following news very closely , something that could reflect both the news consumption habits of senior citizens as well as warnings that they were among those most vulnerable to the new virus .

Yahoo stoked a fake backlash against the TV star. But the damage is real — and alarming.

When it comes to writing, I’ve been rather quiet lately, and friends and acquaintances occasionally ask me why. The answer is fairly simple, really: It is because the world of social media is ruining both journalism and public discourse as we speak.

Do you doubt this? Does this seem a bit over-the-top? Let me regale you, then, with the sordid details of the latest would-be online-outrage witch hunt, flagrantly manufactured by people at two major media companies right in front of our very eyes.

The target, at least this time, was affable television personality Mario Lopez. Mr. Lopez, as you might recall, first shot to stardom on the teen sitcom Saved by the Bell. There, he played the hunky high-school rebel dreamboat A. C. Slater, a young man so desirable that NBC would occasionally pipe in an instant recording of a bunch of girls screaming “Wooooooooooo!” when he entered a room.

Anyway, remember Saul Alinksy’s Rules for Radicals? Remember that book’s detailed instructions on how to fight dirty when it comes to political warfare, including the maxim that one should “pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it”? That’s what a writer at Yahoo and the good folks at Twitter did to Lopez this week. It should alarm us all.

Not long after, a Twitter Moments headline popped up — what a coincidence! — declaring that “Mario Lopez’s comments from June on the #BelieveWomen movement and embracing gender expression in young children are receiving backlash.” Oh, wow! An online “backlash”! How very unusual! How exceedingly rare! The supposed evidence for this sweeping Twitter Moments statement, of course, was a link to the article at Yahoo News.

Start with the economy , which , if you listen to Sanders or the Republicans , is a garbage dump of existential despair . Actually , it ’ s doing quite well . Unemployment has dropped from 10 percent during the worst of the Great Recession to 5 percent today , thanks to a record 69 consecutive months of private-sector employment growth that has produced 13.7 million new jobs . The past two years have been the best two years for job creation in the 21st century .

In any case , the oft-predicted doomsday scenarios of the post-crisis era—double-dip recession , runaway inflation , runaway interest rates , out-of-control energy prices , a health insurance death spiral , a Greek-style debt crisis , a run on the dollar—are still stubbornly refusing to materialize . Growth is modest but steady . Inflation is low . Interest rates are very low , although the Fed felt confident enough about the recovery to raise them last month for the first time since the global financial meltdown . Gas is barely $ 2 a gallon . About 17 million uninsured Americans have gotten coverage in the past few years .

In that sense , we ’ re victims of our own success , although it ’ s way better to be us than them .
Skeptics often portray the U.S. economy as weaker than the data suggest—because underemployment and long-term unemployment rates are still somewhat high , although they ’ re now falling even faster than the regular unemployment rate ; because the “ labor participation rate ” is actually getting worse , although that 's mostly a result of baby-boomer retirements and increased college attendance ; or because too many of the newly created jobs are part time , which is simply untrue . The most widespread criticism is that wages have been stagnant for decades , a legitimate problem , but wages actually grew 2 percent faster than inflation over the past year .
Meanwhile , other recent developments—cheaper gas , free birth control and preventive care , the elimination of annual and lifetime caps on health insurance , expanded tax credits for the working poor , increased efficiency measures that lower energy bills , and much more—have put more money in the pockets of American families , even though their incomes have grown slowly . Health care prices have risen at their lowest rate in half a century since the passage of Obamacare , increasing just 1.3 percent over the past year . Tuition costs are still soaring and Americans now hold more than $ 1.2 trillion in student debt , but the Obama administration has quietly changed the rules to let borrowers cut their payments to 10 percent of their discretionary income and get their loans forgiven after 20 years . Savings rates have almost doubled since the crisis , and family debt burdens have dropped to 2002 levels .
In non-economic news , despite a year of furor over mass shootings and urban unrest , crime in big cities dropped about 5 percent in 2015 , and has been cut in half since 1990 . The teen birth rate is down more than 60 percent since 1990 , and that ’ s not because of increasing abortions , because they ’ ve fallen by more than a third .

Start with the economy, which, if you listen to Sanders or the Republicans, is a garbage dump of existential despair. Actually, it’s doing quite well. Unemployment has dropped from 10 percent during the worst of the Great Recession to 5 percent today, thanks to a record 69 consecutive months of private-sector employment growth that has produced 13.7 million new jobs. The past two years have been the best two years for job creation in the 21st century.

It can sound partisan to mention those facts when a Democrat is in the White House, but they’re facts; it ought to be possible to acknowledge them without necessarily giving President Obama too much credit for them.

Whittington, Nick Gillespie, Jacob Sullum","While many of us turn to the government for answers to the COVID-19 pandemic , others rightfully seek solutions from the private sector . Last week , the Hoover Institution 's Russ Roberts asked his many twitter followers to help `` create a list of voluntary ( non-coercive ) actions taking place right now to reduce COVID-19 spread or impact . '' The answers are too inspiring not to share .
First , many of Roberts ' followers shared a list the benefits offered by their employers that help to alleviate workers ' financial hardships or ensure their health is protected . For instance , Walmart , Target , Gap , and many other firms announced that they will provide up to two weeks of paid leave to every worker who is sick or taking care of sick family members .
Even companies that rely on self-employed contractors are stepping during this crisis . Uber , for example , emailed its customers to inform them that `` Any driver or delivery person who is diagnosed with COVID-19 or is individually asked to self-isolate by a public health authority will receive financial assistance for up to 14 days while their account is on hold , '' adding , `` We 've already helped drivers in some affected areas , and we 're working to quickly implement this worldwide . ''
Second , the fast-rising prices of some items like hand sanitizers frustrate many . But these price hikes are also a vital signal to manufacturers that these products are in especially high demand—high enough that it 's worth it for companies that usually do n't make these goods to shift their resources toward producing them . In China , facemasks are now produced by auto , electronic , and energy companies . A group of citizens in Hong Kong set up a surgical-mask factory to increase supplies , which tempers price hikes .
But Roberts ' followers also highlight examples of companies innovating to fill other shortage gaps . For example , Shine Distillery and Grill in Portland , Oregon , is now turning its alcohol waste into hand sanitizer , which the owner then gives away . The Durham Distillery in North Carolina is also donating its homemade sanitizer to local hospitality businesses .
Big guys like LVMH are helping , too . The world 's biggest luxury company announced that it would temporarily make hand sanitizer instead of perfumes and then freely deliver the gel across France to address critical shortages .
Companies are going out of their way to make it tolerable for people to be stuck at home . The Metropolitan Opera is now streaming nightly performances for free to fans quarantined to their homes . The streaming company Zoom , a leader in modern enterprise video communications , will start streaming religious services for free , too .
Where I live in Arlington , Virginia , Comcast is providing free Wi-Fi for children who do n't have it . This generosity helps students learn while their schools are closed . Charter Communications also announced that it would offer free broadband for two months to households with students around the country .
Former Duke basketball star and current New Orleans Pelican Zion Williamson announced that he will cover the salaries of workers at the Smoothie King Center who will be hurt by the NBA 's suspension of its season . In the same spirit , Charlotte 's Hornets Sports and Entertainment—and Charlotte Hornets players—announced the creation of a fund to provide financial assistance to their 500 part-time employees affected by the lack of games . And Guinness brewery announced that it would give $ 500,000 through its `` Guinness Gives Back Fund to help communities where we live , work and celebrate . ''
Restaurants are also restructuring their operations in order to protect workers and customers . In Seattle , high-end restaurant Canlis went from offering a $ 135 four-course tasting menu to `` selling bagel sandwiches in the morning , running a drive-through serving burgers and veggie melts for lunch and delivering dinner to the doorsteps of Seattle residents , '' according to The New York Times . Roberts ' feed is full of examples of local restaurants offering free lunches to children in need whose schools have closed .
This column is too short to list everything that companies and citizens are now doing to help during this crisis . From private companies searching for cures and developing a vaccine to private citizens tutoring kids for free online to neighbors using the Nextdoor app to set up mutual-aid resources for vulnerable community members needing food , medicines , and services , examples abound of the generosity and sense of community of the American people .

Former Duke basketball star and current New Orleans Pelican Zion Williamson announced that he will cover the salaries of workers at the Smoothie King Center who will be hurt by the NBA's suspension of its season. In the same spirit, Charlotte's Hornets Sports and Entertainment—and Charlotte Hornets players—announced the creation of a fund to provide financial assistance to their 500 part-time employees affected by the lack of games. And Guinness brewery announced that it would give $500,000 through its ""Guinness Gives Back Fund to help communities where we live, work and celebrate.""

Restaurants are also restructuring their operations in order to protect workers and customers. In Seattle, high-end restaurant Canlis went from offering a $135 four-course tasting menu to ""selling bagel sandwiches in the morning, running a drive-through serving burgers and veggie melts for lunch and delivering dinner to the doorsteps of Seattle residents,"" according to The New York Times. Roberts' feed is full of examples of local restaurants offering free lunches to children in need whose schools have closed.

This column is too short to list everything that companies and citizens are now doing to help during this crisis. From private companies searching for cures and developing a vaccine to private citizens tutoring kids for free online to neighbors using the Nextdoor app to set up mutual-aid resources for vulnerable community members needing food, medicines, and services, examples abound of the generosity and sense of community of the American people.

India 's Muslims are struggling not to upgrade themselves from their status as second-class citizens but just to remain citizens . Modi is an unabashed Hindu nationalist whose first act last August after his landslide re-election was to scrap the governing autonomy of majority-Muslim Kashmir , a northern state bordering Pakistan , and put it under federal control . It was a wildly popular move , even among the country 's secularly inclined Hindus , even though Modi put Kashmir 's duly elected leaders under house arrest , imposed a curfew , shut down schools , blacked out news , and suspended the internet . ( Even during the pandemic , Kashmiris are being forced to travel several hours by train to neighboring states to access the internet and get basic information . )
That 's not all Modi did . He also obtained a favorable ruling from the Indian Supreme Court to build a Hindu temple on the site of a mosque that Hindu militants , himself included , razed with their bare hands some decades ago . And then he launched a diabolical scheme to scrap the citizenship of millions of Indian Muslims and ultimately send them to detention camps .
When this triggered protests by India 's Muslims and their progressive backers , especially on college campuses , the Modi government responded with brutal violence . The police stormed Muslim colleges and bashed unarmed students , and they allowed private militants associated with Modi 's party do the same on a prestigious New Delhi campus .
Hindus have long stereotyped Muslim men as inherently dangerous and excused all kinds of harsh tactics to `` domesticate '' them . So in the wake of the growing state violence , Muslim women took it upon themselves to use Gandhian tactics of civil resistance to spearhead a movement for Muslim rights . They cobbled together a site in southeast Delhi for a 24/7 vigil , drawing tens of thousands of protesters—many of them Muslims , but also others .
Far from taking their plight seriously , the broader Hindu community complained bitterly about the traffic disruptions , prompting some local Hindu politicians to call the protesters `` traitors . '' The result ? Even more violence , resulting in a mini-pogrom in February .
Worse , whatever little goodwill the Muslim women enjoyed evaporated as soon as the pandemic hit . Many Indians openly pilloried them as scientifically backward Neanderthals jeopardizing public health for the sake of an overblown crusade—never mind that many of the protesters took social distancing precautions . Authorities used coronavirus as a pretext to unceremoniously evict them in late March , although the virus did n't stop Modi from holding prayers ahead of breaking ground for the temple on the site of the razed mosque .
Contrast this with how Floyd 's murder galvanized the movement against police brutality in America . Spontaneous protests erupted in 2,000 cities and towns across the country . Utah Sen. Mitt Romney , the Republican contender for the presidency in 2012 and not exactly the activist type , joined the Black Lives Matter march in Washington , D.C .

A Monmouth University poll found that a whopping 76 percent of Americans have come to regard racism and discrimination as a `` big problem , '' up 26 points from 2015 . The poll also found that 57 percent of voters thought the anger behind the demonstrations was fully justified .
This is simply stunning , given that when Black Lives Matter was launched in 2013 , it was widely regarded as an extremist , America-hating outfit . Now far more people are taking its concerns about systemic racism in policing seriously .

At the national level , even Trump has realized that simply harrumphing `` Law & Order '' wo n't cut it anymore and has signed an executive order encouraging police reform .

Mccarthy, Tobias Hoonhout, Bill Corsair, Jason Richwine","Sign at an anti-Trump demonstration in New York City , May 23 , 2018 . ( Lucas Jackson/Reuters )
If everything is like the Nazis , then the Nazis of history are no different from an ICE officer , a White House staffer , or . . . you and me .
If you vote for Trump then you , the voter , you , not Donald Trump ,
are standing at the border like Nazis , going : “ You here , you here . ”
Former CIA director Michael Hayden recently tweeted a picture of a Nazi extermination camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau , with his commentary : “ Other governments have separated mothers from children. ” The suggestion was that industrialized death on an unprecedented scale was somehow similar to the temporary detention of children once their parents have been detained for violating federal law .
Actor Peter Fonda recently advised the following about Trump policy adviser Stephen Miller : “ Don ’ t let the pedophile Stephen Goebbels Miller near those girls separated from their parents. ” Comedian Kathy Griffin has asserted that the Trump administration is “ quite pro-Nazi . ”
Fonda perhaps lacks the subtlety of a Bill Kristol , who implies rather than sledgehammers the Nazi comparisons . When Michael Anton , a writer whose articles often appeared in The Weekly Standard , went to work for the Trump administration , Kristol reduced Anton to the status of an infamous Nazi lawyer : “ Carl Schmitt to Mike Anton : First time tragedy , second time farce . ”
Sounds slick , but Anton was working for an elected government in general and in particular for a National Security Council under Lieutenant General H. R. McMaster that was trying to reestablish U.S. deterrence . Stranger still , it is hard to understand how Carl Schmitt ’ s Nazi-party membership and advocacy ( begun formally as early as 1933 ) were in any sense “ tragic ” rather than vile . And if the subordinate is supposedly Carl Schmitt , what then would Kristol call his boss , the iconic McMaster ? Goebbels ? Heydrich ?
If Trump is worried that thousands of foreign citizens are illegally entering the U.S. without much worry over legal consequences , and if he clumsily uses the unfortunate word “ infests ” in the context of the MS-13 gang ( “ infest our Country , like MS-13 ” ) , then for Kristol , Trump becomes analogous to Nazi exterminators : “ Trump ’ s statement that immigrants will ‘ infest our country ’ probably sounds better in the original German . ”
Former CIA director Hayden should have remembered that the very Nazi slur he just used to smear Trump was often used against him , over the enhanced interrogations he oversaw as CIA director .
Perhaps Kristol forgets that his own past promotions of “ national greatness ” and his turn-of-the-century “ Project for a New American Century ” were once smeared by the Left , and some on Right , as proof that he was a crude and dangerous nationalist who was emulating Trotskyite doctrines , at best , and , worse , that he was a warmongering fascist .
Hayden too should have remembered that the very Nazi slur he just used to smear Trump was often used against him , over the enhanced interrogations he oversaw as CIA director .
Ditto the case of former first lady Laura Bush , who recently compared the temporary detention of children — after their parents had been apprehended for breaking U.S. immigration law — to the forced internment of tens of thousands of U.S. citizens of Japanese descent . Mrs. Bush has apparently forgotten that the warped comparison to the Japanese interment was used as a slur against her husband during the Abu Ghraib mess and also after the announcement of the administration ’ s forced renditions of terrorist suspects to foreign countries . In her hierarchy of crimes , is temporarily housing children separately from their law-breaking parents a greater crime than enhanced interrogations , the “ collateral damage ” that accrues from drone strikes , or the use of the interrogation methods in foreign countries on suspects sent there by the U.S. government ?
Unfortunately , these efforts to tar conservatives as Nazis , brown shirts , and fascists are not novel . Such slurs predate both Donald Trump and his policy of detaining minors accompanying their foreign-national parents who are illegally entering the United States .
Harry Truman claimed that his Republican opponent in the 1948 election , Thomas Dewey , was a “ front man ” for fascists . In 1964 , California governor Pat Brown suggested that the Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater had “ the stench of fascism. ” Brown added , “ All we need to hear was ‘ Heil Hitler. ’ ” After 1980 , leftists used the Nazi slur frequently against Ronald Reagan .
“ Nazi ! ” was also a familiar favorite of the Left during the George W. Bush administration , widely employed across the progressive spectrum . Folk singer Linda Ronstadt , dramatist Harold Pinter , cartoonist Ted Rall , and financier George Soros all tied George W. Bush either to Nazism in general or to Adolf Hitler in particular .
Mainstream Democratic politicians — including former vice president Al Gore and the late senators Robert Byrd ( D. , W.Va. ) and John Glenn ( D. , Ohio ) — took delight in slurring George W. Bush or his supporters as Nazis or brown shirts .
The target of the Nazi smear , to avoid even the appearance of affinity with an odious monster and his regime , supposedly will offer psychological penance or policy concessions in hopes that his critics will curb their hysteria . If George W. Bush is Hitler , or Stephen Miller is Joseph Goebbels , or a German-accented Trump is sending Mexican nationals to Auschwitz-like death camps , then what is the patriotic thing for an American to do about them ? One answer might be to take out Trump-Hitler , or take up arms to stop his Nazi takeover of the U.S. , or force the target of such slurs to submit to reeducation to cleanse and reset his mind in a properly correct fashion .
Perhaps such logic is one reason we simultaneously see both the rise of Nazi slurs and the hyperbolic talk of killing a conservative president . Assassination chic also did not begin with Donald Trump , although David Crosby , Johnny Depp , Kamala Harris , Madonna , Rosie O ’ Donnell , Snoop Dogg , Kathy Griffin , and the Free Shakespeare in the Park troupe have by now exhausted the methods by which to rhetorically liquidate Trump ( incineration , shooting by pistol , death by elevator , explosives , jumping off a cliff , shooting by automatic weapon , beheading , and stabbing by a mob ) .
Yet we forget that in 2012 , in an episode of HBO ’ s Game of Thrones , a model of the chopped-off head of George W. Bush turned up on a pike ( “ by accident ” ) . During the acrimonious 2004 election , author Nicholson Baker published Checkpoint — little more than a monotonous dialogue of characters dreaming about how to assassinate the supposedly odious President Bush .
That same year , Guardian guest columnist Charlie Brooker — antedating Johnny Depp ’ s nasty John Wilkes Booth quip ( “ when was the last time an actor assassinated a president ? ” ) — seemed saddened that there was no assassin around to kill Bush : “ John Wilkes Booth , Lee Harvey Oswald , John Hinckley Jr. — where are you now that we need you ? ” The Death of a President was a sick docudrama by director Gabriel Range , enacting , step-by-step , an imagined assassination of then-president George W. Bush .
But beside using such historical slurs for the partisan purposes of pressuring a political opponent to modify his agenda , or to create the sort of hysteria that leads to a climate of violent resistance and even death threats , the Nazi trope is a sin against history .
Were Hitler ’ s death camps and nightmarish slaughters merely temporary parent-child separations at the border ?
If Nazism was once the equivalent of authorizing military action against the genocidal Saddam Hussein , on the consent of 23 separate congressional writs , or the same as temporarily separating foreign nationals who entered the U.S. illegally from the children they brought into the country , then what exactly are the 60 million dead of World War II , which Hitler started , or the 6 million who were gassed , starved , or shot in the Nazi extermination archipelago , or the 27 million Russian dead on the Eastern Front ?
Answer ? Their fates are all more or less analogous to those of the well-fed , clothed children temporarily separated from the parents who undertook a dangerous trip to bring them into the U.S. in violation of U.S. law and who may have used fraud to seek political asylum . What then were Treblinka , the siege of Leningrad , Stalingrad , and the Warsaw Ghetto all about ? Were Hitler ’ s death camps and nightmarish slaughters merely temporary parent-child separations at the border ?
In the case of the once-Nazified George Bush , were the excesses at Guantanamo or Abu Ghraib about the same as the murdering and starvation at Dachau ? Are the halal diet , soccer balls , and multiple recreation facilities ( including a $ 750K soccer field ) at Guantanamo similar to the menus and exercise regimes at Treblinka ?
If a Jewish Stephen Miller is really a Jew-hating Joseph Goebbels , who propagandized and empowered the Nazi cult of mass death and destruction , what , then , should we do to him ? ( Progressives are already answering that inquiry by hounding Miller 24/ 7 . ) And , in turn , was Goebbels then merely a partisan spokesman for an elected president subject to congressional and judicial oversight ?
So the sick Nazi comparison works both ways : It elevates political opponents into homicidal criminals who deserve extreme punishment , while reducing real historical monsters into little more than petty partisan zealots .
We all understand that comparing a transparent , legal , relatively safe , clean , and well-stocked temporary detention center to Auschwitz is meant to put a stop to the detention of illegal-alien families . ( And the hyperbole inadvertently sends the message that if single males are to find asylum in the U.S. , then by all means they should cross the border illegally while accompanied by young children ) .
But do we also grasp that we have just made Auschwitz ’ s 1 million dead little more than temporary detainees ? And by extension , is the treatment meted out to the more than 2 million American prisoners in federal , state , and local prisons and jails ( many likely to have been cut off from their children ) analogous to the mass slaughtering of innocents at the Mauthusen-Gusen concentration camp ?
Most of the slanderers combine the worse of two modernist traits : ignorance and arrogance . Because they are so ill-informed about the wages of World War II and the nature of Nazi beastliness , and so haughty and self-righteous in advancing such exaggerations and fabrications ( and to a generation whose knowledge of the past is often nonexistent ) , they are ever so insidiously redefining not only Bush and Trump but also the Holocaust and the Nazis themselves .

If everything is like the Nazis, then the Nazis of history are no different from an ICE officer, a White House staffer, or . . . you and me.

If you vote for Trump then you, the voter, you, not Donald Trump,

are standing at the border like Nazis, going: “You here, you here.”

— Donny Deutsche, MSNBC commentator

Former CIA director Michael Hayden recently tweeted a picture of a Nazi extermination camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau, with his commentary: “Other governments have separated mothers from children.” The suggestion was that industrialized death on an unprecedented scale was somehow similar to the temporary detention of children once their parents have been detained for violating federal law.

Actor Peter Fonda recently advised the following about Trump policy adviser Stephen Miller: “Don’t let the pedophile Stephen Goebbels Miller near those girls separated from their parents.” Comedian Kathy Griffin has asserted that the Trump administration is “quite pro-Nazi.”

Fonda perhaps lacks the subtlety of a Bill Kristol, who implies rather than sledgehammers the Nazi comparisons. When Michael Anton, a writer whose articles often appeared in The Weekly Standard, went to work for the Trump administration, Kristol reduced Anton to the status of an infamous Nazi lawyer: “Carl Schmitt to Mike Anton: First time tragedy, second time farce.”

Sounds slick, but Anton was working for an elected government in general and in particular for a National Security Council under Lieutenant General H. R. McMaster that was trying to reestablish U.S. deterrence. Stranger still, it is hard to understand how Carl Schmitt’s Nazi-party membership and advocacy (begun formally as early as 1933) were in any sense “tragic” rather than vile. And if the subordinate is supposedly Carl Schmitt, what then would Kristol call his boss, the iconic McMaster? Goebbels? Heydrich?

If Trump is worried that thousands of foreign citizens are illegally entering the U.S. without much worry over legal consequences, and if he clumsily uses the unfortunate word “infests” in the context of the MS-13 gang (“infest our Country, like MS-13”), then for Kristol, Trump becomes analogous to Nazi exterminators: “Trump’s statement that immigrants will ‘infest our country’ probably sounds better in the original German.”

Former CIA director Hayden should have remembered that the very Nazi slur he just used to smear Trump was often used against him, over the enhanced interrogations he oversaw as CIA director.

Perhaps Kristol forgets that his own past promotions of “national greatness” and his turn-of-the-century “Project for a New American Century” were once smeared by the Left, and some on Right, as proof that he was a crude and dangerous nationalist who was emulating Trotskyite doctrines, at best, and, worse, that he was a warmongering fascist.

Ditto the case of former first lady Laura Bush, who recently compared the temporary detention of children — after their parents had been apprehended for breaking U.S. immigration law — to the forced internment of tens of thousands of U.S. citizens of Japanese descent. Mrs. Bush has apparently forgotten that the warped comparison to the Japanese interment was used as a slur against her husband during the Abu Ghraib mess and also after the announcement of the administration’s forced renditions of terrorist suspects to foreign countries. In her hierarchy of crimes, is temporarily housing children separately from their law-breaking parents a greater crime than enhanced interrogations, the “collateral damage” that accrues from drone strikes, or the use of the interrogation methods in foreign countries on suspects sent there by the U.S. government?

Unfortunately, these efforts to tar conservatives as Nazis, brown shirts, and fascists are not novel. Such slurs predate both Donald Trump and his policy of detaining minors accompanying their foreign-national parents who are illegally entering the United States.

Harry Truman claimed that his Republican opponent in the 1948 election, Thomas Dewey, was a “front man” for fascists. In 1964, California governor Pat Brown suggested that the Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater had “the stench of fascism.” Brown added, “All we need to hear was ‘Heil Hitler.’” After 1980, leftists used the Nazi slur frequently against Ronald Reagan.

“Nazi!” was also a familiar favorite of the Left during the George W. Bush administration, widely employed across the progressive spectrum. Folk singer Linda Ronstadt, dramatist Harold Pinter, cartoonist Ted Rall, and financier George Soros all tied George W. Bush either to Nazism in general or to Adolf Hitler in particular.

Mainstream Democratic politicians — including former vice president Al Gore and the late senators Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) and John Glenn (D., Ohio) — took delight in slurring George W. Bush or his supporters as Nazis or brown shirts.

The target of the Nazi smear, to avoid even the appearance of affinity with an odious monster and his regime, supposedly will offer psychological penance or policy concessions in hopes that his critics will curb their hysteria. If George W. Bush is Hitler, or Stephen Miller is Joseph Goebbels, or a German-accented Trump is sending Mexican nationals to Auschwitz-like death camps, then what is the patriotic thing for an American to do about them? One answer might be to take out Trump-Hitler, or take up arms to stop his Nazi takeover of the U.S., or force the target of such slurs to submit to reeducation to cleanse and reset his mind in a properly correct fashion.

Perhaps such logic is one reason we simultaneously see both the rise of Nazi slurs and the hyperbolic talk of killing a conservative president. Assassination chic also did not begin with Donald Trump, although David Crosby, Johnny Depp, Kamala Harris, Madonna, Rosie O’Donnell, Snoop Dogg, Kathy Griffin, and the Free Shakespeare in the Park troupe have by now exhausted the methods by which to rhetorically liquidate Trump (incineration, shooting by pistol, death by elevator, explosives, jumping off a cliff, shooting by automatic weapon, beheading, and stabbing by a mob).

Yet we forget that in 2012, in an episode of HBO’s Game of Thrones, a model of the chopped-off head of George W. Bush turned up on a pike (“by accident”). During the acrimonious 2004 election, author Nicholson Baker published Checkpoint — little more than a monotonous dialogue of characters dreaming about how to assassinate the supposedly odious President Bush.

That same year, Guardian guest columnist Charlie Brooker — antedating Johnny Depp’s nasty John Wilkes Booth quip (“when was the last time an actor assassinated a president?”) — seemed saddened that there was no assassin around to kill Bush: “John Wilkes Booth, Lee Harvey Oswald, John Hinckley Jr. — where are you now that we need you?” The Death of a President was a sick docudrama by director Gabriel Range, enacting, step-by-step, an imagined assassination of then-president George W. Bush.

But beside using such historical slurs for the partisan purposes of pressuring a political opponent to modify his agenda, or to create the sort of hysteria that leads to a climate of violent resistance and even death threats, the Nazi trope is a sin against history.

Were Hitler’s death camps and nightmarish slaughters merely temporary parent-child separations at the border?

If Nazism was once the equivalent of authorizing military action against the genocidal Saddam Hussein, on the consent of 23 separate congressional writs, or the same as temporarily separating foreign nationals who entered the U.S. illegally from the children they brought into the country, then what exactly are the 60 million dead of World War II, which Hitler started, or the 6 million who were gassed, starved, or shot in the Nazi extermination archipelago, or the 27 million Russian dead on the Eastern Front?

Answer? Their fates are all more or less analogous to those of the well-fed, clothed children temporarily separated from the parents who undertook a dangerous trip to bring them into the U.S. in violation of U.S. law and who may have used fraud to seek political asylum. What then were Treblinka, the siege of Leningrad, Stalingrad, and the Warsaw Ghetto all about? Were Hitler’s death camps and nightmarish slaughters merely temporary parent-child separations at the border?

In the case of the once-Nazified George Bush, were the excesses at Guantanamo or Abu Ghraib about the same as the murdering and starvation at Dachau? Are the halal diet, soccer balls, and multiple recreation facilities (including a $750K soccer field) at Guantanamo similar to the menus and exercise regimes at Treblinka?

If a Jewish Stephen Miller is really a Jew-hating Joseph Goebbels, who propagandized and empowered the Nazi cult of mass death and destruction, what, then, should we do to him? (Progressives are already answering that inquiry by hounding Miller 24/ 7.) And, in turn, was Goebbels then merely a partisan spokesman for an elected president subject to congressional and judicial oversight?

So the sick Nazi comparison works both ways: It elevates political opponents into homicidal criminals who deserve extreme punishment, while reducing real historical monsters into little more than petty partisan zealots.

We all understand that comparing a transparent, legal, relatively safe, clean, and well-stocked temporary detention center to Auschwitz is meant to put a stop to the detention of illegal-alien families. (And the hyperbole inadvertently sends the message that if single males are to find asylum in the U.S., then by all means they should cross the border illegally while accompanied by young children).

But do we also grasp that we have just made Auschwitz’s 1 million dead little more than temporary detainees? And by extension, is the treatment meted out to the more than 2 million American prisoners in federal, state, and local prisons and jails (many likely to have been cut off from their children) analogous to the mass slaughtering of innocents at the Mauthusen-Gusen concentration camp?

Most of the slanderers combine the worse of two modernist traits: ignorance and arrogance. Because they are so ill-informed about the wages of World War II and the nature of Nazi beastliness, and so haughty and self-righteous in advancing such exaggerations and fabrications (and to a generation whose knowledge of the past is often nonexistent), they are ever so insidiously redefining not only Bush and Trump but also the Holocaust and the Nazis themselves.

History is now following a sort of Gresham’s law: Lots of cheap, bad history drives out what is left of good history.

In other words, when almost everything and everyone is analogous to Belzec, Sobibór, and Treblinka and their architects, then Belzec, Sobibór, and Treblinka become almost nothing at all.

One of the most common ways that millions of people are being kind to others right now is by practicing the self-sacrifice of social distancing . For many , the key motivation is that they want to protect others . There are precedents for that impulse , says Jill Suttie , a psychologist at The Greater Good Science Center at the University of California , Berkeley . A study demonstrated the most effective way for hospitals to motivate health care professionals to wash their hands isn ’ t by noting the importance of safeguarding oneself from disease . It ’ s stressing the impact it has on protecting patients .
To be sure , not everyone is acting altruistically at the moment . Fights have broken out in supermarkets as people wrestle for the last remaining item on a shelf . Some are hoarding hand sanitizer , face masks , and toilet paper . Many individuals ignored widespread pleas to practice social distancing this weekend by gathering at bars , restaurants , clubs , and music venues . In response , governors in several states , including Massachusetts and Ohio , shut down restaurants and bars except for delivery and takeout and canceled all concerts .
Even so , instances of selflessness have become increasingly common . In Longmont , Colorado , The Roost restaurant and pub has offered free meals to families whose children would have relied on the closed schools to provide them with lunches . Professional basketball players such as Giannis Antetokounmpo , Zion Williamson , and Blake Griffin have donated money to cover the salaries of arena workers affected by the suspension of the season . And when Jordana Shmidman ’ s bat mitzvah was canceled due to the coronavirus , parents volunteered to deliver 150 boxes of the catered food to quarantined families across several boroughs in New York .
Witnessing acts of kindness inspires others to pay it forward , says Mr. Zaki , a psychologist at Stanford University in California . In 2016 , he published an article in Scientific American , Kindness Contagion , that included findings of studies about how people “ catch ” cooperation and generosity from others . This deep-seated desire to help and connect with others intensifies during times of crisis and it crosses lanes of class , race , and other divisions that typically keep people apart .

To Marc Dunkelman , author of “ The Vanishing Neighbor , ” these neighborly responses to the coronavirus crisis are notable in their contrast to normal times . Most people ’ s acquaintances resemble a model like the rings of Saturn , with the innermost bands representing the most intimate connections and each successive loop becoming less intimate . Over the past 50 years , people have invested more time on the innermost ring of friends and family . People have also invested more time in the outermost rings with online acquaintances they don ’ t know personally but with whom they share common interests such as sports , hobbies , or politics .
People have largely abandoned those rings in the middle , says Mr. Dunkelman , a research fellow at Brown University ’ s A. Alfred Taubman Center for Public Policy and American Institutions . Those are the face-to-face rings of contacts , such as neighbors and once-popular associations such as bowling leagues , Boy Scouts , or Rotary clubs . Yet the coronavirus , striking close to home , offers up the opportunity for greater local connection .
“ Could it be that in the context of this crisis , people do break through that initial barrier and say to one another , even though they ’ re not supposed to be accosting one another or having real intimacy , ‘ Hello . You know , I live in apartment 2B . You must live above me ’ ? ” says Mr. Dunkelman .
For his part , Mr. Dunkelman maintains a listserv of nearby neighbors and they ’ re using it to stay in contact and assist each other . Some have gone further .

Beyond offering a cup of sugar

To Marc Dunkelman, author of “The Vanishing Neighbor,” these neighborly responses to the coronavirus crisis are notable in their contrast to normal times.

Jeong , who currently works at the ███ Media site The Verge , was hired by the Times editorial board to work on technology issues . On Thursday , shortly after the hire was announced , conservative publications dug up old tweets of hers containing statements like “ white men are bullshit ” and “ oh man it ’ s kind of sick how much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men . ”
The campaign to use these tweets to get her fired seems to have failed . The Times issued a statement saying that Jeong had meant these tweets satirically — a parody of the hate she has received online as an Asian woman — and that they were standing by her .
But to some conservatives , like National Review ’ s David French and New York magazine ’ s Andrew Sullivan , Jeong ’ s tweets are bigger than her : They reveal a rot in the progressive movement , that “ social justice warriors ” have become totally okay with racism so long as it ’ s directed at white people .
Both French and Sullivan singled out a tweet I had sent defending Jeong — “ a lot of people on the internet today confusing the expressive way anti-racists and minorities talk about ‘ white people ’ with actual race-based hatred , for some unfathomable reason ” — as an exemplar of the problem . Sullivan explains :
I don ’ t think the New York Times should fire her — in part because they largely share her views on race , gender , and oppression . Their entire hiring and editorial process is based on them . In their mind , Jeong was merely caught defending herself . As ███ writer Zack Beauchamp put it : “ A lot of people on the internet today [ are ] confusing the expressive way antiracists and minorities talk about ‘ white people ’ with actual race-based hatred , for some unfathomable reason. ” I have to say that word “ expressive ” made me chuckle out loud . ( But would Beauchamp , I wonder , feel the same way if anti-racists talked about Jews in the same manner Jeong talks about whites ? Aren ’ t Jews included in the category of whites ? )
I have a lot of respect for Andrew — he gave me my first job in journalism , and I ’ ve been over to his DC condo more times than I can count — but I think he has a serious blind spot when it comes to race , and the analogy to Jews here helps reveal it . Both his piece and French ’ s misunderstand what racism is and how the so-called “ social justice left ” approaches the world — and the anti-Jeong vitriol you ’ ve seen from the right speaks more to its failings on race than it does anything about Jeong .
The basic thrust of both Sullivan and French ’ s argument is that if you subbed in any group other than “ white people ” for what Jeong wrote , then it would be obviously offensive . “ # cancelblackpeople probably wouldn ’ t fly at the New York Times , would it ? ” Sullivan asks , rhetorically .
The only reason lefties aren ’ t offended by this obvious race-based hatred , the argument goes , is that they see the world entirely through the lens of power . Since whites as a class have it , minorities by definition can not harbor racist attitudes toward them .
“ It is simply false to excuse anti-white racism on the grounds that people of color lack power , ” French writes . “ But this argument confuses the gravity of an offense with the existence of the offense . A powerless person ’ s hate may not harm the powerful , but it is still hate . ”
The problem here , though , is assuming that Jeong ’ s words were meant literally : that when Jeong wrote “ # cancelwhitepeople , ” for example , she was literally calling for white genocide . Or when she said “ white men are bullshit , ” she meant each and every white man is the human equivalent of bull feces . This is expressly Sullivan ’ s position : He calls her language “ eliminationist , ” a term most commonly used to describe Nazi rhetoric referring to Jews during the Holocaust .
To anyone who ’ s even passingly familiar with the way the social justice left talks , this is just clearly untrue . “ White people ” is a shorthand in these communities , one that ’ s used to capture the way that many whites still act in clueless and/or racist ways . It ’ s typically used satirically and hyperbolically to emphasize how white people continue to benefit ( even unknowingly ) from their skin color , or to point out the ways in which a power structure that favors white people continues to exist .
I get that white people who aren ’ t familiar might find this discomforting . Sullivan thinks it ’ s unacceptable on an “ an open-forum website like Twitter. ” But the reality is that Twitter is where these conversations between people of color are taking place , and ( given the 280-character limit ) it ’ s a lot easier to use the kind of “ white people ” shorthand rather than adding endless qualifications ( “ a certain kind of white person , definitely Not All White People , ” is pretty lengthy ) .
The sentence “ white people run America ” may use most of the same words as “ Jews run America , ” but the former is mostly true while the latter is an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory
What makes these quasi-satirical generalizations about “ white people ” different from actual racism is , yes , the underlying power structure in American society . There is no sense of threat associated with Jeong making a joke about how white people have dog-like opinions . But when white people have said the same about minorities , it has historically been a pretext for violence or justification for exclusionary politics .
This is why Sullivan ’ s use of “ eliminationist ” to describe Jeong ’ s words is , to my mind , particularly ill-chosen . Eliminationist language , in the way it ’ s used by scholars of genocide and racial oppression , is used as justification for concrete actions — the Holocaust is the textbook example , and the Rwandan genocide is another clear one . But the very idea that Sarah Jeong ’ s tweets reveal her desire to set up concentration camps for whites is laughable .
This is , incidentally , why you hear a lot of people on the social left say there ’ s no such thing as “ reverse racism. ” We interpret language through social context . Because of the way racial power structures are set up , the same set of words mean very different things when you swap out “ white people ” for “ black people , ” “ Asians , ” “ Jews , ” etc . The phrase might be racist in one context , in the sense of conveying actual racial animus , but not in another .
This meaning of the phrase “ white people ” is obvious to people who have been listening to these social media conversations , or even from even a cursory search of Twitter for the term . I ’ ve copied a few examples below :

Jeong ’ s tweets , in context , clearly fit this type of rhetoric . When she writes “ dumbass fucking white people marking up the internet with their opinions like dogs pissing on fire hydrants , ” she is not , as Sullivan accuses her of doing , “ equat [ ing whites ] with animals. ” Rather , she is commenting on the ubiquity of ( often uniformed ) white opinion on social media — a way of pointing out how nonwhite voices often don ’ t appear or get drowned out in social media discourse .
Again , this is obvious to people who are steeped in the kind of online communities Jeong spends time in . But what happened , as my colleague Aja Romano notes , is that a few alt-right websites pulled out Jeong ’ s tweets in a deliberate attempt to hurt her career and reputation . What ’ s actually happening here is a racist movement , the alt-right , trying to damage a left-wing woman of color — and mainstream conservatives are furthering their narrative .
I don ’ t necessarily blame Sullivan and French for not hanging out on Social Justice Twitter , where their views would be ... unwelcome , to say the least . What I do blame them for is joining an alt-right pile-on without trying to understand where their left-wing intellectual opponents are coming from and what they ’ re talking about .
In his column , Sullivan challenges me , specifically , to explain how I would feel if Jeong were tweeting about Jews rather than whites . “ Would Beauchamp , I wonder , feel the same way if anti-racists talked about Jews in the same manner Jeong talks about whites ? Aren ’ t Jews included in the category of whites ? ” he asks .
The example , I assume , is chosen deliberately : Andrew knows I ’ m Jewish and sensitive to the real problem of anti-Semitism on the left . So this seems like it should be a hard example for me , as a Jeong defender . But it ’ s not at all . In fact , it makes the distinction between what Jeong is doing even stronger .
First of all , not all Jews are white . Second , even for those Jews who are , our inclusion in the category of whiteness is historically contingent . For the modern alt-right — the people going after Jeong — Jews don ’ t actually count as white . Leading alt-right thinker Richard Spencer has said that in his ideal world , Jews would be expelled from the United States .
Jews are not marginalized in the exact same way that other minority groups are — on average , Jews are wealthier while black people are poorer — but there is deep-seated anti-Semitism in the United States and ( even more so ) in other Western countries . When you talk about “ Jews ” as a group , you aren ’ t just talking about a specific kind of white person ; you ’ re talking about a historically marginalized group , one that has experienced the consequences of actual eliminationist rhetoric firsthand .
And this is what the conservative critiques of Jeong — even the good-faith ones , like Sullivan ’ s and French ’ s — miss entirely . When you talk about race and identity , the context in which you ’ re operating is absolutely inescapable . The sentence “ white people run America ” may use most of the same words as “ Jews run America , ” but the former is mostly true while the latter is an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory .
Historical structures of oppression , along race and other identity lines , shape the way Americans see the world deeply and profoundly . Everything that ’ s said about minority groups is interpreted through the weight of these expectations . One study found that children start thinking in racist terms when they ’ re about 8 years old . It ’ s absurd to pretend , given centuries of racialized oppression , that the phrases “ white people ” and “ black people ” can be swapped in a sentence without profoundly changing the meaning .
This is indicative of a broader failing in the conservative movement .
The weight of history is typically minimized , with the success or failure of minority groups being seen in colorblind , individualized terms . If black people aren ’ t as wealthy as whites , it ’ s not the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow and redlining ; it ’ s because they ’ re lazy , or addicted to welfare , or ( as Sullivan has posited ) simply genetically less likely to be intelligent . There has to be some explanation other than the fact that everything in our society is structured around a longstanding racial caste system , one that persists even after the laws have been made on-face colorblind .
This isn ’ t a mere matter of there being a power differential between whites and various minority groups , as French would have it . It ’ s about the reasons there ’ s a power differential , and how those reasons shape even the very meaning of the words we speak . A blindness to history , and the patterns set by people long dead , is a characteristic of conservative race thinking ( and a somewhat ironic one , given conservative reverence for tradition ) .
I want to close on some more recent history : a similar debate that happened online in 2014 .
The issue then was gender . A number of feminist writers had a habit of writing about “ men ” on social media without qualification like “ most ” or “ the majority of. ” This was partly for simplicity ’ s sake , and partly to point out how widespread a lot of sexist practices are . This led to a lot of responses from men they didn ’ t know , saying something along the lines of “ not all men are sexist , and you ’ re the real sexist for saying they are. ” National Review , French ’ s publication , published an entire column making a basically similar argument .
The feminist writers responded that this was a distraction . It was obvious they weren ’ t talking about literally every man in context , and it was clear these men were butting in on conversations about gender to derail them with a pointlessly persnickety objection rather than dealing with the substantive conversation about sexism . So the feminist writers responded by turning the phrase “ not all men ” into a point of mockery , using it as an example of men sidetracking feminist arguments that made them uncomfortable .
The feminists won this argument ; today , feminists still complain about “ men , ” and “ not all men ” is mostly used as a punchline rather than a serious argument . But the conservative responses to Jeong boil down , essentially , to the same thing : They ’ re saying “ not all white people ” are bad and Jeong is a racist for implying that they are .
My guess is , a few years down the road , we ’ ll remember the Jeong episode in roughly the same way we remember the # NotAllMen controversy today .","Conservatives are up in arms over the New York Times’s latest hire: a tech writer named Sarah Jeong whom they allege to be racist against white people.

Jeong, who currently works at the Vox Media site The Verge, was hired by the Times editorial board to work on technology issues. On Thursday, shortly after the hire was announced, conservative publications dug up old tweets of hers containing statements like “white men are bullshit” and “oh man it’s kind of sick how much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men.”

The campaign to use these tweets to get her fired seems to have failed. The Times issued a statement saying that Jeong had meant these tweets satirically — a parody of the hate she has received online as an Asian woman — and that they were standing by her.

But to some conservatives, like National Review’s David French and New York magazine’s Andrew Sullivan, Jeong’s tweets are bigger than her: They reveal a rot in the progressive movement, that “social justice warriors” have become totally okay with racism so long as it’s directed at white people.

“The neo-Marxist analysis of society, in which we are all mere appendages of various groups of oppressors and oppressed, and in which the oppressed definitionally cannot be at fault, is now the governing philosophy of almost all liberal media,” Sullivan writes. “That’s how ... the New York Times can hire and defend someone who expresses racial hatred.” (Note: The liberal media is not neo-Marxist.)

Both French and Sullivan singled out a tweet I had sent defending Jeong — “a lot of people on the internet today confusing the expressive way anti-racists and minorities talk about ‘white people’ with actual race-based hatred, for some unfathomable reason” — as an exemplar of the problem. Sullivan explains:

I don’t think the New York Times should fire her — in part because they largely share her views on race, gender, and oppression. Their entire hiring and editorial process is based on them. In their mind, Jeong was merely caught defending herself. As Vox writer Zack Beauchamp put it: “A lot of people on the internet today [are] confusing the expressive way antiracists and minorities talk about ‘white people’ with actual race-based hatred, for some unfathomable reason.” I have to say that word “expressive” made me chuckle out loud. (But would Beauchamp, I wonder, feel the same way if anti-racists talked about Jews in the same manner Jeong talks about whites? Aren’t Jews included in the category of whites?)

I have a lot of respect for Andrew — he gave me my first job in journalism, and I’ve been over to his DC condo more times than I can count — but I think he has a serious blind spot when it comes to race, and the analogy to Jews here helps reveal it. Both his piece and French’s misunderstand what racism is and how the so-called “social justice left” approaches the world — and the anti-Jeong vitriol you’ve seen from the right speaks more to its failings on race than it does anything about Jeong.

Why Sarah Jeong’s tweets weren’t racist

The basic thrust of both Sullivan and French’s argument is that if you subbed in any group other than “white people” for what Jeong wrote, then it would be obviously offensive. “#cancelblackpeople probably wouldn’t fly at the New York Times, would it?” Sullivan asks, rhetorically.

The only reason lefties aren’t offended by this obvious race-based hatred, the argument goes, is that they see the world entirely through the lens of power. Since whites as a class have it, minorities by definition cannot harbor racist attitudes toward them.

“It is simply false to excuse anti-white racism on the grounds that people of color lack power,” French writes. “But this argument confuses the gravity of an offense with the existence of the offense. A powerless person’s hate may not harm the powerful, but it is still hate.”

The problem here, though, is assuming that Jeong’s words were meant literally: that when Jeong wrote “#cancelwhitepeople,” for example, she was literally calling for white genocide. Or when she said “white men are bullshit,” she meant each and every white man is the human equivalent of bull feces. This is expressly Sullivan’s position: He calls her language “eliminationist,” a term most commonly used to describe Nazi rhetoric referring to Jews during the Holocaust.

To anyone who’s even passingly familiar with the way the social justice left talks, this is just clearly untrue. “White people” is a shorthand in these communities, one that’s used to capture the way that many whites still act in clueless and/or racist ways. It’s typically used satirically and hyperbolically to emphasize how white people continue to benefit (even unknowingly) from their skin color, or to point out the ways in which a power structure that favors white people continues to exist.

I get that white people who aren’t familiar might find this discomforting. Sullivan thinks it’s unacceptable on an “an open-forum website like Twitter.” But the reality is that Twitter is where these conversations between people of color are taking place, and (given the 280-character limit) it’s a lot easier to use the kind of “white people” shorthand rather than adding endless qualifications (“a certain kind of white person, definitely Not All White People,” is pretty lengthy).

The sentence “white people run America” may use most of the same words as “Jews run America,” but the former is mostly true while the latter is an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory

What makes these quasi-satirical generalizations about “white people” different from actual racism is, yes, the underlying power structure in American society. There is no sense of threat associated with Jeong making a joke about how white people have dog-like opinions. But when white people have said the same about minorities, it has historically been a pretext for violence or justification for exclusionary politics.

#NotAllWhites

Chick-fil-A 's disappointing decision to discontinue donations to `` controversial '' Christian charities is emblematic of the power of political correctness and the bullying left that drives it . If the previously stalwart Chick-fil-A folds , who is left standing to fight ?
Tireless , intolerant LGBTQ activists bombarded the restaurant chain with protests and accusations about it being `` anti-gay . '' The gist of its sin is that it has donated millions of dollars to The Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes , which have historically opposed same-sex marriage .
Just this week , the restaurant chain announced it has stopped funding these two charities . `` We made multi-year commitments to both organizations and we fulfilled those obligations in 2018 , '' said a spokeswoman for the company . She added that the company would focus its giving on `` education , homelessness and hunger . ''
The Salvation Army issued a statement expressing that it was `` saddened '' by this development . `` We serve more than 23 million individuals a year , including those in the LGBTQ+ community , '' the statement reads . `` In fact , we believe we are the largest provider of poverty relief to the LGBTQ+ population . ''
You see , it 's not about being anti-gay at all . It 's about dictating to people how they must think , what they may or may not say , and to whom they may contribute . Indeed , Chick-fil-A has been savaged in the past for its charitable donations and for CEO Dan Cathy 's public opposition to same-sex marriage . Chick-fil-A had , to this point , demonstrated admirable courage and commitment to its principles by enduring this criticism and pressing forward without caving to the PC thought police . In the end , however , it just could n't stand the heat .
The irony is that the company 's contrition wo n't win it any points , for leftist activists are never satisfied unless you go beyond capitulation to abject groveling and become a full-throated ambassador for their views .
`` If Chick-Fil-A is serious about their pledge to stop holding hands with divisive anti-LGBTQ activists , then further transparency is needed regarding their deep ties to organizations like Focus on the Family , which exist purely to harm LGBTQ people and families , '' said Drew Anderson , GLAAD 's director of campaigns and rapid response , in a statement .
We are living at a time when the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes , both of which are dedicated to winning souls for Jesus Christ , are considered by huge swaths of our culture to be outright evil . This inversion of our moral standards is consistent with the left 's support -- and eerie glorification -- of abortion on demand to the point of birth and beyond .
Notice that it is n't Chick-fil-A , the Salvation Army or the Fellowship of Christian Athletes who are casting anyone as evil . It is quite the other way around . These organizations are n't calling for the muzzling of contrary opinions , though one may wonder whether Chick-fil-A might eventually be pushed to that point .
There is no appeasing the left unless the offender is willing to deny himself and his heart . I detail this phenomenon in my book `` Guilty by Reason of Insanity : Why the Democrats Must Not Win , '' and it is no trifling matter .
Let me give you a few examples . Former Vice President Joe Biden was shamed into retracting his gracious statement on Vice President Mike Pence being a `` decent guy . '' The left would n't let that innocuous comment stand , and Biden dutifully apologized . Actor Mark Duplass was badgered into apologizing for having said that conservative Ben Shapiro was kind and fair to him . Conservatives must be ostracized . Kevin Hart was pressured into withdrawing as host of the Academy Awards for a decade-old joke . His withdrawal and apology were n't enough . One progressive writer said that apologizing is like a math problem . To get credit , you have to show your work . To achieve atonement , he had to show his `` changed life '' through his actions . NBC News ' Tom Brokaw profusely apologized when he opined that `` Hispanics should work harder at assimilation . '' But that was insufficient . Some called on NBC to produce a series on American Hispanics , to contribute money to the National Association of Hispanic Journalists and to increase diversity among `` Meet the Press '' guests .
There are tons of other examples , but even more disturbing than the left 's implacability is that so many people on the left and the right knuckle under to this bullying . They are bludgeoned into not only apologizing when they 've done nothing wrong but also publicly renouncing their heartfelt views .
In interviews for my book , many hosts ask me what advice I have for conservatives who seek to stem the tide of leftism overtaking our culture and our political system . One answer is that we must quit downplaying the left 's systematic assaults on our society and begin to fight with the same level of persistence .

Chick-fil-A's disappointing decision to discontinue donations to ""controversial"" Christian charities is emblematic of the power of political correctness and the bullying left that drives it. If the previously stalwart Chick-fil-A folds, who is left standing to fight?

Tireless, intolerant LGBTQ activists bombarded the restaurant chain with protests and accusations about it being ""anti-gay."" The gist of its sin is that it has donated millions of dollars to The Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which have historically opposed same-sex marriage.

Just this week, the restaurant chain announced it has stopped funding these two charities. ""We made multi-year commitments to both organizations and we fulfilled those obligations in 2018,"" said a spokeswoman for the company. She added that the company would focus its giving on ""education, homelessness and hunger.""

The Salvation Army issued a statement expressing that it was ""saddened"" by this development. ""We serve more than 23 million individuals a year, including those in the LGBTQ+ community,"" the statement reads. ""In fact, we believe we are the largest provider of poverty relief to the LGBTQ+ population.""

You see, it's not about being anti-gay at all. It's about dictating to people how they must think, what they may or may not say, and to whom they may contribute. Indeed, Chick-fil-A has been savaged in the past for its charitable donations and for CEO Dan Cathy's public opposition to same-sex marriage. Chick-fil-A had, to this point, demonstrated admirable courage and commitment to its principles by enduring this criticism and pressing forward without caving to the PC thought police. In the end, however, it just couldn't stand the heat.

The irony is that the company's contrition won't win it any points, for leftist activists are never satisfied unless you go beyond capitulation to abject groveling and become a full-throated ambassador for their views.

""If Chick-Fil-A is serious about their pledge to stop holding hands with divisive anti-LGBTQ activists, then further transparency is needed regarding their deep ties to organizations like Focus on the Family, which exist purely to harm LGBTQ people and families,"" said Drew Anderson, GLAAD's director of campaigns and rapid response, in a statement.

We are living at a time when the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, both of which are dedicated to winning souls for Jesus Christ, are considered by huge swaths of our culture to be outright evil. This inversion of our moral standards is consistent with the left's support -- and eerie glorification -- of abortion on demand to the point of birth and beyond.

Notice that it isn't Chick-fil-A, the Salvation Army or the Fellowship of Christian Athletes who are casting anyone as evil. It is quite the other way around. These organizations aren't calling for the muzzling of contrary opinions, though one may wonder whether Chick-fil-A might eventually be pushed to that point.

There is no appeasing the left unless the offender is willing to deny himself and his heart. I detail this phenomenon in my book ""Guilty by Reason of Insanity: Why the Democrats Must Not Win,"" and it is no trifling matter.

Let me give you a few examples. Former Vice President Joe Biden was shamed into retracting his gracious statement on Vice President Mike Pence being a ""decent guy."" The left wouldn't let that innocuous comment stand, and Biden dutifully apologized. Actor Mark Duplass was badgered into apologizing for having said that conservative Ben Shapiro was kind and fair to him. Conservatives must be ostracized. Kevin Hart was pressured into withdrawing as host of the Academy Awards for a decade-old joke. His withdrawal and apology weren't enough. One progressive writer said that apologizing is like a math problem. To get credit, you have to show your work. To achieve atonement, he had to show his ""changed life"" through his actions. NBC News' Tom Brokaw profusely apologized when he opined that ""Hispanics should work harder at assimilation."" But that was insufficient. Some called on NBC to produce a series on American Hispanics, to contribute money to the National Association of Hispanic Journalists and to increase diversity among ""Meet the Press"" guests.

There are tons of other examples, but even more disturbing than the left's implacability is that so many people on the left and the right knuckle under to this bullying. They are bludgeoned into not only apologizing when they've done nothing wrong but also publicly renouncing their heartfelt views.

In interviews for my book, many hosts ask me what advice I have for conservatives who seek to stem the tide of leftism overtaking our culture and our political system. One answer is that we must quit downplaying the left's systematic assaults on our society and begin to fight with the same level of persistence. This requires maintaining the courage of our convictions and standing up against the PC bullying of the tyrannical left, which can be very difficult, as shown by the Chick-fil-A example. Let this be a wake-up call for all patriots and those who still embrace the ideas and values that have made this nation uniquely great.

What’s happening

On May 25, a 17-year-old recorded a video that changed the world. Darnella Frazier’s video of the police killing of George Floyd sparked mass protests across the United States, leading to a racial reckoning that is continuing to affect nearly all parts of society.

The video and clips from it drew the attention of millions. The officers onscreen have been arrested and charged, and in the weeks since, countless videos of police brutality have appeared on social media. Other videos of police brutality against Black people, including Philando Castile, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice and countless others, have also spurred calls for police reform and antiracism.

There’s a long history of widely shared images of Black people in pain or dying. During the Civil War era, an image of the raised scars on the back of an escaped slave galvanized Northerners to sympathize with abolitionist movements. But in the late 1800s and early 1900s, white people created “lynching postcards,” sharing images of the killings of Black people with friends and family. As technology evolved, more Black people started documenting atrocities themselves — from Ida B. Wells’s work chronicling lynchings to photos of Emmett Till’s mutilated body. The images of Till, which were published in Black newspapers, are credited with helping shock people into supporting the civil rights movement.

Why there’s debate

Most people agree that the documentation of these incidents is historically valuable. Videos provide proof of what happened, acting as evidence in the pursuit of justice. However, there is debate over how such videos should be treated by the general public and the press, especially in the age of social media.

Some say there is value in videos like these going viral. They can galvanize movements and bring attention to an incident, which helps pressure authorities to respond. In recent weeks, several videos have led to disciplinary action. Images and videos also force people to face the truth: Though decades apart, the mothers of both Till and Elijah McClain said they want people to see photos of their dead Black sons and bear witness to what happened to them.

But others point out that videos of police brutality have been going viral for years and there hasn’t been systemic change. The circumstances that led to the incident in the first place are still in place, they say. Millions of views and shares aren’t the same as a conviction, they say. Plus, Black, indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) shouldn’t have to film police brutality and racism to prove they exist. The mass dissemination of these videos also leads to ethical questions over who has the privilege of suffering in private, as the bulk are BIPOC — it’s rare to see a viral video of a white person in pain.

Finally, there’s the psychological effects of these videos. Psychologists say Black people can be traumatized by viewing these videos repeatedly. Experts also worry that watching too many videos of police brutality leads to dehumanization of Black people in the videos and desensitizes non-BIPOC to their pain.

What’s next

As the racial reckoning continues and more videos of police brutality and other incidents emerge, some experts recommend that we consume and engage with these videos in a more thoughtful manner.

The Food and Drug Administration released a warning statement on June 19 saying consumers should not buy hand sanitizer products from the Mexico-based manufacturer Eskbiochem. The warning comes after the FDA discovered methanol, or wood alcohol, in these products. Methanol can be dangerous when ingested or absorbed through the skin, and it can be fatal in large quantities.

""Methanol is not an acceptable ingredient for hand sanitizers and should not be used due to its toxic effects,"" the FDA cautions in its letter.

The demand for hand sanitizers is still high as the coronavirus pandemic resurges, which makes the recent health warning even more jarring. Many people can't find their usual hand sanitizer online or in stores, so they turn to new brands that may or may not have manufactured hand sanitizer before the coronavirus pandemic.

Eskbiochem manufactures several brands of hand sanitizer:

All-Clean Hand Sanitizer

Esk Biochem Hand Sanitizer

CleanCare NoGerm Advanced Hand Sanitizer 75% Alcohol

Lavar 70 Gel Hand Sanitizer

The Good Gel Antibacterial Gel Hand Sanitizer

CleanCare NoGerm Advanced Hand Sanitizer 80% Alcohol

CleanCare NoGerm Advanced Hand Sanitizer 75% Alcohol

CleanCare NoGerm Advanced Hand Sanitizer 80% Alcohol

Saniderm Advanced Hand Sanitizer

The FDA encourages consumers not to buy the above brands of hand sanitizer after FDA testing revealed high methanol concentrations in two Eskbiochem hand sanitizer products, Lavar Gel and CleanCare No Germ.

Lavar Gel contains more than 80% methanol and no ethyl alcohol, which is the main FDA-approved ingredient for use in hand sanitizers. CleanCare No Germ contains nearly 30% methanol, the FDA found. As of June 23, the FDA reports no cases of harmful health effects associated with the Eskbiochem hand sanitizers, but urges caution nonetheless.

If you have used a hand sanitizer with methanol in the last few months, throw it out. The FDA advises that you seek medical treatment immediately if you've been exposed to methanol, because intervention is required to reverse the toxic effects of methanol poisoning.

Everyone exposed to methanol is at risk for methanol poisoning, but young children are especially susceptible, the FDA says.

Conservatives who enter progressive domains like the academy or elite media are quite familiar with the idea of tolerance . Such institutions place an enormous amount of emphasis on it , in fact , so much so that they reserve the right to be intolerant to preserve the tolerant ethos of the community , sometimes explicitly . In one of my favorite First Amendment cases , I sued a university that declared in no uncertain terms , “ Acts of intolerance will not be tolerated . ”
Yes , it used those exact words . Think for a moment — isn ’ t every act of enforcement a new violation that requires a new act of enforcement , triggering another violation ? Ah , never mind . We know what the university wanted , a catch-all provision it could use to expel , punish , and silence anyone who ran afoul of the prevailing campus orthodoxy .
But I don ’ t want to focus on intolerance . Let ’ s talk about tolerance , instead . Earlier this week I read an old post by “ Scott Alexander , ” a pseudonymous psychiatrist who writes at the blog Slate Star Codex . Called “ I can tolerate anything except the outgroup , ” it blows up the notion that the kind of inclusion the Left claims it values bears any relationship at all to true tolerance .
As Alexander notes , a person on the left will claim that they ’ re tolerant because of their regard for “ gays , lesbians , bisexuals , asexuals , blacks , Hispanics , Asians , transgender people , and Jews. ” But ask that same person a simple question , “ What ’ s wrong with gay people ? ” and the answer is immediate : “ What do you think I am , some kind of homophobic bigot ? Of course I have nothing against gay people . ”
Then , guess what , you ’ re not tolerating anything . You ’ re mistaking tolerance for fellowship or tolerance for tribalism . The word “ tolerance ” of course implies that there is something to tolerate .
To the very marrow of their being , they believe that they ’ re something they ’ re not . They have taken the vice of their particular brand of tribalism and transformed it into the false virtue of fake tolerance .
I like Alexander ’ s definition of true tolerance : “ Respect and kindness toward members of an outgroup ” — not respect and kindness toward members of what others would define as an outgroup , but rather respect and kindness toward people that are out of your group . His concept reflects Christian values like grace or charity , which imply that there is something to forgive or something to overlook in your relationships with others . When there is nothing to forgive or nothing to overlook and no patience required , there ’ s no tolerance . There ’ s no grace . There ’ s no charity .
The result of this flawed understanding is that millions of people misapprehend their own values . To the very marrow of their being , they believe that they ’ re something they ’ re not . They have taken the vice of their particular brand of tribalism and transformed it into the false virtue of fake tolerance .
To be clear , there are some progressives who are wise to this game . They ’ ve read their Herbert Marcuse , and they know quite well that the new tolerance — what Marcuse called “ liberating tolerance ” — means “ intolerance against movements from the Right and toleration of movements from the Left. ” But most progressives haven ’ t read Marcuse . They ’ ve never heard of him , and they ’ d be shocked at the notion that one of the alleged defining characteristics of their lives is a fiction .
I ’ m of course thinking of all this in connection with The Atlantic ’ s termination of my friend and former colleague Kevin Williamson yesterday . The justification for Kevin ’ s firing — as repeated endlessly on Twitter — is that women don ’ t want to “ share office space with a man who wants them dead. ” There are two easy responses to this assertion .
First , it ’ s false . As Kevin has explained elsewhere , he ’ s generally against the death penalty , he ’ s against lynching , and he ’ s against ex post facto laws . So , no , women would not be sharing office space with someone who “ wants them dead . ”
Second , is there no appreciation for Kevin ’ s tolerance ? He ’ s the son of a teen mom , born shortly before Roe v. Wade , and narrowly escaped being aborted . He ’ d be sharing office space with people who believe it would have been totally fine , completely morally acceptable , and possibly virtuous if a doctor had ripped him to pieces in his mother ’ s womb .
The bottom line is that one party in this controversy — Kevin Williamson — was willing to be tolerant . As Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg related in his termination memo , Kevin had been “ nothing but professional ” in his interactions . In other words , Kevin had “ shown kindness and respect toward members of [ his ] outgroup . ”
But all too many progressives don ’ t see that . To them , there was nothing for Kevin to tolerate . Their views on abortion aren ’ t just tolerable , they ’ re glorious . They ’ re liberating . They ’ re the linchpin of the sexual revolution , the key to women ’ s liberation . What was intolerable was the notion that a man — no matter how courteous and professional in person — could sit next to them advocating ideas they hate .

Why do so many progressives fundamentally misunderstand the term?

Conservatives who enter progressive domains like the academy or elite media are quite familiar with the idea of tolerance. Such institutions place an enormous amount of emphasis on it, in fact, so much so that they reserve the right to be intolerant to preserve the tolerant ethos of the community, sometimes explicitly. In one of my favorite First Amendment cases, I sued a university that declared in no uncertain terms, “Acts of intolerance will not be tolerated.”

Yes, it used those exact words. Think for a moment — isn’t every act of enforcement a new violation that requires a new act of enforcement, triggering another violation? Ah, never mind. We know what the university wanted, a catch-all provision it could use to expel, punish, and silence anyone who ran afoul of the prevailing campus orthodoxy.

But I don’t want to focus on intolerance. Let’s talk about tolerance, instead. Earlier this week I read an old post by “Scott Alexander,” a pseudonymous psychiatrist who writes at the blog Slate Star Codex. Called “I can tolerate anything except the outgroup,” it blows up the notion that the kind of inclusion the Left claims it values bears any relationship at all to true tolerance.

Of course I have nothing against gay people.”

They’re the linchpin of the sexual revolution, the key to women’s liberation. What was intolerable was the notion that a man — no matter how courteous and professional in person — could sit next to them advocating ideas they hate.

There is a conversation to be had about whether a writer’s views should disqualify him from employment at any given magazine. Mission-driven journals, like Reason or The Nation or National Review, hire people who share and broadly advance the mission of the magazine (while of course permitting and encouraging debate from within their respective ideological camps). Journals like The Atlantic at least seem to aspire to something different. They’re left-leaning, to be sure, but do not have an explicit ideological bent.

But in polarized times, “of no party or clique” is a hard space to occupy. It requires moral courage. It requires the ability to withstand considerable internal and external pressure. It requires the ability to treat with respect and kindness even people you might otherwise despise. The Atlantic has the right to define its own mission and message. It has the right to hire and fire writers according to their viewpoints. It’s not the government. It’s a private actor with its own rights to free speech and freedom of association.

culture,The Dispatch,2,https://thedispatch.com/p/the-gops-conspiracy-theorist-problem,The GOP’s Conspiracy Theorist Problem,,Audrey Fahlberg,"The Republican Party let out a collective sigh of relief when Steve King—a soon-to-be-former Iowa congressman known for his racist and nativist rhetoric—lost his re-election primary in early June . But Republicans are still in a bind . In a partisan political climate that has sown the seeds for fringe candidates to win elections , the GOP is struggling to distance itself from conspiracy-mongering nominees without surrendering key districts to Democratic opponents .
Much of this can be traced to the QAnon conspiracy theory . Back in 2016 , “ Pizzagate ” gained national attention when a man who believed that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta were running a child-trafficking ring out of the Comet Ping Pong pizza restaurant in Washington , D.C. , went into the establishment and fired a rifle .
No one was hurt , and the outlandish claims were quickly debunked . But the vile conspiracy theory didn ’ t totally die . It lingered in dark corners of the internet . And then in 2017 , an anonymous user named Q—self-dubbed for his alleged Q level security clearance—took the reins and began posting claims that Clinton would be arrested , adding other allegedly classified intel about her on a public messaging board called “ 4chan. ” Mesmerized by Q ’ s cryptic clues ( which were , in reality , baseless rumors ) , anonymous users began obsessively tracking his posts and the QAnon movement took hold .
According to conspiracy theory expert and University of Miami professor Joseph Oscinski , Q adopted the Pizzagate theory , “ predicting that Donald Trump would be victorious in the battle against the satanic , pedophile , child sex trafficking deep state. ” Anons believe “ that imminently the ‘ Great Awakening ’ is going to happen in which all of the elites who have been engaged in these evil activities are going to be exposed for the evildoers they are , and shipped down to Guantanamo and summarily hung for their crimes . ”
It sounds far-fetched , like the plot of a bad movie . But now , in 2020 several dozen GOP candidates who align themselves with QAnon have run or are running for Congress . Some have snuck onto the ballot in districts where Democrats dominate and the GOP invests few resources in recruiting candidates . Most have lost primaries and won ’ t be on the ballot in the fall .
But GOP primary candidates Lauren Boebert , Marjorie Greene , and Jo Rae Perkins have won the hearts of Republican voters in their states . While Perkins secured a Senate primary victory in Oregon and Boebert ousted a Trump-backed incumbent in Colorado ’ s 3rd District primary , Greene is well on her way to win a House GOP primary runoff in Georgia . Laura Loomer—a Republican primary candidate in Florida ’ s 21st District—doesn ’ t endorse QAnon , but her provocative and bizarre behavior is problematic for other reasons .
Together , they represent a growing problem for Republican leaders : What do you do when your voters choose candidates who espouse fringe , sometimes crazy views ? The answer , at least so far ? It depends .
QAnon ’ s Oregon contender , Jo Rae Perkins , has no realistic shot at beating her Democratic incumbent , Sen. Jeff Merkley . But she won nearly 200,000 votes in her GOP primary—earning almost 50 percent of the vote in a four-person race—and she has garnered national headlines for some of her bolder proclamations . Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Greene , however , have a real chance at winning the general election in each of their districts . Although a few Republican lawmakers have publicly condemned their campaigns , others have remained silent on the matter or gone so far as to offer endorsements .
If QAnon sounds like gibberish to you , polls show you ’ re not alone . A Pew Research poll from March 2020 shows that only 3 percent of Americans know “ a lot ” about the theory , whereas 76 percent of those polled know “ nothing at all. ” But the movement still has a huge following on social media platforms , especially Twitter and YouTube , where some accounts boast hundreds of thousands of followers .
QAnon ’ s doomsday flair has even captured the attention of fringe churches , including Omega Kingdom Ministry , which regularly interprets Q drops through a biblical lens . Its pastor , Russ Wagner—who sports a long beard , bears a striking resemblance to KFC ’ s Colonel Sanders , and preaches in front of an American flag backdrop—regularly live-streams YouTube sermons to the channel ’ s 5.4 thousand subscribers . The church is also affiliated with “ Home Congregations , ” a site with extremely disturbing videos narrated by a woman with an ambiguous accent , who warns against Satan-worshipping pedophiles in the Democratic establishment and beyond .
Although QAnon ’ s following is just a small part of the dark web , what it lacks in reach it makes up for in intensity , resulting in a groundswell of support for certain fringe candidates .
Lauren Boebert is the latest QAnon conspiracy sympathizer to inch toward Congress after beating her Trump-backed incumbent opponent , Rep. Scott Tipton , by 9 points in Colorado ’ s 3rd District Republican primary . President Trump endorsed Tipton the day before the runoff , but he was quick to congratulate Boebert on “ a really great win ! ” on Twitter . She even snagged a congratulatory endorsement from former deputy prime minister of Italy , Matteo Salvani , a neo-nationalist populist , following her win .
“ This is a Republican seat and will remain a Republican seat as Nancy Pelosi and senior House Democrats continue peddling their radical conspiracy theories and pushing their radical cancel culture , ” said National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Tom Emmer in a statement .
With a Twitter bio that proclaims “ Running in Colorado ’ s 3rd to get rid of RINOs , ” Boebert will face off Democratic primary winner Diane Mitsch Bush—who lost to Tipton in 2018—in the general election . In a reliably Republican district that Trump won by a 12 point margin in 2016 , Mitsch Bush ’ s progressive agenda will likely leave Boebert smooth sailing to November ’ s general election .
“ Colorado deserves a fighter who will stand up for freedom , who believes in America and who is willing to take on all the left-wing lunatics who are trying so hard to ruin our country , ” Boebert said in a press release after her primary win . Boebert gained national recognition at a Beto O ’ Rourke rally in September 2019 when she told the former presidential candidate , “ Hell no , you won ’ t take our guns , ” while sporting a glock on her hip . The comment landed her a Fox News appearance the following December .
A die-hard Second Amendment defender who hails from Rifle , Colorado , Boebert owns Shooter ’ s Grill , where she encourages her staff to open-carry while serving customers . She also recently defied Colorado ’ s stay-at-home order by reopening her restaurant in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic , which was met by a temporary suspension of her restaurant license by the county .
When pressed on her knowledge of QAnon on the “ Steel Truth ” show in May , she said , “ I am familiar with that . And , so , that ’ s more my mom ’ s thing . She ’ s a little fringe . I try to uh , I just try to keep things on track and positive . I am very familiar with it though . ”
“ Everything I heard of Q — I hope that this is real because it only means America is getting stronger and better , and people are returning to conservative values , and that 's what I am for , ” she added . The conspiracy “ is only motivating and encouraging and bringing people together , stronger , and if this is real , then it could be really great for our country . ”
If Boebert offered only a halting embrace of the QAnon conspiracies , Marjorie Greene has shown no such hesitancy . And she ’ s currently a favorite to end up in Congress .
Like Boebert , Greene has captured attention for her brash , own-the-libs campaign strategy , and is expected to win Georgia ’ s fourteenth district seat in the general election . After winning a June 9 primary with nearly twice the number of votes as the runner-up , Greene will be facing Dr. John Cowan in the next primary on August 11 .
Greene uploaded a video in 2017 in which she declared , “ Q is a patriot , we know that for sure , but we do not know who Q is. ” She proceeded to say , “ but I ’ m going to tell you about it , because I think it ’ s something worth listening to and paying attention to , ” adding that “ many of the things that he has given clues about and talked about on 4chan and other forums have really proven to be true . ”
The rest of the nearly 30-minute video—which is still up as of today—consists of Greene unspooling outlandish conspiracy theories , one of her favorites being Hillary Clinton ’ s alleged sacrifice of a chicken in her backyard to the ancient Canaanite deity Moloch . After explaining Q ’ s prophetic Great Awakening in which deep state Democrats will be held accountable for their sins , Greene says “ I really truly pray that this is true . ”
“ We know cults are real and we know real evil exists , but it hides in the darkness , ” she warns , “ because it doesn ’ t wan na get caught , because when Satanic worshippers and real evil comes out and it ’ s pulled out into the light it can ’ t survive , it just can ’ t survive . ”
“ Now , there ’ s a once in a lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan worshipping pedophiles out , and I think we have the president to do it , so I ’ m very excited about that ” she says with a smile .
More recently , Politico uncovered recordings in which Greene said African Americans “ are held slaves to the Democratic Party ” and that she would feel proud to see Confederate monuments if she were black because they demonstrate the progress American has made since the Civil War . “ I know a ton of white people that are as lazy and sorry and probably worse than black people , ” Greene said on the topic of black unemployment . “ And that has everything to do with their bad choices and their personal responsibility . That is not a skin-color issue . ”
She called the 2018 House midterms “ an Islamic invasion of our government ” —clearly alluding to the victories by Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib—and said that “ anyone that is a Muslim that believes in Sharia law does not belong in our government . ”
Drew Florio , a spokesman for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , said “ These comments are appalling and Leader McCarthy has no tolerance for them. ” Reps. Liz Cheney ( R-Wyoming ) and Steve Scalise ( R-Louisiana ) are among other key Republicans who have denounced her campaign . The National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Chris Pack said NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer is “ personally disgusted by this rhetoric and condemns it in the strongest possible terms . ”
Georgia Reps. Austin Scott , Buddy Carter , and Drew Ferguson have publicly endorsed Greene ’ s opponent . But Georgia Sens . Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue , along with Gov . Brian Kemp , have been noticeably silent on the matter , despite numerous requests for comment .
And other key players in the new Republican establishment have rallied behind her . Although Rep. Jody Hice rescinded his support for her campaign the day after Politico released its story , Reps. Jim Jordan ( R-Ohio ) and House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs ( R-Arizona ) stand by their endorsements .
The National Association for Gun Rights PAC also endorsed Greene ’ s campaign , persuaded by her stalwart defense of the Second Amendment . “ It ’ s good to see a female say things like that , ” said the organization ’ s president Dudley Brown in an interview with ███ . “ It ’ s got the ‘ I ’ m the mama bear and I ’ m gon na protect not my family , but I ’ m gon na go to Congress and do my part to stop politicians from threatening your family . ’ ”
███ sought answers from Greene ’ s campaign about the race and initially we received no response . But after the distancing from national Republicans earlier in June , the campaign sent us a statement . Greene said she will not let her enemies “ whip [ her ] into submission , ” and that she ’ s “ sick-and-tired of watching establishment Republicans play defense while the Fake News Media cheers on Antifa terrorists , BLM rioters , and the woke cancel culture , as they burn our cities , loot our businesses , vandalize our memorials , and divide our nation . ”
On Wednesday , her campaign manager Isaiah Whartman informed ███ that Greene is suing her opponent in response to the “ defamatory television commercial ” his campaign aired that day .
In a letter obtained by ███ , Greene ’ s lawyer , L. Lin Wood , alleges that Dr. Cowan ’ s commercial “ [ accuses ] Ms. Greene and Taylor Commercial , Inc. of refusing to use a federally required program known as EVerify , ” and “ falsely [ asserts ] that Taylor Commercial , Inc. was not found under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ’ s EVerify website. ” The letter says Dr. Cowan is liable for economic damages for defamation .
No doubt this lawsuit will spice up the race before the candidates face off again in the district ’ s August primary .
Oregon Senate primary winner Jo Rae Perkins is also an avowed QAnon believer . She was eager to talk to ███ about her affinity for Trumpism and hatred of the mainstream media . She has been open about public embrace of the QAnon conspiracy movement , having recently disavowed her own campaign ’ s attempt to dissociate her from the conspiracy .
Perkins—who says she gets her news from the Epoch Times , Fox News , and various podcasts—explained that QAnon uses the Socratic method to crowdsource information . “ We ’ re encouraged to do our own critical thinking and our own research , ” she said in solidarity with the movement , saying it ’ s “ kind of like putting together a massive puzzle . ”
“ If we dare look at something that they didn ’ t put out it ’ s a conspiracy , that it has to be wrong because they didn ’ t sanction it. ” She assured me that she is just a “ mainstream American ” trying to set the facts straight .
But then she ’ ll say something with a hint of conspiracy—wondering , for example , how Black Lives Matter protesters so quickly produced masks that said “ Defund the Police ” days after Floyd was murdered . “ It could be totally organic , ” adding a caveat , “ then again it might not be . ”
Perkins alleged that money being donated to Black Lives Matter—a movement which she believes has “ gotten out of hand ” —is really being funneled into Act Blue and the Democratic Party , a claim ███ Fact Check recently debunked .
“ And this is where I ’ m going to get myself in trouble and I recognize that , ” she said , before proceeding . Perkins then alleged that the Black Lives Matter has been “ co-opted ” to victimize African Americans . Perkins added she had faith in far-right pundit Candace Owens , whom she believes is well-suited to put a stop to it . “ We seem to see this thing happening on four-year cycles that kind of coincide with the presidential election , ” she said .
On the topic of George Floyd , she said “ it certainly looks very damning for that police officer , but in our country you ’ re innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt , ” saying she will let the court and the jury come to their decision on how to handle Officer Derek Chauvin , captured on videotape kneeling on Floyd ’ s neck .
Prior to her primary win , Perkins was endorsed by Rep. Mike Nearman , the Right to Life PAC , and the Republican Party of Linn County , her hometown . Oregon GOP Chairman Bill Currier did not respond to multiple requests for comment from ███ .
Although QAnon has captured its fair share of news headlines in recent years , Joseph Oscinski told me that the group ’ s popularity is likely “ at or near the ceiling , ” citing a 2018 poll he published in the Washington Post showing that QAnon at the time was “ neither well-known nor well-liked by Floridians in either party. ” He reminded me that a lot of the 2018 headlines about QAnon were , in reality , “ all based on 12 people were in Q shirts to a Trump rally in Tampa , ” and that Twitter activity and media coverage are unreliable measures of public opinion .
Meanwhile one of the more prominent QAnon believers , David Hayes , ( he has 300,000 Twitter followers and published a book on the movement ) dismissed the Pew Research poll as “ fake news ” and , in an interview with ███ , claimed that there are “ hundreds of millions ” of Q followers .
But the QAnon conspiracy theory alone doesn ’ t explain why fringe candidates keep winning GOP primaries . Take Laura Loomer , for instance . A former investigative reporter for James O ’ Keefe ’ s Project Veritas , self-proclaimed Islamophobe , and far-right provocateur , Loomer is running in Florida ’ s 21st Congressional District . She rejected the QAnon conspiracy theory in an interview with ███ , but she worked alongside a man who amplified the Pizzagate conspiracy that led it it .
Laura Loomer and Jack Posobiec , a reporter at One American News , made headlines in 2017 for disrupting an anti-Trump play in Central Park . But their professional relationship crumbled after they began squabbling over who deserved credit for propagating conspiracy theories relating to the Las Vegas shooting of 2017 , when Steven Paddock murdered 58 people at a concert .
According to The Daily Beast , “ Loomer reported for a website owned by British provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos that members of Congress had been briefed on ‘ ISIS ties ’ to the shooting ” in March 2017 . Posobiec announced three months later that he would run a segment called “ Inside Las Vegas ” on OANN to peddle other conspiracies about the shooting .
On Twitter , Loomer condemned Posobiec ’ s failure to cite her original—albeit unsubstantiated—reporting on the topic , which was all based on an unofficial report she found online that was authored by by two former intelligence officials . “ I just thought it was really shady how Jack calls himself my friend , but then he won ’ t give me credit for my work , ” she said .
Loomer has called herself a “ proud Islamophobe ” and has previously referred to Muslims as “ savages ” and “ cancer. ” Most Florida Republicans have avoided commenting on her campaign , but Florida GOP Chairman and state Sen. Joe Gruters embraced her candidacy during an interview with ███ .
In 2017 , she was banned from Uber and Lyft after sending a series of Islamophobic tweets after a terrorist drove a truck down a bike path and killed eight people in New York City : “ Someone needs to create a non Islamic form of Uber or Lyft because I never want to support another Islamic immigrant driver. ” She was also banned from Twitter the following year for calling Rep. Ilhan Omar ( D-Minn. ) a “ Jew hater , ” and then from Facebook and Instagram in 2019 for violating user agreements .
Loomer has worked with discredited fabulist Jacob Wohl , locked herself to the doors of Twitter headquarters , and shouted to disrupt a congressional hearing . Loomer has also worked with conspiracy outlet InfoWars after the school shooting in Parkland , Florida .
In an interview , Loomer called herself “ a one woman squad , ” referring to the collective nickname for progressive firebrands , Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y. ; Ilhan Omar , D-MN ; Ayanna Pressley , D-MA . ; and Rashida Tlaib , D-MI .
“ Unlike a lot of other candidates who are running for office who have made promises to take on the squad , I ’ ve already taken on the squad during my time as an investigative journalist. ” She spoke to me about her eagerness to make political affiliation a protected class under the Civil Rights Act in her crusade to combat the “ radical left , ” which she believes is “ trying to create a Communist stronghold in our country . ”
In years past , Loomer ’ s comments toward minorities would push her to the fringes of a typical primary race . But in this age of politics as entertainment , where Donald Trump has pushed past previous boundaries of acceptable rhetoric , she has been endorsed by Jeanine Pirro and Roger Stone ahead over her August 18 primary . Trump himself retweeted two tweets about her campaign .
As for her support within the state party , Sens . Marco Rubio and Rick Scott did not respond to numerous requests for comment . Florida GOP Chairman and state Sen. Joe Gruters , however , is vocal about his support for her campaign . “ I ’ ve developed a close relationship with Loomer , ” Gruters said in an interview with ███ , calling her “ a special candidate. ” Gruters invited her to a news conference in January to discuss his bill , the “ Stop Social Media Censorship Act , ” after which he said , “ I am proud to have Laura Loomer stand with me here today because what we are here discussing is social media censorship , and we are trying to stop the bias . ”
When pressed on Loomer ’ s bigoted comments toward Muslims , Gruters said , “ You know what , here ’ s the deal . When you make comments that are powerful in any way , what will happen is you will be judged accordingly. ” The Florida GOP does not endorse candidates , but the chairman ’ s embrace of her campaign may sway voters come election season .
Despite Loomer ’ s unabashed Islamophobia , she still plays the victim card . Loomer criticized Twitter and Facebook ’ s bans against her , telling me her campaign “ is the only de-platformed campaign in the nation ” that has “ been denied intentionally by these big tech social media companies access to campaign social media accounts. ” Loomer decried this as election interference and said her campaign “ has filed an FCC complaint against Twitter for giving illegal in kind contributions to my Democratic opponent Lois Frankel . ”
Loomer moved to the social media app Parler as an alternative to Twitter , where she boasts 600,000 followers and regularly advocates for “ Twexit ” —the collective abandonment of Twitter .
“ People can say what they ’ re going to say , ” Loomer said regarding her disparaging comments toward Muslims over the years . “ But when you look at the tweet that I was banned for [ the Omar tweet ] , it had nothing to do with any of those comments . ”
“ We can sit here and have conversations for days on end about ideologies ” and “ things I may have or may not have said in the past , ” Loomer said regarding her previous anti-Muslim comments . “ But at the end of the day , ” she said , “ it is not hate speech to call a public elected official anti-Jewish , right ? ” In her eyes , hate speech is nothing more than a conspiracy theory created by Democrats and the media .
The rise of these conspiracy Republicans is causing concern in some quarters of the party , with some leaders denouncing the crazy outright and others awkwardly seeking to avoid comment . But movements often take the shape of their leaders and with Donald Trump , an eager amplifier of many false or unproven conspiracies , as the country ’ s most prominent Republican and the party ’ s de facto leader , there will be no distancing the GOP from conspiracy theories—at least for four more months .","Marjorie Greene

The Republican Party let out a collective sigh of relief when Steve King—a soon-to-be-former Iowa congressman known for his racist and nativist rhetoric—lost his re-election primary in early June. But Republicans are still in a bind. In a partisan political climate that has sown the seeds for fringe candidates to win elections, the GOP is struggling to distance itself from conspiracy-mongering nominees without surrendering key districts to Democratic opponents.

Much of this can be traced to the QAnon conspiracy theory. Back in 2016, “Pizzagate” gained national attention when a man who believed that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta were running a child-trafficking ring out of the Comet Ping Pong pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C., went into the establishment and fired a rifle.

No one was hurt, and the outlandish claims were quickly debunked. But the vile conspiracy theory didn’t totally die. It lingered in dark corners of the internet. And then in 2017, an anonymous user named Q—self-dubbed for his alleged Q level security clearance—took the reins and began posting claims that Clinton would be arrested, adding other allegedly classified intel about her on a public messaging board called “4chan.” Mesmerized by Q’s cryptic clues (which were, in reality, baseless rumors), anonymous users began obsessively tracking his posts and the QAnon movement took hold.

According to conspiracy theory expert and University of Miami professor Joseph Oscinski, Q adopted the Pizzagate theory, “predicting that Donald Trump would be victorious in the battle against the satanic, pedophile, child sex trafficking deep state.” Anons believe “that imminently the ‘Great Awakening’ is going to happen in which all of the elites who have been engaged in these evil activities are going to be exposed for the evildoers they are, and shipped down to Guantanamo and summarily hung for their crimes.”

It sounds far-fetched, like the plot of a bad movie. But now, in 2020 several dozen GOP candidates who align themselves with QAnon have run or are running for Congress. Some have snuck onto the ballot in districts where Democrats dominate and the GOP invests few resources in recruiting candidates. Most have lost primaries and won’t be on the ballot in the fall.

But GOP primary candidates Lauren Boebert, Marjorie Greene, and Jo Rae Perkins have won the hearts of Republican voters in their states. While Perkins secured a Senate primary victory in Oregon and Boebert ousted a Trump-backed incumbent in Colorado’s 3rd District primary, Greene is well on her way to win a House GOP primary runoff in Georgia. Laura Loomer—a Republican primary candidate in Florida’s 21st District—doesn’t endorse QAnon, but her provocative and bizarre behavior is problematic for other reasons.

Together, they represent a growing problem for Republican leaders: What do you do when your voters choose candidates who espouse fringe, sometimes crazy views? The answer, at least so far? It depends.

QAnon’s Oregon contender, Jo Rae Perkins, has no realistic shot at beating her Democratic incumbent, Sen. Jeff Merkley. But she won nearly 200,000 votes in her GOP primary—earning almost 50 percent of the vote in a four-person race—and she has garnered national headlines for some of her bolder proclamations. Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Greene, however, have a real chance at winning the general election in each of their districts. Although a few Republican lawmakers have publicly condemned their campaigns, others have remained silent on the matter or gone so far as to offer endorsements.

If QAnon sounds like gibberish to you, polls show you’re not alone. A Pew Research poll from March 2020 shows that only 3 percent of Americans know “a lot” about the theory, whereas 76 percent of those polled know “nothing at all.” But the movement still has a huge following on social media platforms, especially Twitter and YouTube, where some accounts boast hundreds of thousands of followers.

QAnon’s doomsday flair has even captured the attention of fringe churches, including Omega Kingdom Ministry, which regularly interprets Q drops through a biblical lens. Its pastor, Russ Wagner—who sports a long beard, bears a striking resemblance to KFC’s Colonel Sanders, and preaches in front of an American flag backdrop—regularly live-streams YouTube sermons to the channel’s 5.4 thousand subscribers. The church is also affiliated with “Home Congregations,” a site with extremely disturbing videos narrated by a woman with an ambiguous accent, who warns against Satan-worshipping pedophiles in the Democratic establishment and beyond.

Although QAnon’s following is just a small part of the dark web, what it lacks in reach it makes up for in intensity, resulting in a groundswell of support for certain fringe candidates.

Lauren Boebert

Lauren Boebert is the latest QAnon conspiracy sympathizer to inch toward Congress after beating her Trump-backed incumbent opponent, Rep. Scott Tipton, by 9 points in Colorado’s 3rd District Republican primary. President Trump endorsed Tipton the day before the runoff, but he was quick to congratulate Boebert on “a really great win!” on Twitter. She even snagged a congratulatory endorsement from former deputy prime minister of Italy, Matteo Salvani, a neo-nationalist populist, following her win.

“This is a Republican seat and will remain a Republican seat as Nancy Pelosi and senior House Democrats continue peddling their radical conspiracy theories and pushing their radical cancel culture,” said National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Tom Emmer in a statement.

With a Twitter bio that proclaims “Running in Colorado’s 3rd to get rid of RINOs,” Boebert will face off Democratic primary winner Diane Mitsch Bush—who lost to Tipton in 2018—in the general election. In a reliably Republican district that Trump won by a 12 point margin in 2016, Mitsch Bush’s progressive agenda will likely leave Boebert smooth sailing to November’s general election.

“Colorado deserves a fighter who will stand up for freedom, who believes in America and who is willing to take on all the left-wing lunatics who are trying so hard to ruin our country,” Boebert said in a press release after her primary win. Boebert gained national recognition at a Beto O’Rourke rally in September 2019 when she told the former presidential candidate, “Hell no, you won’t take our guns,” while sporting a glock on her hip. The comment landed her a Fox News appearance the following December.

A die-hard Second Amendment defender who hails from Rifle, Colorado, Boebert owns Shooter’s Grill, where she encourages her staff to open-carry while serving customers. She also recently defied Colorado’s stay-at-home order by reopening her restaurant in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, which was met by a temporary suspension of her restaurant license by the county.

When pressed on her knowledge of QAnon on the “Steel Truth” show in May, she said, “I am familiar with that. And, so, that’s more my mom’s thing. She’s a little fringe. I try to uh, I just try to keep things on track and positive. I am very familiar with it though.”

“Everything I heard of Q — I hope that this is real because it only means America is getting stronger and better, and people are returning to conservative values, and that's what I am for,” she added. The conspiracy “is only motivating and encouraging and bringing people together, stronger, and if this is real, then it could be really great for our country.”

If Boebert offered only a halting embrace of the QAnon conspiracies, Marjorie Greene has shown no such hesitancy. And she’s currently a favorite to end up in Congress.

Like Boebert, Greene has captured attention for her brash, own-the-libs campaign strategy, and is expected to win Georgia’s fourteenth district seat in the general election. After winning a June 9 primary with nearly twice the number of votes as the runner-up, Greene will be facing Dr. John Cowan in the next primary on August 11.

Greene uploaded a video in 2017 in which she declared, “Q is a patriot, we know that for sure, but we do not know who Q is.” She proceeded to say, “but I’m going to tell you about it, because I think it’s something worth listening to and paying attention to,” adding that “many of the things that he has given clues about and talked about on 4chan and other forums have really proven to be true.”

The rest of the nearly 30-minute video—which is still up as of today—consists of Greene unspooling outlandish conspiracy theories, one of her favorites being Hillary Clinton’s alleged sacrifice of a chicken in her backyard to the ancient Canaanite deity Moloch. After explaining Q’s prophetic Great Awakening in which deep state Democrats will be held accountable for their sins, Greene says “I really truly pray that this is true.”

“We know cults are real and we know real evil exists, but it hides in the darkness,” she warns, “because it doesn’t wanna get caught, because when Satanic worshippers and real evil comes out and it’s pulled out into the light it can’t survive, it just can’t survive.”

“Now, there’s a once in a lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan worshipping pedophiles out, and I think we have the president to do it, so I’m very excited about that” she says with a smile.

More recently, Politico uncovered recordings in which Greene said African Americans “are held slaves to the Democratic Party” and that she would feel proud to see Confederate monuments if she were black because they demonstrate the progress American has made since the Civil War. “I know a ton of white people that are as lazy and sorry and probably worse than black people,” Greene said on the topic of black unemployment. “And that has everything to do with their bad choices and their personal responsibility. That is not a skin-color issue.”

She called the 2018 House midterms “an Islamic invasion of our government”—clearly alluding to the victories by Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib—and said that “anyone that is a Muslim that believes in Sharia law does not belong in our government.”

Drew Florio, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, said “These comments are appalling and Leader McCarthy has no tolerance for them.” Reps. Liz Cheney (R-Wyoming) and Steve Scalise (R-Louisiana) are among other key Republicans who have denounced her campaign. The National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Chris Pack said NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer is “personally disgusted by this rhetoric and condemns it in the strongest possible terms.”

Georgia Reps. Austin Scott, Buddy Carter, and Drew Ferguson have publicly endorsed Greene’s opponent. But Georgia Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, along with Gov. Brian Kemp, have been noticeably silent on the matter, despite numerous requests for comment.

And other key players in the new Republican establishment have rallied behind her. Although Rep. Jody Hice rescinded his support for her campaign the day after Politico released its story, Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs (R-Arizona) stand by their endorsements.

The National Association for Gun Rights PAC also endorsed Greene’s campaign, persuaded by her stalwart defense of the Second Amendment. “It’s good to see a female say things like that,” said the organization’s president Dudley Brown in an interview with The Dispatch. “It’s got the ‘I’m the mama bear and I’m gonna protect not my family, but I’m gonna go to Congress and do my part to stop politicians from threatening your family.’”

The Dispatch sought answers from Greene’s campaign about the race and initially we received no response. But after the distancing from national Republicans earlier in June, the campaign sent us a statement. Greene said she will not let her enemies “whip [her] into submission,” and that she’s “sick-and-tired of watching establishment Republicans play defense while the Fake News Media cheers on Antifa terrorists, BLM rioters, and the woke cancel culture, as they burn our cities, loot our businesses, vandalize our memorials, and divide our nation.”

On Wednesday, her campaign manager Isaiah Whartman informed The Dispatch that Greene is suing her opponent in response to the “defamatory television commercial” his campaign aired that day.

In a letter obtained by The Dispatch, Greene’s lawyer, L. Lin Wood, alleges that Dr. Cowan’s commercial “[accuses] Ms. Greene and Taylor Commercial, Inc. of refusing to use a federally required program known as EVerify,” and “falsely [asserts] that Taylor Commercial, Inc. was not found under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s EVerify website.” The letter says Dr. Cowan is liable for economic damages for defamation.

No doubt this lawsuit will spice up the race before the candidates face off again in the district’s August primary.

Oregon Senate primary winner Jo Rae Perkins is also an avowed QAnon believer. She was eager to talk to The Dispatch about her affinity for Trumpism and hatred of the mainstream media. She has been open about public embrace of the QAnon conspiracy movement, having recently disavowed her own campaign’s attempt to dissociate her from the conspiracy.

Perkins—who says she gets her news from the Epoch Times, Fox News, and various podcasts—explained that QAnon uses the Socratic method to crowdsource information. “We’re encouraged to do our own critical thinking and our own research,” she said in solidarity with the movement, saying it’s “kind of like putting together a massive puzzle.”

“If we dare look at something that they didn’t put out it’s a conspiracy, that it has to be wrong because they didn’t sanction it.” She assured me that she is just a “mainstream American” trying to set the facts straight.

But then she’ll say something with a hint of conspiracy—wondering, for example, how Black Lives Matter protesters so quickly produced masks that said “Defund the Police” days after Floyd was murdered. “It could be totally organic,” adding a caveat, “then again it might not be.”

Perkins alleged that money being donated to Black Lives Matter—a movement which she believes has “gotten out of hand”—is really being funneled into Act Blue and the Democratic Party, a claim the Dispatch Fact Check recently debunked.

“And this is where I’m going to get myself in trouble and I recognize that,” she said, before proceeding. Perkins then alleged that the Black Lives Matter has been “co-opted” to victimize African Americans. Perkins added she had faith in far-right pundit Candace Owens, whom she believes is well-suited to put a stop to it. “We seem to see this thing happening on four-year cycles that kind of coincide with the presidential election,” she said.

On the topic of George Floyd, she said “it certainly looks very damning for that police officer, but in our country you’re innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,” saying she will let the court and the jury come to their decision on how to handle Officer Derek Chauvin, captured on videotape kneeling on Floyd’s neck.

Prior to her primary win, Perkins was endorsed by Rep. Mike Nearman, the Right to Life PAC, and the Republican Party of Linn County, her hometown. Oregon GOP Chairman Bill Currier did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Dispatch.

Although QAnon has captured its fair share of news headlines in recent years, Joseph Oscinski told me that the group’s popularity is likely “at or near the ceiling,” citing a 2018 poll he published in the Washington Post showing that QAnon at the time was “neither well-known nor well-liked by Floridians in either party.” He reminded me that a lot of the 2018 headlines about QAnon were, in reality, “all based on 12 people were in Q shirts to a Trump rally in Tampa,” and that Twitter activity and media coverage are unreliable measures of public opinion.

Meanwhile one of the more prominent QAnon believers, David Hayes, (he has 300,000 Twitter followers and published a book on the movement) dismissed the Pew Research poll as “fake news” and, in an interview with The Dispatch, claimed that there are “hundreds of millions” of Q followers.

Laura Loomer

But the QAnon conspiracy theory alone doesn’t explain why fringe candidates keep winning GOP primaries. Take Laura Loomer, for instance. A former investigative reporter for James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas, self-proclaimed Islamophobe, and far-right provocateur, Loomer is running in Florida’s 21st Congressional District. She rejected the QAnon conspiracy theory in an interview with The Dispatch, but she worked alongside a man who amplified the Pizzagate conspiracy that led it it.

Laura Loomer and Jack Posobiec, a reporter at One American News, made headlines in 2017 for disrupting an anti-Trump play in Central Park. But their professional relationship crumbled after they began squabbling over who deserved credit for propagating conspiracy theories relating to the Las Vegas shooting of 2017, when Steven Paddock murdered 58 people at a concert.

According to The Daily Beast, “Loomer reported for a website owned by British provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos that members of Congress had been briefed on ‘ISIS ties’ to the shooting” in March 2017. Posobiec announced three months later that he would run a segment called “Inside Las Vegas” on OANN to peddle other conspiracies about the shooting.

On Twitter, Loomer condemned Posobiec’s failure to cite her original—albeit unsubstantiated—reporting on the topic, which was all based on an unofficial report she found online that was authored by by two former intelligence officials. “I just thought it was really shady how Jack calls himself my friend, but then he won’t give me credit for my work,” she said.

Loomer has called herself a “proud Islamophobe” and has previously referred to Muslims as “savages” and “cancer.” Most Florida Republicans have avoided commenting on her campaign, but Florida GOP Chairman and state Sen. Joe Gruters embraced her candidacy during an interview with The Dispatch.

In 2017, she was banned from Uber and Lyft after sending a series of Islamophobic tweets after a terrorist drove a truck down a bike path and killed eight people in New York City: “Someone needs to create a non Islamic form of Uber or Lyft because I never want to support another Islamic immigrant driver.” She was also banned from Twitter the following year for calling Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) a “Jew hater,” and then from Facebook and Instagram in 2019 for violating user agreements.

Loomer has worked with discredited fabulist Jacob Wohl, locked herself to the doors of Twitter headquarters, and shouted to disrupt a congressional hearing. Loomer has also worked with conspiracy outlet InfoWars after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida.

In an interview, Loomer called herself “a one woman squad,” referring to the collective nickname for progressive firebrands, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Ilhan Omar, D-MN; Ayanna Pressley, D-MA.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-MI.

“Unlike a lot of other candidates who are running for office who have made promises to take on the squad, I’ve already taken on the squad during my time as an investigative journalist.” She spoke to me about her eagerness to make political affiliation a protected class under the Civil Rights Act in her crusade to combat the “radical left,” which she believes is “trying to create a Communist stronghold in our country.”

In years past, Loomer’s comments toward minorities would push her to the fringes of a typical primary race. But in this age of politics as entertainment, where Donald Trump has pushed past previous boundaries of acceptable rhetoric, she has been endorsed by Jeanine Pirro and Roger Stone ahead over her August 18 primary. Trump himself retweeted two tweets about her campaign.

As for her support within the state party, Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott did not respond to numerous requests for comment. Florida GOP Chairman and state Sen. Joe Gruters, however, is vocal about his support for her campaign. “I’ve developed a close relationship with Loomer,” Gruters said in an interview with The Dispatch, calling her “a special candidate.” Gruters invited her to a news conference in January to discuss his bill, the “Stop Social Media Censorship Act,” after which he said, “I am proud to have Laura Loomer stand with me here today because what we are here discussing is social media censorship, and we are trying to stop the bias.”

When pressed on Loomer’s bigoted comments toward Muslims, Gruters said, “You know what, here’s the deal. When you make comments that are powerful in any way, what will happen is you will be judged accordingly.” The Florida GOP does not endorse candidates, but the chairman’s embrace of her campaign may sway voters come election season.

Despite Loomer’s unabashed Islamophobia, she still plays the victim card. Loomer criticized Twitter and Facebook’s bans against her, telling me her campaign “is the only de-platformed campaign in the nation” that has “been denied intentionally by these big tech social media companies access to campaign social media accounts.” Loomer decried this as election interference and said her campaign “has filed an FCC complaint against Twitter for giving illegal in kind contributions to my Democratic opponent Lois Frankel.”

Loomer moved to the social media app Parler as an alternative to Twitter, where she boasts 600,000 followers and regularly advocates for “Twexit”—the collective abandonment of Twitter.

“People can say what they’re going to say,” Loomer said regarding her disparaging comments toward Muslims over the years. “But when you look at the tweet that I was banned for [the Omar tweet], it had nothing to do with any of those comments.”

“We can sit here and have conversations for days on end about ideologies” and “things I may have or may not have said in the past,” Loomer said regarding her previous anti-Muslim comments. “But at the end of the day,” she said, “it is not hate speech to call a public elected official anti-Jewish, right?” In her eyes, hate speech is nothing more than a conspiracy theory created by Democrats and the media.

The rise of these conspiracy Republicans is causing concern in some quarters of the party, with some leaders denouncing the crazy outright and others awkwardly seeking to avoid comment. But movements often take the shape of their leaders and with Donald Trump, an eager amplifier of many false or unproven conspiracies, as the country’s most prominent Republican and the party’s de facto leader, there will be no distancing the GOP from conspiracy theories—at least for four more months.

Passel","Debates over who is Hispanic and who is not have fueled conversations about identity among Americans who trace their heritage to Latin America or Spain . The question surfaced during U.S. presidential debates and the confirmation of Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court . More recently , it bubbled up after a singer from Spain won the “ Best Latin ” award at the 2019 Video Music Awards .
So , who is considered Hispanic in the United States ? And how are they counted in public opinion surveys , voter exit polls and government surveys like the upcoming 2020 census ?
The most common approach to answering these questions is straightforward : Who is Hispanic ? Anyone who says they are . And nobody who says they aren ’ t .
The U.S. Census Bureau uses this approach , as does ███ and most other research organizations that conduct public opinion surveys . By this way of counting , the Census Bureau estimates there were roughly 59.9 million Hispanics in the United States as of July 1 , 2018 , making up 18 % of the total national population .
Behind the impressive precision of this official Census Bureau number lies a long history of changing labels , shifting categories and revised question wording on census forms – all of which reflect evolving cultural norms about what it means to be Hispanic or Latino in the United States today .
Here ’ s a quick primer on the Census Bureau ’ s approach of using self-identification to decide who is Hispanic .
Q. I immigrated to Phoenix from Mexico . Am I Hispanic ?
Q . My parents moved to New York from Puerto Rico . Am I Hispanic ?
Q . My grandparents were born in Spain but I grew up in California . Am I Hispanic ?
Q. I was born in Maryland and married an immigrant from El Salvador . Am I Hispanic ?
Q. I was born in Argentina but grew up in Texas . I don ’ t consider myself Hispanic . Does the Census Bureau count me as Hispanic ?
A . Not if you say you aren ’ t . Of the 42.7 million adults with Hispanic ancestry in 2015 , an estimated 5 million people , or 11 % , said they do not identify as Hispanic or Latino . These people aren ’ t counted as Hispanic by the Census Bureau or in ███ surveys .
Hispanic self-identification varies across immigrant generations . Among the foreign born from Latin America , nearly all self-identify as Hispanic . But by the fourth generation , only half of people with Hispanic heritage in the U.S. self-identify as Hispanic .
Q . But isn ’ t there an official definition of what it means to be Hispanic or Latino ?
A . In 1976 , the U.S. Congress passed the only law in this country ’ s history that mandated the collection and analysis of data for a specific ethnic group : “ Americans of Spanish origin or descent. ” The language of that legislation described this group as “ Americans who identify themselves as being of Spanish-speaking background and trace their origin or descent from Mexico , Puerto Rico , Cuba , Central and South America , and other Spanish-speaking countries. ” This includes 20 Spanish-speaking nations from Latin America and Spain itself , but not Portugal or Portuguese-speaking Brazil . Standards for collecting data on Hispanics were developed by the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) in 1977 and revised in 1997 . Using these standards , schools , public health facilities and other government entities and agencies keep track of how many Hispanics they serve – the primary goal of the 1976 law .
However , the Census Bureau does not apply this definition when counting Hispanics . Rather , it relies entirely on self-reporting and lets each person identify as Hispanic or not . The 2020 census form will ask the question this way :
A . The terms “ Hispanic ” and “ Latino ” are panethnic terms meant to describe – and summarize – the population of people living in the U.S. of that ethnic background . In practice , the Census Bureau most often uses the term “ Hispanic , ” while ███ uses the terms “ Hispanic ” and “ Latino ” interchangeably .
Some have drawn sharp distinctions between these two terms , saying for example , Hispanics are people from Spain or from Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America ( this excludes Brazil , where Portuguese is the official language ) while Latinos are people from Latin America regardless of language ( this includes Brazil but excludes Spain ) . Despite this debate , the “ Hispanic ” and “ Latino ” labels are not universally embraced by the community that has been labeled , even as they are widely used .
Instead , ███ surveys show a preference for other terms to describe identity . A 2015 survey found that 50 % of Hispanics most often describe themselves by their family ’ s country of origin , 23 % use the terms Latino or Hispanic , and 23 % most often describe themselves as American . As for a preference between the terms Hispanic or Latino , the survey found that 32 % of Hispanics prefer “ Hispanic , ” 15 % prefer the term “ Latino ” and the rest ( 51 % ) have no preference .
Another common identity label is “ Latinx , ” an emerging panethnic , gender-neutral term that is used in place of “ Hispanic ” or “ Latino. ” While the Census Bureau has not recognized the term , U.S. public interest in “ Latinx ” has grown since 2018 , according to an analysis of Google search data . However , some have not embraced the term .
Q . The Census Bureau also asks people about their race and their ancestry . How do these responses come into play when determining if someone is Hispanic ?
A . They don ’ t . In the eyes of the Census Bureau , Hispanics can be of any race , any ancestry or any country of origin . This results in varying patterns that relate to where people come from and how they choose to identify themselves on census surveys . For example , nearly all immigrants from Mexico ( 99 % ) called themselves Hispanic , according to a ███ analysis of the Census Bureau ’ s 2017 American Community Survey . By comparison , 93 % of immigrants from Argentina said so , as did 88 % of immigrants from Spain and 87 % from Panama .
Q . What about Brazilians , Portuguese and Filipinos ? Are they Hispanic ?
A . They are in the eyes of the Census Bureau if they say they are , even though these countries do not fit the federal government ’ s official definition of “ Hispanic ” because they are not Spanish-speaking . For the most part , people who trace their ancestry to these countries do not self-identify as Hispanic when they fill out their census forms . Only about 2 % of immigrants from Brazil do so , as do 2 % of immigrants from Portugal and 1 % from the Philippines , according to ███ tabulations of the 2017 American Community Survey .
These patterns reflect a growing recognition and acceptance of the official definition of Hispanics . In the 1980 census , 18 % of Brazilian immigrants and 12 % of both Portuguese and Filipino immigrants identified as Hispanic . But by 2000 , the shares identifying as Hispanic dropped to levels close to those seen today .
What people report on census forms are not subject to any independent checks , corroborations or corrections . This means , in theory , someone who has no Hispanic ancestors could identify as Hispanic and that ’ s how they would be counted .
Q . Has the Census Bureau changed the way it counts Hispanics ?
A . The first year the Census Bureau asked everybody in the country about Hispanic ethnicity was in 1980 . Some efforts took place before then to count people that today would be considered Hispanic . In the 1930 census , for example , an attempt to count Hispanics appeared as part of the race question , which had a category for “ Mexican . ”
The first major attempt to estimate the size of the nation ’ s Hispanic population came in 1970 and produced widespread concerns among Hispanic organizations about an undercount . A portion of the U.S. population ( 5 % ) was asked if their origin or descent was from the following categories : “ Mexican , Puerto Rican , Cuban , Central or South American , Other Spanish , ” and “ No , none of these. ” This approach had problems , among them an undercount of about 1 million Hispanics . One reason for this is that many second-generation Hispanics did not select one of the Hispanic groups because the question did not include terms like “ Mexican American. ” The question wording also resulted in hundreds of thousands of people living in the south or central regions of the U.S. to be mistakenly included in the “ Central or South American ” category .
By 1980 , the current approach – in which someone is asked if they are Hispanic – had taken hold , with some tweaks made to the question and response categories since then . In 2000 , for example , the term “ Latino ” was added to make the question read , “ Is this person Spanish/Hispanic/Latino ? ” In recent years , the Census Bureau has studied an alternative approach to counting Hispanics that combines the questions that ask about Hispanic origin and race . However , this change will not appear in the 2020 census .","Debates over who is Hispanic and who is not have fueled conversations about identity among Americans who trace their heritage to Latin America or Spain. The question surfaced during U.S. presidential debates and the confirmation of Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court. More recently, it bubbled up after a singer from Spain won the “Best Latin” award at the 2019 Video Music Awards.

So, who is considered Hispanic in the United States? And how are they counted in public opinion surveys, voter exit polls and government surveys like the upcoming 2020 census?

The most common approach to answering these questions is straightforward: Who is Hispanic? Anyone who says they are. And nobody who says they aren’t.

The U.S. Census Bureau uses this approach, as does Pew Research Center and most other research organizations that conduct public opinion surveys. By this way of counting, the Census Bureau estimates there were roughly 59.9 million Hispanics in the United States as of July 1, 2018, making up 18% of the total national population.

Behind the impressive precision of this official Census Bureau number lies a long history of changing labels, shifting categories and revised question wording on census forms – all of which reflect evolving cultural norms about what it means to be Hispanic or Latino in the United States today.

Here’s a quick primer on the Census Bureau’s approach of using self-identification to decide who is Hispanic.

Q. I immigrated to Phoenix from Mexico. Am I Hispanic?

A. You are if you say so.

Q. My parents moved to New York from Puerto Rico. Am I Hispanic?

A. You are if you say so.

Q. My grandparents were born in Spain but I grew up in California. Am I Hispanic?

A. You are if you say so.

Q. I was born in Maryland and married an immigrant from El Salvador. Am I Hispanic?

A. You are if you say so.

Q. I was born in Argentina but grew up in Texas. I don’t consider myself Hispanic. Does the Census Bureau count me as Hispanic?

A. Not if you say you aren’t. Of the 42.7 million adults with Hispanic ancestry in 2015, an estimated 5 million people, or 11%, said they do not identify as Hispanic or Latino. These people aren’t counted as Hispanic by the Census Bureau or in Pew Research Center surveys.

Hispanic self-identification varies across immigrant generations. Among the foreign born from Latin America, nearly all self-identify as Hispanic. But by the fourth generation, only half of people with Hispanic heritage in the U.S. self-identify as Hispanic.

Q. But isn’t there an official definition of what it means to be Hispanic or Latino?

A. In 1976, the U.S. Congress passed the only law in this country’s history that mandated the collection and analysis of data for a specific ethnic group: “Americans of Spanish origin or descent.” The language of that legislation described this group as “Americans who identify themselves as being of Spanish-speaking background and trace their origin or descent from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central and South America, and other Spanish-speaking countries.” This includes 20 Spanish-speaking nations from Latin America and Spain itself, but not Portugal or Portuguese-speaking Brazil. Standards for collecting data on Hispanics were developed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 1977 and revised in 1997. Using these standards, schools, public health facilities and other government entities and agencies keep track of how many Hispanics they serve – the primary goal of the 1976 law.

However, the Census Bureau does not apply this definition when counting Hispanics. Rather, it relies entirely on self-reporting and lets each person identify as Hispanic or not. The 2020 census form will ask the question this way:

Q. What’s the difference between Hispanic and Latino?

A. The terms “Hispanic” and “Latino” are panethnic terms meant to describe – and summarize – the population of people living in the U.S. of that ethnic background. In practice, the Census Bureau most often uses the term “Hispanic,” while Pew Research Center uses the terms “Hispanic” and “Latino” interchangeably.

Some have drawn sharp distinctions between these two terms, saying for example, Hispanics are people from Spain or from Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America (this excludes Brazil, where Portuguese is the official language) while Latinos are people from Latin America regardless of language (this includes Brazil but excludes Spain). Despite this debate, the “Hispanic” and “Latino” labels are not universally embraced by the community that has been labeled, even as they are widely used.

Instead, Pew Research Center surveys show a preference for other terms to describe identity. A 2015 survey found that 50% of Hispanics most often describe themselves by their family’s country of origin, 23% use the terms Latino or Hispanic, and 23% most often describe themselves as American. As for a preference between the terms Hispanic or Latino, the survey found that 32% of Hispanics prefer “Hispanic,” 15% prefer the term “Latino” and the rest (51%) have no preference.

Another common identity label is “Latinx,” an emerging panethnic, gender-neutral term that is used in place of “Hispanic” or “Latino.” While the Census Bureau has not recognized the term, U.S. public interest in “Latinx” has grown since 2018, according to an analysis of Google search data. However, some have not embraced the term.

Q. The Census Bureau also asks people about their race and their ancestry. How do these responses come into play when determining if someone is Hispanic?

A. They don’t. In the eyes of the Census Bureau, Hispanics can be of any race, any ancestry or any country of origin. This results in varying patterns that relate to where people come from and how they choose to identify themselves on census surveys. For example, nearly all immigrants from Mexico (99%) called themselves Hispanic, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the Census Bureau’s 2017 American Community Survey. By comparison, 93% of immigrants from Argentina said so, as did 88% of immigrants from Spain and 87% from Panama.

Q. What about Brazilians, Portuguese and Filipinos? Are they Hispanic?

A. They are in the eyes of the Census Bureau if they say they are, even though these countries do not fit the federal government’s official definition of “Hispanic” because they are not Spanish-speaking. For the most part, people who trace their ancestry to these countries do not self-identify as Hispanic when they fill out their census forms. Only about 2% of immigrants from Brazil do so, as do 2% of immigrants from Portugal and 1% from the Philippines, according to Pew Research Center tabulations of the 2017 American Community Survey.

These patterns reflect a growing recognition and acceptance of the official definition of Hispanics. In the 1980 census, 18% of Brazilian immigrants and 12% of both Portuguese and Filipino immigrants identified as Hispanic. But by 2000, the shares identifying as Hispanic dropped to levels close to those seen today.

What people report on census forms are not subject to any independent checks, corroborations or corrections. This means, in theory, someone who has no Hispanic ancestors could identify as Hispanic and that’s how they would be counted.

Q. Has the Census Bureau changed the way it counts Hispanics?

A. The first year the Census Bureau asked everybody in the country about Hispanic ethnicity was in 1980. Some efforts took place before then to count people that today would be considered Hispanic. In the 1930 census, for example, an attempt to count Hispanics appeared as part of the race question, which had a category for “Mexican.”

The first major attempt to estimate the size of the nation’s Hispanic population came in 1970 and produced widespread concerns among Hispanic organizations about an undercount. A portion of the U.S. population (5%) was asked if their origin or descent was from the following categories: “Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, Other Spanish,” and “No, none of these.” This approach had problems, among them an undercount of about 1 million Hispanics. One reason for this is that many second-generation Hispanics did not select one of the Hispanic groups because the question did not include terms like “Mexican American.” The question wording also resulted in hundreds of thousands of people living in the south or central regions of the U.S. to be mistakenly included in the “Central or South American” category.

By 1980, the current approach – in which someone is asked if they are Hispanic – had taken hold, with some tweaks made to the question and response categories since then. In 2000, for example, the term “Latino” was added to make the question read, “Is this person Spanish/Hispanic/Latino?” In recent years, the Census Bureau has studied an alternative approach to counting Hispanics that combines the questions that ask about Hispanic origin and race. However, this change will not appear in the 2020 census.

US actor Jussie Smollett has been arrested in Chicago after being charged with filing a false police report.

The Empire star had said he was subjected to a homophobic and racist physical attack by two men in January.

Police suspect the 36-year-old actor paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack. They are both co-operating with the investigation, US media report.

He is due to appear in court later on Thursday. His lawyers earlier said they would ""mount an aggressive defence"".

What do police say?

Suspicion over the actor's claim started to grow after police said they could not find any video footage of the alleged incident from surveillance cameras. There were also no witnesses.

But investigators managed to track two men who appeared on video footage near where the actor said he had been attacked.

The men - Ola and Abel Osundairo - had left the US following the alleged attack and were held for nearly 48 hours after they returned last week.

They were released without charges after providing information that ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation"", police said. One of the brothers is Mr Smollett's personal trainer and both have worked as extras on Empire.

A lawyer for the brothers, Gloria Schmidt, said they had chosen to testify because ""there was a point where this story needed to be told"". She added: ""They manned up and said: 'You know what? We're going to correct this'.""

On Wednesday, CBS Chicago obtained footage which appeared to show two people buying materials, including ski masks, that had allegedly been worn by the actor's attackers.

What happens now?

Mr Smollett turned himself in early on Thursday and is in custody of Chicago police, spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

He faces felony charges for disorderly conduct and filing a false police report.

The actor is being temporarily held at the Cook County Jail and has been separated from other prisoners, which is common of notable inmates, Chicago media report.

If found guilty, he faces up to three years in prison and may also be forced to reimburse police for the cost of their three week-long investigation.

What does Smollett say happened?

The actor, who is gay, said he had gone out to buy food late at night in downtown Chicago when two white men hurled racial and homophobic insults at him.

The changed politics of late-night TV
The curtain rose this week on a new era of late-night TV — altering the terrain for politicians who frequent the shows and complicating life for Republicans , who have lost their most comfortable seat in front of the camera .
“ The whole landscape ’ s about to change , ” Arsenio Hall , the recently reincarnated late-night host , said in an interview . “ Jay [ Leno ] going home is going to change it for a lot of people . ”
Jimmy Fallon replaced Leno — who was seen as the one late-night host with a welcome mat out for the GOP — and moved “ The Tonight Show ” back to New York City after decades in Hollywood . Beyond the location , expect another big departure from Leno : Not nearly as many heavy-hitting political jokes or guests .
Fallon , who is eyed a bit warily by some Republicans , had first lady Michelle Obama on Thursday — they have a chemistry between them — after launching his new show on Monday . He said recently that his show will not be the place to go for in-depth interviews with politicians and candidates .
Obama and Fallon ’ s only foray into politics during her appearance was a pitch about Obamacare ’ s provision that allows children to stay on their parent ’ s health insurance until age 26 , with a quick quip from Fallon about the problem-plagued HealthCare.gov finally working .
“ ( The website is ) working now . It ’ s so much better when it ’ s working , ” Fallon said .
As part of the new late-night lineup , Seth Meyers is taking over Fallon ’ s old spot on “ Late Night , ” and the former “ Saturday Night Live ” head writer has said he does plan to focus on politics . In fact , Vice President Joe Biden will be one of his first guests on Monday , when the show debuts . Meyers and his team declined an interview request .
With the 2014 midterms not far off and the 2016 presidential cycle already in motion , a seat on a late-night host ’ s couch is an important place for politicians who are looking to soften their image , reach a young-ish audience and prove they have a sense of humor like any average Joe .
But there will definitely be less pure politics without Leno , experts said . While Leno and “ Late Show ” host David Letterman have relied heavily on politics in their monologues and had many politicians on as guests , Fallon turns political only when there ’ s a story so big it can ’ t be ignored , said Robert Lichter , director of Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University and the author of the forthcoming book “ Politics Is a Joke : How TV Comedians Are Remaking Political Life . ”
“ [ Johnny ] Carson initiated political humor on late night , but Leno put it on steroids , ” Lichter said . “ Leno always told far more political jokes than anyone else . With folks like Fallon and others , you ’ ve got political humor when something big happens … so , for Fallon , politics is just one of many areas . For Leno , it was a major part of his arsenal . ”
Fallon ’ s slimmed-down diet of politics may not be a bad thing , said Erik Smith , Obama ’ s senior adviser for advertising and message development during the 2008 and 2012 campaigns . As opposed to what Smith called a “ sense of cynicism ” toward politics that Leno and Letterman exhibit in their monologues , Fallon ’ s skits and stunts — like the “ slow jam ” — bring out a softer side of a candidate and are more likely to go viral .
“ The type of stuff Fallon does , from a [ political ] strategist point of view , will be a lot more helpful , because you ’ re actually showing a side of a politician most people can ’ t see , which is really fun , ” Smith said . “ When Obama slow-jammed with Fallon , he was talking about student loans . He got his message across . That was more effective than going on a talk show . ”
Sen. John McCain , one of the most prolific political late-night guests , said he often tries to encourage his fellow members of Congress to hit the late-night circuit but that it can be a hard sell .
“ I ’ ve always encouraged my colleagues to go on as many of these shows as possible , because it ’ s a unique way to touch an audience that generally you never are able to reach under any other medium or format . And don ’ t think a lot of them aren ’ t scared , ” the Arizona Republican said in an interview .
While the entertainment world has always had a liberal veneer , and the political leanings of the late-night hosts have been hotly debated for years , one thing seems clear : It is Republicans who will miss Leno most .
Calling Leno his favorite late-night host , McCain said Leno would do little things like making sure there were cupcakes in the green room ( McCain ’ s favorite ) or show the senator around his car collection .
“ That ’ s just the kind of guy he is , ” McCain said . “ Another reason I like him so much is he uses humor but he doesn ’ t have the sharp edge that some others do , the kind of put-down that is popular with some others . ”
Longtime Republican strategist Mark McKinnon , who has advised the presidential campaigns of McCain and George W. Bush , said losing Leno is a loss to “ bipartisan political comedy . ”
“ Conservative candidates are justifiably going to be more cautious about other [ late-night ] platforms , ” he said .
“ Unlike other shows , specifically Letterman , Leno and his team always went out of their way to make candidates feel welcome and , more importantly , prepared . There were never any surprises , ” McKinnon added . “ The guests always knew ahead of time what they were likely to encounter on stage . And he and the writers were incredibly helpful suggesting scripts and ideas . And when male married candidates showed up with their spouses , they ’ d always have flowers for the wife . Very classy . Made candidates want to go back . ”
Republican consultant and pundit Mike Murphy said that it was partly Leno ’ s viewership that made GOP leaders feel more comfortable .
“ I think because Jay ’ s audience skewed a bit older and more Midwestern , the usual older GOP leader type felt an affinity for him , but I don ’ t think Jay ’ s material was any easier on GOP than Democrats at all , ” Murphy said .
According to Lichter ’ s analysis , Leno ’ s jokes from 2009-2013 were 49 percent about Democrats versus 51 percent about Republicans , although President Bill Clinton was his No . 1 target over his entire hosting career . Fallon , who told three times fewer political jokes than Leno in the same time period , hit Democrats in 59 percent of his political jokes versus 41 percent for Republicans , though Lichter notes that ’ s likely due to the scandals surrounding politicians like Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer .
“ Letterman particularly in recent years has gotten very one-sided , so if conservatives want to complain about late-night media bias , it ’ s Letterman and not Leno they had to worry about , ” Lichter said . “ I ’ m sure conservatives thought of Leno as more balanced , and our data bear that out to some degree . ”
Letterman ’ s humor skewed heavily anti-Republican , Lichter found . From 2009 to 2013 , 71 percent of the late-night funnyman ’ s jokes were targeted at the GOP , versus 29 percent for Democrats .
Last year , when news first surfaced that Leno was on his way out , conservative pundits lamented his possible exit , even though Leno has called himself a fiscal conservative but social liberal .
At the time , Matt Towery wrote on the conservative Town Hall website that Leno is like “ Barry Goldwater ” when compared with Letterman . “ … I know that Jay Leno , like most on network TV , is a self-proclaimed ‘ liberal , ’ but I could care less . Next to David Letterman , he looks like Barry Goldwater , ” Towery wrote .
In his first monologue on Monday night , Fallon said he ’ d be targeting anyone and everyone for a laugh .
But Christian Toto , assistant editor at the conservative news site Breitbart , said Fallon ’ s track record “ isn ’ t promising in terms of being non-partisan . ”
Noting Leno ’ s top ratings toward the end of his run , Toto said Leno understood the late-night rule of making fun of the president no matter the party . “ Leno was talking truth to power , and it was resonating , ” said Toto , who also oversees Breitbart ’ s Big Hollywood section .
Michele Tasoff , Leno ’ s longtime political booker and producer , said the interviews were never “ cakewalks ” for politicians .
“ It won ’ t be an easy interview ; Jay certainly has his opinions where one might stand on a particular topic or issue , but they know they ’ re going to get a fair shake , ” Tasoff said , noting that she had politicians tell her after the shows that they enjoyed the format and were appreciative of Leno letting them talk , unlike on cable news shows . “ I think that ’ s one reason why we ’ ve been successful in having so many notable politicians on the show . ”
Letterman ’ s political booker and producer Mike Buczkiewicz said in an interview that even with Leno ’ s departure , he doesn ’ t expect much to change for pols and candidates .
“ Politicians have always gravitated toward Dave , so I don ’ t think there ’ s going to be a massive change in that respect , ” Buczkiewicz said . “ I think Jay certainly had his handful of politicians on as well , but I don ’ t really see [ his departure ] affecting what we do here all that much . ”
Buczkiewicz said that unlike the typical news show , Letterman offers politicians time to make their case .
“ They ’ re lengthy interviews , so we give politicians time to stretch their legs a little bit ; this isn ’ t a 45-second cable hit , ” Buczkiewicz said . “ With the amount of outlets politicians go to , Dave sets himself apart from the rest with the ability to have fun with them , talk with them about world hunger or serious issues that I think on first glance people would look at a subject and say , ‘ Oh my , you can ’ t talk about that on late night ’ ; well , Dave can do that . ”
Hall said there ’ s an obvious difference in interview styles between the hosts in the late-night landscape , but that each one is “ brilliant in their own way . ”
“ I love sitting and watching Letterman talk with Barack Obama , the way he did it , the way he paced it , the questions he asked , the conversational manner he did it in , ” Hall said . “ But I think the great thing about it , Fallon is totally different . If you ’ re a Fallon viewer , you like his style and how he approached it . Letterman doesn ’ t slow jam the news , but it was equally an exciting and meaningful appearance . You choose a host who executes the interviews and the show you want to see . ”
Fallon , who declined an interview request from ███ , may grow into having more political guests as he settles into his new role , Lichter predicted .
“ When you ’ re trying to build buzz for a new host , having your stuff repeated in politically oriented news is going to get it out to a wider audience . So let ’ s see if Fallon remains what he has been or if he tries to use some of the things Leno led the way on , even if he doesn ’ t go as far as Leno did , ” Lichter said . “ Fallon isn ’ t particularly good or interested in interviewing big-name politicians . But if you have presidential candidates going on the other shows and not on your show , you may have a problem , whether you like it or not . ”","With Leno's departure, many expect not as many political jokes or guests with Fallon.

On Monday , Nike announced that Kaepernick is one of the athletes helping commemorate the 30th anniversary of the brand ’ s iconic slogan . ( Serena Williams and Odell Beckham Jr. are among the other faces of the campaign . ) The ad is a black-and-white close-up of Kaepernick ’ s face with the words , “ Believe in something . Even if it means sacrificing everything ” — a reference to Kaepernick ’ s lawsuit against the NFL for allegedly colluding to keep the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback out of the league over his protests against police brutality .

Though Kaepernick and other NFL players who have kneeled during the national anthem maintain that their protest is about police brutality resulting in the deaths of unarmed black Americans , that hasn ’ t stopped their critics , including President Donald Trump , from claiming that Kaepernick is disrespecting his flag and country .
And so the new Nike ad has inspired some people to post videos and photos of them destroying their Nike apparel in an illustration of their fealty to said flag and country :
First the @ NFL forces me to choose between my favorite sport and my country . I chose country . Then @ Nike forces me to choose between my favorite shoes and my country .

What ’ s followed is a boycott largely confined to performative social-media outrage . Unsurprisingly , this outrage caught the attention of President Donald Trump , leading him to double down on his attacks on Kaepernick and the NFL on Wednesday , in a tweet claiming that the boycott was punitively damaging Nike :
Just like the NFL , whose ratings have gone WAY DOWN , Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts . I wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way ? As far as the NFL is concerned , I just find it hard to watch , and always will , until they stand for the FLAG ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) September 5 , 2018
Americans destroying apparel they ’ ve already paid for to scold a multibillion-dollar company over an ad campaign that promotes rebellion but also is implicitly selling conformity : It sounds like deep-level satire . But that is the world we live in , and it crystallizes some specifics of how the internet outrage machine operates — and how Nike has already won .
Some people are destroying Nike stuff they ’ ve already bought . More people are mocking them for doing so .
When Kaepernick ’ s ad was released on Monday night , social media quickly lit up with excitement . But there was also a vocal contingent who staged their own protest , of sorts , in response .
John Rich , of the country duo Big & Rich , tweeted that his sound man ( a former Marine ) was moved to destroy a pair of white Nike tube socks over the news :
Our Soundman just cut the Nike swoosh off his socks . Former marine . Get ready @ Nike multiply that by the millions . pic.twitter.com/h8kj6RXe7j — John Rich ( @ johnrich ) September 3 , 2018
Rich went on to clarify that the news was so inflammatory that it drove the sock-cutter into such a rage that he couldn ’ t cut straight into the fabric :
Nah , he was just so wound up that he did n't take time . It 's a wonder he did n't cut himself . You think we 'll roll over on shit like this ? hahaa ! Ok. Have another SnowCone . — John Rich ( @ johnrich ) September 3 , 2018
Rich ’ s tweet went viral , though it ’ s unclear how much of that reflects support for his statement versus a desire to dunk on the guy who destroyed those tube socks :

However , Rich ’ s documentation of Nike destruction wasn ’ t the first to appear on social media , nor the first to get dunked on . It followed on the heels of another viral tweet from Twitter user Sean Clancy ( whose avatar includes Pepe the frog and the text “ don ’ t tread on memes ” ) , which featured a video of a pair of Nike shoes on fire and seems to have , ahem , ignited the hashtag # BurnYourNikes .
But while there ’ s a smattering of seemingly sincere participants in this incendiary boycott , including some encouragement from the sitting president of the United States , the # BurnYourNikes hashtag is currently heavily populated by those mocking the performance , pointing out that destroying Nike goods that are already bought and paid for doesn ’ t actually hurt Nike ’ s bottom line . In some cases , burning Nikes might inadvertently be advertising for the company .
Other details this viral Nike boycott has thus far failed to take into consideration : whether it also means never rooting for Ohio State , Penn State , Michigan State , Michigan , Texas , Baylor , or any other college that is sponsored by Nike ; whether it extends to Converse , Hurley , and all the other brands owned by Nike ; whether boycotters will also forgo brands like Under Armour , which has also delved into political waters and opposed Trump ; and whether the service members being used as justification for the boycott want to be used as props :

What ’ s being underlined in this conversation around Nike destruction and its relative merit is that this performative boycott isn ’ t just about the brand itself . Setting Nike shoes on fire or cutting up socks allows these users to voice their displeasure with Nike , and to assert their own identity in a public space that might invite some mockery , sure , but will also reward them for their performance : In shunning Nike on Twitter , they ’ re also courting follows , likes , and retweets , the platform ’ s main currency .
For some users , this boycott , regardless of its sincerity , doubles as a branding opportunity — especially for someone like Rich , who has posted several follow-up tweets about Nike and attempted to coin his own hashtag , # PigSocks . His country music band is now more visible than it ’ s been in years , and the viral boycott he helped spark has drawn increased attention to his Twitter page — which as of press time features a pinned tweet promoting his Redneck Riviera whiskey brand .
The irony here , of course , is that the Kaepernick ad is itself branding — and in reacting to it , its critics are ensuring that Nike is getting exactly what it paid for .
Nike knew what it was doing when it picked Kaepernick for the ad
Nike deciding to highlight Kaepernick wasn ’ t done on a whim . The company has had Kaepernick under contract since 2011 , and reportedly began negotiating a “ new , multi-year pact ” with him months ago , well after he initiated the lawsuit alluded to in the ad ’ s text . The timing is not a coincidence .
Like any billion-dollar brand , Nike employs a lot of people , many of whom are experts in marketing . The risk of a negative response was undoubtedly assessed before making the deal , which makes clear that Nike believes the rewards of sponsoring Kaepernick outweigh the cost . That the ad became part of the national conversation within minutes of its release means that it ’ s already worked , and whatever minor hit Nike ’ s stock has taken in the immediate aftermath is outweighed by the long-term attention the brand has received .
Would you sacrifice comfort , money and security for what you believe in ? # ImWithKap pic.twitter.com/MMY55z84G3 — Ava DuVernay ( @ ava ) September 3 , 2018
Another thing to keep in mind is that the identity factor works both ways . The spirit that drives one person to burn a pair of already purchased Nikes is the same spirit that might move another person to buy the branded apparel that ’ s part of Kaepernick ’ s endorsement with the company . Whether they ’ re detractors burning items they ’ ve already paid for or supporters indicating their approval by buying new items , Nike makes money on both .
You burning your Nike gear costs Nike nothing , & gives them free advertising .
They are going to sell more to others because of the campaign .
You think a multi billion dollar company did n't study the cost/benefit fallout before launching the campaign ?
In that respect , as Rolling Stone ’ s Jamil Smith points out , this isn ’ t a completely altruistic story . Nike is still going to make a profit off social justice and people ’ s desire to do something for a cause .
But it ’ s also a rare example of a company taking a loud , public stand for social justice and civil rights , and Nike is putting at least some of its money where its mouth is : Kaepernick ’ s deal with the company reportedly includes a contribution to his Know Your Rights charity . ( Kaepernick himself has donated to several civil rights and equality organizations . ) That counts for something , even if it loses Nike some fans ( who have already bought merchandise ) along the way .","Goaded by the performative nature of the internet, people are destroying their Nike apparel and declaring a moral boycott over shoes they’ve already purchased — all in the name of denouncing Colin Kaepernick, the newest face of Nike’s “Just Do It” campaign.

The new advocates for cultural freedom are different from their forebears . They are more ethnically and sexually diverse . Practically all of them operate outside the academy . They are not self-consciously organized as a movement . To some extent , of course , this lack of institutionalization is related to present historical conditions . The mid 20th century was an era of bigness , of vast bureaus , of hierarchical corporations where political life , especially on the left , was divided and subdivided into party , committee , and cell . The early 21st century is too fractured , disaggregated , and anarchic for such precise construction and coordination . This is a time of weak relationships , of loose affiliations . People drop in and out of movements at the press of a “ like , ” “ tweet , ” or “ send ” button . And because our media is unbundled , and the multiple means of personal expression so accessible , no one authority has monopoly power to distinguish reasonable dissenters from cranks . This creates an opportunity for the enforcers of political correctness , who are quick to associate the enemies they unfairly deride as racists with genuine ones .
What has come into being is not a committee or congress but a Coalition for Cultural Freedom . This wide-ranging assembly of critics opposed to the consensus that dominates the commanding heights of culture , entertainment , and media is neither centrally directed nor unified , not precisely delineated or philosophically consistent . But they do all believe in what Gaetano Mosca called “ juridical defense , ” pluralism in opinion and institutions to guard against conformity and repression . And the fact that Kanye ’ s heresy and Weiss ’ s reporting were greeted with contumely , derision , outrage , and agony is evidence for the strength of such conformity , the desire for such repression .
Political correctness reigns in San Francisco , Hollywood , and Berkeley , and it is making inroads into New York and the permanent bureaucratic government in Washington , D.C. , but its position is insecure , unstable . The ferocity with which challenges to the ideology are met signifies not power but weakness . All it takes to end the hegemony of political correctness is to combat or ignore its will to intimidation . And that is happening . The simple truth is that people do not like being reduced to their skin color , and they hate being called racists . So they tend to abandon the figures and organizations that see them as nothing but biased , sexist , bigoted dullards who belong in a basket of deplorables . They may not voice their opinion to a pollster for fear of social ostracism . But they reveal their preferences through action .
Hillary Clinton can tell you as much . So can ESPN and the NFL and the Hollywood studios whose social-justice masterworks are rewarded at the Oscars but not at the box office . Google and Facebook have also felt the backlash from censoring non-woke voices . Conversely , the success of American Sniper , Donald Trump , Jordan Peterson , and Roseanne has revealed the size of the audience willing to abandon the poses of political correctness for authenticity and disruption .
“ The defense of intellectual liberty today imposes a positive obligation : to offer new and constructive answers to the problems of our time , ” wrote the authors of the Freedom Manifesto . “ We address this manifesto to all men who are determined to regain those liberties which they have lost and to preserve and extend those which they enjoy. ” Those ranks included Sidney Hook and Arthur Koestler .

Kanye West, Jordan Peterson, and the revolt against political correctness

On May 15, 1939, philosopher John Dewey issued a statement to the press announcing the formation of the Committee for Cultural Freedom. Attached were the committee’s declaration of principles and the names of 96 signatories. The following day, at a meeting inside Columbia University’s Low Library, the committee adopted its official manifesto. “Never before in modern times,” the document began, “has the integrity of the writer, the artists, the scientist, and the scholar been threatened so seriously.”

The committee’s members included anthropologists, philosophers, journalists, dramatists, attorneys, educators, and historians. Politically, they ran the gamut from democratic socialists to New Deal liberals to 19h-century liberals who embraced the market without serious qualification. What unified them was their commitment “to propagate courageously the ideal of untrammeled intellectual activity.” The “fundamental criteria for evaluating all social philosophies today,” their manifesto read, are “whether it permits the thinker and the artist to function independently of political, religious, or racial dogmas.” The basis for this alliance between such disparate persons, they continued, was “the least common denominator of a civilized culture — the defense of creative and intellectual freedom.”

It was the existence of Popular Front groups who toed the Stalinist line in science, literature, social thought, and the arts that moved the committee’s chief organizer, Sidney Hook, to action. “It seemed to me that it was necessary to challenge this massive phenomenon that was corrupting the springs of liberal opinion and indeed making a mockery of common sense,” Hook wrote in his autobiography, Out of Step (1987). “I decided to launch a new movement, based on general principles whose validity would be independent of geographical or national boundaries and racial or class membership.”

They are not self-consciously organized as a movement. To some extent, of course, this lack of institutionalization is related to present historical conditions. The mid 20th century was an era of bigness, of vast bureaus, of hierarchical corporations where political life, especially on the left, was divided and subdivided into party, committee, and cell. The early 21st century is too fractured, disaggregated, and anarchic for such precise construction and coordination. This is a time of weak relationships, of loose affiliations. People drop in and out of movements at the press of a “like,” “tweet,” or “send” button. And because our media is unbundled, and the multiple means of personal expression so accessible, no one authority has monopoly power to distinguish reasonable dissenters from cranks. This creates an opportunity for the enforcers of political correctness, who are quick to associate the enemies they unfairly deride as racists with genuine ones.

What has come into being is not a committee or congress but a Coalition for Cultural Freedom. This wide-ranging assembly of critics opposed to the consensus that dominates the commanding heights of culture, entertainment, and media is neither centrally directed nor unified, not precisely delineated or philosophically consistent. But they do all believe in what Gaetano Mosca called “juridical defense,” pluralism in opinion and institutions to guard against conformity and repression. And the fact that Kanye’s heresy and Weiss’s reporting were greeted with contumely, derision, outrage, and agony is evidence for the strength of such conformity, the desire for such repression.

Political correctness reigns in San Francisco, Hollywood, and Berkeley, and it is making inroads into New York and the permanent bureaucratic government in Washington, D.C., but its position is insecure, unstable. The ferocity with which challenges to the ideology are met signifies not power but weakness. All it takes to end the hegemony of political correctness is to combat or ignore its will to intimidation. And that is happening. The simple truth is that people do not like being reduced to their skin color, and they hate being called racists. So they tend to abandon the figures and organizations that see them as nothing but biased, sexist, bigoted dullards who belong in a basket of deplorables. They may not voice their opinion to a pollster for fear of social ostracism. But they reveal their preferences through action.

Hillary Clinton can tell you as much. So can ESPN and the NFL and the Hollywood studios whose social-justice masterworks are rewarded at the Oscars but not at the box office. Google and Facebook have also felt the backlash from censoring non-woke voices. Conversely, the success of American Sniper, Donald Trump, Jordan Peterson, and Roseanne has revealed the size of the audience willing to abandon the poses of political correctness for authenticity and disruption.

“The defense of intellectual liberty today imposes a positive obligation: to offer new and constructive answers to the problems of our time,” wrote the authors of the Freedom Manifesto. “We address this manifesto to all men who are determined to regain those liberties which they have lost and to preserve and extend those which they enjoy.” Those ranks included Sidney Hook and Arthur Koestler. Today they have been joined by Jordan Peterson, Charles Murray, Christina Hoff Sommers, and, yes, Kanye West.

It is a deeply patriotic holiday that many regard as a semi-sacred , particularly because we celebrate it on April 25 to mark the anniversary of the day in 1915 when Anzacs arrived on the shores of Gallipoli , Turkey to fight in a battle that would result in over ten thousand soldiers losing their lives . Like it or not , Anzac Day has become patriotic mythology .
To mark Anzac Day in 2015 , Special Broadcasting Service ( SBS ) reporter Scott McIntyre took to Twitter and wrote : “ Remembering the summary execution , widespread rape and theft committed by these ‘ brave ’ Anzacs in Egypt , Palestine and Japan. ” To make matters worse , he also asked “ if the poorly-read , largely white , nationalist drinkers and gamblers pause today to consider the horror that all mankind suffered. ” Then to round things off he added that Australia and its allies perpetrated the largest single-day “ terrorist attacks in history ” by dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima & Nagasaki .
Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull , who was Communications Minister at the time , tweeted back to McIntyre that his tweets were “ despicable remarks which deserve to be condemned . ”
The following day the media reported that McIntyre had been sacked by SBS News although he later settled an action for unfair dismissal against the network .
Then in 2016 in what was dubbed a “ witch hunt by conservative extremists , ” La Trobe University temporarily stood down academic and LGBT anti-bullying advocate Roz Ward after she privately posted to Facebook a picture of a rainbow flag with the text : “ Now we just need to get rid of the racist Australian flag on top of state parliament and get a red one up there and my work is done. ” The reference to the “ red one ” was understood to refer to the socialist flag , as Ward is an active member of the Socialist Alternative . She was also the prominent co-founder of the “ Safe Schools ” program , designed to educate children about LGBT issues .
The backlash was swift but so was the defence of Ward by the National Tertiary Education Union ( NTEU ) , who released a statement saying , “ This NTEU branch stands firmly against such modern-day witch-hunts and calls on La Trobe University management to publicly state their support for Roz ’ s ongoing employment with Safe Schools Coalition . ”
Yassmin Abdel-Magied also faced calls for her sacking from the national broadcaster after she posted on Facebook on Anzac Day 2017 : “ LEST . WE . FORGET . ( Manus , Nauru , Syria , Palestine … ) . ” ( Manus and Nauru are Australia ’ s offshore asylum seeker processing centers ) . Abdel-Magied was not fired but instead the ABC program she hosted was axed .
But in Australia witch hunts are bipartisan . Conservative indignation for leftist ideas generates much the same treatment . In 2017 , Dr. Pansy Lai appeared in a television advertisement for the ‘ Coalition for Marriage ’ calling for a vote against same-sex marriage . “ When same-sex marriage passes as law overseas , ” she said , “ this type of program [ the Safe Schools program ] becomes widespread and compulsory. ” Dr. Lai was threatened , and a petition was set up to demand that she be deregistered by the Australian Medical Association .
Earlier this year Australian rugby superstar Israel Folau wrote on his Instagram account that gay people would go to hell “ unless they repent of their sins and turn to God. ” He later published an anti-gay sermon on Twitter . This resulted in calls for him to leave Rugby Union , and speculation that Rugby Australia will not renew his contract .
'Sack Israel Folau ' : Liz Ellis urges Rugby Australia to act over 'homophobic ' comment https : //t.co/JuuUsnjwyb Folau was asked the Question and he replied – Ellis should go not Folau — Stephen Russell ( @ SJWR ) April 8 , 2018
Sometimes it ’ s clear to see why someone ’ s controversial comments have an impact on their employment . For example , the former Victoria police assistant commissioner resigned after it was revealed he had made racist and sexist comments online under a pseudonym , including about colleagues and the commissioner . Given that he was the head of the police ’ s ethical standards body , his own ethics and neutrality were clearly called into question . But often , the offensive conduct is private and has nothing to do with how people perform their job .
Should a doctor be able to practice medicine because she opposes same-sex marriage , or should a reporter be able to keep his job if he criticizes Australia ’ s military history on Anzac Day ? It ’ s my guess that depending on their politics , many Australians would passionately say yes to one but no to the other . So no matter what our political position when we express controversial views , whether from the left or the right , we count on offense , backlash and calls to get that person sacked . When we enter the realm of controversy , both sides want retribution and one of the most damning things you can do to a person is take away their livelihood .
Pitchfork-wielding mobs have always existed , but never have they been able to form in a matter of minutes and get people fired within hours . The speed of outrage on the internet moves so quickly that we could tweet something at the breakfast table before heading out the door for work only to find that when we arrive we don ’ t have a job . Whether we like it or not we are all governed by this rapid-growth wrath and the possibility that expressing our honest opinions on social media could destroy our careers .
As a practicing lawyer , I ’ m interested in looking at how social media is changing our ideas of justice and tort law . We live in a time when the dialogue itself can be the severest punishment we can inflict .
When people attempt to resolve disputes on their own , lawyers call it self-help . Self-help is all that exists in societies which lack an overarching legal system to determine rights and duties . Examples of self-help include something as benign as cutting off the branches from your neighbor ’ s tree when they overhang on your fence . However , self-help may also include trespassing on private property , or even assaulting a person . It is for this reason that the eminent textbook author Percy H. Winfield observed , “ self-help has always been reckoned as a perilous remedy owing to the stringent rules against its abuse. ” In other words , when people take the law into their own hands , the courts only allow it if the conduct is reasonable and proportionate . At its worst , self-help leads to vendettas , public shaming , and mob-violence .
In societies lacking functioning legal systems , feuds founded on self-help can descend into vendettas . Jared Diamond in The World Until Yesterday : What Can We Learn from Traditional Societies ? details his experiences in Papua New Guinea , where a driver named Malo accidentally strikes and kills a young boy named Billy . Diamond notes that in Papua New Guinea , drivers are allowed to flee the scene and head to the nearest police station because bystanders might drag them from their cars and beat them to death .
Adding to the tension in the incident Diamond describes , Malo and Billy were from different tribes and ethnic groups . In the event , the matter was resolved when Malo ’ s employer spoke to Billy ’ s father and offered to transfer food to Billy ’ s family , and gave a formal apology at Billy ’ s funeral . The first option with this kind of traditional justice is an attempt to achieve peace by compensation and negotiation , but if this doesn ’ t work , the second option is to seek personal retribution by violence , which tends to escalate into further retributive acts and then war . What is interesting about Diamond ’ s story is that the laws he describes are not an attempt to replace self-help but in fact work within the parameters of it .
While “ an eye for an eye ” may look bloodthirsty to us now , it was in fact an effort by ancient civilizations to forestall blood vendettas . In other words , the retributive response to an injury should be proportionate to the original injury , and the matter ends once proportionate retribution has been taken . Unlike Malo , the victims of a social media mobbing can ’ t flee . They can close their personal social media accounts , but they can ’ t stop people from calling , writing , emailing or campaigning against them . And we don ’ t have the capacity for peaceful negotiation in our modern global society , particularly when the mob is large , scattered and apt to expand exponentially .
My argument that social media campaigns are a form of self-help is at odds with the argument recently advanced by Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning in The Rise of Victimhood Culture . Campbell and Manning argue that social media campaigns to get people sacked are the opposite of self-help . This is because , unlike in the tribal Papua New Guinean context , they say that we have a comprehensive overarching governmental and legal system whereby we raise concerns with third parties to resolve disputes . Consequently , they assert that these situations involve “ legal overdependency , ” where rather than resolving their own disputes , people rely too heavily on an external third party .
Campbell and Manning deal specifically with disputes in the university context , where students bring claims of offensive behavior to university authorities rather than resolving them between themselves ( which would be a form of self-help ) . They use the example of Nicholas and Erika Christakis , both of whom had to stand down as faculty-in-residence at Silliman College , Yale University , after students became offended by an email about Halloween costumes and then organized protests and petitions against the couple .
Nonetheless , there ’ s still a self-help aspect to these disputes . Typically , the third-party authority is afraid of the mob and accedes to the demands rather than making a decision based on principles of justice and the facts at hand . Decisions are not made based on the private law rights between the parties ( what their employment contract states , or what wrong has been done ) . In fact , as Campbell and Manning outline , often these cases involve a startling lack of legal procedural protections .
Insofar as these decisions are said to represent legal decision-making , they don ’ t reflect the way law should operate in a liberal democracy . Every defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty , all parties are accorded procedural fairness and entitled to know what accusations are made against them , and all defendants are entitled to a relevant legal defense . There is an absence of law here , particularly when it comes to social media and the quick retribution a social media mob can exact .
In fact , civil recourse theorists argue one of the aims of tort law is to prevent self-help as much as possible , particularly when it takes violent forms if people feel they ’ ve been wronged . Instead , courts vindicate the victim ’ s rights in a public forum . While social media inflames tensions , the law aims to remove emotion and passion from disputes . This was recognized by John Locke in his Second Treatise on Government , written in 1690 :
…thus all private judgment of every particular member being excluded , the community comes to be umpire , by settled standing rules , indifferent , and the same to all parties ; and by men having authority from the community , for the execution of those rules , decides all the differences that may happen between any members of that society concerning any matter of right ; and punishes those offenses which any member hath committed against the society , with such penalties as the law has established…
This is the way in which liberal civil society should be organized . We want our disputes to be resolved by impartial judges who do not take sides , who drain the emotion out of matters , because a society that uses self-help to resolve disagreements is a more dangerous and violent one .
Democracy is predicated upon the free exchange of ideas . You might say , “ Ah , but that doesn ’ t include a right to be offensive , and to hurt others ! ” The difficulty is that “ offense ” is a subjective term , and what is offensive to one person may simply be a joke to another or have no impact at all . Occasionally during my teaching evaluations , a student will write comments indicating I ’ m a ginger-haired nerd . I ’ m not offended . I made peace with the fact that I have red hair , glasses , and a prodigious enthusiasm for academic topics .
In Campbell and Manning ’ s terms , my response is typical of a “ dignity culture , ” where the proper response to personal insults is to ignore them or rise above them . I may also have a touch of “ honor culture , ” where the proper response to a personal insult is to strike back physically , but I suppress that response as unworthy . I do not reflect “ victimhood culture , ” where a person ’ s status is predicated upon their ability to tick certain categories of disadvantage related to oppression and minority status ( the more boxes ticked , the higher the status ) . I could fit into several disadvantaged boxes if I wanted to , but I have spent my life trying to overcome disadvantage , not being defined by it .
But I understand that it can be traumatic to be on the receiving end of online abuse aimed at having you sacked from your job . I ’ ve received it myself for expressing certain opinions in public , and I ’ ve recently seen others ( both colleagues and friends ) receive similar abuse . Entire topics are off-limits for public discussion for me because of the abuse I received in the past . After my experience , several people told me , “ We think the same as you do , but we ’ d never say it publicly. ” Goodness knows , many others may have similar doubts to me , but we ’ ll never know , and in the meantime social policy will be predicated upon a totally different set of assumptions .
Joseph Overton postulated that there was an ever-shifting window of ideas that are politically acceptable ( the “ Overton window ” ) . I feel as if the Overton window of acceptable political ideas is shifting to polarized extremes , and views which I have long held ( e.g. , I prefer to judge people according to their conduct , not as members of the ethnic group to which they belong ) may now be regarded as unacceptable on parts of both right and left .
In Private Truths , Public Lies : The Social Consequences of Preference Falsification , Timur Kuran explains why it ’ s less than ideal to have situations where there is widespread preference falsification—where people don ’ t say what they really think out of fear . First , widely disliked social structures may be preserved because no one is brave enough to say publicly that they , too , do not agree . Secondly , social structures which are predicated on false preferences are prone to sudden collapse once the majority realizes that no one else likes or believes in the particular thing which is being upheld . Finally , preference falsification distorts public opinion , public discourse , and human knowledge . If people can not openly discuss their views , then certain views will not be explored or discussed , and the sum of human knowledge will be diminished .
Resentments may also fester in ways that are unhealthy , and which may erupt in unpredictable ways . And in the context of people being sacked for unpopular or offensive views or comments , employers will respond to those who make the most noise , regardless of whether the majority of consumers actually care about the issue . With all of this in mind , we need disincentives to stop a small group of aggressive people from policing other people ’ s opinions .
Moreover , it is important to recall basic labor law principles , and why it ’ s wrong to sack people for expressing political opinions that we do not like . Trade unions were the first to assert that workers should not be sacked because of their political beliefs or because of the people with whom they associated , and they continue to fulfill this role . My own union , the NTEU , rightly supported academic Roz Ward , mentioned at the outset of this piece as having caused offence by questioning the Australian flag . However , it is also standing up for Professor Peter Ridd , an academic who questioned the theory that the Great Barrier Reef is dying as a result of global warming . James Cook University sacked Ridd for alleged “ serious misconduct , ” but he is ( again rightly , in my view ) being supported by the NTEU , even though many union members would disagree with his position .
In this excellent post , UK labor lawyer Virginia Mantouvalou considers the broader issue of employees being sacked over social media posts , and notes there ’ s a legal inconsistency between protection of freedom of speech in the UK and rights against employers . She says :
The employer can not police workers ’ moral character , their political opinions or their preferences . The retention of someone ’ s job should not depend on the tabloid press and the effect of its ( mis ) reporting on employers ’ reputation . At present , speech that is protected against state interference is not protected in the employment context against dismissal and other disciplinary action . This is disturbing .
Dismissal can be devastating for its effect on income , reputation , and social life , as the Strasbourg Court itself has recognized , and even on people ’ s health .
The last point is a really important one . Employment is the way people make a living , but it can also be important to one ’ s identity and social status . To lose one ’ s job , or even to be at risk of losing one ’ s job , is so devastating that it can lead to PTSD or even suicide .
In an Australian context , an employer who sacked an employee would be subject to the Fair Work Act 2009 . It ’ s worth noting that McIntyre—the reporter who was sacked for his offensive tweets on Anzac Day—brought an action in unfair dismissal under this legislation , but not all employees are able to take advantage of such laws , or even make it past the loss of a single pay check .
There ’ s another issue here , too . Why do employers not stand up for an employee in the face of mob pressure ? My own theory is that it comes down to “ corporate branding ” and the way in which an individual ’ s “ personal brand ” is thought to mesh with the employer ’ s “ corporate brand. ” In other words , companies want to be perceived by the public in a certain way , and if individuals behave in a way that doesn ’ t match the brand , they must be disposed of before the brand is affected . This is even if the individual ’ s offensive comment is made in a private context and is not associated with their employment .
This strikes me as a form of market failure . Universities in particular should not operate according to corporate branding . A better indicator of the strength and health of a university is the extent to which it allows rigorous dissent and discussion , not in how it micromanages opinions expressed by staff .
I ’ ve talked above about the legal relationship between employer and employee , but what about the social media mob ? This is a little more difficult . However , there are several tort doctrines which may be helpful . The first is defamation , which prohibits communication to third parties of false statements that injure the reputation of a person . Importantly , the defamatory statements are presumed to be untrue , and it is for the defendant to prove that they are in fact true ( or “ substantially true ” in Australia ) . Unsurprisingly , social media defamation cases are on the rise , not only in Australia but around the world . Recently , a south Australian judge held a man liable not only for his Facebook posts , but also for the comments on those posts which brought a commercial rival into disrepute . Damages were were awarded for the loss of business which resulted . Consequently , if persons make or even just allow defamatory comments on social media which lead to a person getting sacked , they may be liable .
The other relevant tort doctrines are the economic torts prohibiting interference with contractual relations : inducing breach of contract , interference with contractual relationships , and conspiracy .
The history of these torts is odd , although it does show they ’ re long-lived and flexible . They arise from the action of per quod servitium amisit or “ loss of services , ” a common law action which arose in early medieval England . The feudal lord was held to own not only the services of his servants , but also the services of his wife . Injury to the wife therefore gave rise to damages for “ loss of consortium. ” The tort of inducing breach of contract was an offshoot of loss of services and arose in the wake of the Black Death after a third to one half of the population in Britain had died .
In response to the resultant labor shortage , the English Parliament passed the Ordinance of Labourers in 1349 , followed by the Statute of Labourers in 1351 . The Statute made it a crime to break an existing contract of service and attempted to fix wages at pre-plague rates . It was generally unsuccessful at achieving this aim and is thought to be one of the factors leading to the Peasant ’ s Revolt in 1381 . The Statute allowed judges to discover a common law action preventing a servant from breaking a contract and moving to a new master .
The modern tort of inducing breach of contract arose from the case of Lumley v. Gye , where Lumley ( the manager of Her Majesty ’ s Theatre ) sued Gye ( the manager of Covent Garden Theatre ) for inducing an opera singer , Johanna Wagner , to breach her contract to perform for Lumley in order to perform at his venue instead . The tort of inducing breach of contract later became notorious as it was part of the private law armory used by employers against trade unions , along with the contractual doctrine prohibiting restraint of trade , and the tort of conspiracy . Thus , in Taff Vale Railway Company v. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants the tort of inducing breach of contract was used to hold unions liable for losses which companies suffered due to striking workers . All these doctrines were ameliorated by statute in due course .
Importantly , the longevity and flexibility of these torts are suggestive . The tort of inducing breach of contract is rarely used and as the brief history outlined above shows , it has generally been used by employers , either to prevent employees from working for a rival employer , or to prevent unions from encouraging members from refusing to work for certain organizations . However , it could be repurposed to protect employees , and to disincentivize social media mobs .
Could someone like Scott McIntyre take action against people who called for him to be stood down from SBS ? His employment contract was clearly cancelled as a result of social media outrage , and certain public people were on record as saying his views were unacceptable ( including Malcolm Turnbull ) . Damage flowed from the cancellation of the contract , although it is not clear whether the contract was in fact breached by his employer ( I ’ m not aware of what the terms were ) . However , causation might be difficult to show . There was a social media pile-on and thus it might be difficult to prove ( a ) which individuals made the call to sack the employee and ( b ) that the calls in fact caused the sacking . It might be a situation of a death by a thousand cuts , and it would be difficult to show exactly which cut caused the final demise , or whether the decision to terminate the contract was an independent decision by the broadcaster .
Secondly , defendants may try to argue justification , perhaps in terms of general societal norms against offensive conduct , or in terms of specific provisions in McIntyre ’ s contract ( as noted above , we don ’ t know the terms ) .
However , if McIntyre could establish liability he could perhaps obtain an injunction restraining SBS from sacking him , or obtain damages from those who called for his sacking , reflecting the income and opportunity lost as a result of the cancellation of the contract , and perhaps aggravated damages for distress flowing from the cancellation . It is worth noting that courts in England , Australia and the U.S. would be less inclined to force SBS to rehire McIntyre in the event that the contract had already been terminated . Courts are reluctant to force people to work together once relations have broken down , although there is some Australian authority to the effect that the situation is different where an employee seeks an injunction against an employer .
Fundamentally , we have to stand against social media mobs who call for a person ’ s sacking simply because the person was offensive . Employers must make a measured decision on the basis of the legality of the situation . I ’ m not saying that a person can never be sacked on the basis of being offensive on social media ( sometimes it is clearly right that a person is sacked ) , but I am saying that we should resist mobs and think about the position of the employee dispassionately . Private law may help us to challenge employers who buckle at the first sign of anger on social media ; it encourages a measured view of disagreements .
We do not want a society where self-help becomes dominant , because in such a society , decisions are made in anger , and almost always result in some level of injustice . Moreover , it is bad for society if we can not freely exchange ideas . Unfortunately , being open to different ideas means that sometimes you get offended .
When in legal practice and at law school , I was trained always to look at the other side ’ s argument and to take its merits seriously . This meant that I gained a better idea of the strengths and weaknesses of my own position . Sometimes it was unpleasant and uncomfortable to have my views challenged , but I grew and learned as a result , and sometimes I even listened and changed my mind .

When people attempt to resolve disputes on their own, lawyers call it self-help. Self-help is all that exists in societies which lack an overarching legal system to determine rights and duties. Examples of self-help include something as benign as cutting off the branches from your neighbor’s tree when they overhang on your fence. However, self-help may also include trespassing on private property, or even assaulting a person. It is for this reason that the eminent textbook author Percy H. Winfield observed, “self-help has always been reckoned as a perilous remedy owing to the stringent rules against its abuse.” In other words, when people take the law into their own hands, the courts only allow it if the conduct is reasonable and proportionate.

What is interesting about Diamond’s story is that the laws he describes are not an attempt to replace self-help but in fact work within the parameters of it.

While “an eye for an eye” may look bloodthirsty to us now, it was in fact an effort by ancient civilizations to forestall blood vendettas. In other words, the retributive response to an injury should be proportionate to the original injury, and the matter ends once proportionate retribution has been taken. Unlike Malo, the victims of a social media mobbing can’t flee. They can close their personal social media accounts, but they can’t stop people from calling, writing, emailing or campaigning against them. And we don’t have the capacity for peaceful negotiation in our modern global society, particularly when the mob is large, scattered and apt to expand exponentially.

My argument that social media campaigns are a form of self-help is at odds with the argument recently advanced by Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning in The Rise of Victimhood Culture. Campbell and Manning argue that social media campaigns to get people sacked are the opposite of self-help. This is because, unlike in the tribal Papua New Guinean context, they say that we have a comprehensive overarching governmental and legal system whereby we raise concerns with third parties to resolve disputes. Consequently, they assert that these situations involve “legal overdependency,” where rather than resolving their own disputes, people rely too heavily on an external third party.

Campbell and Manning deal specifically with disputes in the university context, where students bring claims of offensive behavior to university authorities rather than resolving them between themselves (which would be a form of self-help). They use the example of Nicholas and Erika Christakis, both of whom had to stand down as faculty-in-residence at Silliman College, Yale University, after students became offended by an email about Halloween costumes and then organized protests and petitions against the couple.

Nonetheless, there’s still a self-help aspect to these disputes. Typically, the third-party authority is afraid of the mob and accedes to the demands rather than making a decision based on principles of justice and the facts at hand. Decisions are not made based on the private law rights between the parties (what their employment contract states, or what wrong has been done). In fact, as Campbell and Manning outline, often these cases involve a startling lack of legal procedural protections.

Insofar as these decisions are said to represent legal decision-making, they don’t reflect the way law should operate in a liberal democracy. Every defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty, all parties are accorded procedural fairness and entitled to know what accusations are made against them, and all defendants are entitled to a relevant legal defense. There is an absence of law here, particularly when it comes to social media and the quick retribution a social media mob can exact.

In fact, civil recourse theorists argue one of the aims of tort law is to prevent self-help as much as possible, particularly when it takes violent forms if people feel they’ve been wronged. Instead, courts vindicate the victim’s rights in a public forum. While social media inflames tensions, the law aims to remove emotion and passion from disputes. This was recognized by John Locke in his Second Treatise on Government, written in 1690:

…thus all private judgment of every particular member being excluded, the community comes to be umpire, by settled standing rules, indifferent, and the same to all parties; and by men having authority from the community, for the execution of those rules, decides all the differences that may happen between any members of that society concerning any matter of right; and punishes those offenses which any member hath committed against the society, with such penalties as the law has established…

This is the way in which liberal civil society should be organized. We want our disputes to be resolved by impartial judges who do not take sides, who drain the emotion out of matters, because a society that uses self-help to resolve disagreements is a more dangerous and violent one.

Democracy is predicated upon the free exchange of ideas. You might say, “Ah, but that doesn’t include a right to be offensive, and to hurt others!” The difficulty is that “offense” is a subjective term, and what is offensive to one person may simply be a joke to another or have no impact at all. Occasionally during my teaching evaluations, a student will write comments indicating I’m a ginger-haired nerd. I’m not offended. I made peace with the fact that I have red hair, glasses, and a prodigious enthusiasm for academic topics.

In Campbell and Manning’s terms, my response is typical of a “dignity culture,” where the proper response to personal insults is to ignore them or rise above them. I may also have a touch of “honor culture,” where the proper response to a personal insult is to strike back physically, but I suppress that response as unworthy. I do not reflect “victimhood culture,” where a person’s status is predicated upon their ability to tick certain categories of disadvantage related to oppression and minority status (the more boxes ticked, the higher the status). I could fit into several disadvantaged boxes if I wanted to, but I have spent my life trying to overcome disadvantage, not being defined by it.

But I understand that it can be traumatic to be on the receiving end of online abuse aimed at having you sacked from your job. I’ve received it myself for expressing certain opinions in public, and I’ve recently seen others (both colleagues and friends) receive similar abuse. Entire topics are off-limits for public discussion for me because of the abuse I received in the past. After my experience, several people told me, “We think the same as you do, but we’d never say it publicly.” Goodness knows, many others may have similar doubts to me, but we’ll never know, and in the meantime social policy will be predicated upon a totally different set of assumptions.

Joseph Overton postulated that there was an ever-shifting window of ideas that are politically acceptable (the “Overton window”). I feel as if the Overton window of acceptable political ideas is shifting to polarized extremes, and views which I have long held (e.g., I prefer to judge people according to their conduct, not as members of the ethnic group to which they belong) may now be regarded as unacceptable on parts of both right and left.

In Private Truths, Public Lies: The Social Consequences of Preference Falsification, Timur Kuran explains why it’s less than ideal to have situations where there is widespread preference falsification—where people don’t say what they really think out of fear. First, widely disliked social structures may be preserved because no one is brave enough to say publicly that they, too, do not agree. Secondly, social structures which are predicated on false preferences are prone to sudden collapse once the majority realizes that no one else likes or believes in the particular thing which is being upheld. Finally, preference falsification distorts public opinion, public discourse, and human knowledge. If people cannot openly discuss their views, then certain views will not be explored or discussed, and the sum of human knowledge will be diminished.

Resentments may also fester in ways that are unhealthy, and which may erupt in unpredictable ways. And in the context of people being sacked for unpopular or offensive views or comments, employers will respond to those who make the most noise, regardless of whether the majority of consumers actually care about the issue. With all of this in mind, we need disincentives to stop a small group of aggressive people from policing other people’s opinions.

Moreover, it is important to recall basic labor law principles, and why it’s wrong to sack people for expressing political opinions that we do not like. Trade unions were the first to assert that workers should not be sacked because of their political beliefs or because of the people with whom they associated, and they continue to fulfill this role. My own union, the NTEU, rightly supported academic Roz Ward, mentioned at the outset of this piece as having caused offence by questioning the Australian flag. However, it is also standing up for Professor Peter Ridd, an academic who questioned the theory that the Great Barrier Reef is dying as a result of global warming. James Cook University sacked Ridd for alleged “serious misconduct,” but he is (again rightly, in my view) being supported by the NTEU, even though many union members would disagree with his position.

In this excellent post, UK labor lawyer Virginia Mantouvalou considers the broader issue of employees being sacked over social media posts, and notes there’s a legal inconsistency between protection of freedom of speech in the UK and rights against employers. She says:

The employer cannot police workers’ moral character, their political opinions or their preferences. The retention of someone’s job should not depend on the tabloid press and the effect of its (mis)reporting on employers’ reputation. At present, speech that is protected against state interference is not protected in the employment context against dismissal and other disciplinary action. This is disturbing.

Dismissal can be devastating for its effect on income, reputation, and social life, as the Strasbourg Court itself has recognized, and even on people’s health.

The last point is a really important one. Employment is the way people make a living, but it can also be important to one’s identity and social status. To lose one’s job, or even to be at risk of losing one’s job, is so devastating that it can lead to PTSD or even suicide.

In an Australian context, an employer who sacked an employee would be subject to the Fair Work Act 2009. It’s worth noting that McIntyre—the reporter who was sacked for his offensive tweets on Anzac Day—brought an action in unfair dismissal under this legislation, but not all employees are able to take advantage of such laws, or even make it past the loss of a single pay check.

There’s another issue here, too. Why do employers not stand up for an employee in the face of mob pressure? My own theory is that it comes down to “corporate branding” and the way in which an individual’s “personal brand” is thought to mesh with the employer’s “corporate brand.” In other words, companies want to be perceived by the public in a certain way, and if individuals behave in a way that doesn’t match the brand, they must be disposed of before the brand is affected. This is even if the individual’s offensive comment is made in a private context and is not associated with their employment.

This strikes me as a form of market failure. Universities in particular should not operate according to corporate branding. A better indicator of the strength and health of a university is the extent to which it allows rigorous dissent and discussion, not in how it micromanages opinions expressed by staff.

I’ve talked above about the legal relationship between employer and employee, but what about the social media mob? This is a little more difficult. However, there are several tort doctrines which may be helpful. The first is defamation, which prohibits communication to third parties of false statements that injure the reputation of a person. Importantly, the defamatory statements are presumed to be untrue, and it is for the defendant to prove that they are in fact true (or “substantially true” in Australia). Unsurprisingly, social media defamation cases are on the rise, not only in Australia but around the world. Recently, a south Australian judge held a man liable not only for his Facebook posts, but also for the comments on those posts which brought a commercial rival into disrepute. Damages were were awarded for the loss of business which resulted. Consequently, if persons make or even just allow defamatory comments on social media which lead to a person getting sacked, they may be liable.

The other relevant tort doctrines are the economic torts prohibiting interference with contractual relations: inducing breach of contract, interference with contractual relationships, and conspiracy.

The history of these torts is odd, although it does show they’re long-lived and flexible. They arise from the action of per quod servitium amisit or “loss of services,” a common law action which arose in early medieval England. The feudal lord was held to own not only the services of his servants, but also the services of his wife. Injury to the wife therefore gave rise to damages for “loss of consortium.” The tort of inducing breach of contract was an offshoot of loss of services and arose in the wake of the Black Death after a third to one half of the population in Britain had died.

In response to the resultant labor shortage, the English Parliament passed the Ordinance of Labourers in 1349, followed by the Statute of Labourers in 1351. The Statute made it a crime to break an existing contract of service and attempted to fix wages at pre-plague rates. It was generally unsuccessful at achieving this aim and is thought to be one of the factors leading to the Peasant’s Revolt in 1381. The Statute allowed judges to discover a common law action preventing a servant from breaking a contract and moving to a new master.

The modern tort of inducing breach of contract arose from the case of Lumley v. Gye, where Lumley (the manager of Her Majesty’s Theatre) sued Gye (the manager of Covent Garden Theatre) for inducing an opera singer, Johanna Wagner, to breach her contract to perform for Lumley in order to perform at his venue instead. The tort of inducing breach of contract later became notorious as it was part of the private law armory used by employers against trade unions, along with the contractual doctrine prohibiting restraint of trade, and the tort of conspiracy. Thus, in Taff Vale Railway Company v. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants the tort of inducing breach of contract was used to hold unions liable for losses which companies suffered due to striking workers. All these doctrines were ameliorated by statute in due course.

Importantly, the longevity and flexibility of these torts are suggestive. The tort of inducing breach of contract is rarely used and as the brief history outlined above shows, it has generally been used by employers, either to prevent employees from working for a rival employer, or to prevent unions from encouraging members from refusing to work for certain organizations. However, it could be repurposed to protect employees, and to disincentivize social media mobs.

Could someone like Scott McIntyre take action against people who called for him to be stood down from SBS? His employment contract was clearly cancelled as a result of social media outrage, and certain public people were on record as saying his views were unacceptable (including Malcolm Turnbull). Damage flowed from the cancellation of the contract, although it is not clear whether the contract was in fact breached by his employer (I’m not aware of what the terms were). However, causation might be difficult to show. There was a social media pile-on and thus it might be difficult to prove (a) which individuals made the call to sack the employee and (b) that the calls in fact caused the sacking. It might be a situation of a death by a thousand cuts, and it would be difficult to show exactly which cut caused the final demise, or whether the decision to terminate the contract was an independent decision by the broadcaster.

Secondly, defendants may try to argue justification, perhaps in terms of general societal norms against offensive conduct, or in terms of specific provisions in McIntyre’s contract (as noted above, we don’t know the terms).

However, if McIntyre could establish liability he could perhaps obtain an injunction restraining SBS from sacking him, or obtain damages from those who called for his sacking, reflecting the income and opportunity lost as a result of the cancellation of the contract, and perhaps aggravated damages for distress flowing from the cancellation. It is worth noting that courts in England, Australia and the U.S. would be less inclined to force SBS to rehire McIntyre in the event that the contract had already been terminated. Courts are reluctant to force people to work together once relations have broken down, although there is some Australian authority to the effect that the situation is different where an employee seeks an injunction against an employer.

Fundamentally, we have to stand against social media mobs who call for a person’s sacking simply because the person was offensive. Employers must make a measured decision on the basis of the legality of the situation. I’m not saying that a person can never be sacked on the basis of being offensive on social media (sometimes it is clearly right that a person is sacked), but I am saying that we should resist mobs and think about the position of the employee dispassionately. Private law may help us to challenge employers who buckle at the first sign of anger on social media; it encourages a measured view of disagreements.

We do not want a society where self-help becomes dominant, because in such a society, decisions are made in anger, and almost always result in some level of injustice. Moreover, it is bad for society if we cannot freely exchange ideas. Unfortunately, being open to different ideas means that sometimes you get offended.

When in legal practice and at law school, I was trained always to look at the other side’s argument and to take its merits seriously. This meant that I gained a better idea of the strengths and weaknesses of my own position. Sometimes it was unpleasant and uncomfortable to have my views challenged, but I grew and learned as a result, and sometimes I even listened and changed my mind.

I can ’ t say . I just know I woke up one day confused .
Everyone , it seemed , had become a walking TV Guide : debating a bubbling vat of dramas and comedies , gossiping and blasting alerts about their pundit show bookings , filling out Which-character-are-you ? quizzes . TV coverage had overtaken the media , where magazines , newspapers and websites dissected anticipated serial finales like D-Day .
It wasn ’ t the existence of new cult shows that left me befuddled , or even the tonnage of critical praise heaped on them . It was the hungry-hippo , remote-happy tone that continues to define this “ golden age of TV. ” Kill Your Television has morphed into Love Your Television . I find this transformation deeply disorienting , but not in an old-person , out-of-touch kind of way . Because watching TV is an activity I associate with retirement homes , it feels more like the world around me has prematurely aged .
For years I ’ ve dreaded writing this . There ’ s no way to do it without sounding like that stock villain of the postwar American dinner party , the tweedy bore and pretentious prick who makes a loud public show of not owning a TV . For the record , I ’ m not that guy . But it ’ s time to call bullshit on the new consensus that TV , in any of its Internet-age mutations , has become our harmless friend , deserving ever-greater amounts of our time and critical coverage limited to endless plot exegesis . It ’ s time to shout from our dish-cluttered rooftops what has been obvious for years : this celebration of TV ’ s new “ golden age ” is out of control . It ’ s dangerous , and it ’ s sad .
Not long ago , the culture , and especially the left , wrestled with television . It was accepted to represent a bit of a mass media riddle : neither easily dismissed , nor easily accepted . It was hard to imagine forcing change or even organizing modern society without utilizing and harnessing its power and reach . At the same time , it was understood , by its very nature , to be a potent conduit for saturation levels of corporate and state propaganda . It was thought to breed passivity and weaken the capacity for critical thought . These debates had been going for decades when they disappeared early in the new century . The rising sea of “ must-see ” TV drowned ideas that were part of the bedrock of the left ’ s heritage .
When I began hashing out a worldview as an adolescent in the late 1980s , initiation into this heritage meant reckoning with television . I ’ d watched my share of `` Brady Bunch '' reruns and `` Silver Spoons , '' ingesting millions of commercials along the way , and it took its toll . In my mid-teens I started to intuit TV was causing me problems , both with schoolwork and more generally with my ability to make sense of the world . When I eventually found my way to the then-standard critiques of television , it was revelatory . The arguments rested on multiple pillars : the political economy of the networks ; the way that political economy leads to content designed to reinforce the status quo in often subtle but effective ways ; the impact of advertising ; the medium ’ s structural limitations and psychological effects ; and , most important , how all of this interacted to shape the potential for mass organization and social and political change . It wasn ’ t called the Idiot Box just because “ Hill Street Blues ” wasn ’ t written as well as “ The Wire , ” or because there were no shows where Nation and Mother Jones writers could talk about their work .
You could trace the lineage of these critiques back to guys like Marx and Adorno ( the first asshole to brag about not owning a TV ) but it wasn ’ t necessary . There was no shortage of popular books that modernized and developed the old ideas about culture reflecting and reinforcing society ’ s underlying economic relations — books like Jerry Mander ’ s `` Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television , '' Neil Postman ’ s `` Amusing Ourselves to Death , '' and Bill McKibben ’ s `` Age of Missing Information , '' to name a few . Less than a generation ago , the essence of these books could be found on ringed-binders , skateboards and first cars , distilled to that three-word battle cry , Kill Your Television , which captured a truth that has yet to be upended by TiVo , streaming , HBO or Chris Hayes . That truth , then as now , is this : Staring at images on a little screen — that are edited in ways that weaken the brain ’ s capacity for sustained and critical thought , that encourage passivity and continued viewing , that are controlled by a handful of publicly traded corporations , that have baked into them lots of extremely slick and manipulating advertising — is not the most productive or pleasurable way to spend your time , whether you ’ re interested in serious social change , or just want to have a calm , clear and rewarding relationship with the real world around you .
But wait , you say , you ’ re not just being a killjoy and a bore , you ’ re living in the past . Television in 2014 is not the same as television in 1984 , or 1994 . That ’ s true . Chomsky ’ s “ propaganda model , ” set out during cable ’ s late dawn in `` Manufacturing Consent , '' is due for an update . The rise of on-demand viewing and token progressive programming has complicated the picture . But only by a little . The old arguments were about structure , advertising , structure , ownership , and structure , more than they were about programming content , or what time of the day you watched it . Less has changed than remains the same . By all means , let ’ s revisit the old arguments . That is , if everyone isn ’ t busy binge-watching “ House of Cards . ”
It ’ s been something to watch , this televisionification of the left . Open a window on social media during prime time , and you ’ ll find young journalists talking about TV under Twitter avatars of themselves in MSNBC makeup . Fifteen years ago , these people might have attended media reform congresses discussing how corporate TV pacifies and controls people , and how those facts flow from the nature of the medium . Today , they ’ re more likely to status-update themselves on their favorite corporate cable channel , as if this were something to brag about .
None of this could be happening at a worse time . According to the latest S.O.S . from climate science , we have maybe 15 years to enact a radical civilizational shift before game over . This may be generous , it may be alarmist ; no one knows . What is certain is that pulling off a civilizational Houdini trick will require not just switching energy tracks , but somehow confronting the “ endless growth ” paradigm of the Industrial Revolution that continues to be shared by everyone from Charles Koch to Paul Krugman . We face very long odds in just getting our heads fully around our situation , let alone organizing around it . But it will be impossible if we no longer even understand the dangers of chuckling along to Kia commercials while flipping between Maher , `` Merlin '' and `` Girls . ''
One of the effects of watching so much TV is we start to confuse it with reality . In extreme cases , this can lead to ratings wars as a form of politics . As in , “ Ha ha , more of the 25–54 year-old viewers prized by advertisers are sitting in front of a box watching my favorite television personalities than are watching your favorite television personalities. ” Let ’ s skip by the fact that the fantasy abuse on “ Game of Thrones ” gets as much attention as abuse in our prison system , and go right to the aircraft carrier loads of type dedicated to parsing the representation of young women and feminism on cable shows . Last week , the front page of the Guardian website featured a column called “ Genius TV , ” in which Ann Friedman gushed that the Comedy Central show “ Broad City ” was “ a huge step forward , ” if not for equal pay , then for her crowded viewing schedule .

No , Carr , you ’ re not a bad person for missing “ Top of the Lake , ” whatever that is .

I can’t say. I just know I woke up one day confused.

Everyone, it seemed, had become a walking TV Guide: debating a bubbling vat of dramas and comedies, gossiping and blasting alerts about their pundit show bookings, filling out Which-character-are-you? quizzes. TV coverage had overtaken the media, where magazines, newspapers and websites dissected anticipated serial finales like D-Day.

It wasn’t the existence of new cult shows that left me befuddled, or even the tonnage of critical praise heaped on them. It was the hungry-hippo, remote-happy tone that continues to define this “golden age of TV.” Kill Your Television has morphed into Love Your Television. I find this transformation deeply disorienting, but not in an old-person, out-of-touch kind of way. Because watching TV is an activity I associate with retirement homes, it feels more like the world around me has prematurely aged.

For years I’ve dreaded writing this. There’s no way to do it without sounding like that stock villain of the postwar American dinner party, the tweedy bore and pretentious prick who makes a loud public show of not owning a TV. For the record, I’m not that guy. But it’s time to call bullshit on the new consensus that TV, in any of its Internet-age mutations, has become our harmless friend, deserving ever-greater amounts of our time and critical coverage limited to endless plot exegesis. It’s time to shout from our dish-cluttered rooftops what has been obvious for years: this celebration of TV’s new “golden age” is out of control. It’s dangerous, and it’s sad.

Not long ago, the culture, and especially the left, wrestled with television. It was accepted to represent a bit of a mass media riddle: neither easily dismissed, nor easily accepted. It was hard to imagine forcing change or even organizing modern society without utilizing and harnessing its power and reach. At the same time, it was understood, by its very nature, to be a potent conduit for saturation levels of corporate and state propaganda. It was thought to breed passivity and weaken the capacity for critical thought. These debates had been going for decades when they disappeared early in the new century. The rising sea of “must-see” TV drowned ideas that were part of the bedrock of the left’s heritage.

When I began hashing out a worldview as an adolescent in the late 1980s, initiation into this heritage meant reckoning with television. I’d watched my share of ""Brady Bunch"" reruns and ""Silver Spoons,"" ingesting millions of commercials along the way, and it took its toll. In my mid-teens I started to intuit TV was causing me problems, both with schoolwork and more generally with my ability to make sense of the world. When I eventually found my way to the then-standard critiques of television, it was revelatory. The arguments rested on multiple pillars: the political economy of the networks; the way that political economy leads to content designed to reinforce the status quo in often subtle but effective ways; the impact of advertising; the medium’s structural limitations and psychological effects; and, most important, how all of this interacted to shape the potential for mass organization and social and political change. It wasn’t called the Idiot Box just because “Hill Street Blues” wasn’t written as well as “The Wire,” or because there were no shows where Nation and Mother Jones writers could talk about their work.

You could trace the lineage of these critiques back to guys like Marx and Adorno (the first asshole to brag about not owning a TV) but it wasn’t necessary. There was no shortage of popular books that modernized and developed the old ideas about culture reflecting and reinforcing society’s underlying economic relations — books like Jerry Mander’s ""Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television,"" Neil Postman’s ""Amusing Ourselves to Death,"" and Bill McKibben’s ""Age of Missing Information,"" to name a few. Less than a generation ago, the essence of these books could be found on ringed-binders, skateboards and first cars, distilled to that three-word battle cry, Kill Your Television, which captured a truth that has yet to be upended by TiVo, streaming, HBO or Chris Hayes. That truth, then as now, is this: Staring at images on a little screen — that are edited in ways that weaken the brain’s capacity for sustained and critical thought, that encourage passivity and continued viewing, that are controlled by a handful of publicly traded corporations, that have baked into them lots of extremely slick and manipulating advertising — is not the most productive or pleasurable way to spend your time, whether you’re interested in serious social change, or just want to have a calm, clear and rewarding relationship with the real world around you.

But wait, you say, you’re not just being a killjoy and a bore, you’re living in the past. Television in 2014 is not the same as television in 1984, or 1994. That’s true. Chomsky’s “propaganda model,” set out during cable’s late dawn in ""Manufacturing Consent,"" is due for an update. The rise of on-demand viewing and token progressive programming has complicated the picture. But only by a little. The old arguments were about structure, advertising, structure, ownership, and structure, more than they were about programming content, or what time of the day you watched it. Less has changed than remains the same. By all means, let’s revisit the old arguments. That is, if everyone isn’t busy binge-watching “House of Cards.”

It’s been something to watch, this televisionification of the left. Open a window on social media during prime time, and you’ll find young journalists talking about TV under Twitter avatars of themselves in MSNBC makeup. Fifteen years ago, these people might have attended media reform congresses discussing how corporate TV pacifies and controls people, and how those facts flow from the nature of the medium. Today, they’re more likely to status-update themselves on their favorite corporate cable channel, as if this were something to brag about.

None of this could be happening at a worse time. According to the latest S.O.S. from climate science, we have maybe 15 years to enact a radical civilizational shift before game over. This may be generous, it may be alarmist; no one knows. What is certain is that pulling off a civilizational Houdini trick will require not just switching energy tracks, but somehow confronting the “endless growth” paradigm of the Industrial Revolution that continues to be shared by everyone from Charles Koch to Paul Krugman. We face very long odds in just getting our heads fully around our situation, let alone organizing around it. But it will be impossible if we no longer even understand the dangers of chuckling along to Kia commercials while flipping between Maher, ""Merlin"" and ""Girls.""

One of the effects of watching so much TV is we start to confuse it with reality. In extreme cases, this can lead to ratings wars as a form of politics. As in, “Ha ha, more of the 25–54 year-old viewers prized by advertisers are sitting in front of a box watching my favorite television personalities than are watching your favorite television personalities.” Let’s skip by the fact that the fantasy abuse on “Game of Thrones” gets as much attention as abuse in our prison system, and go right to the aircraft carrier loads of type dedicated to parsing the representation of young women and feminism on cable shows. Last week, the front page of the Guardian website featured a column called “Genius TV,” in which Ann Friedman gushed that the Comedy Central show “Broad City” was “a huge step forward,” if not for equal pay, then for her crowded viewing schedule. She sent up a loud “Amen” to the words of Grantland’s Molly Lambert, who wrote: “I [once] dreamed of a world on the screen … populated with chill women who refer to everyone as ‘dude.’ ‘Broad City’ is that world. May it run forever.”

Dare to dream, Molly.

Louder “hallelujahs” are often expressed about Stephen Colbert, the quickest-witted TV host since Groucho and with better politics. The problem starts when we forget he’s just a TV personality, and that his show is burdened with the same baggage as every other. The fact that his (and Jon Stewart’s) coverage of current events is often the best around was once seen as a condemnation of everyone else.

The problem with ""cancel culture"" has nothing to do with the act of cancelation.

That's something those behind the trend and those standing against it need to recognize. The effort to excommunicate from public life insufficiently ""woke"" (morally progressive) journalists, writers, comedians, and other prominent figures, including trying to get them fired, is likely to backfire. But not because the act of social and cultural cancelation itself is illegitimate or egregious.

All cultures ""cancel"" certain actions and opinions, and often the people associated with them. Ruling certain actions (and even thoughts) morally out of bounds is, in fact, a good part of what cultures do. Even liberal ones. Cultures are repositories of and communal enforcement mechanisms for upholding moral norms, and they do this by valorizing certain moral views and directing opprobrium at others. Doing so reinforces what ""we"" believe, thereby fostering social cohesion and helping to set moral standards and expectations for the political community as a whole.

In most cases, we tacitly acknowledge this and consider it perfectly uncontroversial. A neo-Nazi who made a point of publicly defending Hitler's Final Solution would be treated as a pariah, and hardly anyone would rise to his defense. Likewise with Stalinists, members of the Ku Klux Klan, child molesters, and practitioners of (even voluntary) incest and cannibalism. Nearly all of us consider these acts and belief systems evil and have no doubts about the wisdom and justice of excluding those who uphold them.

Which means that nearly all of us practice and approve of ""cancel culture"" an awful lot of the time.

But then what is it about the specific form of cancelation practiced by progressive activists over the past several years that raises so many hackles? If it isn't the act of canceling itself that's the problem, what is?

The answer is that critics of cancel culture are reacting to its partisan character. I'm using the term partisan in the precise sense, to mean an expression of the views of ""a part"" of the political community, as opposed to the views of the whole. The kind of cancelation I described above — about Nazis, Stalinists, violent racists, child molesters, and practitioners of incest and cannibalism — is affirmed, once again, by nearly everyone on nearly every side of every dispute that divides us as a society. It is transpartisan, an expression of the convictions of almost everyone. It is, for the most part, beyond dispute.

In many ways, comparing the experience of being (metaphorically) canceled in the 21st-century United States to a social and political upheaval that may have (literally) killed more than a million people is ludicrous and offensive.

We ’ ll be waiting to see if these left-wing bastions will change . I doubt it . But it sucks when you get a face full of buckshot , huh ?","The left-wing mob is recharged and totally insane. They’re back on this cancel culture nonsense. They’re tearing down statues of historical figures they view as problematic. There is no reasoning with them. They’re the intellectual al-Qaeda of our time. You don’t negotiate with terrorists. As Lincoln, Washington, Jefferson, and Roosevelt are being targeted, two things are clear. This has never been about Confederate statues, folks. This has been centered on the Left’s hatred of America and its history and the bizarre fetish to rewrite it through a woke paradigm where no nuance is afforded to anyone. The far-left loony code of ethics, for lack of a better term, is retroactively applied here. It’s utterly insane.

Now, granted, I admit that the Left had a good PR move here. The Confederacy isn’t all that popular, of course. By targeting them, they’ve created a campaign that puts every historical figure at risk. It was never going to stop with Jackson, Lee, or Davis. Never. This was the flank march, the backdoor maneuver to smash all the people.

As you already know, the statue of former President Ulysses S. Grant was torn down. American history has dark periods. The Confederacy, for better or worse, is part of that narrative. It must be defended, so yes—I will defend all the statues because the alternative is what we’re seeing now: A roving band of historically illiterate morons whose main goal is destruction and nothing else.

Conservative commentator Jesse Kelly has decided to bring the war home for these clowns, compiling a list of institutions that should be canceled due to the Left’s new rules on this matter. If you’re a member of the liberal elite, you should be ashamed. The entire Ivy League was built on racism. Granted, some of you knew this already. New York City was named after James, the Duke of York, and eventual King of England (James II), who, along with his brother, King Charles II, created a global monopoly on the slave trade. William M. Rice, who founded Rice University, wanted the institution to be “whites only.” Elihu Yale, who founded Yale University, was a slave trader as well. Oh, and you bet some liberals were not happy with Kelly making fun of them.

FYI: I’m not stopping until justice is done. @RiceUniversity has until next week to remove this statue of racist founder William M. Rice from its campus. Or we will march on Rice. Rice believed that school should be “for whites only”. Not in my America. ??? #CancelRice pic.twitter.com/jAqXltoszY — Jesse Kelly (@JesseKellyDC) June 22, 2020

On Aug. 17 , 1992 , Pat Buchanan and the Republican Party declared a “ culture war … for the soul of America. ” On Oct. 6 , 2014 , Republicans surrendered .
Twenty-two years ago at his party ’ s national convention , Buchanan thundered , “ we stand with [ President George H. W. Bush ] against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women. ” Last week , nearly every Republican and conservative movement leader stood quietly as the Supreme Court effectively extended equal marriage rights to more than half of the country . Stunned , former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee lashed out at his party ’ s silence , “ go ahead and just abdicate on this issue … I ’ ll become an independent . I ’ ll start finding people that have guts to stand. ” But he doesn ’ t seem to have many takers .
The surrender followed several capitulations and recalibrations by Republicans on other social issues . In March , Colorado Rep. Cory Gardner , locked in a close Senate race against Democratic incumbent Mark Udall , renounced his support for a state “ personhood ” amendment that would define human life at the moment of fertilization , but before implantation , and thus establish the constitutional grounds to ban certain forms of birth control . During an Iowa Senate debate late last month , Republican nominee Joni Ernst found herself having to roll back her definition of what “ personhood ” meant : In May she said it would establish an “ inalienable right to life of every person at any stage of development , ” but when her rival , Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley , said it “ would have banned all forms of abortion [ and ] certain forms of contraception , ” she recharacterized the constitutional amendment as something akin to a nonbinding resolution “ simply a statement that I support life ” —nothing more , she repeated , than “ a statement on life. ” Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker recently shifted from proclaiming he ’ s “ 100 percent pro-life ” to airing an ad , in response to one from Emily ’ s List advertising his absolute opposition to abortion even in cases of rape and incest , assuring voters his new abortion law “ leaves the final decision to a woman and her doctor . ”
We ’ ve come a long way since 2004 , when Republicans went 11-0 on anti-gay marriage state ballot initiatives , and since 1996 when Democrats were defensively insisting they wanted abortion to be “ rare. ” Half of all Americans now live in states that allow same-sex marriage , with more on the way .
How did the party of “ the real America ” get so utterly thumped in the culture war , a war of its own choosing ? People will tell you the defeat is due to the “ Rising American Electorate ” of African-American , Latino , youth and single women voters , which made up nearly half of the 2012 turnout and voted 2-to-1 for Obama . But it ’ s not a mere matter of demographics shifting under the Republicans ’ feet . The GOP sowed the seeds of its culture war demise with three big strategic blunders .
When Bill Clinton won the presidency in 1992 , Republicans lost the opening battle in the culture war , at least as defined by Buchanan in the summer of 1992 : “ In that struggle for the soul of America , Clinton & Clinton are on the other side , and George Bush is on our side. ” But , after the election , social conservatives regrouped and developed a smart abortion strategy that could succeed even if the wind was not at their backs .
Instead of emphasizing their purist positions , which they recognized most Americans did not yet share , conservatives took a pragmatic approach . They pinpointed their opponent ’ s weak spots . They hammered on abortion scenarios that Democrats would have to uncomfortably explain at length to defend . They crafted legislation to both restrict abortion access and divide Democrats . Medically necessary late-term abortions suddenly became gruesome “ partial-birth abortions , ” prompting more than 70 House Democrats in 1995 and 1997 to vote for a ban , which Clinton vetoed . Seemingly innocuous “ informed consent , ” “ parental involvement ” and “ safety ” regulations designed to limit abortion access flooded state legislatures , many of which became law .
During the subsequent Bush presidency , conservatives stayed on this path , albeit more aggressively . The federal “ Partial Birth Abortion Act ” was signed into law and upheld by Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices . The number of states with onerous regulations stifling abortion providers more than doubled to 33 . By 2004 , Mississippi managed to shut down every abortion clinic within its borders save for one .
A warning sign that anti-abortion activists can push things too far flashed in 2006 , when South Dakota voters repealed a state law enacted earlier that year banning all abortions .
Yet when the ideological pendulum swung back to the left with the 2008 election of Barack Obama , Republicans failed to stick with the incremental , sometimes stealthy , approach that allowed social conservatives to make advancements despite a Democratic White House in the 1990s . Conservative state legislators turned “ informed consent ” into “ mandated transvaginal ultrasounds. ” Primary voters eagerly elevated candidates opposed to all abortions without exception , including two 2012 Senate nominees who explicitly defended forcing rape victims to carry out their pregnancies . Both proceeded to lose in states that Mitt Romney won .
Anti-abortion forces continue to hold the upper hand in deep-red states , where 20-week abortion bans without exceptions are the latest thing . But in the states that determine who controls Congress , the tables have been turned . Now the Democrats are the ones who can pound their opponent ’ s weak spots on abortion . Even in reddish North Carolina , Sen. Kay Hagan is holding a gender gap-fueled lead by opposing a 20-week ban and hammering her Republican rival on abortion restrictions he helped clear the state legislature .
Perhaps Republicans were impatient with incremental progress . Perhaps the party lacked a strong leadership figure who could keep fringe players in check . But Republicans made a decision on abortion strategy that they didn ’ t have to make .
When Mitt Romney couldn ’ t succinctly answer a 2012 primary debate question about whether states should be able to ban contraception , Republicans blamed the media for raising an irrelevant question . Not only was the question relevant— “ personhood ” amendments had already been considered at the state level , and more were to come—Romney ’ s fumble foreshadowed his party ’ s inexplicable difficulty to handle an issue that had been long put to bed .
Republican squeamishness with birth control is hard to figure . Surveys show that 99 percent of women under 45 who have sex with men will , at least some of the time , use birth control . Any competent politician would try to get in good with the 99 percent , not the 1 percent .
In fact , during the George W. Bush presidency , Republicans were quite comfortable with the idea of requiring insurers to include contraception in their plans . As the Los Angeles Times chronicled , members of both parties worked on such mandates after women ’ s groups argued it was unfair for plans to include Viagra but not the pill . The Bush administration chose not to scrap a 2000 rule forcing many employers to cover contraception if they also were covering preventative services and prescription drugs . Twenty-two states , including six with Republican governors , enacted laws that required insurance companies to cover birth control .
When the Affordable Care Act mandated the same thing , suddenly Republicans concluded the clause was an attack on religious liberty and an example of government handouts run amok . Conservatives celebrated the Supreme Court ’ s Hobby Lobby ruling , which has complicated implementation of the mandate . In a January speech to the Republican National Committee , Huckabee said in disgust , “ If the Democrats want to insult the women of America by making them believe that they are helpless without Uncle Sugar coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control because they can not control their libido or reproductive system without the help of the government , so be it . ”
Nine years earlier , Huckabee had been one of those six Republican governors who signed the same mandate into law .
Republicans had been perfectly willing to use the power of government to expand access to birth control.They had done it when Bush was president . But under Obama , they blew a synapse , and let their hatred wreck their political judgment .
After 2000 , Bush political strategist Karl Rove fretted that 4 million Christian conservatives stayed home on Election Day . After 2003 , many on the right were in a panic once the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court established equal marriage rights for gays and lesbians . In 2004 , Republicans responded by spearheading ballot initiatives in 11 states banning same-sex marriage , including the swing states of Ohio and Michigan . Rove may not have masterminded it , but he told the Ohio media he believed the initiative would boost Republican turnout .
Republicans won the battle , but they soon lost the war . All 11 passed handily , and another seven passed in 2006 . However , the mean-spirited anti-gay marriage campaign actually failed to increase Republican turnout , while alienating the younger generation of voters . American youth who had grown up treating gays equally soon propelled Barack Obama to the White House and invigorated the marriage cause . Ten years after that first round of anti-gay initiatives , same-sex marriage is on the verge of being legal in 60 percent of the country .
With a little more foresight and a little less bigotry , Republicans could have realized that misguided cultural attitudes toward gays would naturally diminish over time , and divined better ways to rally the conservative troops . There were plenty of signs that Republicans were on the wrong side of history . The vice president ’ s daughter was openly gay . The TV show “ Will & Grace ” was in its sixth season . Even Bush sensed that a hateful anti-gay stance could drive away swing voters : One week before Election Day , he expressed support for civil unions .
It was too little too late . Republicans never launched an organized push for civil unions as a way to compete for gay voters without alienating religious conservatives who wanted to cordon off marriage for heterosexuals . Such a stance would have been squarely in the ideological middle at the time : In the 2004 Election Day exit poll , 35 percent of Americans supported civil unions and another 25 percent supported equal marriage . Only 37 percent opposed all forms of legal recognition for same-sex couples . If Republicans hoped to draw a line at marriage , a firm civil-unions position was their best chance .
That way , if Republicans had still lost the marriage fight , they at least would have lost honorably without appearing clueless and homophobic . Instead they chose the William F. Buckley strategy : to stand athwart history yelling “ Stop. ” It backfired . Support for gay marriage , now a clear majority , has jumped 15 points in five years and will surely continue to rise . Indeed , on issue after cultural issue , Republican positions poll miserably , especially with younger voters .
Some might argue Republicans lost the culture war because they have been held captive by an increasingly out-of-touch religious right . These examples complicate that narrative . Social conservatives might hinder Republican flexibility on cultural issues to an extent . Yet it was not long ago when Republicans were capable of pursuing incremental abortion restrictions and accepting birth control as part of mainstream society . With more forceful leadership from a Republican president , they may have been able to walk the line on civil unions and hold the line on marriage .
Pat Buchanan was never going to see his dream of an America without abortion or gays . But it was not preordained for Republicans to lose the culture war so completely .

But it’s not a mere matter of demographics shifting under the Republicans’ feet. The GOP sowed the seeds of its culture war demise with three big strategic blunders.

1. Republicans stopped being savvy on abortion.

When Bill Clinton won the presidency in 1992, Republicans lost the opening battle in the culture war, at least as defined by Buchanan in the summer of 1992: “In that struggle for the soul of America, Clinton & Clinton are on the other side, and George Bush is on our side.” But, after the election, social conservatives regrouped and developed a smart abortion strategy that could succeed even if the wind was not at their backs.

2. Republicans got weird about birth control.

When Mitt Romney couldn’t succinctly answer a 2012 primary debate question about whether states should be able to ban contraception, Republicans blamed the media for raising an irrelevant question.

Then, Obama.

In a January speech to the Republican National Committee, Huckabee said in disgust, “If the Democrats want to insult the women of America by making them believe that they are helpless without Uncle Sugar coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control because they cannot control their libido or reproductive system without the help of the government, so be it.”

Sign up here .
President Trump on Friday announced that new Centers for Disease Control guidance will classify houses of worship as “ essential , ” as he called on governors to allow them to open “ right now ” after being closed during the coronavirus lockdowns .
Trump announced the policy for churches , synagogues and mosques , during a short briefing at the White House .
BALTIMORE PASTOR RIPS UP CEASE-AND-DESIST LETTER MID-SERMON : 'WE 'RE GON NA DO IT GOD 'S WAY ! '
`` The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential places of faith to open right now -- for this weekend , '' Trump said . `` If they do n't do it , I will override the governors . ''
`` In America , we need more prayer not less , '' Trump added .
It 's unclear under what authority Trump has to override governors . But Trump took issue with certain businesses being open , while churches are not . Attorney General William Barr already warned last month that coronavirus restrictions by state and local government should be applied evenly and not single out religious organizations .
`` Some governors have deemed the liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential , '' Trump said . `` But have left out churches and other houses of worship . It 's not right . So I 'm correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential . ''
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released interim guidelines Friday for communities of faith that acknowledge `` millions of Americans embrace worship as an essential part of life '' but also warn that `` gatherings present a risk for increasing the spread of COVID-19 . ''

President Trump on Friday announced that new Centers for Disease Control guidance will classify houses of worship as “essential,” as he called on governors to allow them to open “right now” after being closed during the coronavirus lockdowns.

Trump announced the policy for churches, synagogues and mosques, during a short briefing at the White House.

""The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential places of faith to open right now--for this weekend,"" Trump said. ""If they don't do it, I will override the governors.""

""In America, we need more prayer not less,"" Trump added.

It's unclear under what authority Trump has to override governors. But Trump took issue with certain businesses being open, while churches are not. Attorney General William Barr already warned last month that coronavirus restrictions by state and local government should be applied evenly and not single out religious organizations.

""Some governors have deemed the liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential,"" Trump said. ""But have left out churches and other houses of worship. It's not right. So I'm correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released interim guidelines Friday for communities of faith that acknowledge ""millions of Americans embrace worship as an essential part of life"" but also warn that ""gatherings present a risk for increasing the spread of COVID-19.""

The guidelines encourage the use of cloth face coverings during services, limiting the size of gatherings, social distancing during services and suspending or decreasing choirs and singing in church since ""singing may contribute to transmission of COVID-19, possibly through emission of aerosols,"" the CDC says.

Last week the CDC released new guidelines that schools, businesses and other organizations can use as states reopen from coronavirus shutdowns. The document, however, excluded guidance for churches and faith-based groups because the White House raised concerns about the recommended restrictions, the Associated Press reported.

Jones is co-author of `` Say it Loud : An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete . '' She talks politics , sports and culture weekly on Philadelphia 's Praise 107.9 FM . The views expressed here are solely hers . Read more opinion on CNN .
( CNN ) Sometimes `` I 'm sorry '' just does n't cut it -- a hard lesson that NBC Today show host Megyn Kelly now understands . Reportedly , Kelly 's morning show `` Megyn Kelly Today '' may be cancelled , according to CNN sources and Variety reports .
Kelly , who never really seemed like a good fit for the NBC morning show , overplayed her popularity earlier this week when she passionately defended people who don blackface costumes for Halloween -- a thing that most Americans understand is definitely not okay , unless their intention is to offend .
`` But what is racist ? '' Kelly asked on her show . `` Because you do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface on Halloween , or a black person who puts on whiteface for Halloween . Back when I was a kid that was OK , as long as you were dressing up as , like , a character . ''
The backlash was swift . Kelly was roasted across social media and more importantly her colleagues and bosses were appalled by her comments . NBC executives forced Kelly to apologize first , internally to her colleagues , and then to the viewers .
But Halloween is tricky and the blackface flap did n't die down .
Ironically , for me , the most revealing part of Kelly 's explosive comments was their illumination of her true face as an out-of-the-closet racist , in my opinion .
I did n't buy Kelly 's innocent act of contrition . Maybe I 've just become desensitized to these knee-jerk , teleprompter apologies for public misdeeds . Maybe we all have . Maybe we should .
But Kelly should n't be surprised that her racist statements met resistance . And she should n't be surprised that NBC , like so many other employers who have taken action against talent for incidents of racism , has apparently decided that her brand of bigotry is simply not worth the risk anymore . Even her NBC colleague Al Roker , who said Wednesday , `` The fact is , she owes a bigger apology to folks of color around the country . ''
This is not Megyn 's first go around with racially-tinged talk . We know her history ; we 've watched her on Fox , stirring up political divisiveness and animosity . We listened to you spout white privilege with your snarky comments : `` Jesus was a white man ... as is Santa . '' That 's just a historical fact , you claimed . Though a quick check of the Bible does n't back up your statements . You also said the young girl in Texas shown being manhandled by a cop in a viral video `` was no saint , '' and criticized others , like Stephen A. Smith and then-Baltimore mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake , for apologizing for their own racially insensitive comments .
Despite her history , I was initially willing to cut Kelly some slack . When she landed her $ 69 million deal and moved to NBC from Fox under a cloud of controversy over her divisiveness , many , myself included , resented that Kelly bumped out fan favorites ( and two black journalists I admire greatly ) Al Roker and Tamron Hall . But I told my peers to give her a chance .
Kelly had impressed me at the presidential debates back in 2016 . She was strong and came across as a solid journalist who 'd done her research . She stood up to then-candidate Trump 's misogynist bullying . I respected her for that even if I did n't agree with her politics .
But she failed to live up to that respect . Like many people recently , Kelly fell into the trap ensnaring a lot of undercover bigots in America today .
We all know them by now thanks to social media , which has shamed these over-zealous white people for falsely accusing innocent blacks of wrongdoing .
Mowing lawns , taking a nap in a dorm , sitting in Starbucks , trying to enter your apartment after a long day at work -- it 's alarming the rate at which whites have used police to try and intimidate black people for simply being in their space . It 's no wonder Kelly feels empowered to reveal her racist opinions on national television .
Sadly , these offenses are felt almost daily for black folks , even me . My former business partner and neighbor recently felt free to throw out the N-word with his friends while we were at work . Then he laughed about it when a guy standing nearby pointed out that I was in earshot . Like Megyn Kelly , he too later apologized . But I had already seen his true face .
I get that underground racists feel emboldened by a President who declares on national TV , `` Absolutely I am a nationalist . '' They think they can now push the boundaries of what it means to be a racist . They think they can redefine the meaning of racism by arguing that they do n't believe in being PC -- which to me means that they want to be free to deny the humanity and equality of others who are not like them .
What they do n't get is that we will not allow the clocks to be turned back to a time when the only thing right was white .
Too much blood has been shed in the fight for equality . It 's a new day . And this time , the voices for equality are amplified . More Americans across every demographic believe in their own inalienable right to justice and equality .
We do n't believe in political correctness , either . Not the type that says we have to be silent and do nothing in the face of your hatred . No . We are fighting back . We are organizing , using social media to ostracize blatant acts of racism . And we will hold accountable anyone who uses hate to try and demean us and deny our equality .
Megyn and her ilk may follow the bitter road that leads out of Washington . But beware : we are coming for you . Armed with new allies , more political awareness , technology and our growing financial power . We wo n't go backward .","Roxanne Jones, a founding editor of ESPN Magazine and former vice president at ESPN, has worked as a producer, reporter and editor at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer.

But Halloween is tricky and the blackface flap didn't die down.

Ironically, for me, the most revealing part of Kelly's explosive comments was their illumination of her true face as an out-of-the-closet racist, in my opinion.

I didn't buy Kelly's innocent act of contrition. Maybe I've just become desensitized to these knee-jerk, teleprompter apologies for public misdeeds. Maybe we all have. Maybe we should.

But Kelly shouldn't be surprised that her racist statements met resistance. And she shouldn't be surprised that NBC, like so many other employers who have taken action against talent for incidents of racism, has apparently decided that her brand of bigotry is simply not worth the risk anymore. Even her NBC colleague Al Roker, who said Wednesday, ""The fact is, she owes a bigger apology to folks of color around the country.""

This is not Megyn's first go around with racially-tinged talk. We know her history; we've watched her on Fox, stirring up political divisiveness and animosity. We listened to you spout white privilege with your snarky comments : ""Jesus was a white man ... as is Santa."" That's just a historical fact, you claimed. Though a quick check of the Bible doesn't back up your statements. You also said the young girl in Texas shown being manhandled by a cop in a viral video ""was no saint,"" and criticized others , like Stephen A. Smith and then-Baltimore mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, for apologizing for their own racially insensitive comments.

Despite her history, I was initially willing to cut Kelly some slack. When she landed her $69 million deal and moved to NBC from Fox under a cloud of controversy over her divisiveness, many, myself included, resented that Kelly bumped out fan favorites (and two black journalists I admire greatly) Al Roker and Tamron Hall. But I told my peers to give her a chance.

Kelly had impressed me at the presidential debates back in 2016. She was strong and came across as a solid journalist who'd done her research. She stood up to then-candidate Trump's misogynist bullying. I respected her for that even if I didn't agree with her politics.

But she failed to live up to that respect. Like many people recently, Kelly fell into the trap ensnaring a lot of undercover bigots in America today.

We all know them by now thanks to social media, which has shamed these over-zealous white people for falsely accusing innocent blacks of wrongdoing.

Mowing lawns, taking a nap in a dorm, sitting in Starbucks, trying to enter your apartment after a long day at work -- it's alarming the rate at which whites have used police to try and intimidate black people for simply being in their space. It's no wonder Kelly feels empowered to reveal her racist opinions on national television.

Sadly, these offenses are felt almost daily for black folks, even me. My former business partner and neighbor recently felt free to throw out the N-word with his friends while we were at work. Then he laughed about it when a guy standing nearby pointed out that I was in earshot. Like Megyn Kelly, he too later apologized. But I had already seen his true face.

I get that underground racists feel emboldened by a President who declares on national TV, ""Absolutely I am a nationalist."" They think they can now push the boundaries of what it means to be a racist. They think they can redefine the meaning of racism by arguing that they don't believe in being PC -- which to me means that they want to be free to deny the humanity and equality of others who are not like them.

What they don't get is that we will not allow the clocks to be turned back to a time when the only thing right was white.

Too much blood has been shed in the fight for equality. It's a new day. And this time, the voices for equality are amplified. More Americans across every demographic believe in their own inalienable right to justice and equality.

We don't believe in political correctness, either. Not the type that says we have to be silent and do nothing in the face of your hatred. No. We are fighting back. We are organizing, using social media to ostracize blatant acts of racism. And we will hold accountable anyone who uses hate to try and demean us and deny our equality.

We all could use a retreat.

Antonin Scalia didn’t get into Princeton University. That’s one of the many things I didn’t necessarily expect to learn reading On Faith : Lessons from an American Believer, a new collection of reflections and speeches by and about the late Supreme Court justice.

He brought it up during a 1998 talk to a group of students at his alma mater, Georgetown University. He used it as an example of trusting the hand of Providence and not being stubborn about your own will. He trusted he was a “better” man than he might have been had his own will — going to Princeton — been done. For every disappointment in life, not just college admissions, it’s something worth keeping in mind. It’s important if you’re a person “who believes in the transcendental.”

And if you say you do, and can’t quite keep that perspective, it’s probably long past time you get yourself on a retreat. “If you don’t have a weekend to spare once a year to think exclusively about the things that really matter — well, then you haven’t planned your life correctly,” Scalia insisted, perhaps knowing what most of us would be thinking right about now.

That was Scalia’s pitch back on campus. And thanks to this new volume, which is full of discourses on the law, courage, vocation, and moments of grave moral concerns (such as the Holocaust), it’s his pitch to us, too.

“Maybe now more than ever” may be an overused phrase, but it applies here, for a time-out is needed in many of our lives. How many of us can even get through a traditional newspaper column without being tempted, or simply unable to resist, the urge to go check our phone for something — anything — potentially new? Everyone knows about “fake news”; how about the needless, repetitious information that we voluntarily submit ourselves to daily and that we even form what sound to be strong, emotional opinions about? Some of it is no better than gossip. Most of it not only has no positive effect on our lives, it also takes us away from the people and needs around us that should demand our attention. It’s a never-ending reality-television show that keeps trumping itself (and no, it’s not only the president!) for new plot lines.

He’s a man who has suffered, and there may be a wisdom there that our current politics just can’t handle tapping into.

It’s all certainly worth a prayer, and a little listening time for guidance, a reassessing. If we were all doing this, we’d be better, making life better for others. Scalia said he fell off retreats after his Catholic-school days but then rediscovered their power in the Eighties and kept with it thereafter. It’s a beautiful legacy — his very practical and in-no-way-partisan posthumous gift for a harried people.

I think [ the ‘ American Dirt ’ incident ] is more of a hiccup along the way than an indication that we ’ re sliding back. ” ( Read the Monitor ’ s review of “ American Dirt . ” )
But bestselling author David Bowles ( “ Feathered Serpent , Dark Heart of Sky : Myths of Mexico ” ) believes that earlier protest campaigns have resulted in more empathetic rewrites that were mindful of people ’ s dignity .
“ Why it ’ s happening now is because it is related to the politics of identity and the feeling that certain groups in society haven ’ t had a sufficient voice and representation , ” says Ian Buruma , former editor of The New York Review of Books . “ If every writer could only write about characters like themselves that would become a very narrow exercise . And the whole point of writing , especially of fiction , is that you can get into the heads of people who are not like yourself . ”
At the heart of the matter is a deeper question : How can fiction best engender empathy ?
The furor over “ American Dirt ” centers around a previously noncontroversial idea : authors using fiction to imagine lives other than their own . To some , the controversy represents identity politics run amok . To others , the dispute highlights a lack of diversity within the most prestigious echelons of the publishing industry .
It was supposed to be the book launch of every author ’ s dream : Jeanine Cummins had scored a rare publishing industry trifecta . She sold “ American Dirt ” for seven figures . A Hollywood studio bought the film rights . Oprah Winfrey anointed it her Book Club pick .
Yesterday , Ms. Cummins ’ publisher canceled her tour and issued a public apology amid a firestorm of accusations of cultural appropriation and stereotyping .
It ’ s a pattern familiar to writers of young adult , science fiction , and other genre fiction . But “ American Dirt , ” industry observers say , is the most high-profile work of literary fiction bound up in a thorny question : Who gets to tell someone ’ s story ?
Ms. Cummins herself acknowledged the debate in her afterword of her thriller about a Mexican mother and son escaping a drug lord by fleeing to the U.S. border . “ As a non-immigrant and non-Mexican , I had no business writing a book set almost entirely in Mexico , set entirely among immigrants , ” she wrote . “ I wished someone slightly browner than me would write it . ”

“ Why it ’ s happening now is because it is related to the politics of identity and the feeling that certain groups in society haven ’ t had a sufficient voice and representation , ” says Ian Buruma , former editor of The New York Review of Books . “ But when it starts relating to fiction or drama or film , it seems to me a very doubtful discourse because , first of all , if every writer could only write about characters like themselves that would become a very narrow exercise . And the whole point of writing , especially of fiction , is that you can get into the heads of people who are not like yourself . ”
The caveat is that authors should strive for verisimilitude . Ms. Cummins has claimed she was “ careful and deliberate ” in her research and traveled extensively on both sides of the border . ( Flatiron Books agreed to the Monitor ’ s request for an email interview with Ms. Cummins , but she hasn ’ t responded to the submitted questions . )
Yet Latino authors such as Myriam Gurba , Daniel Peña , and David Bowles have rebuked Ms. Cummins for employing nonidiomatic Spanish phrases , homogenizing Mexicans ’ regional cultures and geography , and lazily relying on stereotypical tropes such as setting the first scene at a quinceañera . They fret that “ American Dirt ” will leave readers with the impression that Mexico is a hellhole .
“ Cummins identified the gringo appetite for Mexican pain and found a way to exploit it , ” wrote Ms. Gurba ( author of the memoir “ Mean ” ) , whose caustic review notes that Ms. Cummins identified as white in a 2015 essay . In the run-up to the book ’ s publication , the author described herself as part Latino because her grandmother is from Puerto Rico . “ Critics have compared Cummins to Steinbeck , I think a more apt comparison is to Vanilla Ice , ” Ms. Gurba wrote .
By contrast , American writer Lionel Shriver ( “ We Need to Talk About Kevin ” ) has long defended the idea that authors should be free to try on other hats . At the 2017 Brisbane Writer ’ s Festival in Australia , she underscored that point by donning a sombrero at the end of a speech .
“ We all observe each other , ” says Ms. Shriver . “ And part of self-examination is not always availing , is it ? So sometimes others can see things about you that you can ’ t . So I ’ m interested in the observations of people about groups to which they do not belong . ”
Lefteris Pitarakis/AP/File Writer Lionel Shriver , shown in 2007 in her London apartment , has long defended the idea that novelists should be free to write about lives unlike their own .
“ If you ’ re a good fiction writer and a good observer of the world , there are no limits to what you can take on with enough empathy and research , ” says Ms. Shriver . “ You own the whole world for as long as you are here . It is your backyard . It is your experience . And there is no hands off . And that ’ s for everyone , as well as artists . So you have a right to have an opinion about it , to experience it , to think about it , to talk about it . ”
Of late , several genre fiction authors have been called out for misrepresenting marginalized groups that they aren ’ t a part of . The civil war in the Romance Writers of America – which resulted in the resignations of multiple presidents , an entire board , and the cancellation of the 2020 convention – erupted in December after the RWA banned a Chinese American writer , Courtney Milan , for forcefully objecting on Twitter to how Kathryn Lynn Davis described Chinese characters in “ Somewhere Lies the Moon ” ( which was published in 1999 ) .
In the world of young adult fantasy , Amélie Wen Zhao ’ s “ Blood Heir , ” Keira Drake ’ s “ The Continent , ” Laura Moriarty ’ s “ American Heart , ” and Laurie Frost ’ s “ The Black Witch ” were pilloried for alleged racist depictions of characters . Polite critiques on Twitter and Goodreads were about as rare as a starred review for a James Patterson thriller in Publishers Weekly . Consequently , several of those books were pulled prior to publication and revised .
Bestselling YA author Mr. Bowles ( “ Feathered Serpent , Dark Heart of Sky : Myths of Mexico ” ) believes those protest campaigns resulted in more empathetic rewrites that were more mindful of the dignity of groups of people .
“ Very few people are saying that people can not write other people ’ s stories , but what they are saying is it is the height of privilege to believe that you are writing in a vacuum , ” says Mr. Bowles , who notes that relatively few books are subject to headline-making instances of blowback . “ All of this hand-wringing about , ‘ You ’ re trying to censor me , ’ feels like more of a move by white hegemony – often an unconscious move , but a move nonetheless – to continue to marginalize the voices of color . ”
For its part , the publishing industry is very self-aware of its demographic makeup . Yesterday , Lee and Low Books released a survey that revealed that 76 % of employees in the industry are white , 74 % are women , 81 % are straight , and 89 % are non-disabled . In recent years , many publishing houses have striven to promote marginalized authors writing about marginalized characters with # ownvoices marketing campaigns .
The industry regularly employs sensitivity readers to vet books – particularly for children and young adults – for offensive material related to portrayals of race , nationality , gender , religion , sexuality , and ability . In her acknowledgments at the end of “ American Dirt , ” Ms. Cummins thanks more than a dozen Latinos who read the manuscript , including scholars and people at various nonprofit institutions in Mexico .
Some are dubious that sensitivity readers can claim to fully represent a particular group . After all , people within different nationalities , races , classes , and genders aren ’ t homogenous .
“ They ’ re being explicitly asked to make normative judgments , ethical judgments , aesthetic judgments , ” says philosopher and science fiction author Craig Delancey ( “ Gods of Earth ” ) . “ Is the fact that this particular character is a criminal somehow now expressive of certain bigotries ? ”
Their evaluations go beyond fact-checking – they ’ re subjective , says Mr. Delancey . Case in point : Clarkesworld magazine recently pulled the sci-fi short story “ I Sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter ” – not exactly a common category of intersectionality – when some readers interpreted it as a transphobic allegory . The story had been vetted by sensitivity readers . And it was written by a trans woman .
Mr. Buruma , for one , believes that authors shouldn ’ t strive for sensitivity in an ideological sense of placating readers . After all , many works of literature , including “ Lady Chatterley ’ s Lover , ” “ Ulysses , ” and “ Last Exit to Brooklyn ” have offended readers . Rather , authors should be sensitive to the behavior of their characters , who may well misbehave , as a way to understand the human heart .
“ Fiction has an important role in making us understand not only ourselves better and how human behavior in general works – including our own – but where empathy comes in is that it allows us to get under the skin of people who are not like us , ” says Mr. Buruma , now a professor of human rights and journalism at Bard College in New York .
By her own account , that ’ s exactly what Ms. Cummins set out to accomplish with “ American Dirt. ” She wrote that she wanted to remind readers that “ the people coming to our border are not one faceless brown mass but singular individuals . ”
Some writers , including Ann Patchett and Lauren Groff , testify to being deeply moved by the story . “ When I think of the migrants at the border , suffering and desperate , I think of Lydia and Luca , ” Ms. Groff wrote in a New York Times review , in which she also expressed anxiety over the fact that “ American Dirt ” wasn ’ t written by a Mexican or a migrant .
Sandra Cisneros ( “ The House on Mango Street ” ) remains a staunch defender of the book and believes it could reach audiences who wouldn ’ t pick up one of her books . “ It ’ s going to be [ an audience ] who maybe is undecided about issues at the border , ” Ms. Cisneros told NPR ’ s Maria Hinojosa . “ It ’ s going to be someone who wants to be entertained , and the story is going to enter like a Trojan horse and change minds . And it ’ s going to change the minds that , perhaps , I can ’ t change . ”
But for Daniel Peña ( “ Bang ” ) the plot amounts to “ lab-created brown trauma built for the white gaze and white book clubs to give a textural experience to people who need to feel something to avoid doing anything and from the safety of their chair . ”
Yesterday , Flatiron publisher Bob Miller issued a public apology in which he wrote , “ We should never have claimed that it was a novel that defined the migrant experience. ” The publisher also canceled Ms. Cummins ’ extensive book tour due to “ specific threats to booksellers and the author. ” Ms. Winfrey now says she wants to host a “ deeper conversation ” about “ American Dirt ” on her Apple+ TV show .
Flatiron promises a series of town hall meetings at a later point in which Ms. Cummins “ will be joined by some of the groups who have raised objections to the book. ” Mr. Miller added , “ We believe that this provides an opportunity to come together and unearth difficult truths to help us move forward as a community . ”

Mccarthy, Tobias Hoonhout, Bill Corsair, Jason Richwine","An old truism holds that to find out who rules you , “ look for who you ’ re not allowed to criticize. ” In a democratic society , however , I ’ d suggest a more accurate measure would be : Look for the person or thing that gets praised the least . One of the defining qualities of a free people , after all , is deep aversion to appearing on the side of power . Even the original quotation obviously exists to instigate criticism where a lack of it is presently perceived .
By this standard , social media is clearly our collective tyrant . We all understand ourselves to be ruled by it , and endless columns are churned out decrying this grim reality . Writers are ostentatiously quitting Twitter left and right — most recently the New York Times ’ Maggie Haberman — or simply writing long essays about the neurotic hell it has made their lives .
Blame is heaped not only on endless hate tweets , preening status updates , curated echo chambers , and daily viral outrages , but also on the medium itself . Psychologically manipulative interfaces are accused of trapping us in addictive cycles of constant use . Character limits and anonymous accounts are turning us into snippy , cocksure jerks . Blocked and banned accounts are eroding free speech . Social-media CEOs are hauled before Congress to explain themselves .
Much of this hostility and skepticism is rationally grounded , but it ’ s also only one half of the story , and we ’ re not well served by ignoring the other half . It ’ s always easy , fun , and empowering to hate the tyrant of the moment , but vastly harder — socially , emotionally , and intellectually — to acknowledge its talents . And not just talents in the “ it ’ s good at manipulating me ” sense either , but genuinely attractive qualities worth praising on their own terms .
The hard fact is that social media remains popular despite its flaws because it is a tremendously useful , convenient , and enjoyable technology for the vast majority of users . It has made communication among friends , strangers , and mass audiences fast and easy . Distribution and dissemination of news — in the broadest sense of the word — has become effortlessly efficient .

Are social media the problem? Or are we?

An old truism holds that to find out who rules you, “look for who you’re not allowed to criticize.” In a democratic society, however, I’d suggest a more accurate measure would be: Look for the person or thing that gets praised the least. One of the defining qualities of a free people, after all, is deep aversion to appearing on the side of power. Even the original quotation obviously exists to instigate criticism where a lack of it is presently perceived.

By this standard, social media is clearly our collective tyrant. We all understand ourselves to be ruled by it, and endless columns are churned out decrying this grim reality. Writers are ostentatiously quitting Twitter left and right — most recently the New York Times’ Maggie Haberman — or simply writing long essays about the neurotic hell it has made their lives.

Blame is heaped not only on endless hate tweets, preening status updates, curated echo chambers, and daily viral outrages, but also on the medium itself. Psychologically manipulative interfaces are accused of trapping us in addictive cycles of constant use. Character limits and anonymous accounts are turning us into snippy, cocksure jerks. Blocked and banned accounts are eroding free speech. Social-media CEOs are hauled before Congress to explain themselves.

Much of this hostility and skepticism is rationally grounded, but it’s also only one half of the story, and we’re not well served by ignoring the other half. It’s always easy, fun, and empowering to hate the tyrant of the moment, but vastly harder — socially, emotionally, and intellectually — to acknowledge its talents. And not just talents in the “it’s good at manipulating me” sense either, but genuinely attractive qualities worth praising on their own terms.

The hard fact is that social media remains popular despite its flaws because it is a tremendously useful, convenient, and enjoyable technology for the vast majority of users. It has made communication among friends, strangers, and mass audiences fast and easy. Distribution and dissemination of news — in the broadest sense of the word — has become effortlessly efficient. Social media has given us a clearer window into the minds of politicians, journalists, brands, entertainers, and celebrities of all sorts, and in doing so, helped us understand them, appreciate them, and hold them accountable. It has served as a useful forum for intellectual conversation, creative self-expression, and online commerce. It is mostly free to use.

Every decision counts.

Meat eaters rejoice! A new scientific study suggests that the eating of flesh alone cannot explain differences in the carbon footprints (CF) of various households.

Instead, the true culprits of elevated carbon footprints, based on a new study in the journal One Earth, seem to be sweets, frequenting restaurants often, and swilling booze. ”Meat consumption only weakly explains the difference between high- and low-CF households and is not localized to any particularly easily targeted group,” an international team of researchers concluded after examining the eating habits of 60,000 Japanese households and comparing this information with other relevant data.

Carefully designed experimental studies have revealed that Americans treat people of the same party differently from members of opposing parties . Public opinion surveys also reveal that politics affects Americans ' social relationships , ranging from how they get along with neighbors to their preferences for the person their son or daughter chooses to marry . Still other studies have revealed sharp partisan differences in Americans ' trust in institutions like the media .
A recent ███/Knight Foundation survey extended this research to Americans ' community-level attachments . The study looked at how people 's perceptions of their community 's political leanings relate to 1 ) their feelings of community attachment and 2 ) their trust in local residents .
To examine these issues , ███ asked respondents to characterize their own political views , and the political leanings of the people who live in their local area , using a seven-point scale ranging from very liberal to very conservative . Each respondent was given a gap score based on the number of scale positions separating the two ratings . The maximum score of six is for those describing their own views as `` very liberal '' and the community as `` very conservative , '' or vice versa . Respondents who rate their own views and those of their community the same were scored a zero .

One way that Americans ' perception of the ideological match between themselves and their community seems to matter is in their sense of community attachment .
Eighty-two percent of respondents living in politically compatible communities ( ideological gaps of zero to 1 ) of any political group say they feel `` very '' or `` somewhat '' attached to their local community . Those who perceive a moderate ideological gap are nearly as likely to say the same ( 75 % ) . A more significant drop in a sense of belonging occurs among respondents who perceive a large ideological gap , with 62 % saying they feel `` very '' or `` somewhat '' attached . These patterns hold among Democrats , Republicans and independents .
Republicans Far Less Likely to Trust Neighbors When Community Contrast Is High
In addition to measuring attachment to their community , the survey also asked respondents about their trust in people in their community , generally . Sixty-six percent of Americans , including equal percentages of Republicans and Democrats , say most people in their local area can be trusted . Yet , one 's perceptions of their community 's ideological leaning influences how much people trust their fellow residents , but only for Republicans , not Democrats .
After controlling for a number of demographic variables ( gender , age , education , income and urbanicity ) , the predicted probability a Republican will say people in their local area can be trusted drops from 73 % in perceived ideologically friendly territory ( gaps of 0 to 1 point ) to 45 % in perceived unfriendly territory ( gap of four or more points ) .
In contrast , the predicted probability that Democrats will trust people in their local area is roughly 70 % regardless of the ideological gap .

Bottom Line

Political polarization is not only relevant to Americans' voting behavior, news consumption and stance on policy issues, but is also a lens through which we can better understand how Americans interact in their communities. Americans' perception of how well the politics of that community matches their own political worldview closely relates to their own sense of community attachment. The closer the political alignment, the more attachment they feel. This is not only important on its own, but community attachment has been shown to be a meaningful proxy for civic and political engagement.

Likewise, the dearth of trust in one's neighbors expressed by Republicans living in areas perceived as politically liberal has far ranging implications. In particular, trust is an undervalued resource that powers economic prosperity and promotes political stability by reducing uncertainty and increasing people's willingness to give the other side the benefit of the doubt. The fact that the perceived ideological gap affects the generalized trust of people in the local area among Republicans and not among Democrats lends support to the contention of asymmetrical polarization.

Ultimately, given the high level of polarization in the U.S., the ideological gap between people's own views and that of their community appears to be a useful metric for understanding how Americans on opposing sides of the U.S. ideological spectrum relate to their community in important ways.",www.news.gallup.com,center,Am9qegbM7BZRzW42

Earlier media reports described the station as Jones’ “flagship” outlet, but one of the station’s hosts, Danny Sessom, said Wednesday night that TXLR merely rebroadcasts Jones’ show, according to NPR.

Jones has faced mounting troubles in recent months, most notably a defamation lawsuit arising from his false claim on his “Infowars” program that the parents of one of the children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre were perpetuating the massacre story as a hoax.

Most social media platforms have banned Jones from their channels for violating their prohibitions on hate speech.

His program also has been yanked from the music streaming service Spotify and he was suspended from Twitter for a week for violating that platform’s rules.",www.nypost.com,right,SEGCOPo67PWyXWlQ

Prior to 1963 , when a vaccine was developed , the highly contagious virus led each year to 48,000 hospitalizations and 400–500 deaths , mostly among small children , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . But immunization campaigns steadily eroded the disease 's reach , and by 2000 it was declared eliminated from American shores .
Today , the U.S. is grappling with the worst measles outbreak in a quarter-century . Some 981 cases were confirmed in 26 states between January 1 and May 31—a 26-fold increase from the total in 2004 . The CDC anticipates one or two fatalities per 1,000 cases , so it looks like only a matter of time before the disease again starts claiming American lives .
The most tragic thing about the measles resurgence is how wholly unnecessary it is . Whether out of fear , out of ignorance , out of confusion , or out of religious conviction , parents choosing not to vaccinate their kids have allowed immunization rates to drop below the 95 percent threshold required to keep the virus at bay . In October , officials reported that the number of children who have n't received vaccines for preventable diseases had quadrupled since 2001 .

Socialism , too , is having an American renaissance . As with measles , if it 's allowed to spread , the result will be needless human suffering .
A generation after the fall of the Soviet Union , young Americans have forgotten , if they ever learned , what happens when a citizenry allows itself be enraptured by the promise of communal ownership of a national economy ( `` Socialism Is Back , and the Kids Are Loving It , '' page 55 ) . Such regimes have failed whenever and wherever they 've been tried , engendering misery , starvation , persecution , and wasted human potential on a massive scale . At this very moment , hyperinflation and desperate shortages of food , medicine , and power are ravaging Venezuela ( `` Man-Made Disaster in Venezuela , '' page 75 ) , a previously rich country that had every intention of forging a better , smarter socialist future for the 21st century .
The new wave of young American socialists are quick to insist they have a different , gentler vision—as the Democratic Socialists of America 's website puts it , one in which `` working people '' run things `` democratically to meet human needs , not to make profits for a few . '' But that is a hoped-for end state , not an implementable program . The concrete policies most modern socialists propose—high confiscatory taxes and aggressive wealth redistribution , free college , publicly provided universal health care ( and , often , the abolition of private alternatives ) —are far more likely to wreak devastation on the well-being of Americans than they are to finally achieve utopia .
Each of these policies does violence to the market-based system of free exchange and private property rights that has underpinned the greatest expansion of human flourishing in human history .

Socialism, too, is having an American renaissance. As with measles, if it's allowed to spread, the result will be needless human suffering.

culture,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2017/10/20/16507594/john-kelly-beliefs-few-good-men,John Kelly has become a field commander in Trump’s culture war,2017-10-20,"Dara Lind, Umair Irfan, Nicole Narea, Terry Nguyen, German Lopez, Alissa Wilkinson, Constance Grady","When White House Chief of Staff John Kelly took the podium at the Thursday afternoon press briefing to defend the controversy surrounding President Trump ’ s treatment of a Gold Star family , he was treated with the deference and gravitas this White House doesn ’ t usually receive .
It wasn ’ t just because Kelly is himself a Gold Star father — his son Robert was killed in Afghanistan in 2010 . It was because Kelly ’ s reluctance to talk about his son ’ s death in public has become part of the legend of John Kelly — ironically , the idea that Kelly is too noble to use the death of his son to burnish his own reputation has burnished that reputation more than anything Kelly could have said .
On Thursday , there he was : a man whose White House tenure has been associated with blunt truths and ( occasionally successful ) discipline , talking about the thing he ’ d always resisted talking about in public .
But this wasn ’ t a 60 Minutes interview . It was a presidential press briefing .
Kelly ’ s appearance may have been compelling because of John Kelly , the man ; but it mattered because it was one of the most powerful advisers to the most powerful man on earth , using his personal experience and gravitas to attempt to lay a political controversy to rest — by characterizing those who had raised it , including a member of Congress , as violators of something sacred .
“ You know , when I was a kid growing up , a lot of things were sacred in our country . Women were sacred . Looked upon with great honor . That 's obviously not the case anymore , as we 've seen from recent cases , ” he said . “ Life was sacred . That 's gone . Religion . That seems to be gone as well . Gold Star families , I think that left in the convention over the summer . I just thought the selfless devotion that brings a man or woman to die in the battlefield , I thought that might be sacred . ”
But the distinction in demeanor between Kelly and his boss — and subsequent difference in how much they ’ re respected by the press — masked some Trumpian tendencies of Kelly ’ s own . In his umbrage toward Rep. Frederica Wilson ( D-FL ) , who listened to Trump ’ s call with the Gold Star Johnson family , he told an ugly story about Wilson ’ s “ empty-barrel ” bragging about funding an FBI office — a story that turned out to be , in many particulars , untrue .
Kelly ’ s tactics may not be Trump ’ s tactics . But his enemies are Trump ’ s enemies . As long as Kelly remains in this White House , he is helping to prosecute President Trump ’ s culture war — a war in which the other side is seen as people who don ’ t love or respect America enough to see it made great again .
Kelly is a more credible messenger , as far as the Washington press corps is concerned , for the message that the actions of the American state are beyond question . That doesn ’ t mean he ’ s right .
To John Kelly , there are those who serve America , and those who will never understand what that means
Kelly is the kind of military man who really wants you to know that he doesn ’ t like politics or politicians . Whenever Trump says that chief of staff is the best job Kelly ’ s ever had , he reminds him that the best job he ever had was US Marine .
As secretary of the Department of Homeland Security , he resented queries from members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus about the actions of immigration agents ; as chief of staff , he consistently appears in “ inside the White House ” stories expressing frustration that Congress hasn ’ t fixed a problem yet .
It ’ s understandable that Kelly wouldn ’ t be used to the domestic political arena — after all , the adage that “ Politics stops at the water ’ s edge ” insulates career military officers from having to deal with the level of scrutiny and criticism that their domestic counterparts can face . But it ’ s not just that Kelly doesn ’ t respect the way that politics works within Washington — the time it takes to make a congressional deal , the way that embarrassing statements can get leaked to eager reporters . He actively thinks that they have America wrong , and that they will never understand it in the way those who serve it will .
President Trump generated two days of controversy earlier in the week by saying that President Obama didn ’ t call the families of fallen soldiers , creating a stream of follow-up questions that ultimately led a White House official ( later identified as press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders ) to say that Obama had not called Kelly after the death of his son . But at Thursday ’ s press conference , Kelly simply waved away that whole phase of the controversy : Presidents often don ’ t call Gold Star families , he said , and he ’ d actually advised Trump not to do so . Because a call from the president didn ’ t matter anyway :
Typically the only phone calls the family receives are the most important phone calls they could imagine , and that is from their buddies . In my case , after my son was killed , his friends were calling us from Afghanistan telling us what a great guy he was . Those are the only phone calls that really matter .
“ Buddies ” aren ’ t just the people who knew the deceased . They ’ re the people who served with him . That comment is a glimpse into a world where there are only two kinds of people : those who have served or have family members who do , and those who will never understand the sacrifices of the first group .
Kelly made the division clear himself when , in taking questions , he insisted on calling on only reporters who knew Gold Star families themselves . Everyone else was assumed to be part of the problem .
Kelly champions the idea that criticizing the behavior of agents of the state is criticizing America
This isn ’ t just a matter of simple anti-elite , anti- “ chickenhawk ” sentiment . In Kelly ’ s eyes , those who serve America understand it and those who do not simply don ’ t . The latter , in fact , can ’ t really be trusted to preserve America ’ s goodness .
“ We do n't look down upon those who have n't served , ” Kelly said at the end of the presser . “ In a way we 're a bit sorry because you 'll never experience the wonderful joy you get in your heart when you do the kind of things our service men and women do . ”
In fact , he said at another point , they “ volunteer to protect our country when there 's nothing in our country anymore that seems to suggest that self-service to the nation is not only appropriate but required . That 's all right ” ( emphasis added ) .
So when Kelly waxed nostalgic about the days when certain things were “ sacred ” — women , religion , and battlefield sacrifice — he wasn ’ t just echoing the complaints of so many who support Donald Trump because they too feel America is no longer great . He was saying that there are Americans who have kept the flame of American greatness alive — those who serve the country for a living — and that the best thing the rest of America can do is keep a respectful distance .
Maybe it ’ s an understandable bit of chauvinism from a career Marine . But that doesn ’ t stop it from being a worrisome attitude when it becomes an unquestioning fealty to anything those people can do while in uniform . Kelly ’ s rhetoric can be reminiscent of Jack Nicholson ’ s character Col. Jessup in A Few Good Men — “ I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide , and then questions the manner in which I provide it ” — but Jessup was the villain .
Furthermore , to Kelly , the caste of those who serve America goes beyond members of the military to those who protect against threats “ at home ” — the people he was leading as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security .
At DHS , Kelly routinely expressed frustration with anyone who questioned the actions of DHS staff — whether they were Customs and Border Protection officers detaining people at airports under Trump ’ s first travel ban , or Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials detaining immigrants who were supposed to be protected from deportation under the DACA program .
In a speech at George Washington University in April , Kelly blamed this for DHS ’ s notoriously low morale : “ When you discourage , when you disable , when you unjustly criticize and default to believing the initial reports as opposed to defaulting to believing the stories told by my professionals , what else do you expect ? ”
“ Defaulting to believing ” one side of a story is not how the press works . It ’ s not how political debate works . Politics is literally , on one level , asking and answering questions about the actions of agents of the state . But Kelly sees no distinction between questioning the action and questioning the person . It ’ s a revival of the George W. Bush-era idea that “ respecting the troops ” meant supporting the war , updated for a 21st-century sense that because the enemy is everywhere , America ’ s “ front lines ” are populated not just by soldiers but by law enforcement .
No matter how Kelly feels about Trump , he ’ s prosecuting Trump ’ s culture war
This is the attitude of those who have criticized , or even threatened to abandon , the NFL over the decision of some players to kneel during the national anthem as a protest for racial justice and against aggressive policing .
It ’ s the attitude that not only does it breach the mystical unity of the American nation to be reminded of politics , i.e. , disagreements over the actions of the American state , but that it is a specific insult to the individuals who serve as agents of that state . That protesting police is the same as disrespecting the troops and the flag itself . That no matter how respectfully the protest is conducted , the fact that it is a protest is an insult : “ Kneeling , ” President Trump said this week , “ is basically sitting . ”
Trump didn ’ t start this culture war — the ingredients have been there ever since the Dixie Chicks were blackballed by country radio and their listeners because their lead singer criticized George W. Bush at an overseas concert . But he has ascended to the nation ’ s most powerful office for the purpose of waging it .
It ’ s obvious , at this point , that Trump sees his job as serving the people who voted for him and being mean to those who don ’ t . And it appears to be true that for many of his supporters , Trump ’ s actions as head of government matter less than his actions as head of state — i.e. , the man with the most powerful microphone — and the people he ’ s sticking it to .
Yes , it ’ s ironic that so much of what Kelly appears to despise about contemporary politics and society is embodied in his own boss . But as long as Kelly remains in the White House , it does not matter .
Maybe he thinks Trump is doing the right thing by putting the right people in charge . Maybe he sees Trump as a unique danger to the Republic and thinks therefore it ’ s particularly important for him to serve as an adult in the room . Maybe he thinks all politicians are really this bad . Maybe he suspects that a decadent , disrespectful America has simply gotten what it deserves .
What is going on inside John Kelly ’ s head does not matter as long as he is willing to stand at the podium in the press room and tell members of the press that they and the political debate they engage in are not just frivolous but corrosive to the republic , and that there is a truer form of patriotism — one embodied in the agents of the state — that they should not question and whose messengers they must respect .
The press is used to deferring to the military , and to those who have lost children in war . They ’ re willing to let Kelly attack them in ways they wouldn ’ t be willing to countenance from other Trump officials . But what Kelly is saying doesn ’ t come from his experience as a Gold Star father . It comes from the way he sees the world — and his own agenda to make America great again .","When White House Chief of Staff John Kelly took the podium at the Thursday afternoon press briefing to defend the controversy surrounding President Trump’s treatment of a Gold Star family, he was treated with the deference and gravitas this White House doesn’t usually receive.

It wasn’t just because Kelly is himself a Gold Star father — his son Robert was killed in Afghanistan in 2010. It was because Kelly’s reluctance to talk about his son’s death in public has become part of the legend of John Kelly — ironically, the idea that Kelly is too noble to use the death of his son to burnish his own reputation has burnished that reputation more than anything Kelly could have said.

On Thursday, there he was: a man whose White House tenure has been associated with blunt truths and (occasionally successful) discipline, talking about the thing he’d always resisted talking about in public.

But this wasn’t a 60 Minutes interview. It was a presidential press briefing.

Kelly’s appearance may have been compelling because of John Kelly, the man; but it mattered because it was one of the most powerful advisers to the most powerful man on earth, using his personal experience and gravitas to attempt to lay a political controversy to rest — by characterizing those who had raised it, including a member of Congress, as violators of something sacred.

“You know, when I was a kid growing up, a lot of things were sacred in our country. Women were sacred. Looked upon with great honor. That's obviously not the case anymore, as we've seen from recent cases,” he said. “Life was sacred. That's gone. Religion. That seems to be gone as well. Gold Star families, I think that left in the convention over the summer. I just thought the selfless devotion that brings a man or woman to die in the battlefield, I thought that might be sacred.”

But the distinction in demeanor between Kelly and his boss — and subsequent difference in how much they’re respected by the press — masked some Trumpian tendencies of Kelly’s own. In his umbrage toward Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-FL), who listened to Trump’s call with the Gold Star Johnson family, he told an ugly story about Wilson’s “empty-barrel” bragging about funding an FBI office — a story that turned out to be, in many particulars, untrue.

Kelly’s tactics may not be Trump’s tactics. But his enemies are Trump’s enemies. As long as Kelly remains in this White House, he is helping to prosecute President Trump’s culture war — a war in which the other side is seen as people who don’t love or respect America enough to see it made great again.

Kelly is a more credible messenger, as far as the Washington press corps is concerned, for the message that the actions of the American state are beyond question. That doesn’t mean he’s right.

To John Kelly, there are those who serve America, and those who will never understand what that means

Kelly is the kind of military man who really wants you to know that he doesn’t like politics or politicians. Whenever Trump says that chief of staff is the best job Kelly’s ever had, he reminds him that the best job he ever had was US Marine.

As secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, he resented queries from members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus about the actions of immigration agents; as chief of staff, he consistently appears in “inside the White House” stories expressing frustration that Congress hasn’t fixed a problem yet.

It’s understandable that Kelly wouldn’t be used to the domestic political arena — after all, the adage that “Politics stops at the water’s edge” insulates career military officers from having to deal with the level of scrutiny and criticism that their domestic counterparts can face. But it’s not just that Kelly doesn’t respect the way that politics works within Washington — the time it takes to make a congressional deal, the way that embarrassing statements can get leaked to eager reporters. He actively thinks that they have America wrong, and that they will never understand it in the way those who serve it will.

President Trump generated two days of controversy earlier in the week by saying that President Obama didn’t call the families of fallen soldiers, creating a stream of follow-up questions that ultimately led a White House official (later identified as press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders) to say that Obama had not called Kelly after the death of his son. But at Thursday’s press conference, Kelly simply waved away that whole phase of the controversy: Presidents often don’t call Gold Star families, he said, and he’d actually advised Trump not to do so. Because a call from the president didn’t matter anyway:

Typically the only phone calls the family receives are the most important phone calls they could imagine, and that is from their buddies. In my case, after my son was killed, his friends were calling us from Afghanistan telling us what a great guy he was. Those are the only phone calls that really matter.

“Buddies” aren’t just the people who knew the deceased. They’re the people who served with him. That comment is a glimpse into a world where there are only two kinds of people: those who have served or have family members who do, and those who will never understand the sacrifices of the first group.

Kelly made the division clear himself when, in taking questions, he insisted on calling on only reporters who knew Gold Star families themselves. Everyone else was assumed to be part of the problem.

Kelly champions the idea that criticizing the behavior of agents of the state is criticizing America

This isn’t just a matter of simple anti-elite, anti-“chickenhawk” sentiment. In Kelly’s eyes, those who serve America understand it and those who do not simply don’t. The latter, in fact, can’t really be trusted to preserve America’s goodness.

“We don't look down upon those who haven't served,” Kelly said at the end of the presser. “In a way we're a bit sorry because you'll never experience the wonderful joy you get in your heart when you do the kind of things our service men and women do.”

In fact, he said at another point, they “volunteer to protect our country when there's nothing in our country anymore that seems to suggest that self-service to the nation is not only appropriate but required. That's all right” (emphasis added).

So when Kelly waxed nostalgic about the days when certain things were “sacred” — women, religion, and battlefield sacrifice — he wasn’t just echoing the complaints of so many who support Donald Trump because they too feel America is no longer great. He was saying that there are Americans who have kept the flame of American greatness alive — those who serve the country for a living — and that the best thing the rest of America can do is keep a respectful distance.

Maybe it’s an understandable bit of chauvinism from a career Marine. But that doesn’t stop it from being a worrisome attitude when it becomes an unquestioning fealty to anything those people can do while in uniform. Kelly’s rhetoric can be reminiscent of Jack Nicholson’s character Col. Jessup in A Few Good Men — “I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide, and then questions the manner in which I provide it” — but Jessup was the villain.

Furthermore, to Kelly, the caste of those who serve America goes beyond members of the military to those who protect against threats “at home” — the people he was leading as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

At DHS, Kelly routinely expressed frustration with anyone who questioned the actions of DHS staff — whether they were Customs and Border Protection officers detaining people at airports under Trump’s first travel ban, or Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials detaining immigrants who were supposed to be protected from deportation under the DACA program.

In a speech at George Washington University in April, Kelly blamed this for DHS’s notoriously low morale: “When you discourage, when you disable, when you unjustly criticize and default to believing the initial reports as opposed to defaulting to believing the stories told by my professionals, what else do you expect?”

“Defaulting to believing” one side of a story is not how the press works. It’s not how political debate works. Politics is literally, on one level, asking and answering questions about the actions of agents of the state. But Kelly sees no distinction between questioning the action and questioning the person. It’s a revival of the George W. Bush-era idea that “respecting the troops” meant supporting the war, updated for a 21st-century sense that because the enemy is everywhere, America’s “front lines” are populated not just by soldiers but by law enforcement.

No matter how Kelly feels about Trump, he’s prosecuting Trump’s culture war

This is the attitude of those who have criticized, or even threatened to abandon, the NFL over the decision of some players to kneel during the national anthem as a protest for racial justice and against aggressive policing.

It’s the attitude that not only does it breach the mystical unity of the American nation to be reminded of politics, i.e., disagreements over the actions of the American state, but that it is a specific insult to the individuals who serve as agents of that state. That protesting police is the same as disrespecting the troops and the flag itself. That no matter how respectfully the protest is conducted, the fact that it is a protest is an insult: “Kneeling,” President Trump said this week, “is basically sitting.”

Trump didn’t start this culture war — the ingredients have been there ever since the Dixie Chicks were blackballed by country radio and their listeners because their lead singer criticized George W. Bush at an overseas concert. But he has ascended to the nation’s most powerful office for the purpose of waging it.

It’s obvious, at this point, that Trump sees his job as serving the people who voted for him and being mean to those who don’t. And it appears to be true that for many of his supporters, Trump’s actions as head of government matter less than his actions as head of state — i.e., the man with the most powerful microphone — and the people he’s sticking it to.

Yes, it’s ironic that so much of what Kelly appears to despise about contemporary politics and society is embodied in his own boss. But as long as Kelly remains in the White House, it does not matter.

Maybe he thinks Trump is doing the right thing by putting the right people in charge. Maybe he sees Trump as a unique danger to the Republic and thinks therefore it’s particularly important for him to serve as an adult in the room. Maybe he thinks all politicians are really this bad. Maybe he suspects that a decadent, disrespectful America has simply gotten what it deserves.

What is going on inside John Kelly’s head does not matter as long as he is willing to stand at the podium in the press room and tell members of the press that they and the political debate they engage in are not just frivolous but corrosive to the republic, and that there is a truer form of patriotism — one embodied in the agents of the state — that they should not question and whose messengers they must respect.

The press is used to deferring to the military, and to those who have lost children in war. They’re willing to let Kelly attack them in ways they wouldn’t be willing to countenance from other Trump officials. But what Kelly is saying doesn’t come from his experience as a Gold Star father. It comes from the way he sees the world — and his own agenda to make America great again.",www.vox.com,left,QHZ9DX1u9y7hSWEd
culture,The American Mind,2,https://americanmind.org/essays/preserving-the-american-way-of-life/,Preserving the American Way of Life,,"Thomas D. Klingenstein, Titus Techera, Santi Ruiz, Pedro Gonzalez","It seems to me Republicans are somewhat lost . And that may be , in part , because they are not exactly sure where they want to go . They do not think clearly enough about their purpose or mission .
My proposal for a mission is this : To “ preserve the American way of life . ”
The party ’ s platform and rhetoric should serve this mission . To “ preserve the American way of life ” is not simply a bumper sticker or a talking point ( though it might work well as both ) . It is the essential starting point for a strategy .
Strategy follows from purpose . If the purpose is poorly understood , then the strategy almost certainly will be muddled , particularly when circumstances change . A man who wants to climb to the top of a mountain often can follow a well-trodden trail , his head down , confident that the trail will take him to his destination . But what if the trail is washed away , blocked , or disguised ? Under these circumstances the climber must find an alternative route—but this requires keeping his head up and his destination in sight .
President Trump gets this . He has a mission : “ Make America Great Again. ” That ’ s his mountain top . He keeps his eye on it , and he recognizes that the new circumstances of the moment require a route which does not conform to traditional Republican norms .
Often , Republicans describe their mission as “ freedom. ” But the word “ freedom ” ( used in its everyday sense ) does not give us any guidance as to when freedom must be restricted , as it often must . Take the coronavirus pandemic . We all can agree that in this case some restrictions are justified , but what restrictions exactly ?
To answer that ( very difficult ) question we need a concept both more focused and more comprehensive than just freedom . We need a mission . If Republicans formulated their mission as preserving the American way of life , I think it might be clearer to them that minimizing deaths from the virus and the health of the economy , important as they may be , are not the only considerations .
With a clearer sense of purpose we might better appreciate that vesting control in people like Coronavirus czar Dr. Anthony Fauci—people who know a lot about a little—risks sacrificing the body for the sake of a finger .
Republicans sometimes also say their purpose is “ constitutional government ” ( or limited government ) . But this , too , is not a mission : it is a means to a mission . The Constitution does indeed provide limits and we should , of course , stay within them—but within them there exists a great deal of latitude . To frame the mission as “ limited government ” fails to provide enough guidance as to what the government should be doing at any particular time .
The mission I propose is shorthand for “ securing the conditions necessary to pursue a worthy life. ” “ A worthy life ” is what the founders meant by “ happiness ” in the Declaration of Independence . The most essential “ conditions ” are the beliefs and values that must be held by society at large in order that each American can pursue a worthy life . These beliefs and values support the American way of life ; hence the short form version of the mission : To “ preserve the American way of life . ”
Creating the conditions necessary to achieve the American way of life means giving citizens a nudge in the desired direction . Yes , nudging can , if we are not careful , come to pushing ( as libertarians fear ) . That is indeed a risk we must guard against . But there is always risk that good governance turns into abuse of power . Politics is a high-wire act . One is always in danger of leaning too far to one side or another .
What is the American way of life that Republicans should want to preserve ? It would not be difficult to reach a consensus on this question among Republicans . They want to preserve , and in some respects recover , what Americans thought was the right way of life until a generation or two ago .
We then believed that we were the shining city on the hill , marked out to show the rest of the world that people can govern themselves . We saw ourselves as one people with a single culture , which was directed by a creed ( expressed most notably in the Declaration ) , supported by the Judeo-Christian ethos , all flavored by our particular history .
True , there were sub-cultures , but we understood them as all sharing the fundamental attributes of a single culture . There were no hyphenated Americans . We insisted that immigrants be assimilated . Colorblindness was our ideal .
We believed we had done great things in the past and were capable of doing more . This success , despite numerous missteps , made us a confident people . No wonder we thought ourselves exceptional in both senses of the term : distinct and better . No wonder we wore our patriotism on our sleeve and revered our military .
We believed ourselves to be the least class-conscious , most individualist , most religious people in the world . We believed that success in life depends on one ’ s own talents and character and so we glorified the self-made man . We valued work , no matter how humble , and self-reliance . Dependency was thought to be shameful . This was all part of the “ American Dream . ”
Although we understood ourselves as individualistic , we believed that happiness ( a worthy life ) requires doing good in this world . And so volunteerism and sacrifice for the common good was highly valued and publicly honored . This meant more than voting and obeying the law : it meant serving in the military and participating in civic organizations , local government and political parties , and teaching one ’ s children what it meant to be a responsible citizen . For most people , happiness was found in family , church and community .
Many Americans still hold this understanding of the American way of life . It is this , I believe , that Republicans would like to preserve .
If Republicans today conceived of their purpose as preserving this American way of life , then I think they would more easily see that that way of life is being attacked by proponents of another way of life ( or regime ) . They would then be better equipped to repel it .
That other regime is multiculturalism . As I am using the term , multiculturalism sees society not as a community of rights-bearing individuals with a shared understanding of a national good , but as a collection of cultural identity groups , ranked in order of victimhood ( though all oppressed by white males ) , and aggregated within highly permeable national boundaries.Multiculturalism replaces American citizens with so-called “ global citizens . ”
Identity politics is the politics of multiculturalism . Political correctness is its enforcement arm . Multiculturalism involves a way of life that can not exist peacefully with the American way of life any more than could Communism or the antebellum South .
That is to say , today we find ourselves in a regime-level contest . The Claremont Institute has framed it as “ Multiculturalism versus America. ” A regime-level conflict is a struggle over what a society aims at , what its end is . Differences in ends can not be negotiated .
Antebellum America provides a good example of societies with different ends . The South believed that slavery was a good thing and so wanted to expand it ; the North , on the other hand , believed slavery was bad and so wanted to contract it . This is an example of a non-negotiable difference .
A nation can not go in opposite directions at the same time . Multiculturalism has its own end , one that can not exist peacefully with the American way of life any more than the North and South could exist peacefully together .
Multiculturalism ’ s end is a society where there are no outcome disparities among identity groups . Each group has , proportional to its size , the same income ( hence the need for socialism ) and the same power as measured by job titles ; that is , the same number of CEOs , senators , marines , fire fighters , college presidents , physicists , soccer players , etc .
Outcome parity is the multiculturalists ’ understanding of a just society . Thus , one role of government in such a society is to free us all from the sins of racism , sexism , homophobia ( and all the other ever-growing “ -isms ” and “ -phobias ” ) that stand in the way of outcome parity .
We saw multicultural justice ( so-called “ social justice ” ) in action in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings . If , as the multiculturalists believe , individual white men are largely defined by their group identification , and if that group oppresses women , then it follows logically enough that a white male , when accused by a woman , is presumed guilty .
Republicans think Democrats violated rules of due process in the Kavanaugh hearings . I think it is more accurate to say Democrats were playing by their own , multicultural rules . The hearings were not so much a contest over the application of agreed-upon rules as they were a contest over the rules themselves .
Thus , in a larger sense , the hearings presented a contest between multiculturalism and America . When two sides have a different understanding of justice , both sides eventually break the old rules ( formal and informal ) : first the side that does not believe in them breaks them , and then the other side does so in self-defense .
As the Kavanaugh hearings illustrate , multiculturalism ’ s end ( outcome parity ) can not possibly co-exist peacefully with a free society like America that is guided by nature ’ s laws . For in such a society there will always be group differences—between men and women and among various sub-cultures . Multiculturalism requires crushing these natural differences and so demands expansion of state power and countless social restrictions , including censorship ( political correctness ) .
Nature , however , is not easily crushed . As multiculturalism advances , nature ’ s resistance stiffens , requiring ever-more state power and restrictions , leading to ever-more destruction of the American way of life .
As with any regime , multiculturalism teaches its beliefs and values to its future citizens . One way it does so is through the teaching of American history . American history is not simply a description of what happened in America in the past : it is an account of who we are as a people . As such , our history is a general guide to the future .
Until a generation or two ago , American history was an account of a good people striving , however imperfectly and haltingly , toward its noble ideals . And our history—which is particular to us , shared only by Americans—bound us together and helped to make us one people . Aspects of our history changed over time as new facts came to light and new interpretations were made of old facts , but the basic storyline did not change .
Multiculturalism seeks to overthrow that history . Multiculturalists , like totalitarians everywhere , understand that changing a culture requires rewriting its history so as to bring the past into line with the desired future . This is the purpose of the 1619 Project , a major initiative of the New York Times led by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones .
The 1619 Project , writes the Times , “ aims to reframe the country ’ s history , understanding 1619 as our true founding and placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of the story we tell ourselves about who we are. ” In this version of American history , America , writes Hannah-Jones , is “ not a democracy but a slavocracy , ” and “ one of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery . ”
The Times ’ s version of American history makes slavery the cause of virtually everything the Times does not like about today ’ s America ( most particularly , capitalism ) , and blacks responsible for virtually everything that is good about America—which , according to the 1619 Project , is not much .
This multicultural version of American history teaches us that we are unworthy—not just that we have sinned ( which of course we have ) but that we are irredeemably sinful . Sin ( in this case racism ) is “ in our DNA ” as the 1619 Project puts it . This teaches shame , not patriotism . The 1619 Project promotes both a sense of victimhood among blacks ( and other “ oppressed ” identity groups ) and guilt among whites .
According to the 1619 way of thinking , we are not one people but a collection of different peoples . This teaches race consciousness , not colorblindness . The 1619 version of history is backward-looking and teaches us that our top priority should be reparations . Its major contention—that capitalism is a form of slavery—is a brief for socialism .
In a sentence , the 1619 Project teaches that America—its values , customs , and institutions—is evil .
We can not possibly defend ourselves if we think we are unworthy of defending . We shall not defeat China ( or other enemies ) unless we defeat the thinking that deprives us of the reason for preferring ourselves to our enemies . China may pose a more immediate danger . But at the end of the day , the larger danger is the debased self-understanding advanced by the 1619 Project .
Trump gets this , too . He is our antidote to the demoralizing effects of 1619 thinking . If there is one thing Trump stands for , it is pride in America . Trump exudes more confidence in America than any national figure in living memory . I do not suppose that Trump is any more patriotic than most Republicans , but he expresses his patriotism much more than they do . At every turn you hear him claiming that America is “ incredible ” —its science , its military , its businesses , its people ( and yes , himself ) .
The one thing he thinks is not incredible ( in a positive sense ) is the mainstream media , and that is because he sees the media as anti-American . So what if Trump does not always express his love of America in the language of a Cambridge don . He , towering above all other national figures on the Right , stands athwart the self-destructive sentiments of our age : the guilt and doubt bred by multiculturalism . Whatever Trump ’ s faults , his full-throated defense of America overwhelms them many times over .
Multiculturalism seeks to destroy not only our history but education more broadly , as well as the other institutions that teach the beliefs and values necessary for preserving the American way of life . The most important of these institutions is family , because it is here “ that the foundation of morality is laid ” as John Adams put it . In other words , family is the foundation of the American way of life .
For Adams , as for most Americans until rather recently , a strong family generally requires a mother and father . The mother has primary responsibility for taking care of the children , the father primary responsibility for supporting the family financially . Americans understood what our social scientists have demonstrated conclusively : children raised in such a family are likely to be more law-abiding , more public-spirited , better educated , and wealthier than children raised in other arrangements .
Our regime depends on such citizens . Without them , we can not have limited , constitutional government . In other words , it is the family ( along with other value-forming institutions ) that makes republican government possible .
The multiculturalists , on the other hand , seek to destroy the family as it traditionally has been understood . Their desire for outcome parity requires separating women from motherhood , for it is caring for children that makes it very difficult for women to compete with men in the workplace and other spheres outside the home .
This means teaching young women that gender is simply a social construct ( designed by white males to keep women in their place ) , and that only by having a career can a woman live a worthy life . To this end , it is necessary for women to place less emphasis on marriage and to have few babies , easy access to abortion , and government-sponsored childcare .
Republicans certainly understand the importance of family and education as well as the other value-forming institutions ( most notably community and religion ) . They do not , however , seem to think that defending these institutions is a terribly important part of their job description .
The 1619 Project is a case in point . It is perhaps the most significant political event of 2019 , odd as that would sound to most Republicans . Its curricula have been adopted by more than 1000 schools and multiple school districts , including Chicago . More are certain to follow .
And yet it would seem that hardly any national Republican politician has even heard of the 1619 Project . I think they would have heard about it had they thought about their mission as preserving the American way of life .
As for family , Republicans sometimes talk about its importance and they often “ market ” themselves as family men or women . But , with a few notable exceptions , they do not actually assign it much importance ; instead , Republicans focus on reducing taxes and regulations , gun rights , strong defense , and all the rest of the traditional Republican policy agenda . All this is important , but not as important as family because—to repeat myself—it is strong families that make it possible to actually implement this agenda .
This is all to say that the war against multiculturalism is not in the first instance a fight over the Constitution or the size of government or economic policies or Supreme Court decisions ( as important as it is to keep fighting these battles ) . The war is over the institutions that form our culture . This is a culture war .
Fighting this war against multiculturalism today is a responsibility which rests almost entirely on the shoulders of our politicians . There was a time when our opinion-forming institutions—academia , media , entertainment and so forth—supported the American way of life . But no longer . The Right can no longer challenge elite culture from within these institutions , because the Right has virtually no troops on the ground . It is necessary , therefore , for the Right to fight the culture war on the battlefield of politics .
Republicans should take their lead from Trump . He is our political culture warrior— “ a walking , talking rejection of multiculturalism and the post-modern ideas that support it , ” to quote myself . Every time he ignores political correctness he is standing up for America ’ s distinctive culture . After all , what is political correctness but a prohibition on defending America ’ s distinctive culture ? Trump “ has said over and over exactly what political correctness prohibits one from saying : ‘ America does not want cultural diversity ; we have our culture , it ’ s exceptional , and we want to keep it that way ’ ” ( to quote the same author ) .
And Trump comes to this fight with a knife . By contrast , many Republicans , unaccustomed as they are to wartime conditions , continue to try to “ reach across the aisle. ” In a war , however , if you are too eager to find common ground you are likely to end up on enemy ground . This seems to be a Republican proclivity .
Differences in ends , it bears repeating , can not be negotiated . Were the Republican Party to take notice of the 1619 Project , no doubt they would find it objectionable . But then they would take all the air out of their objections by acknowledging that the 1619 Project makes many true statements that we should take to heart . They would then find themselves accepting the 1619 curriculum : first in part and then , eventually , entirely .
Of course , the 1619 Project does make some true statements . What account of history does not ? But its overall message is so wrong and so destructive that the Project must be smashed to smithereens . Either you start with 1619 and make slavery the nation ’ s central idea , or you start with 1776 and make human equality the central idea . It is one or the other .
Many Republicans , particularly those of a libertarian bent , say to the multiculturalists , “ you can live the way you wish , just let us live the way we wish. ” To expect people to live one way when surrounded by people who live a very different way is an example of wishful thinking if there ever was one .
For most human beings , living in accordance with a given set of values requires living in an environment that supports those values . The multiculturalists , unlike the “ live and let live ” conservatives , understand this , which is why they insist that the rest of us conform to their values .
For example , as Scott Yenor points out , the multiculturalists understand that if they are to truly “ liberate ” women , it is not enough to allow women to put career over motherhood : women must do so . Otherwise , women will see that they have a choice . Similarly , it is not enough to allow individual schools to adopt the 1619 Project curricula : they must be required to adopt it . Of course , at first it is optional—but only because the multiculturalists understand they must move in steps .
1619 Project leader Hannah-Jones insists that no sane person may object to the Project ’ s slave-centric narrative . “ Our fact checkers went back to panels of historians and had them go through every single argument and every single fact that is in here , ” she said in an interview with PBS . “ So it ’ s really not something that you can dispute with facts . ”
Republicans should take note . They are fighting an enemy which believes that there is no disputing its facts . If Republicans practice “ live and let live , ” and the multiculturalists practice “ do it our way or else , ” Republicans will continue to lose .
If Republicans conceived of their mission as preserving the American way of life , they would pay more attention than they do to the institutions that nurture the foundations of that life—family , religion , education , and community . All else rests on those foundations . Today those foundations are giving way . Strengthening them should therefore be , I think , the top priority of the Republican party .
What policies should Republicans support ? I do not know . Determining the right policies requires expertise in various subject areas as well as the practical wisdom ( prudence ) required of a working politician . That is not my line of work . However , I do have a guiding principle : good political choices depend on having the right purpose .
Let me use family as an example . If we wish to strengthen the family then we must try to encourage marriage ( between those responsible enough to sustain its burdens ) , discourage divorce , and make it as easy as possible for mothers to care for their children and fathers to make enough money to support their family . ( Obviously , we should not mandate these things , but we should try to create conditions that encourage them . )
Thus , when considering a policy of any sort , we should first ask ourselves : what is the proposed policy ’ s effect on the family ?
Take an issue much in the news today : our manufacturing dependence on China . If our goal were primarily to protect the nation ’ s health and defense , we would focus on moving the manufacturing of health care and defense products out of China , transferring them to more friendly countries . But if our goal were to strengthen the family ( and we thought that more manufacturing jobs in America would make it easier for a man to support his family ) we might move all manufacturing back to America—and not just from China but from all countries .
This might cost us more ( labor is more expensive here than in most other places ) , but if we thought strengthening the family was very important , we might deem it worth the cost . Oren Cass and others have suggested something along these lines .
I do not mean , of course , that we should try to reclaim all manufacturing jobs today ( or even tomorrow ) . I mean only to make the simple point that policy choices should be determined by our objectives . Making family an important objective leads to different policy choices than would other objectives .
As important as it is to have the right policies , rhetoric ( in the classical sense ) is even more important . The role of a politician is not only , or even primarily , to legislate but to build public sentiment in favor of decent laws and moral habits . The need for rhetoric is particularly important at present . This is because Americans do not fully understand the nature and extent of the multicultural threat that confronts them , and because many have been intellectually disarmed by multicultural dogma .
In order to shape public sentiment , politicians must make arguments . The public does not always have well-developed arguments . Their beliefs are sometimes unformed or taken for granted . We look to politicians ( and intellectuals ) to give voice to such beliefs .
Under present circumstances , in which the multiculturalists control the opinion-forming institutions , the political arena is pretty much the only place where there is even the possibility of seeing traditional American values expressed publicly . If such values are not expressed there , then those citizens who hold such views will assume they are not widely supported . In that case , citizens are likely to sit on their hands , or worse , come to adopt what they understand to be the prevailing views .
This is what seems to have happened with gay marriage . Once politicians stopped opposing gay marriage , the public , which had been strongly opposed , began to support it . By contrast , politicians continue to speak up loudly against abortion , and so , despite adverse court decisions , abortion remains a live political issue . If politicians do not stand up for our traditional historical narrative , the family , religion , etc. , then these debates will be smothered just like the one over gay marriage .
If Republicans desire to reverse the decline in marriage , and all the rest of the multicultural agenda , they should scream bloody murder . They should declare war , identify the enemy , and give it a name . We can not fight an enemy if we do not have a name for it . Many of my knowledgeable friends tell me that “ multiculturalism ” is not the name to go to war with . I am not completely persuaded , but that is a discussion for another day . For now , not knowing a better name , I shall continue to identify the enemy as “ multiculturalism ” and its adherents “ multiculturalists . ”
Having identified the enemy , Republicans need to explain both its purpose and how it operates . The 1619 Project is one way it operates . The denigration of motherhood is another way . So is socialism ( necessary to achieve income equality ) ; transgenderism ( which , among other things , tries to liberate women from womanhood ) ; the taking down of statues of our heroes ( like the 1619 Project , part of the multiculturalists ’ effort to destroy our history ) ; open borders ( the destruction of our distinctive culture ) and on and on .
These and the other tentacles of multiculturalism need to be drawn together so we can create an overarching narrative that allows us to see the monster in its entirety .
And Republicans need to call out multiculturalism when it manifests itself , as it did both in the Kavanaugh hearings and in the midst of coronavirus pandemic , when multicultural Democrats at the highest levels claimed that it was xenophobic to prohibit from entering the country those travelers likely carrying a lethal infection .
Republicans rightly criticized the offending Democrats , but I think Republicans should have taken one more step and called attention to the multicultural monster that was lurking just below the surface . Here was a powerful way of showing how multiculturalism is going to get us all killed .
The perilous state of the family should become a central part of the national political discussion . We all have a pretty good idea what the employment rate is at any given time . It ’ s well tracked and publicized . The employment rate is , however , of less importance than the marriage rate . Every American needs to know that 40 % of births are out of wedlock , why this is significant , and what might be done to improve it .
In the case of the 1619 Project , national politicians should alert the public and exhort state and local politicians to ban 1619-like curricula from K-12 . The public must be made to understand that teaching the 1619 America-is-evil narrative is every bit as dangerous as teaching Communism . Ideas that work to undermine the regime can not be taught to our young . Multiculturalists should , of course , be free to speak , but the rest of us have a duty to ensure that what is taught to our future citizens promotes the American way of life .
President Trump could—and probably should—make education ( including The 1619 Project ) , family , and religion part of his rhetorical campaign . Whether or not one thinks he is always the poster child for these things , he can still defend them . The mainstream press will scream “ hypocrite ” to the rooftops , but Trump does not care what the press says ( God bless him ) . He knows the public is thirsting for someone who will defend the American way of life . Trump also knows the public does not require pure spring water .
Higher education is where the monster was created and continues to be fed . The 1619 Project , for example , was not just dreamed up by a bunch of New York Times reporters ; it came straight out of our colleges and universities . Whenever Republicans see multiculturalism in action , they need to call attention to its breeding ground . The anti-Americanism of our colleges and universities must be stopped .
Yes , this is an extremely tough nut to crack . But perhaps if we were more committed to preserving the American way of life , we would work harder at it . The founders bequeathed us a Constitution that is flexible enough to deal with any existential threat .
Republicans must not make just any arguments against multiculturalism : they must make the right arguments . The right arguments are arguments from justice .
Unlike the rules of baseball , laws must be justified . Baseball rules just are . They are arbitrary ; they have no moral content ( even if they have taken on a certain sacredness ) . But politics is not baseball . Politics is about justice .
Republicans , however , tend to steer clear of arguments from justice , relying instead on various forms of economic arguments or , in the case of the Constitution , textualist arguments . ( Again , abortion is a notable exception . )
Take gay marriage . Democrats said that if a man and a woman are able to marry then it is only just that two men or two women should be able to do so . Republicans responded not by arguing that gay marriage was unjust , but that it ran counter to tradition or religion or social science research . These , however , are not arguments from justice .
Republicans said requiring gay marriage was unconstitutional . I believe it is , and I also believe that the Constitution is just . But why it is just needs to be explained—not only in the idiom of lawyers ( e.g. , precedents , 5-part tests , and so forth ) but in the everyday language of right and wrong , which we non-lawyers can comprehend . We can comprehend it because justice is common sense .
Or take immigration restrictions . Democrats say they are unjust ( selfish or racist ) , a judgment which is based on the multiculturalist worldview that does away with nation states , thereby eliminating the distinction between Americans and foreigners . Republicans usually respond by arguing that immigrants take jobs from Americans . That is a good and necessary argument , but it does not meet the multiculturalists ’ claim that existing citizens do not deserve preference over foreigners .
The proper argument for discriminating among immigrants—the argument from justice—rests on the justification for having a single culture . We once took the need for a single culture for granted , but ( as is often the case with things taken for granted ) , we have lost a firm grasp of the reasons why . Multiculturalism , with all its talk of “ diversity being our greatest strength , ” has knocked us off balance .
In order that all citizens be able to pursue a worthy life ( happiness ) , it is necessary that most citizens share a similar understanding of what constitutes a worthy life . That is , citizens must share basic values and beliefs . Such citizens can be friends .
The closer the friendship among the citizens the easier it is for all citizens to pursue happiness ( a just end ) . This is because friends themselves contribute to happiness , and because friends are more trustworthy than non-friends : friends are more inclined to sacrifice for each other , and a community of friends requires fewer social and political restraints than a community of non-friends .
This is all to say : having a single culture is just because it is a necessary condition for achieving a just end . Arguments from justice , like this one , must proceed from the ( just ) end of society .
The multiculturalists , unlike Republicans , understand the importance of making arguments from justice . This often makes it appear they have the high moral ground . They have ( social ) justice ; Republicans have “ it costs less , ” “ reduce the size of government , ” or “ states ’ rights. ” Republicans will not win that fight .
Justice arguments must be met with other , better justice arguments . He who does not argue from justice is not even in the ring . Republicans can scream until they are blue in the face about the need to follow the Constitution , but the multiculturalists will never comply because they reject the values the Constitution is designed to protect .
The multiculturalists will continue to justify interpreting the Constitution to make it conform to multicultural values . Republicans must make better arguments about the just ends the Constitution is intended to serve . Lincoln had a similar challenge : to explain the just end for which the North was fighting .
Perhaps Republicans ’ aversion to justice arguments explains how the multiculturalists have been able to convince many people of absurdities : to wit , that it is racist to object to organizing society by race ; or that what actually destroys societies ( racial and ethnic diversity ) is what strengthens them ; or that American society is built on oppressive social constructs such as traditional marriage , when multicultural constructs are tyrannical ( as they must be since they run against nature ’ s currents ) . They have made these “ arguments ” stick because we have allowed them to shut us up .
Imagine a politician saying : the 1619 Project or “ Black Lives Matter ” are racist ; traditional marriage is far better than alternative arrangements ; there are no hyphenated Americans ; or America is a Christian country . Only a generation or so ago these would have been unremarkable claims of cultural distinctiveness ; today they are considered seditious , with offenders put on the rack .
If we can not speak about who are we , we will not know who we are . If so , we shall not long endure . If we can not ask , for example , whether Islam is consistent with liberal democracy , we may well follow the suicidal path of many of our European friends . Thus , to preserve the American way of life we must confront political correctness .
“ Political correctness is the problem of our time. ” Those are Trump ’ s words . It is this insight , along with his willingness to put his mouth where his money is , that has made Trump such a godsend . He is our “ fire bell in the night. ” Will our leading politicians heed his warning ?
Many Republicans see that Trump gets mileage out of kicking political correctness in the mid-section ; still , they seem unwilling to follow suit or even defend Trump when he is politically incorrect . When Trump ( most indecorously ) called Haiti a “ shithole , ” not a single Republican senator , many of whom undoubtedly agreed with Trump , tried to explain what Trump was getting at : that there are some people who can not live , or do not wish to live , in accordance with the American way of life . ( Whether Haitians are the right example is beside the point . )
In failing to support Trump , Republicans missed an opportunity to explain who we are as a people . Who are we ? That is the most important question of our time .
At one level Republicans are very much aware of political correctness . They are exquisitely sensitive to its commands . And yet they do not publicly identify political correctness as a problem , let alone the problem . I hear no Republican campaigning against political correctness . ( One partial exception might be those who are trying to fight censorship by Big Tech . )
I suspect that if Republicans believed the survival of the American way of life depended on speaking up , they would make combatting political correctness a high priority . They must . They must start speaking out in defense of the American way of life . Trump has shown them that it can be done .
Again , Republicans must say plainly , without the usual LGBT/feminist-appeasing qualifications , that : traditional marriage is the best way to raise children ; some lifestyles are better than others ; and America-is-evil curricula are racist and undermine the American way of life .
They must insist that we are one culture , that there are no hyphenated Americans , that we have no duty to invite anyone into this country , and that no one has a right to come here . ( These statements do not constitute an immigration policy but rather the premises for a sound one . )
They must explain that the problem with the administrative state is not so much that it is wasteful and inefficient ( though it is ) or that bureaucrats make wrong choices ( they do ) , but that bureaucrats are making our choices . Living a worthy life requires that citizens , to the extent possible , make their own choices .
During the coronavirus pandemic there has been much talk about making the right choices , but not nearly enough talk about the importance of citizens making their own choices . Our experience with the coronavirus “ experts ” shows us vividly what a profound and immediate threat the administrative state is to the American way of life .
Republicans must explain that “ diversity is our greatest strength , ” which is multiculturalism boiled down to an aphorism , is exactly backwards . America ’ s greatest strength is having transcended race , and the one major exception , slavery , was very nearly our undoing .
And perhaps most importantly , Republicans must , like Trump , remind the public that America is “ incredible. ” That America is the greatest country the world has ever seen . As Norman Podhoretz is fond of pointing out , America has brought more freedom and more prosperity to more people than any nation in the history the world . Citizens need to hear this—loudly and often .
If , because of political correctness , Republicans can not say some of these things today , then they need to figure out how to get to a place where they can say them .
More broadly , Republicans need to articulate a compelling vision of an American way of life that competes with the multicultural way of life .
The good news is that this vision is likely to be well received by the American public , including many Democrats . The divide in this country is not between Republicans and Democrats but between multiculturalists and Americans .
By and large , Americans reject multiculturalism—political correctness , the America-is-evil narrative , taking down statues , transgenderism , diversity requirements , open borders , drag queen library hour , and many of the other tentacles of multiculturalism . The public opposes these things by huge margins .
And I can not believe that even most Democrats think it was xenophobic for Trump to keep out the Chinese during the coronavirus pandemic . Nor do I believe that American people have much use for the anti-American “ liberal arts ” that are taught by our best colleges and universities .
As Christopher Flannery advised , Republicans ought to make the next presidential election a choice between multiculturalism and America . Although the divide in this country turns on multiculturalism , our politics are still fought along party lines . Thus , Republicans must be clear that the Democratic Party , despite the better judgment and inclinations of many of its voters , is being taken over by the multiculturalists .
A vote for a Democrat at any level must be seen as a vote for the multicultural project to destroy America . As Flannery wrote , “ If Democrats want to repudiate the multicultural agenda , God bless them…but Republicans must compel them to do that or to get unelected . ”
After Trump , Republicans will not get far without a national leader , one who has Trump ’ s courage and conviction and who understands what Trump has tapped into ( a rejection of multiculturalism ) and where he is pointing ( the preservation of the American way of life ) . But that leader must go further than Trump . Trump began the fight . Now we need someone to carry it on , which requires explaining what the fight is all about .
One often hears it said , usually by multiculturalists , that the Republican party is dying because old white males are dying out . Republicans , however , can not let themselves be positioned by the multiculturalists as the party of white males . Republicans must be the party of the middle class and of common-sense Americans , of all races and ethnicities , the party of color blind , hard-working , self-reliant , public-spirited , religious , patriotic , self-sacrificing Americans . There are many , many Democrats who belong in that group .
Making multiculturalism the enemy provides a big opportunity for Republicans . Opposing multiculturalism , like slavery and Communism before it , has the potential to energize the Republican party and the conservative movement . Conservatives , who are in the business of conserving things , come to life when there is something important to conserve . This allows them to stake out a very distinctive and morally powerful position with enough room to accommodate a broad coalition .
In this case , that really important “ something ” is the American way of life .","It seems to me Republicans are somewhat lost. And that may be, in part, because they are not exactly sure where they want to go. They do not think clearly enough about their purpose or mission.

My proposal for a mission is this: To “preserve the American way of life.”

The party’s platform and rhetoric should serve this mission. To “preserve the American way of life” is not simply a bumper sticker or a talking point (though it might work well as both). It is the essential starting point for a strategy.

Strategy follows from purpose. If the purpose is poorly understood, then the strategy almost certainly will be muddled, particularly when circumstances change. A man who wants to climb to the top of a mountain often can follow a well-trodden trail, his head down, confident that the trail will take him to his destination. But what if the trail is washed away, blocked, or disguised? Under these circumstances the climber must find an alternative route—but this requires keeping his head up and his destination in sight.

President Trump gets this. He has a mission: “Make America Great Again.” That’s his mountain top. He keeps his eye on it, and he recognizes that the new circumstances of the moment require a route which does not conform to traditional Republican norms.

“Freedom” and “Limited Government” Are Not Enough

Often, Republicans describe their mission as “freedom.” But the word “freedom” (used in its everyday sense) does not give us any guidance as to when freedom must be restricted, as it often must. Take the coronavirus pandemic. We all can agree that in this case some restrictions are justified, but what restrictions exactly?

To answer that (very difficult) question we need a concept both more focused and more comprehensive than just freedom. We need a mission. If Republicans formulated their mission as preserving the American way of life, I think it might be clearer to them that minimizing deaths from the virus and the health of the economy, important as they may be, are not the only considerations.

With a clearer sense of purpose we might better appreciate that vesting control in people like Coronavirus czar Dr. Anthony Fauci—people who know a lot about a little—risks sacrificing the body for the sake of a finger.

Republicans sometimes also say their purpose is “constitutional government” (or limited government). But this, too, is not a mission: it is a means to a mission. The Constitution does indeed provide limits and we should, of course, stay within them—but within them there exists a great deal of latitude. To frame the mission as “limited government” fails to provide enough guidance as to what the government should be doing at any particular time.

The mission I propose is shorthand for “securing the conditions necessary to pursue a worthy life.” “A worthy life” is what the founders meant by “happiness” in the Declaration of Independence. The most essential “conditions” are the beliefs and values that must be held by society at large in order that each American can pursue a worthy life. These beliefs and values support the American way of life; hence the short form version of the mission: To “preserve the American way of life.”

Creating the conditions necessary to achieve the American way of life means giving citizens a nudge in the desired direction. Yes, nudging can, if we are not careful, come to pushing (as libertarians fear). That is indeed a risk we must guard against. But there is always risk that good governance turns into abuse of power. Politics is a high-wire act. One is always in danger of leaning too far to one side or another.

What is the American way of life that Republicans should want to preserve? It would not be difficult to reach a consensus on this question among Republicans. They want to preserve, and in some respects recover, what Americans thought was the right way of life until a generation or two ago.

We then believed that we were the shining city on the hill, marked out to show the rest of the world that people can govern themselves. We saw ourselves as one people with a single culture, which was directed by a creed (expressed most notably in the Declaration), supported by the Judeo-Christian ethos, all flavored by our particular history.

True, there were sub-cultures, but we understood them as all sharing the fundamental attributes of a single culture. There were no hyphenated Americans. We insisted that immigrants be assimilated. Colorblindness was our ideal.

We believed we had done great things in the past and were capable of doing more. This success, despite numerous missteps, made us a confident people. No wonder we thought ourselves exceptional in both senses of the term: distinct and better. No wonder we wore our patriotism on our sleeve and revered our military.

We believed ourselves to be the least class-conscious, most individualist, most religious people in the world. We believed that success in life depends on one’s own talents and character and so we glorified the self-made man. We valued work, no matter how humble, and self-reliance. Dependency was thought to be shameful. This was all part of the “American Dream.”

Although we understood ourselves as individualistic, we believed that happiness (a worthy life) requires doing good in this world. And so volunteerism and sacrifice for the common good was highly valued and publicly honored. This meant more than voting and obeying the law: it meant serving in the military and participating in civic organizations, local government and political parties, and teaching one’s children what it meant to be a responsible citizen. For most people, happiness was found in family, church and community.

Many Americans still hold this understanding of the American way of life. It is this, I believe, that Republicans would like to preserve.

Multiculturalism Versus the American Way of Life

If Republicans today conceived of their purpose as preserving this American way of life, then I think they would more easily see that that way of life is being attacked by proponents of another way of life (or regime). They would then be better equipped to repel it.

That other regime is multiculturalism. As I am using the term, multiculturalism sees society not as a community of rights-bearing individuals with a shared understanding of a national good, but as a collection of cultural identity groups, ranked in order of victimhood (though all oppressed by white males), and aggregated within highly permeable national boundaries.Multiculturalism replaces American citizens with so-called “global citizens.”

Identity politics is the politics of multiculturalism. Political correctness is its enforcement arm. Multiculturalism involves a way of life that cannot exist peacefully with the American way of life any more than could Communism or the antebellum South.

That is to say, today we find ourselves in a regime-level contest. The Claremont Institute has framed it as “Multiculturalism versus America.” A regime-level conflict is a struggle over what a society aims at, what its end is. Differences in ends cannot be negotiated.

Antebellum America provides a good example of societies with different ends. The South believed that slavery was a good thing and so wanted to expand it; the North, on the other hand, believed slavery was bad and so wanted to contract it. This is an example of a non-negotiable difference.

A nation cannot go in opposite directions at the same time. Multiculturalism has its own end, one that cannot exist peacefully with the American way of life any more than the North and South could exist peacefully together.

Multiculturalism’s end is a society where there are no outcome disparities among identity groups. Each group has, proportional to its size, the same income (hence the need for socialism) and the same power as measured by job titles; that is, the same number of CEOs, senators, marines, fire fighters, college presidents, physicists, soccer players, etc.

Outcome parity is the multiculturalists’ understanding of a just society. Thus, one role of government in such a society is to free us all from the sins of racism, sexism, homophobia (and all the other ever-growing “-isms” and “-phobias”) that stand in the way of outcome parity.

We saw multicultural justice (so-called “social justice”) in action in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. If, as the multiculturalists believe, individual white men are largely defined by their group identification, and if that group oppresses women, then it follows logically enough that a white male, when accused by a woman, is presumed guilty.

Republicans think Democrats violated rules of due process in the Kavanaugh hearings. I think it is more accurate to say Democrats were playing by their own, multicultural rules. The hearings were not so much a contest over the application of agreed-upon rules as they were a contest over the rules themselves.

Thus, in a larger sense, the hearings presented a contest between multiculturalism and America. When two sides have a different understanding of justice, both sides eventually break the old rules (formal and informal): first the side that does not believe in them breaks them, and then the other side does so in self-defense.

As the Kavanaugh hearings illustrate, multiculturalism’s end (outcome parity) cannot possibly co-exist peacefully with a free society like America that is guided by nature’s laws. For in such a society there will always be group differences—between men and women and among various sub-cultures. Multiculturalism requires crushing these natural differences and so demands expansion of state power and countless social restrictions, including censorship (political correctness).

Nature, however, is not easily crushed. As multiculturalism advances, nature’s resistance stiffens, requiring ever-more state power and restrictions, leading to ever-more destruction of the American way of life.

Education: 1619 v. 1776

As with any regime, multiculturalism teaches its beliefs and values to its future citizens. One way it does so is through the teaching of American history. American history is not simply a description of what happened in America in the past: it is an account of who we are as a people. As such, our history is a general guide to the future.

Until a generation or two ago, American history was an account of a good people striving, however imperfectly and haltingly, toward its noble ideals. And our history—which is particular to us, shared only by Americans—bound us together and helped to make us one people. Aspects of our history changed over time as new facts came to light and new interpretations were made of old facts, but the basic storyline did not change.

Multiculturalism seeks to overthrow that history. Multiculturalists, like totalitarians everywhere, understand that changing a culture requires rewriting its history so as to bring the past into line with the desired future. This is the purpose of the 1619 Project, a major initiative of the New York Times led by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones.

The 1619 Project, writes the Times, “aims to reframe the country’s history, understanding 1619 as our true founding and placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of the story we tell ourselves about who we are.” In this version of American history, America, writes Hannah-Jones, is “not a democracy but a slavocracy,” and “one of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery.”

The Times’s version of American history makes slavery the cause of virtually everything the Times does not like about today’s America (most particularly, capitalism), and blacks responsible for virtually everything that is good about America—which, according to the 1619 Project, is not much.

This multicultural version of American history teaches us that we are unworthy—not just that we have sinned (which of course we have) but that we are irredeemably sinful. Sin (in this case racism) is “in our DNA” as the 1619 Project puts it. This teaches shame, not patriotism. The 1619 Project promotes both a sense of victimhood among blacks (and other “oppressed” identity groups) and guilt among whites.

According to the 1619 way of thinking, we are not one people but a collection of different peoples. This teaches race consciousness, not colorblindness. The 1619 version of history is backward-looking and teaches us that our top priority should be reparations. Its major contention—that capitalism is a form of slavery—is a brief for socialism.

In a sentence, the 1619 Project teaches that America—its values, customs, and institutions—is evil.

We cannot possibly defend ourselves if we think we are unworthy of defending. We shall not defeat China (or other enemies) unless we defeat the thinking that deprives us of the reason for preferring ourselves to our enemies. China may pose a more immediate danger. But at the end of the day, the larger danger is the debased self-understanding advanced by the 1619 Project.

Trump gets this, too. He is our antidote to the demoralizing effects of 1619 thinking. If there is one thing Trump stands for, it is pride in America. Trump exudes more confidence in America than any national figure in living memory. I do not suppose that Trump is any more patriotic than most Republicans, but he expresses his patriotism much more than they do. At every turn you hear him claiming that America is “incredible”—its science, its military, its businesses, its people (and yes, himself).

The one thing he thinks is not incredible (in a positive sense) is the mainstream media, and that is because he sees the media as anti-American. So what if Trump does not always express his love of America in the language of a Cambridge don. He, towering above all other national figures on the Right, stands athwart the self-destructive sentiments of our age: the guilt and doubt bred by multiculturalism. Whatever Trump’s faults, his full-throated defense of America overwhelms them many times over.

Family

Multiculturalism seeks to destroy not only our history but education more broadly, as well as the other institutions that teach the beliefs and values necessary for preserving the American way of life. The most important of these institutions is family, because it is here “that the foundation of morality is laid” as John Adams put it. In other words, family is the foundation of the American way of life.

For Adams, as for most Americans until rather recently, a strong family generally requires a mother and father. The mother has primary responsibility for taking care of the children, the father primary responsibility for supporting the family financially. Americans understood what our social scientists have demonstrated conclusively: children raised in such a family are likely to be more law-abiding, more public-spirited, better educated, and wealthier than children raised in other arrangements.

Our regime depends on such citizens. Without them, we cannot have limited, constitutional government. In other words, it is the family (along with other value-forming institutions) that makes republican government possible.

The multiculturalists, on the other hand, seek to destroy the family as it traditionally has been understood. Their desire for outcome parity requires separating women from motherhood, for it is caring for children that makes it very difficult for women to compete with men in the workplace and other spheres outside the home.

This means teaching young women that gender is simply a social construct (designed by white males to keep women in their place), and that only by having a career can a woman live a worthy life. To this end, it is necessary for women to place less emphasis on marriage and to have few babies, easy access to abortion, and government-sponsored childcare.

Republicans Are Not Sure What Their Job Is

Republicans certainly understand the importance of family and education as well as the other value-forming institutions (most notably community and religion). They do not, however, seem to think that defending these institutions is a terribly important part of their job description.

The 1619 Project is a case in point. It is perhaps the most significant political event of 2019, odd as that would sound to most Republicans. Its curricula have been adopted by more than 1000 schools and multiple school districts, including Chicago. More are certain to follow.

And yet it would seem that hardly any national Republican politician has even heard of the 1619 Project. I think they would have heard about it had they thought about their mission as preserving the American way of life.

As for family, Republicans sometimes talk about its importance and they often “market” themselves as family men or women. But, with a few notable exceptions, they do not actually assign it much importance; instead, Republicans focus on reducing taxes and regulations, gun rights, strong defense, and all the rest of the traditional Republican policy agenda. All this is important, but not as important as family because—to repeat myself—it is strong families that make it possible to actually implement this agenda.

This is all to say that the war against multiculturalism is not in the first instance a fight over the Constitution or the size of government or economic policies or Supreme Court decisions (as important as it is to keep fighting these battles). The war is over the institutions that form our culture. This is a culture war.

Fighting this war against multiculturalism today is a responsibility which rests almost entirely on the shoulders of our politicians. There was a time when our opinion-forming institutions—academia, media, entertainment and so forth—supported the American way of life. But no longer. The Right can no longer challenge elite culture from within these institutions, because the Right has virtually no troops on the ground. It is necessary, therefore, for the Right to fight the culture war on the battlefield of politics.

Republicans should take their lead from Trump. He is our political culture warrior—“a walking, talking rejection of multiculturalism and the post-modern ideas that support it,” to quote myself. Every time he ignores political correctness he is standing up for America’s distinctive culture. After all, what is political correctness but a prohibition on defending America’s distinctive culture? Trump “has said over and over exactly what political correctness prohibits one from saying: ‘America does not want cultural diversity; we have our culture, it’s exceptional, and we want to keep it that way’” (to quote the same author).

And Trump comes to this fight with a knife. By contrast, many Republicans, unaccustomed as they are to wartime conditions, continue to try to “reach across the aisle.” In a war, however, if you are too eager to find common ground you are likely to end up on enemy ground. This seems to be a Republican proclivity.

Differences in ends, it bears repeating, cannot be negotiated. Were the Republican Party to take notice of the 1619 Project, no doubt they would find it objectionable. But then they would take all the air out of their objections by acknowledging that the 1619 Project makes many true statements that we should take to heart. They would then find themselves accepting the 1619 curriculum: first in part and then, eventually, entirely.

Of course, the 1619 Project does make some true statements. What account of history does not? But its overall message is so wrong and so destructive that the Project must be smashed to smithereens. Either you start with 1619 and make slavery the nation’s central idea, or you start with 1776 and make human equality the central idea. It is one or the other.

Many Republicans, particularly those of a libertarian bent, say to the multiculturalists, “you can live the way you wish, just let us live the way we wish.” To expect people to live one way when surrounded by people who live a very different way is an example of wishful thinking if there ever was one.

For most human beings, living in accordance with a given set of values requires living in an environment that supports those values. The multiculturalists, unlike the “live and let live” conservatives, understand this, which is why they insist that the rest of us conform to their values.

For example, as Scott Yenor points out, the multiculturalists understand that if they are to truly “liberate” women, it is not enough to allow women to put career over motherhood: women must do so. Otherwise, women will see that they have a choice. Similarly, it is not enough to allow individual schools to adopt the 1619 Project curricula: they must be required to adopt it. Of course, at first it is optional—but only because the multiculturalists understand they must move in steps.

1619 Project leader Hannah-Jones insists that no sane person may object to the Project’s slave-centric narrative. “Our fact checkers went back to panels of historians and had them go through every single argument and every single fact that is in here,” she said in an interview with PBS. “So it’s really not something that you can dispute with facts.”

Republicans should take note. They are fighting an enemy which believes that there is no disputing its facts. If Republicans practice “live and let live,” and the multiculturalists practice “do it our way or else,” Republicans will continue to lose.

What Should Republicans Do?

If Republicans conceived of their mission as preserving the American way of life, they would pay more attention than they do to the institutions that nurture the foundations of that life—family, religion, education, and community. All else rests on those foundations. Today those foundations are giving way. Strengthening them should therefore be, I think, the top priority of the Republican party.

What policies should Republicans support? I do not know. Determining the right policies requires expertise in various subject areas as well as the practical wisdom (prudence) required of a working politician. That is not my line of work. However, I do have a guiding principle: good political choices depend on having the right purpose.

Let me use family as an example. If we wish to strengthen the family then we must try to encourage marriage (between those responsible enough to sustain its burdens), discourage divorce, and make it as easy as possible for mothers to care for their children and fathers to make enough money to support their family. (Obviously, we should not mandate these things, but we should try to create conditions that encourage them.)

Thus, when considering a policy of any sort, we should first ask ourselves: what is the proposed policy’s effect on the family?

Take an issue much in the news today: our manufacturing dependence on China. If our goal were primarily to protect the nation’s health and defense, we would focus on moving the manufacturing of health care and defense products out of China, transferring them to more friendly countries. But if our goal were to strengthen the family (and we thought that more manufacturing jobs in America would make it easier for a man to support his family) we might move all manufacturing back to America—and not just from China but from all countries.

This might cost us more (labor is more expensive here than in most other places), but if we thought strengthening the family was very important, we might deem it worth the cost. Oren Cass and others have suggested something along these lines.

I do not mean, of course, that we should try to reclaim all manufacturing jobs today (or even tomorrow). I mean only to make the simple point that policy choices should be determined by our objectives. Making family an important objective leads to different policy choices than would other objectives.

Rhetoric

As important as it is to have the right policies, rhetoric (in the classical sense) is even more important. The role of a politician is not only, or even primarily, to legislate but to build public sentiment in favor of decent laws and moral habits. The need for rhetoric is particularly important at present. This is because Americans do not fully understand the nature and extent of the multicultural threat that confronts them, and because many have been intellectually disarmed by multicultural dogma.

In order to shape public sentiment, politicians must make arguments. The public does not always have well-developed arguments. Their beliefs are sometimes unformed or taken for granted. We look to politicians (and intellectuals) to give voice to such beliefs.

Under present circumstances, in which the multiculturalists control the opinion-forming institutions, the political arena is pretty much the only place where there is even the possibility of seeing traditional American values expressed publicly. If such values are not expressed there, then those citizens who hold such views will assume they are not widely supported. In that case, citizens are likely to sit on their hands, or worse, come to adopt what they understand to be the prevailing views.

This is what seems to have happened with gay marriage. Once politicians stopped opposing gay marriage, the public, which had been strongly opposed, began to support it. By contrast, politicians continue to speak up loudly against abortion, and so, despite adverse court decisions, abortion remains a live political issue. If politicians do not stand up for our traditional historical narrative, the family, religion, etc., then these debates will be smothered just like the one over gay marriage.

If Republicans desire to reverse the decline in marriage, and all the rest of the multicultural agenda, they should scream bloody murder. They should declare war, identify the enemy, and give it a name. We cannot fight an enemy if we do not have a name for it. Many of my knowledgeable friends tell me that “multiculturalism” is not the name to go to war with. I am not completely persuaded, but that is a discussion for another day. For now, not knowing a better name, I shall continue to identify the enemy as “multiculturalism” and its adherents “multiculturalists.”

Having identified the enemy, Republicans need to explain both its purpose and how it operates. The 1619 Project is one way it operates. The denigration of motherhood is another way. So is socialism (necessary to achieve income equality); transgenderism (which, among other things, tries to liberate women from womanhood); the taking down of statues of our heroes (like the 1619 Project, part of the multiculturalists’ effort to destroy our history); open borders (the destruction of our distinctive culture) and on and on.

These and the other tentacles of multiculturalism need to be drawn together so we can create an overarching narrative that allows us to see the monster in its entirety.

And Republicans need to call out multiculturalism when it manifests itself, as it did both in the Kavanaugh hearings and in the midst of coronavirus pandemic, when multicultural Democrats at the highest levels claimed that it was xenophobic to prohibit from entering the country those travelers likely carrying a lethal infection.

Republicans rightly criticized the offending Democrats, but I think Republicans should have taken one more step and called attention to the multicultural monster that was lurking just below the surface. Here was a powerful way of showing how multiculturalism is going to get us all killed.

The perilous state of the family should become a central part of the national political discussion. We all have a pretty good idea what the employment rate is at any given time. It’s well tracked and publicized. The employment rate is, however, of less importance than the marriage rate. Every American needs to know that 40% of births are out of wedlock, why this is significant, and what might be done to improve it.

In the case of the 1619 Project, national politicians should alert the public and exhort state and local politicians to ban 1619-like curricula from K-12. The public must be made to understand that teaching the 1619 America-is-evil narrative is every bit as dangerous as teaching Communism. Ideas that work to undermine the regime cannot be taught to our young. Multiculturalists should, of course, be free to speak, but the rest of us have a duty to ensure that what is taught to our future citizens promotes the American way of life.

President Trump could—and probably should—make education (including The 1619 Project), family, and religion part of his rhetorical campaign. Whether or not one thinks he is always the poster child for these things, he can still defend them. The mainstream press will scream “hypocrite” to the rooftops, but Trump does not care what the press says (God bless him). He knows the public is thirsting for someone who will defend the American way of life. Trump also knows the public does not require pure spring water.

Higher education is where the monster was created and continues to be fed. The 1619 Project, for example, was not just dreamed up by a bunch of New York Times reporters; it came straight out of our colleges and universities. Whenever Republicans see multiculturalism in action, they need to call attention to its breeding ground. The anti-Americanism of our colleges and universities must be stopped.

Yes, this is an extremely tough nut to crack. But perhaps if we were more committed to preserving the American way of life, we would work harder at it. The founders bequeathed us a Constitution that is flexible enough to deal with any existential threat.

Arguments from Justice

Republicans must not make just any arguments against multiculturalism: they must make the right arguments. The right arguments are arguments from justice.

Unlike the rules of baseball, laws must be justified. Baseball rules just are. They are arbitrary; they have no moral content (even if they have taken on a certain sacredness). But politics is not baseball. Politics is about justice.

Republicans, however, tend to steer clear of arguments from justice, relying instead on various forms of economic arguments or, in the case of the Constitution, textualist arguments. (Again, abortion is a notable exception.)

Take gay marriage. Democrats said that if a man and a woman are able to marry then it is only just that two men or two women should be able to do so. Republicans responded not by arguing that gay marriage was unjust, but that it ran counter to tradition or religion or social science research. These, however, are not arguments from justice.

Republicans said requiring gay marriage was unconstitutional. I believe it is, and I also believe that the Constitution is just. But why it is just needs to be explained—not only in the idiom of lawyers (e.g., precedents, 5-part tests, and so forth) but in the everyday language of right and wrong, which we non-lawyers can comprehend. We can comprehend it because justice is common sense.

Or take immigration restrictions. Democrats say they are unjust (selfish or racist), a judgment which is based on the multiculturalist worldview that does away with nation states, thereby eliminating the distinction between Americans and foreigners. Republicans usually respond by arguing that immigrants take jobs from Americans. That is a good and necessary argument, but it does not meet the multiculturalists’ claim that existing citizens do not deserve preference over foreigners.

The proper argument for discriminating among immigrants—the argument from justice—rests on the justification for having a single culture. We once took the need for a single culture for granted, but (as is often the case with things taken for granted), we have lost a firm grasp of the reasons why. Multiculturalism, with all its talk of “diversity being our greatest strength,” has knocked us off balance.

In order that all citizens be able to pursue a worthy life (happiness), it is necessary that most citizens share a similar understanding of what constitutes a worthy life. That is, citizens must share basic values and beliefs. Such citizens can be friends.

The closer the friendship among the citizens the easier it is for all citizens to pursue happiness (a just end). This is because friends themselves contribute to happiness, and because friends are more trustworthy than non-friends: friends are more inclined to sacrifice for each other, and a community of friends requires fewer social and political restraints than a community of non-friends.

This is all to say: having a single culture is just because it is a necessary condition for achieving a just end. Arguments from justice, like this one, must proceed from the (just) end of society.

The multiculturalists, unlike Republicans, understand the importance of making arguments from justice. This often makes it appear they have the high moral ground. They have (social) justice; Republicans have “it costs less,” “reduce the size of government,” or “states’ rights.” Republicans will not win that fight.

Justice arguments must be met with other, better justice arguments. He who does not argue from justice is not even in the ring. Republicans can scream until they are blue in the face about the need to follow the Constitution, but the multiculturalists will never comply because they reject the values the Constitution is designed to protect.

The multiculturalists will continue to justify interpreting the Constitution to make it conform to multicultural values. Republicans must make better arguments about the just ends the Constitution is intended to serve. Lincoln had a similar challenge: to explain the just end for which the North was fighting.

Perhaps Republicans’ aversion to justice arguments explains how the multiculturalists have been able to convince many people of absurdities: to wit, that it is racist to object to organizing society by race; or that what actually destroys societies (racial and ethnic diversity) is what strengthens them; or that American society is built on oppressive social constructs such as traditional marriage, when multicultural constructs are tyrannical (as they must be since they run against nature’s currents). They have made these “arguments” stick because we have allowed them to shut us up.

Political Correctness

Imagine a politician saying: the 1619 Project or “Black Lives Matter” are racist; traditional marriage is far better than alternative arrangements; there are no hyphenated Americans; or America is a Christian country. Only a generation or so ago these would have been unremarkable claims of cultural distinctiveness; today they are considered seditious, with offenders put on the rack.

If we cannot speak about who are we, we will not know who we are. If so, we shall not long endure. If we cannot ask, for example, whether Islam is consistent with liberal democracy, we may well follow the suicidal path of many of our European friends. Thus, to preserve the American way of life we must confront political correctness.

“Political correctness is the problem of our time.” Those are Trump’s words. It is this insight, along with his willingness to put his mouth where his money is, that has made Trump such a godsend. He is our “fire bell in the night.” Will our leading politicians heed his warning?

So far I am not encouraged.

Many Republicans see that Trump gets mileage out of kicking political correctness in the mid-section; still, they seem unwilling to follow suit or even defend Trump when he is politically incorrect. When Trump (most indecorously) called Haiti a “shithole,” not a single Republican senator, many of whom undoubtedly agreed with Trump, tried to explain what Trump was getting at: that there are some people who cannot live, or do not wish to live, in accordance with the American way of life. (Whether Haitians are the right example is beside the point.)

In failing to support Trump, Republicans missed an opportunity to explain who we are as a people. Who are we? That is the most important question of our time.

At one level Republicans are very much aware of political correctness. They are exquisitely sensitive to its commands. And yet they do not publicly identify political correctness as a problem, let alone the problem. I hear no Republican campaigning against political correctness. (One partial exception might be those who are trying to fight censorship by Big Tech.)

The Path Forward

I suspect that if Republicans believed the survival of the American way of life depended on speaking up, they would make combatting political correctness a high priority. They must. They must start speaking out in defense of the American way of life. Trump has shown them that it can be done.

Again, Republicans must say plainly, without the usual LGBT/feminist-appeasing qualifications, that: traditional marriage is the best way to raise children; some lifestyles are better than others; and America-is-evil curricula are racist and undermine the American way of life.

They must insist that we are one culture, that there are no hyphenated Americans, that we have no duty to invite anyone into this country, and that no one has a right to come here. (These statements do not constitute an immigration policy but rather the premises for a sound one.)

They must explain that the problem with the administrative state is not so much that it is wasteful and inefficient (though it is) or that bureaucrats make wrong choices (they do), but that bureaucrats are making our choices. Living a worthy life requires that citizens, to the extent possible, make their own choices.

During the coronavirus pandemic there has been much talk about making the right choices, but not nearly enough talk about the importance of citizens making their own choices. Our experience with the coronavirus “experts” shows us vividly what a profound and immediate threat the administrative state is to the American way of life.

Republicans must explain that “diversity is our greatest strength,” which is multiculturalism boiled down to an aphorism, is exactly backwards. America’s greatest strength is having transcended race, and the one major exception, slavery, was very nearly our undoing.

And perhaps most importantly, Republicans must, like Trump, remind the public that America is “incredible.” That America is the greatest country the world has ever seen. As Norman Podhoretz is fond of pointing out, America has brought more freedom and more prosperity to more people than any nation in the history the world. Citizens need to hear this—loudly and often.

If, because of political correctness, Republicans cannot say some of these things today, then they need to figure out how to get to a place where they can say them.

More broadly, Republicans need to articulate a compelling vision of an American way of life that competes with the multicultural way of life.

Good News

The good news is that this vision is likely to be well received by the American public, including many Democrats. The divide in this country is not between Republicans and Democrats but between multiculturalists and Americans.

By and large, Americans reject multiculturalism—political correctness, the America-is-evil narrative, taking down statues, transgenderism, diversity requirements, open borders, drag queen library hour, and many of the other tentacles of multiculturalism. The public opposes these things by huge margins.

And I cannot believe that even most Democrats think it was xenophobic for Trump to keep out the Chinese during the coronavirus pandemic. Nor do I believe that American people have much use for the anti-American “liberal arts” that are taught by our best colleges and universities.

As Christopher Flannery advised, Republicans ought to make the next presidential election a choice between multiculturalism and America. Although the divide in this country turns on multiculturalism, our politics are still fought along party lines. Thus, Republicans must be clear that the Democratic Party, despite the better judgment and inclinations of many of its voters, is being taken over by the multiculturalists.

A vote for a Democrat at any level must be seen as a vote for the multicultural project to destroy America. As Flannery wrote, “If Democrats want to repudiate the multicultural agenda, God bless them…but Republicans must compel them to do that or to get unelected.”

After Trump, Republicans will not get far without a national leader, one who has Trump’s courage and conviction and who understands what Trump has tapped into (a rejection of multiculturalism) and where he is pointing (the preservation of the American way of life). But that leader must go further than Trump. Trump began the fight. Now we need someone to carry it on, which requires explaining what the fight is all about.

One often hears it said, usually by multiculturalists, that the Republican party is dying because old white males are dying out. Republicans, however, cannot let themselves be positioned by the multiculturalists as the party of white males. Republicans must be the party of the middle class and of common-sense Americans, of all races and ethnicities, the party of color blind, hard-working, self-reliant, public-spirited, religious, patriotic, self-sacrificing Americans. There are many, many Democrats who belong in that group.

Making multiculturalism the enemy provides a big opportunity for Republicans. Opposing multiculturalism, like slavery and Communism before it, has the potential to energize the Republican party and the conservative movement. Conservatives, who are in the business of conserving things, come to life when there is something important to conserve. This allows them to stake out a very distinctive and morally powerful position with enough room to accommodate a broad coalition.

In this case, that really important “something” is the American way of life.",www.americanmind.org,right,somOyBHZl1wiAHec

Keny and Nancy Pham own a pair of businesses outside of the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco — a nail salon and a Vietnamese Banh Mi restaurant — where they say sales have dropped more than 50 percent this week . The salon was empty Thursday at the usually busy lunch time .
Nobody wants to get manicures — because that involves hand touching . The salon typically gets about 100 clients a day and this week is down to about 10 a day , said Nancy Pham , co-owner of the Pampered Hands Nail Spa .

The restaurants, food trucks and other businesses that thrive off lunchtime crowds say that businesses has pretty much ground to a halt.

Keny and Nancy Pham own a pair of businesses outside of the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco — a nail salon and a Vietnamese Banh Mi restaurant — where they say sales have dropped more than 50 percent this week. The salon was empty Thursday at the usually busy lunch time.

Nobody wants to get manicures — because that involves hand touching. The salon typically gets about 100 clients a day and this week is down to about 10 a day, said Nancy Pham, co-owner of the Pampered Hands Nail Spa.

Keny Pham says he is concerned about finances and paying their $10,000 monthly rent, but he has other worries as well. They have a child and live with Keny’s elderly parents, whose health he is most worried about. And it’s hard not to look at customers as potential germ carriers. Pham has asked his half dozen employees to rotate shifts and work alternate days, for now.

“We don’t want to lay anyone off,” he said. “We have to come up with a way to survive.”

In Las Vegas, where so much of the economy is wedded to big crowds from concerts, tournaments, conventions and tourists, many suddenly found themselves out of work.

Las Vegas bartender Rique Rose works part-time at three different locations on the Las Vegas Strip, tending bar in event centers at the MGM Grand, the Mandalay Bay and in the T-Mobile arena, where the Las Vegas Golden Knights play.

First, he lost Friday and Saturday shifts with the cancellation of the Pac-12 men’s college basketball tournament. Then, he saw that the NHL was suspending the rest of its season. He’s still waiting to see if the Post Malone concert he was scheduled to work Saturday night will be canceled.

Every cancellation means more than missing out on his $8.25 minimum wage pay; he also loses approximately $200 in tips. He wonders how he will pay his bills.

“I guess we’re just going to have to endure it,” he sighed.

And American Airlines announced Thursday that one of its pilots based at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport tested positive for the virus.

More than 1,300 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the United States, and 40 people have died as of Thursday evening. About 128,000 people have been infected globally.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.

In every state, officials were taking dramatic new measures each day to keep the virus from spreading deeper into the country. And with each shuttered school, canceled outing, lost shift and work-from-home directive, people’s lives were being transformed in profound ways.

Mom Natasja Billiau came up with a quick homeschooling plan for 8-year-old Victor and 5-year-old Anna Laura after their public school in Seattle closed for the first full day Thursday. They kept as close to their regular school schedule as possible, she said, with recess times and lunch built in.

Billiau’s husband has been working from home since last week, and the family is moving to a new house in two weeks.

“Everything’s up in the air. I don’t know how I’m going to get it done, we’ll see,” she said. “It’s a day-by-day situation.”

She went forward with play dates, but everyone kept apart at a safe distance.

“And of course, as soon as we get home everybody has to wash hands,” she said.

Despite the scrambling and closures, for many people, life continued as usual. Hours after Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, announced it was sending students home and would complete the semester online, customers stood in a busy line and ate lunch elbow-to-elbow at a crowded taqueria not far from campus. Many were working to see the upside of hunkering down and “social distancing,” swapping recommendations for Netflix shows or good books.

Students at the University of Maryland in College Park are heading off to spring break this week and classes are moving online. On Thursday, students were packing up their belongings on a campus that was noticeably emptier than usual.

Signs posted on the front doors of the University of Maryland’s journalism school said, “If you are sick, please go home.”

Mike Davis, 60, drove over from Annapolis, Maryland, to help his son Nick, a 22-year-old senior, pack up his stuff. Davis said the school’s decision to keep students off campus for several weeks make sense.

Besides, he was looking forward to having his son around the house: “I’ve got three bags of mulch ready for him to spread.”

So what ’ s America going to look like when this generation rises to power ? I spent the past three years trying to answer that question by crisscrossing the country , interviewing the young leaders who are among the first in their cohort to be elected to public office . I sat down with Democratic stars like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , 30 , and former South Bend , Ind. , mayor Pete Buttigieg , 38 , and Republican up-and-comers like Representatives Elise Stefanik and Dan Crenshaw , both 35 . I interviewed rookie Democratic Congresswomen like Lauren Underwood , 33 , and Haley Stevens , 36 , and a smattering of local leaders from California to New York , including Stockton , Calif. , Mayor Michael Tubbs , 29 , and Ithaca , N.Y. , Mayor Svante Myrick , 32 . The result is my book , The Ones We ’ ve Been Waiting For .
If I set out to learn what millennials believe and why , I ended up with something more compelling : a glimpse of our country ’ s future . Millennials , after all , are starting to gain political power at a time when America looks more like a gerontocracy than ever . Donald Trump is the oldest first-term President in U.S. history , elected largely by older , white voters . He is surrounded in Washington by senior citizens like Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross , 82 , who can manage only a small window every day when he can “ focus and pay attention and not fall asleep , ” according to one Politico report . Trump ’ s Senate allies are similarly geriatric . Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell , 77 , graduated from the University of Louisville when tuition ran just $ 330 a year , and Republican Senator Chuck Grassley , 86 , was kindergarten age before the chocolate-chip cookie was invented , in 1938 .
It ’ s not just Republicans . Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , 79 , and two of the top Democratic presidential candidates–former Vice President Joe Biden , 77 , and Senator Bernie Sanders , 78–were born before the discovery of the polio vaccine and the bikini . Many of the lawmakers who must now grapple with questions of net neutrality , cyberwarfare and how to regulate Facebook were approaching retirement age when social media was invented .
Of course , age isn ’ t everything . Sanders , whose politics broadly reflect the preferences of the rising millennial electorate , has emerged as a Democratic front runner in part because of his popularity among young voters , while Buttigieg is most popular among older , more moderate Democrats . And Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , 86 , has become a hero among young liberal women .
Nor will a generational uprising come all at once . Young people have historically voted at much lower rates than older people , and factors like geography , gerrymandering and voter-suppression efforts–which tend to disenfranchise college students and new voters–will conspire to diminish the power of millennials as the largest voting bloc . It may take years or even decades for millennials to be proportionally represented in the halls of power .
But a progressive youthquake is coming . Research has shown that people ’ s experiences in early adulthood have the greatest impact on their lifelong political leanings , and millennials , for the most part , have experienced an America riven by inequality , endless wars , a financial collapse , a student debt crisis , and inertia in the face of climate change . All that has made them distinctly more liberal than their elders . “ The America we grew up in is nothing like the America our parents or our grandparents grew up in , ” Ocasio-Cortez told me in an interview in her Capitol Hill office last year . “ A lot of what we have to deal with are issues and decisions that were made by people in generations before us . ”
According to Pew , 57 % of millennials hold “ consistently ” or “ mostly liberal ” opinions , while only 12 % report having conservative views . Even Buttigieg , who is often cast as a moderate in this Democratic presidential primary , is significantly more liberal than centrists of the previous generation , favoring universal health care , student debt relief and urgent action on climate change . He is also openly gay–which just a generation ago might have disqualified him from the South Bend mayor ’ s office , let alone the presidency . Meanwhile , Trump is deeply unpopular among young Americans . One Harvard poll found his disapproval rate among people under the age of 30 topped 70 % .
There ’ s nothing more natural than generational turnover . Every couple of decades , a wave of elected officials begin to retire and a new generation fills the void . In the 1950s and ’ 60s , it was the Greatest Generation , the ones who fought WW II and led a civic revival that built the national highway system and the rockets that sent men to the moon . In the ’ 70s and ’ 80s , the so-called Watergate babies swept into office to clean up corruption and reform institutions , ushering in a new era of entrenched partisanship . And for the past 30 years , baby boomers have been running the show . They shaped American politics according to their principles of fierce individualism , embracing privatization , tax cuts and policies rooted in “ personal responsibility. ” Generation X ’ s leaders , including former Georgia house minority leader Stacey Abrams and Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Josh Hawley , are now ascendant .
Millennials are next . And by understanding the forces that shaped their politics , we can understand what America might look like when they ’ re in charge .

On Christmas Eve 1999 , 16-year-old Haley Stevens opened her journal , gripped a purple marker and wrote : Haley ’ s Millennium Ideas . Her letters were large and looping . “ The polar ice caps are going to melt , ” she wrote . “ Natural disasters and mad leaders at war … what we read and what we do became so unbalanced and money driven. ” Like most diary-scribbling teenagers , she had a flair for the dramatic : “ We won ’ t stop our mistakes , ” she wrote . “ So what the prophets predict will come true . ”
Back then , Stevens was just a high school junior who filled her journal with America Online instant-message chats with boys from camp . ( She printed them out and saved them for later analysis . ) Now she ’ s a freshman Democratic Representative from Michigan ’ s 11th District , one of 20 millennials who were elected to Congress in 2018 in a wave of discontent with the Trump Administration .
I first met Stevens a couple of months before she won her primary . She had never held elected office , and at that point she was a long shot to win her party ’ s nomination , much less go on to flip her Michigan House district . Which is perhaps why she let a reporter into her mother ’ s bright yellow kitchen to read her childhood journals and sift through boxes of old keepsakes . “ I think there ’ s a little bit of a misperception that people have about millennials : we do feel very called to service , ” she told me at the time . “ Kids of the ’ 90s , we grew up thinking that we were going to change the world . ”
The conventional wisdom has long been that young people usually lean to the left and then become more conservative as they age , buy homes , build wealth and raise families . Winston Churchill once supposedly said , “ If you ’ re not a liberal at 20 , you have no heart ; if you ’ re not a conservative at 40 , you have no brain. ” But the data tell a different story . Researchers have found that popular Presidents tend to attract young people to their party , while unpopular Presidents repel them . Those formative attitudes are persistent : if you ’ re disenchanted by a Republican President as a teenager , you ’ re disproportionately more likely to vote for Democrats well into your adult life . One Pew study of 2012 data found that those who turned 18 during the unpopular Republican Richard Nixon years were more likely to vote for Democrat Barack Obama , while those who turned 18 just a decade later , during the prosperous Ronald Reagan years , tended to vote for Obama ’ s GOP opponent in the 2012 presidential race , Mitt Romney .
In several studies , Andrew Gelman , a political scientist at Columbia University , and Yair Ghitza , chief scientist at Catalist , a data provider for Democratic and progressive organizations , found that political events experienced between the ages of 14 and 24 have roughly triple the impact of events experienced later in life . ( Their research focused on white voters , since longitudinal data on voters of color is more difficult to find . ) “ It ’ s much more about cohort than age , ” Gelman says . “ One way of understanding these up and down trend lines over the decades is asking : What happened when people were young ? ”
Consider , then , the millennial generation ’ s experience of America so far . For many , their political awakening came on Sept. 11 , 2001 . Ocasio-Cortez , then a seventh-grader , remembers coming home early from school and watching the towers fall on television , wondering whether her mom would be home from work in time for the apocalypse . Representative Max Rose , then a high school freshman , surprised his parents after the tragedy by hanging an American flag in his messy teenage bedroom in New York City . Stefanik , who was a high school senior in Albany , N.Y. , remembers watching a friend collapse on the floor because her sister worked in one of the towers . ( The friend ’ s sister was ultimately found safe . ) “ It ’ s one of the reasons I wanted to go into public policy , ” Stefanik told me later . “ On that day , we became a globally aware generation . ”
The millennials who enlisted to fight in the endless wars that followed would learn firsthand the consequences of American foreign policy . Crenshaw , who was also in high school on 9/11 , lost his eye in Afghanistan while serving as a Navy SEAL , completing a mission he thought was a misguided use of resources by Obama ’ s Pentagon . Rose was injured by an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan ; his life was saved by a new kind of Stryker vehicle that has been recently funded by Congress . When Buttigieg arrived in Afghanistan as a naval intelligence officer in 2014 , his fellow officers told him the war was over : he spent most of his nights in his bunk , reading Tolstoy ’ s War and Peace and thinking about the question Vietnam veteran John Kerry once asked during congressional testimony : “ How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake ? ”
The young people who served in Iraq and Afghanistan often have a more comprehensive view of American military engagement than their peers . Crenshaw is a vocal supporter of American military abroad and bucked his party to oppose Trump ’ s proposed withdrawal of troops from Syria . He often says , “ We go there , so they don ’ t come here. ” But while the baby boomers endured the Vietnam draft , only a small fraction of millennials have served in the military , and many see the wars as folly at best , immoral at worst . To many of them , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were expensive fiascoes that shattered their sense of American exceptionalism .
In 2017 , just half of millennials said they thought the U.S. should take an active part in world affairs , compared with almost three-quarters of boomers . Only about a third of millennials said they thought the U.S. was the greatest country in the world .
Meanwhile , young people weren ’ t doing great at home either . Thanks to a series of public-policy moves , including slashing federal funding for state colleges and institutionalizing debt as a means to pay for it , millennials ended up owing nearly four times as much in student loans as their parents did . The student debt burden in the U.S. now stands at $ 1.6 trillion , most of which is owed by younger generations .
Then came the financial crisis in 2008 , which has had cascading effects for millennials and shaped many of their young political leaders . Ocasio-Cortez ’ s father died just as the economy was melting down , and as her mother fought in court to recoup her husband ’ s assets , Ocasio-Cortez ’ s younger brother Gabriel noticed bank officials prowling around taking photos of their home . He had read that having a dog on the property can slow down the foreclosure process , since the bank would have to compensate its managers with hazard pay . He started leaving the family ’ s Great Dane , Domino , on the porch .
Between student debt and the financial crisis , millennials are lagging behind boomers and Gen X-ers . One study found that nearly a decade after the recession , millennialled households still had 34 % less wealth than older generations had at their age , and the recession prevented millennials from substantially increasing their net worth . Youth unemployment spiked to 20 % after the recession , and when millennials did find jobs , they were often in the gig economy , which likely meant irregular hours and no benefits . Between 1989 and 2011 , the percentage of graduates covered by employer-sponsored health insurance was halved . Millennials , as a group , are more likely to have debt , less likely to have union benefits , and less likely to own a house or a car compared with the generations before them . Those who have gotten married have done so later and had fewer children . No wonder , then , that many young people today feel that 20th century systems aren ’ t working . They want to build 21st century solutions for 21st century problems .
Stevens campaigns in her Michigan district during her 2018 congressional run Brittany Greeson—The New York Times/Redux
The 2008 presidential race was a galvanizing political moment for many young people . Buttigieg , who was 26 at the time , trudged through Iowa canvassing for Obama , digging out his car with his clipboard when it got stuck in the snow . Eric Lesser , who is now a Massachusetts state senator , worked as a luggage handler for Obama ’ s campaign . Obama ’ s victory was due in large part to youth enthusiasm : he won two-thirds of voters under 30 .
Obama rose to power on a message of consensus building , and many of the young people who worked for him internalized that message . Stevens , who also worked for Hillary Clinton in the primary and for Biden ’ s vice-presidential bid in 2008 , was hired to work on the new President ’ s auto task force . She remembers staying up all night in the Treasury Department , eating Cheerios straight out of the box as the task force tried to find a way to save the auto industry . Lauren Underwood , now a first-term Illinois Congresswoman , worked in Obama ’ s Department of Health and Human Services , helping implement the Affordable Care Act . “ We have very high goals , just like Obama did , ” says Lesser , who spent much of Obama ’ s first term sitting in a tiny cubby outside the Oval Office , working as a special assistant to senior adviser David Axelrod . “ But we also understood that sometimes it ’ s the singles and doubles and triples that get you there . ”
Other young people were galvanized in a different way by Obama ’ s focus on consensus . “ A lot of our generation put our hopes into Barack Obama ’ s campaign , ” says Waleed Shahid of Justice Democrats , a progressive organization that supports young , working-class candidates like Ocasio-Cortez in campaigns against moderate Democrats . “ And then as soon as he gets into office , there ’ s all these things that go on that are kind of disappointing to young people. ” If this was the best a transformative leader like Obama could do within the system , many people figured , then maybe the system itself was broken .
If systems were the problem , then movements–not individuals–would be the solution . In the wake of the Obama Administration , millennials began founding and joining “ leaderless ” social movements like Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter , demanding systemic overhauls to fix structural inequality and institutional racism . These groups rejected Obama ’ s hopeful pragmatism . “ We ’ ve never seen bipartisanship function in society , ” says Varshini Prakash , a leader of the Sunrise Movement , a group of young people agitating for a Green New Deal . “ We ’ ve fundamentally seen our political institutions fail to fix the most existential threats of our lifetime . ”
So when Sanders ran for President in 2016 on a message that the system itself was rigged , his message struck a chord . Working as a bartender in New York , Ocasio-Cortez sometimes made as little as $ 60 in tips in a nine-hour day . “ I didn ’ t have health care , I wasn ’ t being paid a living wage , and I didn ’ t think that I deserved any of those things , ” she told a cheering crowd of Sanders supporters in late 2019 , after endorsing his presidential run . “ It wasn ’ t until I heard of a man by the name of Bernie Sanders that I began to question and assert and recognize my inherent value as a human being . ”
Among young voters , Sanders ’ embrace of democratic socialism was not a liability ; it was part of his appeal . Young people ’ s approval of capitalism dropped 15 points from 2010 to 2019 , according to Gallup . By 2018 , fewer than half of 18-to-29-year-olds said they supported capitalism , according to an annual poll from Harvard ’ s Institute of Politics ; 39 % said they supported democratic socialism . The word itself–socialism–became something of a generational Rorschach test : to boomers , it conjured images of Soviet gulags and Venezuelan famine ; to millennials , it meant universal health care and day care , climate solutions and affordable housing .
None of this looks good for the GOP . Republicans have long done well among white voters , but millennials and their younger siblings in Gen Z ( those born since 1997 ) are the most racially diverse generation in U.S. history . Republicans maintain strong ties to religious voters ; millennials widely reject organized religion and are more openly LGBTQ than any generation before . On nearly every predictor of social conservatism–religion , race , wealth–millennials are headed one way and the GOP is headed another .
In the years before 2016 , young Republicans urged their party to do a better job of appealing to millennials . Former GOP Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida , first elected at age 34 , pushed his party to embrace immigration reform and described a widespread acceptance of marriage equality among younger conservatives . “ This is a live-and-let-live generation , ” he says . “ We don ’ t seek to impose our moral codes on others. ” Stefanik and Curbelo both pushed their party to act on climate change , an issue that many of their septuagenarian colleagues have either dismissed or ignored . ( Stefanik , who first emerged as a voice of moderation in the GOP , has now taken a hard right turn , defending Trump against impeachment and signing on as a New York co-chair in his re-election campaign . )
But Trump ’ s election in 2016 scrambled young Republicans ’ efforts to appeal to a new generation . When Curbelo , once a rising star in the GOP , was ousted in the 2018 midterms , Trump mocked him as Carlos “ Que-bella. ” As Trumpism rose , many young conservatives began nursing serious doubts about their party , and some jumped ship altogether . From 2015 to 2017 , roughly half of young Republicans defected from the GOP , according to Pew . Over 20 % came back to the party by 2017 , but almost a quarter left for good , Pew found . By 2018 , only 17 % of millennials identified as solidly Republican .
Conservatives may find solace in the fact that young people are still much less likely to vote than their parents or grandparents . But that may be changing too . Millennial turnout was 42 % in the 2018 midterms , roughly double what it was four years prior , and they voted for Democrats by roughly 2 to 1 . That turnout helped send 20 millennials to Congress , from firebrand socialists like Ocasio-Cortez in New York City to moderate seat flippers like Representative Abby Finkenauer in Iowa . And nearly 60 % of Americans under 30 say they definitely plan to vote in 2020 .
Ocasio-Cortez rallies fellow millennials at a Sanders campaign event in Queens , N.Y. , on Oct. 19 Michael Nigro—Sipa
These generational rifts have already defined the Democratic primary in surprising ways . Buttigieg has frequently noted that he is a member of the “ school-shooting generation , ” and emphasized that millennials like him will be on “ the business end ” of climate change . When I first met Buttigieg at a coffee shop in Manhattan in 2017 , he told me he thought a lot about the 2004 commencement speech that the comedian Jon Stewart gave at William & Mary . “ He said , ‘ Here ’ s the thing about the real world : We broke it , sorry ’ –I think he meant grownups , ” Buttigieg told me , paraphrasing the speech . “ He said , ‘ We broke it , but the thing is , if you figure out how to fix it , you get to be the next Greatest Generation . ' ”
Today Buttigieg is part of a quartet of top contenders in the 2020 Democratic primary . If he wins , he ’ ll be the first millennial presidential nominee . And if the nomination goes instead to Sanders or Elizabeth Warren , both in their 70s , it will be because millennial voters have dragged the party to the left . Nearly 6 in 10 young Democrats favor the most progressive candidates : according to a January Quinnipiac poll , 39 % of voters under 35 favor Sanders and 18 % support Warren .
Which means that if 2016 was a skirmish , then 2020 could be an all-out generational war . It may take two years , or five years , or 10 , but the boomers who run Washington today won ’ t be around forever . A surge is coming . The elections this year could tell us if it ’ s already here .
Adapted from Alter ’ s book , The Ones We ’ ve Been Waiting For , out Feb. 18
This appears in the February 03 , 2020 issue of TIME .","Love ’em or hate ’em, this much is true: one day soon, millennials will rule America.

This is neither wish nor warning but fact, rooted in the physics of time and the biology of human cells. Millennials–born between 1981 and 1996–are already the largest living generation and the largest age group in the workforce. They outnumber Gen X (born 1965–1980) and will soon outnumber baby boomers (born 1946–1964) among American voters. Their startups have revolutionized the economy, their tastes have shifted the culture, and their enormous appetite for social media has transformed human interaction. American politics is the next arena ripe for disruption.

When it occurs, it may feel like a revolution, in part because this generation has different political views than those in power now. Millennials are more racially diverse, more tuned in to the power of networks and systems and more socially progressive than either Gen X or baby boomers on nearly every available metric. They tend to favor government-run health care, student debt relief, marijuana legalization and criminal-justice reform, and they demand urgent government action on climate change. The millennial wave is coming: the only questions are when and how fast it will arrive.

He is surrounded in Washington by senior citizens like Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, 82, who can manage only a small window every day when he can “focus and pay attention and not fall asleep,” according to one Politico report. Trump’s Senate allies are similarly geriatric. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, 77, graduated from the University of Louisville when tuition ran just $330 a year, and Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, 86, was kindergarten age before the chocolate-chip cookie was invented, in 1938.

It’s not just Republicans. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, 79, and two of the top Democratic presidential candidates–former Vice President Joe Biden, 77, and Senator Bernie Sanders, 78–were born before the discovery of the polio vaccine and the bikini. Many of the lawmakers who must now grapple with questions of net neutrality, cyberwarfare and how to regulate Facebook were approaching retirement age when social media was invented.

Of course, age isn’t everything. Sanders, whose politics broadly reflect the preferences of the rising millennial electorate, has emerged as a Democratic front runner in part because of his popularity among young voters, while Buttigieg is most popular among older, more moderate Democrats. And Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 86, has become a hero among young liberal women.

Nor will a generational uprising come all at once. Young people have historically voted at much lower rates than older people, and factors like geography, gerrymandering and voter-suppression efforts–which tend to disenfranchise college students and new voters–will conspire to diminish the power of millennials as the largest voting bloc. It may take years or even decades for millennials to be proportionally represented in the halls of power.

But a progressive youthquake is coming. Research has shown that people’s experiences in early adulthood have the greatest impact on their lifelong political leanings, and millennials, for the most part, have experienced an America riven by inequality, endless wars, a financial collapse, a student debt crisis, and inertia in the face of climate change. All that has made them distinctly more liberal than their elders. “The America we grew up in is nothing like the America our parents or our grandparents grew up in,” Ocasio-Cortez told me in an interview in her Capitol Hill office last year. “A lot of what we have to deal with are issues and decisions that were made by people in generations before us.”

According to Pew, 57% of millennials hold “consistently” or “mostly liberal” opinions, while only 12% report having conservative views. Even Buttigieg, who is often cast as a moderate in this Democratic presidential primary, is significantly more liberal than centrists of the previous generation, favoring universal health care, student debt relief and urgent action on climate change. He is also openly gay–which just a generation ago might have disqualified him from the South Bend mayor’s office, let alone the presidency. Meanwhile, Trump is deeply unpopular among young Americans. One Harvard poll found his disapproval rate among people under the age of 30 topped 70%.

There’s nothing more natural than generational turnover. Every couple of decades, a wave of elected officials begin to retire and a new generation fills the void. In the 1950s and ’60s, it was the Greatest Generation, the ones who fought WW II and led a civic revival that built the national highway system and the rockets that sent men to the moon. In the ’70s and ’80s, the so-called Watergate babies swept into office to clean up corruption and reform institutions, ushering in a new era of entrenched partisanship. And for the past 30 years, baby boomers have been running the show. They shaped American politics according to their principles of fierce individualism, embracing privatization, tax cuts and policies rooted in “personal responsibility.” Generation X’s leaders, including former Georgia house minority leader Stacey Abrams and Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Josh Hawley, are now ascendant.

Millennials are next. And by understanding the forces that shaped their politics, we can understand what America might look like when they’re in charge.

On Christmas Eve 1999, 16-year-old Haley Stevens opened her journal, gripped a purple marker and wrote: Haley’s Millennium Ideas. Her letters were large and looping. “The polar ice caps are going to melt,” she wrote. “Natural disasters and mad leaders at war … what we read and what we do became so unbalanced and money driven.” Like most diary-scribbling teenagers, she had a flair for the dramatic: “We won’t stop our mistakes,” she wrote. “So what the prophets predict will come true.”

Back then, Stevens was just a high school junior who filled her journal with America Online instant-message chats with boys from camp. (She printed them out and saved them for later analysis.) Now she’s a freshman Democratic Representative from Michigan’s 11th District, one of 20 millennials who were elected to Congress in 2018 in a wave of discontent with the Trump Administration.

I first met Stevens a couple of months before she won her primary. She had never held elected office, and at that point she was a long shot to win her party’s nomination, much less go on to flip her Michigan House district. Which is perhaps why she let a reporter into her mother’s bright yellow kitchen to read her childhood journals and sift through boxes of old keepsakes. “I think there’s a little bit of a misperception that people have about millennials: we do feel very called to service,” she told me at the time. “Kids of the ’90s, we grew up thinking that we were going to change the world.”

The conventional wisdom has long been that young people usually lean to the left and then become more conservative as they age, buy homes, build wealth and raise families. Winston Churchill once supposedly said, “If you’re not a liberal at 20, you have no heart; if you’re not a conservative at 40, you have no brain.” But the data tell a different story. Researchers have found that popular Presidents tend to attract young people to their party, while unpopular Presidents repel them. Those formative attitudes are persistent: if you’re disenchanted by a Republican President as a teenager, you’re disproportionately more likely to vote for Democrats well into your adult life. One Pew study of 2012 data found that those who turned 18 during the unpopular Republican Richard Nixon years were more likely to vote for Democrat Barack Obama, while those who turned 18 just a decade later, during the prosperous Ronald Reagan years, tended to vote for Obama’s GOP opponent in the 2012 presidential race, Mitt Romney.

In several studies, Andrew Gelman, a political scientist at Columbia University, and Yair Ghitza, chief scientist at Catalist, a data provider for Democratic and progressive organizations, found that political events experienced between the ages of 14 and 24 have roughly triple the impact of events experienced later in life. (Their research focused on white voters, since longitudinal data on voters of color is more difficult to find.) “It’s much more about cohort than age,” Gelman says. “One way of understanding these up and down trend lines over the decades is asking: What happened when people were young?”

Consider, then, the millennial generation’s experience of America so far. For many, their political awakening came on Sept. 11, 2001. Ocasio-Cortez, then a seventh-grader, remembers coming home early from school and watching the towers fall on television, wondering whether her mom would be home from work in time for the apocalypse. Representative Max Rose, then a high school freshman, surprised his parents after the tragedy by hanging an American flag in his messy teenage bedroom in New York City. Stefanik, who was a high school senior in Albany, N.Y., remembers watching a friend collapse on the floor because her sister worked in one of the towers. (The friend’s sister was ultimately found safe.) “It’s one of the reasons I wanted to go into public policy,” Stefanik told me later. “On that day, we became a globally aware generation.”

The millennials who enlisted to fight in the endless wars that followed would learn firsthand the consequences of American foreign policy. Crenshaw, who was also in high school on 9/11, lost his eye in Afghanistan while serving as a Navy SEAL, completing a mission he thought was a misguided use of resources by Obama’s Pentagon. Rose was injured by an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan; his life was saved by a new kind of Stryker vehicle that has been recently funded by Congress. When Buttigieg arrived in Afghanistan as a naval intelligence officer in 2014, his fellow officers told him the war was over: he spent most of his nights in his bunk, reading Tolstoy’s War and Peace and thinking about the question Vietnam veteran John Kerry once asked during congressional testimony: “How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?”

The young people who served in Iraq and Afghanistan often have a more comprehensive view of American military engagement than their peers. Crenshaw is a vocal supporter of American military abroad and bucked his party to oppose Trump’s proposed withdrawal of troops from Syria. He often says, “We go there, so they don’t come here.” But while the baby boomers endured the Vietnam draft, only a small fraction of millennials have served in the military, and many see the wars as folly at best, immoral at worst. To many of them, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were expensive fiascoes that shattered their sense of American exceptionalism.

In 2017, just half of millennials said they thought the U.S. should take an active part in world affairs, compared with almost three-quarters of boomers. Only about a third of millennials said they thought the U.S. was the greatest country in the world.

Meanwhile, young people weren’t doing great at home either. Thanks to a series of public-policy moves, including slashing federal funding for state colleges and institutionalizing debt as a means to pay for it, millennials ended up owing nearly four times as much in student loans as their parents did. The student debt burden in the U.S. now stands at $1.6 trillion, most of which is owed by younger generations.

Then came the financial crisis in 2008, which has had cascading effects for millennials and shaped many of their young political leaders. Ocasio-Cortez’s father died just as the economy was melting down, and as her mother fought in court to recoup her husband’s assets, Ocasio-Cortez’s younger brother Gabriel noticed bank officials prowling around taking photos of their home. He had read that having a dog on the property can slow down the foreclosure process, since the bank would have to compensate its managers with hazard pay. He started leaving the family’s Great Dane, Domino, on the porch.

Between student debt and the financial crisis, millennials are lagging behind boomers and Gen X-ers. One study found that nearly a decade after the recession, millennialled households still had 34% less wealth than older generations had at their age, and the recession prevented millennials from substantially increasing their net worth. Youth unemployment spiked to 20% after the recession, and when millennials did find jobs, they were often in the gig economy, which likely meant irregular hours and no benefits. Between 1989 and 2011, the percentage of graduates covered by employer-sponsored health insurance was halved. Millennials, as a group, are more likely to have debt, less likely to have union benefits, and less likely to own a house or a car compared with the generations before them. Those who have gotten married have done so later and had fewer children. No wonder, then, that many young people today feel that 20th century systems aren’t working. They want to build 21st century solutions for 21st century problems.

The 2008 presidential race was a galvanizing political moment for many young people. Buttigieg, who was 26 at the time, trudged through Iowa canvassing for Obama, digging out his car with his clipboard when it got stuck in the snow. Eric Lesser, who is now a Massachusetts state senator, worked as a luggage handler for Obama’s campaign. Obama’s victory was due in large part to youth enthusiasm: he won two-thirds of voters under 30.

Obama rose to power on a message of consensus building, and many of the young people who worked for him internalized that message. Stevens, who also worked for Hillary Clinton in the primary and for Biden’s vice-presidential bid in 2008, was hired to work on the new President’s auto task force. She remembers staying up all night in the Treasury Department, eating Cheerios straight out of the box as the task force tried to find a way to save the auto industry. Lauren Underwood, now a first-term Illinois Congresswoman, worked in Obama’s Department of Health and Human Services, helping implement the Affordable Care Act. “We have very high goals, just like Obama did,” says Lesser, who spent much of Obama’s first term sitting in a tiny cubby outside the Oval Office, working as a special assistant to senior adviser David Axelrod. “But we also understood that sometimes it’s the singles and doubles and triples that get you there.”

Other young people were galvanized in a different way by Obama’s focus on consensus. “A lot of our generation put our hopes into Barack Obama’s campaign,” says Waleed Shahid of Justice Democrats, a progressive organization that supports young, working-class candidates like Ocasio-Cortez in campaigns against moderate Democrats. “And then as soon as he gets into office, there’s all these things that go on that are kind of disappointing to young people.” If this was the best a transformative leader like Obama could do within the system, many people figured, then maybe the system itself was broken.

If systems were the problem, then movements–not individuals–would be the solution. In the wake of the Obama Administration, millennials began founding and joining “leaderless” social movements like Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter, demanding systemic overhauls to fix structural inequality and institutional racism. These groups rejected Obama’s hopeful pragmatism. “We’ve never seen bipartisanship function in society,” says Varshini Prakash, a leader of the Sunrise Movement, a group of young people agitating for a Green New Deal. “We’ve fundamentally seen our political institutions fail to fix the most existential threats of our lifetime.”

So when Sanders ran for President in 2016 on a message that the system itself was rigged, his message struck a chord. Working as a bartender in New York, Ocasio-Cortez sometimes made as little as $60 in tips in a nine-hour day. “I didn’t have health care, I wasn’t being paid a living wage, and I didn’t think that I deserved any of those things,” she told a cheering crowd of Sanders supporters in late 2019, after endorsing his presidential run. “It wasn’t until I heard of a man by the name of Bernie Sanders that I began to question and assert and recognize my inherent value as a human being.”

Among young voters, Sanders’ embrace of democratic socialism was not a liability; it was part of his appeal. Young people’s approval of capitalism dropped 15 points from 2010 to 2019, according to Gallup. By 2018, fewer than half of 18-to-29-year-olds said they supported capitalism, according to an annual poll from Harvard’s Institute of Politics; 39% said they supported democratic socialism. The word itself–socialism–became something of a generational Rorschach test: to boomers, it conjured images of Soviet gulags and Venezuelan famine; to millennials, it meant universal health care and day care, climate solutions and affordable housing.

None of this looks good for the GOP. Republicans have long done well among white voters, but millennials and their younger siblings in Gen Z (those born since 1997) are the most racially diverse generation in U.S. history. Republicans maintain strong ties to religious voters; millennials widely reject organized religion and are more openly LGBTQ than any generation before. On nearly every predictor of social conservatism–religion, race, wealth–millennials are headed one way and the GOP is headed another.

In the years before 2016, young Republicans urged their party to do a better job of appealing to millennials. Former GOP Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida, first elected at age 34, pushed his party to embrace immigration reform and described a widespread acceptance of marriage equality among younger conservatives. “This is a live-and-let-live generation,” he says. “We don’t seek to impose our moral codes on others.” Stefanik and Curbelo both pushed their party to act on climate change, an issue that many of their septuagenarian colleagues have either dismissed or ignored. (Stefanik, who first emerged as a voice of moderation in the GOP, has now taken a hard right turn, defending Trump against impeachment and signing on as a New York co-chair in his re-election campaign.)

But Trump’s election in 2016 scrambled young Republicans’ efforts to appeal to a new generation. When Curbelo, once a rising star in the GOP, was ousted in the 2018 midterms, Trump mocked him as Carlos “Que-bella.” As Trumpism rose, many young conservatives began nursing serious doubts about their party, and some jumped ship altogether. From 2015 to 2017, roughly half of young Republicans defected from the GOP, according to Pew. Over 20% came back to the party by 2017, but almost a quarter left for good, Pew found. By 2018, only 17% of millennials identified as solidly Republican.

Conservatives may find solace in the fact that young people are still much less likely to vote than their parents or grandparents. But that may be changing too. Millennial turnout was 42% in the 2018 midterms, roughly double what it was four years prior, and they voted for Democrats by roughly 2 to 1. That turnout helped send 20 millennials to Congress, from firebrand socialists like Ocasio-Cortez in New York City to moderate seat flippers like Representative Abby Finkenauer in Iowa. And nearly 60% of Americans under 30 say they definitely plan to vote in 2020.

These generational rifts have already defined the Democratic primary in surprising ways. Buttigieg has frequently noted that he is a member of the “school-shooting generation,” and emphasized that millennials like him will be on “the business end” of climate change. When I first met Buttigieg at a coffee shop in Manhattan in 2017, he told me he thought a lot about the 2004 commencement speech that the comedian Jon Stewart gave at William & Mary. “He said, ‘Here’s the thing about the real world: We broke it, sorry’–I think he meant grownups,” Buttigieg told me, paraphrasing the speech. “He said, ‘We broke it, but the thing is, if you figure out how to fix it, you get to be the next Greatest Generation.'”

Today Buttigieg is part of a quartet of top contenders in the 2020 Democratic primary. If he wins, he’ll be the first millennial presidential nominee. And if the nomination goes instead to Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, both in their 70s, it will be because millennial voters have dragged the party to the left. Nearly 6 in 10 young Democrats favor the most progressive candidates: according to a January Quinnipiac poll, 39% of voters under 35 favor Sanders and 18% support Warren.

Which means that if 2016 was a skirmish, then 2020 could be an all-out generational war. It may take two years, or five years, or 10, but the boomers who run Washington today won’t be around forever. A surge is coming. The elections this year could tell us if it’s already here.

culture,Medium,1,https://medium.com/s/world-wide-wtf/memetic-tribes-and-culture-war-2-0-14705c43f6bb,The Memetic Tribes Of Culture War 2.0,2019-07-21,Intellectual Explorers,"Below are some further comments and our speculations on how the tribes will evolve in Culture War 2.0 .
While this tribe engages in full-out war with other tribes , they continue to make gains in legacy media , corporate HR and PR departments , and government institutions . With increased embeddedness of SJA values in institutions and corporations , expect a right-wing countervailing response . Also watch for a fight to define leftism against class-first analysis .
This tribe has made a large impact on the cultural landscape , but has not yet made an impact on government policy . Watch for potential conflicts with masculinist black nationalists and the “ leaving the plantation ” narrative of Candace Owens . Also , keep a look-out for BLM to distance themselves from white allies capitalizing on wokeness .
Perhaps the fastest growing tribe in recent times , it has moved quickly to redefine the social consensus . Watch for further revelations concerning men in power , followed by more conservative and reactionary backlash .
The feminists left behind by trans-inclusive feminists are fighting an uphill battle inside the left . Watch for future mixing with non-left tribes , and more offline culture war .
Neo-Marxists , while still alive and well in a critical capacity on college campuses , have lost significance since the fall of the Soviet Union . Communism is seen across the political spectrum as discredited . However , given the rising popularity of Democratic Socialists , the memes that Marx birthed could see a revival . If Neo-Marxists can offer a compelling narrative and escape the capitulation and nihilism of Accelerationist thought , they might be able to piggy-back on the DSA ’ s popularity . Watch for Douglas Lain ’ s Zero Books imprint to capitalize on this opportunity .
Even without identifiable chieftains , Antifa has played an important part in the culture war and continues to benefit from people ’ s fear of Trump and dissatisfaction with mainstream responses . Watch for the normalization of a violent offline culture war .
The tribe that coalesced around radical leftism , hope , and physical presence has been shattered . Dormant , it lives on in the 99 % meme and in the pages of Adbusters .
The drama of the Bernie campaign and dissatisfaction with the lack of leftism in the Democratic Party has led to a surge in a radical wing of the American left . The ironic fringe still rests at the top of the podcasts , and the push for mainstreaming socialism has been growing ever since Trump ’ s election . Watch for further infighting with Social Justice Activists .
In reaction to the polarization and catastrophizing they see on both the left and right , this nascent tribe has coalesced around the idea that the world is in fact improving , and whatever challenges society faces can be solved through the institutions and values we currently hold . Watch for an increased presence as neoliberalism converts libertarians and shifts to be embraced as a contrarian ideology .
The zeitgeist of our times gives the palpable sense that the establishment left and right are dramatically on the decline , especially amongst millennials and Generation Z . Those in power within the establishment are experiencing increased pressure from rapidly rising elements within their parties . Democratic and liberal parties worldwide are contending with socialist and far-left elements . Conservative parties have seen populists and illiberal democrats take over . And everyone , everywhere , has been blindsided by the rise of white identitarian and nationalist elements . Watch for these tribes to make a last grasp at power during the 2020 elections .
The atheist tribes are indirect participants in the culture war . Their shared objective is to attack the religious truth-claims and to plant doubt in the epistemic methodology of believers . The New Atheists lost the relevance they had during the Bush Era when the “ Four Horsemen ” had great popularity , but their impact has been felt in the noosphere . They contributed to the religious right ’ s defeat in Culture War 1.0 by weakening it on philosophical grounds . The Street Epistemologists are the New Atheists ’ potential successor in Culture War 2.0 .
Incubated on Overcoming Bias and LessWrong , this is an observer tribe in the culture war . Though similar to the New Atheists in that they prize rationality , they do not define themselves in opposition to religion . Thanks to the strength of Eliezer Yudkowsky and Scott Alexander ’ s writing , and the beliefs and epistemic virtues of the diaspora , they command increasing respect in the culture war . Watch for a popularity boost to Effective Altruism , a struggle with the downsides of increased attention , and possible pressure from the SJAs for the Rationalists to commit to progressive values .
This is another observer tribe , and possibly the most interesting one . If the rationalist motto is “ the map is not the territory , but it is important to create the most accurate map possible , ” then the post-rationalist motto is “ the canvas is not the territory , but it is important to create the most interesting canvas possible. ” This observer tribe has the potential to generate innovative solutions to the seemingly intractable problem of the differend .
Ken Wilber , who lost some momentum in his “ Wyatt Earp ” incident , is steadily gaining a strong following amongst cultural influencers . Like the Rationalists and Post-Rationalists , Integralists are an observer tribe . Unlike them , they have a teleological narrative that instills existential hope . This will be a tribe to watch if it moves away from its observer capacity and becomes more active in the war .
Jordan Peterson is the common denominator of these two tribes . One of the most important figures in Culture War 2.0 , his central message emphasizes free speech and the importance of truth-speaking . His following of mostly young men , which we dub the Sorters , are attracted to Peterson ’ s style and message of personal responsibility . The “ Intellectual Dark Web , ” coined by Eric Weinstein , consists of thinkers who have experienced what they view as thought-policing by politically correct elements of the left . With the ever-increasing popularity of Peterson ’ s brand and related platforms such as Quillette , the Rubin Report , and the Joe Rogan Experience , watch for both of these tribes to gain members and make a strong push for a return to a classically liberal center in our culture .
With a religious right increasingly subservient to Trump , it is becoming incumbent for Christians who put faith first to organize collectively . This memetic tribe is aware of its own mortality and is putting survival before the culture war . Watch for a siphoning of disillusioned Christians and rightists .
The religious right is quickly transitioning into a nationalist right . The culture war goals of the Moral Majority have largely been set aside in favor of punishing the left via Trump . Unless there is a public evangelist revival , watch for this tribe to dissolve into Trumpists and Benedictines over the next few years .
Since its decline following the 2013 government shutdown , this tribe has largely been subsumed by the Trumpists . Watch for a continued decline in libertarian activism as believers drift towards Trump or neoliberalism .
This new tribe makes up for a lack of experience and policy through power and “ high energy. ” They are engaged in a fight for control over the mainstream perception of conservatism with a blindsided establishment right . Watch for a push for votes from racial minorities and a scramble to stay in line with Trump ’ s thought .
These are the conspiracy theory tribes of the culture war . Alex Jones and Infowars represent “ established ” conspiracies such as the New World Order and Illuminati . With his manic energy , Jones has successfully turned conspiracy into a profitable business . QAnon is a grassroots emergence of conspiracy theories originating on /pol/ . Given the intense passion their reality tunnel engenders , we speculate that QAnon will grow amongst Trumpists and will be censored on social media platforms , which will only further fuel its growth .
These three tribes are concerned with issues surrounding white people and are often lumped together by the mainstream media , but they are actively fighting amongst themselves ( “ punching right ” ) in order to create distance and avoid conflation . The Alt-Lite would be quick to point out that they are less defined by white identity and more by western chauvinism , an unapologetic view that western culture is the best . Watch for massive fluctuations and changes in the composition of all three , and a continued fight amongst themselves to gain adherents .
This semi-dormant tribe has partly been subsumed into the Alt-Right . Lack of public direction from its key figures has led to a decline in influence . Watch for Nick Land ’ s return to the blogosphere and keep an eye on Social Matter and the Hestia Society for a potential revival .
Like the dissident right tribes , these masculine tribes are usually lumped together . Like the far-right tribes , these masculinist tribes also signal to create distance from each other . The Manosphere , the largest of the three tribes , reached its peak around Gamergate and has lost momentum due to its lack of a non-hedonistic strategy , and due to men ’ s attention being divided by the competing message of Jordan Peterson . See a continued declined with these three groups , unless new voices emerge .
These self-described involuntary celibates could be placed in the masculinist cluster if not for their view of themselves as having been “ black-pilled ” instead of “ red-pilled. ” They agree with most of the descriptive views of the masculinist tribes , but see their situation as radically hopeless and unfair . The more extreme adherents have a belief space that shares more with terrorist groups like ISIS than any of the memetic tribes listed above . Copycat attacks mimicking Elliot Rodger and Alek Minassian might grow in number unless a memeplex emerges that can inspire and provide meaning to sexually unsuccessful males in society .
We conclude this white paper by offering speculative proposals that are not meant to treat the culture war as a solvable problem , but as an opportunity for personal and collective growth .
We view the noosphere as an emergent phenomenon , a consequence of globalization and digitalization . When Pierre Teilhard de Chardin introduced the term , he adopted a teleological perspective and saw the collective consciousness of humanity developing towards an “ Omega Point. ” While we are agnostic about whether there is an endpoint , we do think that looking at the noosphere as being in the process of evolution can help with regards to making speculative proposals . In this section we shift our focus from seeing memetic tribes as individual entities to viewing them as fragments of the larger noosphere .
Bruce Tuckman , a psychology researcher in group dynamics , established his famous “ stages of group development ” model in 1965 . He believed that there were four necessary stages that newly formed groups need to progress through in order to tackle their shared challenges . The first stage is forming , when a team first comes together and individuals , mainly focused on themselves , operate with a degree of politeness . The second stage is storming , when comfort within the group allows for conflicting opinions to be voiced . Team members may wrestle for control of the group ’ s values and goals . The third stage is norming , when “ resolved disagreements and personality clashes result in greater intimacy , and a spirit of cooperation emerges. ” The fourth stage is performing , where , with “ group norms and roles established , group members focus on achieving common goals , often reaching an unexpectedly high level of success . ”
Not all groups are successful . Some abort during the storming phase — and if we apply this model to the noosphere , we see that all the memetic tribes are in the midst of it . The emergent collective consciousness of the internet began as the relatively innocent forming stage of Web 1.0 . Now that we are in the storming phase , we are plagued by mobs , trolls , and doxxing .
If we are to survive as a species , we must address our collective challenges and existential risks — from rogue A.I . to environmental disaster . To do so , we ’ re going to have to build the bridge from storming to norming . This norming phase may not involve feel-good utopianism , but it must involve deep negotiations and compromises between tribes , or alternatively , a peaceful geopolitical instantiation of the growing memetic divides .
These eight speculative proposals are meant as a launching pad for discussion . They are not proposals for government or corporate policy . Rather , they are ideas for readers to explore , small but meaningful steps to push against the overwhelming whirlwind of the culture war . It is our hope that interested minds and entrepreneurial spirits will take these proposals and advance them further .
The Hippocratic Oath was an oath that physicians were required to take before they began practicing medicine . Its modern iteration is a rite of passage for graduates of some medical schools . While today the oath is not a binding contract , there is a degree of ritualistic magic in formally committing to ideals . Could there be a Culture War equivalent to the Hippocratic Oath ? One that chieftains of the memetic tribes could affirm ? It would prove beneficial if journalists , authors , bloggers , and professors alike took this oath , but any social media user could take the oath , by pledging their name and accepting some sort of e-badge . Promises can be broken , but breaking public promises can generate swift social feedback .
What would this Oath consist of ? At the bare minimum : a commitment to good faith dialogue , the principle of charity , and intellectual humility . The last virtue is critical . A caveat of “ I could be wrong ” underlying strongly held beliefs helps even the most difficult conversations , a shared commitment to that caveat helps even more . If enough culture warriors take such an Oath , it could pave the way for a Geneva Convention of the Culture War .
It is increasingly hard for media outlets to approximate “ performative neutrality , ” thanks to the perverse incentives of outrage porn and the need to appease dwindling subscribers for survival . Is there a way to satisfy the collective hunger for “ unbiased news ” ? While we try to figure that out , cynicism spreads , as rightists increasingly find traditional media ’ s claims of neutrality laughable . Is there an alternative ?
We could all start by putting our skin in the game , by being honest about our biases and tribal affiliations . We could abandon the pretense to neutrality and more honestly engage with each other , knowing where we stand . Arguments could go to our philosophical foundations more quickly , instead of expending themselves on object-level disagreement .
We call this “ clean bias , ” an admission of an epistemic framework and value structure . It is in contrast to “ dirty bias , ” unspoken and denied framework and values while purporting universality . Thanks to the reality crisis , we are shedding our faith in universally imposed and agreed-upon truths . Clean bias is a necessary part of a new peace in our fractured reality . A first step could be for memetic creators , from journalists to bloggers , to commit to including their foundational presumptions in their bios .
Debate is broken . Nobody actually likes “ gotcha interviews ” or debates plagued with strawmanning , question-begging , bad faith , and side-stepping . Debate needs to be rebuilt . We suggest that debate currently tries to inhabit two contradictory roles . On the one hand , it is a source of entertainment through combat ; On the other , it is an avenue for improved understanding and wisdom . We propose that these two roles should be formally separated into distinct types of debates : Sport Debates and Sensemaking Debates .
In Sport Debates , participants debate for combat and entertainment . This would gamify the desire to engage in verbal combat for its own sake , with truth as a potential byproduct . They could be viewed as the UFC of the mind . While it may seem cynical to sponsor an avenue for the fiery and often toxic form debates can take , we think that diverting those urges away from sensemaking desires is a good harm-reduction strategy .
In Sensemaking Debates , participants debate for understanding and exploration . This would allow the purported values of debate to actually flourish . This can also include philosophical sandboxing , the adoption of ideologies as a method actor . Spaces could be made where participants take on ideological roles so as to better understand them , and to develop the skill to take them off .
David Brin ’ s idea of “ Disputation Arenas ” and William MacAskill ’ s “ Anti-Debates ” can map over to the two types of debates , with Bryan Caplan ’ s “ Ideological Turing Test ” as another potential modality that falls somewhere between both types . Peter , the co-author of this white paper , has been experimenting with both of these debate modalities inside his Intellectual Explorers Club . He welcomes suggestions and participants .
Due to technological innovation , industries are being disrupted the world-over , from the sharing economy to AI developments . We suggest that it is time for philosophy to endure similar disruptions . In Disabling Professions , Ivan Illich argues that professionalization can have a damaging effect on society , as expert culture induces knowledge-distance , blindness , and reliance on experts by non-experts . While Illich ’ s focus was the medical establishment , this also applies to philosophy , which has been inaccessible to most non-professionals for decades . This has in turn led to a sense of philosophy ’ s irrelevance amongst non-academics .
But as practical philosopher Andrew Taggart points out , philosophy is much more than an academic discipline , it is as a way of life : “ Philosophy is not theoretical discourse but a way of being . Philosophical discourse , accordingly , appears only when necessary and is always put in the service of leading a certain kind of life. ” Indeed , we are seeing the beginnings of a reclaiming of philosophy as a way of life in the new popularity of the longform podcast and of philosophies of virtue , such as Stoicism .
Our hope is that with these and other disruptions to the philosophical status quo , people will gain the tools to think critically and avoid being drawn into convenient and prepackaged worldviews . Philosophy could be a guard against the pressure to join an existing memetic tribe . R.J. Hollingdale ’ s aphorism may come to fruition : “ If we thought more for ourselves we would have very many more bad books and very many more good ones . ”
A new role might be required in the Culture War , that of the Memetic Mediator . This mediator would be a pan-tribalist participant who has the ability to communicate across tribes in a way that seems fair and reasonable to each tribe . They would have the mental agility , empathy , and wisdom needed to shift between a multitude of perspectives .
Memetic mediators could be called in for memetic battles where both participants prefer peace to continued civil decay , but can not come to an accord without facilitation . These mediators would require a multitude of tools at their disposal . They would need to be fluent in multiple tribal paradigms and give the impression of fairness . And because each tribe has their own method and claims to truth , Memetic Mediators would have to be skilled at finding any common ground and building from it .
As we do not have an existing example to point to , we can only speculate that the role will emerge out of necessity in the coming war . They could even emerge as consultants for social media companies .
Venkatesh Rao has introduced the term “ grey pilling , ” which he views as the third pill in the blue-red pill dichotomy . Blue pills are unquestioned consensus realities we are socialized into . A red pill , as Venkatesh puts it , is :
a dose of information that awakens you to the existence of a world beyond the one you are unconsciously immersed in , like a fish being taken out of water . Red-pill moments sensitize you to the previously invisible boundaries and structural lies of the world you knew , and make you alive to astounding possibilities beyond it .
A grey pill , according to Venkatesh , is the process of “ relearning the value of questioning and doubt after you ’ ve been seduced by answers and certainties ; it ’ s leaving comforting ‘ secret ’ societies for continued intellectual growth. ” Grey pills can engender an existential crisis , but at the right dose they can provide a confident unknowing and a sexy uncertainty , what Stephen Fry calls “ passionate and positive doubt. ” In a world of tyrannical certainty , grey pilling may be an ethical act .
In 1964 , Ken Kesey , smitten with the experience that LSD provided him , drove around the country with his Merry Band of Pranksters and offered “ acid tests ” to anyone they could find with the intent to open minds and transform the consciousness of society . Some may argue that they were successful in doing so , as his adventures chronicled in Tom Wolfe ’ s book The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test are credited with giving birth to the hippie movement . What if we grey-pilled the way Kesey acid-tested ?
This would be the return of Socrates , the original gadfly , who grey-pilled anyone who dared to converse with him . The method of the Street Epistemologists are instructive and may be repurposed for this proposal . Their conversational method of innocently starting dialog is well-structured , but instead of atheists inquiring into the epistemic methodology of their “ irrational ” interlocutors , performative agnostics could inquire with the intention to get mutually , philosophically lost . This may be our most dangerous , and most fun , speculation .
Management theorist Robert Katz made a distinction between three critical skills for professional success : technical skills , conceptual skills , and human skills . Technical skills are practical skill-sets that can be mastered . Conceptual skills are effective ways of thinking about complex problems . And human skills can be understood as the ability to connect with what is “ human ” about another person . While the “ marketing mentality ” invokes the need for social skills , which are instrumental towards salesmanship or leadership persuasion , “ human skills ” invokes the framework of authentic relationships with other humans . It has the potential to lend itself to a non-instrumental view of relationships . In Buberian terms , this is a movement from an I-It way of relating to one of I-Thou .
The Authentic Relating and Circling Movement aims to cultivate WE Spaces , which are intersubjective I-Thou spaces where collective consciousness can emerge . For individuals concerned by their own culpability in the Culture War , these spaces give an opportunity to develop Human Skills . We speculate that if one becomes skilled at relating to another for its own sake , across tribal affiliation , it may allow people to bypass tribalistic affinities and a Protean Tribalism to emerge . One ’ s tribe would be fluid and context-based , in contrast to the increasingly rigid identities we currently find comfort in .
The Culture War is a vicious cycle — those who suffer from it feel they have to perpetuate it . Initiating conversations about alternatives can be the start of a positive feedback loop . Individuals looking to improve the atmosphere in their communities could initiate workshops to that end .
A promising example to this end is the OpenMind platform . As per its website , “ OpenMind is a psychology-based educational platform designed to depolarize campuses , companies , organizations , and communities . OpenMind helps people foster intellectual humility and mutual understanding , while equipping them with the essential cognitive skills to engage constructively across differences. ” A combination of online program and workshop , OpenMind is one avenue to develop viewpoint diversity and diffuse political tensions in relationships . Any organized , good faith approach to repairing fraying communities is likely to have a positive effect .","Below are some further comments and our speculations on how the tribes will evolve in Culture War 2.0.

SJA

While this tribe engages in full-out war with other tribes, they continue to make gains in legacy media, corporate HR and PR departments, and government institutions. With increased embeddedness of SJA values in institutions and corporations, expect a right-wing countervailing response. Also watch for a fight to define leftism against class-first analysis.

Black Lives Matter

This tribe has made a large impact on the cultural landscape, but has not yet made an impact on government policy. Watch for potential conflicts with masculinist black nationalists and the “leaving the plantation” narrative of Candace Owens. Also, keep a look-out for BLM to distance themselves from white allies capitalizing on wokeness.

#MeToo

Perhaps the fastest growing tribe in recent times, it has moved quickly to redefine the social consensus. Watch for further revelations concerning men in power, followed by more conservative and reactionary backlash.

Gender-Critical Feminists

The feminists left behind by trans-inclusive feminists are fighting an uphill battle inside the left. Watch for future mixing with non-left tribes, and more offline culture war.

Modern Neo-Marxists

Neo-Marxists, while still alive and well in a critical capacity on college campuses, have lost significance since the fall of the Soviet Union. Communism is seen across the political spectrum as discredited. However, given the rising popularity of Democratic Socialists, the memes that Marx birthed could see a revival. If Neo-Marxists can offer a compelling narrative and escape the capitulation and nihilism of Accelerationist thought, they might be able to piggy-back on the DSA’s popularity. Watch for Douglas Lain’s Zero Books imprint to capitalize on this opportunity.

Antifa

Even without identifiable chieftains, Antifa has played an important part in the culture war and continues to benefit from people’s fear of Trump and dissatisfaction with mainstream responses. Watch for the normalization of a violent offline culture war.

Occupy

The tribe that coalesced around radical leftism, hope, and physical presence has been shattered. Dormant, it lives on in the 99% meme and in the pages of Adbusters.

DSA and Dirtbag Left

The drama of the Bernie campaign and dissatisfaction with the lack of leftism in the Democratic Party has led to a surge in a radical wing of the American left. The ironic fringe still rests at the top of the podcasts, and the push for mainstreaming socialism has been growing ever since Trump’s election. Watch for further infighting with Social Justice Activists.

Optimists

In reaction to the polarization and catastrophizing they see on both the left and right, this nascent tribe has coalesced around the idea that the world is in fact improving, and whatever challenges society faces can be solved through the institutions and values we currently hold. Watch for an increased presence as neoliberalism converts libertarians and shifts to be embraced as a contrarian ideology.

Establishment Left and Right

The zeitgeist of our times gives the palpable sense that the establishment left and right are dramatically on the decline, especially amongst millennials and Generation Z. Those in power within the establishment are experiencing increased pressure from rapidly rising elements within their parties. Democratic and liberal parties worldwide are contending with socialist and far-left elements. Conservative parties have seen populists and illiberal democrats take over. And everyone, everywhere, has been blindsided by the rise of white identitarian and nationalist elements. Watch for these tribes to make a last grasp at power during the 2020 elections.

New Atheists and Street Epistemologists

The atheist tribes are indirect participants in the culture war. Their shared objective is to attack the religious truth-claims and to plant doubt in the epistemic methodology of believers. The New Atheists lost the relevance they had during the Bush Era when the “Four Horsemen” had great popularity, but their impact has been felt in the noosphere. They contributed to the religious right’s defeat in Culture War 1.0 by weakening it on philosophical grounds. The Street Epistemologists are the New Atheists’ potential successor in Culture War 2.0.

Rationalist Diaspora

Incubated on Overcoming Bias and LessWrong, this is an observer tribe in the culture war. Though similar to the New Atheists in that they prize rationality, they do not define themselves in opposition to religion. Thanks to the strength of Eliezer Yudkowsky and Scott Alexander’s writing, and the beliefs and epistemic virtues of the diaspora, they command increasing respect in the culture war. Watch for a popularity boost to Effective Altruism, a struggle with the downsides of increased attention, and possible pressure from the SJAs for the Rationalists to commit to progressive values.

Post-Rationalists

This is another observer tribe, and possibly the most interesting one. If the rationalist motto is “the map is not the territory, but it is important to create the most accurate map possible,” then the post-rationalist motto is “the canvas is not the territory, but it is important to create the most interesting canvas possible.” This observer tribe has the potential to generate innovative solutions to the seemingly intractable problem of the differend.

Integral Theorists

Ken Wilber, who lost some momentum in his “Wyatt Earp” incident, is steadily gaining a strong following amongst cultural influencers. Like the Rationalists and Post-Rationalists, Integralists are an observer tribe. Unlike them, they have a teleological narrative that instills existential hope. This will be a tribe to watch if it moves away from its observer capacity and becomes more active in the war.

Sorters and Intellectual Dark Web

Jordan Peterson is the common denominator of these two tribes. One of the most important figures in Culture War 2.0, his central message emphasizes free speech and the importance of truth-speaking. His following of mostly young men, which we dub the Sorters, are attracted to Peterson’s style and message of personal responsibility. The “Intellectual Dark Web,” coined by Eric Weinstein, consists of thinkers who have experienced what they view as thought-policing by politically correct elements of the left. With the ever-increasing popularity of Peterson’s brand and related platforms such as Quillette, the Rubin Report, and the Joe Rogan Experience, watch for both of these tribes to gain members and make a strong push for a return to a classically liberal center in our culture.

Benedictines

With a religious right increasingly subservient to Trump, it is becoming incumbent for Christians who put faith first to organize collectively. This memetic tribe is aware of its own mortality and is putting survival before the culture war. Watch for a siphoning of disillusioned Christians and rightists.

Christian Right

The religious right is quickly transitioning into a nationalist right. The culture war goals of the Moral Majority have largely been set aside in favor of punishing the left via Trump. Unless there is a public evangelist revival, watch for this tribe to dissolve into Trumpists and Benedictines over the next few years.

Tea Party

Since its decline following the 2013 government shutdown, this tribe has largely been subsumed by the Trumpists. Watch for a continued decline in libertarian activism as believers drift towards Trump or neoliberalism.

Trumpists

This new tribe makes up for a lack of experience and policy through power and “high energy.” They are engaged in a fight for control over the mainstream perception of conservatism with a blindsided establishment right. Watch for a push for votes from racial minorities and a scramble to stay in line with Trump’s thought.

Infowarriors and QAnoners

These are the conspiracy theory tribes of the culture war. Alex Jones and Infowars represent “established” conspiracies such as the New World Order and Illuminati. With his manic energy, Jones has successfully turned conspiracy into a profitable business. QAnon is a grassroots emergence of conspiracy theories originating on /pol/. Given the intense passion their reality tunnel engenders, we speculate that QAnon will grow amongst Trumpists and will be censored on social media platforms, which will only further fuel its growth.

Alt-Lite, Alt-Right, and Modern Neo-Nazis

These three tribes are concerned with issues surrounding white people and are often lumped together by the mainstream media, but they are actively fighting amongst themselves (“punching right”) in order to create distance and avoid conflation. The Alt-Lite would be quick to point out that they are less defined by white identity and more by western chauvinism, an unapologetic view that western culture is the best. Watch for massive fluctuations and changes in the composition of all three, and a continued fight amongst themselves to gain adherents.

Neoreactionaries

This semi-dormant tribe has partly been subsumed into the Alt-Right. Lack of public direction from its key figures has led to a decline in influence. Watch for Nick Land’s return to the blogosphere and keep an eye on Social Matter and the Hestia Society for a potential revival.

MRA, Manosphere, MGTOW

Like the dissident right tribes, these masculine tribes are usually lumped together. Like the far-right tribes, these masculinist tribes also signal to create distance from each other. The Manosphere, the largest of the three tribes, reached its peak around Gamergate and has lost momentum due to its lack of a non-hedonistic strategy, and due to men’s attention being divided by the competing message of Jordan Peterson. See a continued declined with these three groups, unless new voices emerge.

Incels

These self-described involuntary celibates could be placed in the masculinist cluster if not for their view of themselves as having been “black-pilled” instead of “red-pilled.” They agree with most of the descriptive views of the masculinist tribes, but see their situation as radically hopeless and unfair. The more extreme adherents have a belief space that shares more with terrorist groups like ISIS than any of the memetic tribes listed above. Copycat attacks mimicking Elliot Rodger and Alek Minassian might grow in number unless a memeplex emerges that can inspire and provide meaning to sexually unsuccessful males in society.

Speculative Proposals

We conclude this white paper by offering speculative proposals that are not meant to treat the culture war as a solvable problem, but as an opportunity for personal and collective growth.

We view the noosphere as an emergent phenomenon, a consequence of globalization and digitalization. When Pierre Teilhard de Chardin introduced the term, he adopted a teleological perspective and saw the collective consciousness of humanity developing towards an “Omega Point.” While we are agnostic about whether there is an endpoint, we do think that looking at the noosphere as being in the process of evolution can help with regards to making speculative proposals. In this section we shift our focus from seeing memetic tribes as individual entities to viewing them as fragments of the larger noosphere.

Bruce Tuckman, a psychology researcher in group dynamics, established his famous “stages of group development” model in 1965. He believed that there were four necessary stages that newly formed groups need to progress through in order to tackle their shared challenges. The first stage is forming, when a team first comes together and individuals, mainly focused on themselves, operate with a degree of politeness. The second stage is storming, when comfort within the group allows for conflicting opinions to be voiced. Team members may wrestle for control of the group’s values and goals. The third stage is norming, when “resolved disagreements and personality clashes result in greater intimacy, and a spirit of cooperation emerges.” The fourth stage is performing, where, with “group norms and roles established, group members focus on achieving common goals, often reaching an unexpectedly high level of success.”

Not all groups are successful. Some abort during the storming phase — and if we apply this model to the noosphere, we see that all the memetic tribes are in the midst of it. The emergent collective consciousness of the internet began as the relatively innocent forming stage of Web 1.0. Now that we are in the storming phase, we are plagued by mobs, trolls, and doxxing.

If we are to survive as a species, we must address our collective challenges and existential risks — from rogue A.I. to environmental disaster. To do so, we’re going to have to build the bridge from storming to norming. This norming phase may not involve feel-good utopianism, but it must involve deep negotiations and compromises between tribes, or alternatively, a peaceful geopolitical instantiation of the growing memetic divides.

These eight speculative proposals are meant as a launching pad for discussion. They are not proposals for government or corporate policy. Rather, they are ideas for readers to explore, small but meaningful steps to push against the overwhelming whirlwind of the culture war. It is our hope that interested minds and entrepreneurial spirits will take these proposals and advance them further.

Hippocratic Oath of the Cultural War

The Hippocratic Oath was an oath that physicians were required to take before they began practicing medicine. Its modern iteration is a rite of passage for graduates of some medical schools. While today the oath is not a binding contract, there is a degree of ritualistic magic in formally committing to ideals. Could there be a Culture War equivalent to the Hippocratic Oath? One that chieftains of the memetic tribes could affirm? It would prove beneficial if journalists, authors, bloggers, and professors alike took this oath, but any social media user could take the oath, by pledging their name and accepting some sort of e-badge. Promises can be broken, but breaking public promises can generate swift social feedback.

What would this Oath consist of? At the bare minimum: a commitment to good faith dialogue, the principle of charity, and intellectual humility. The last virtue is critical. A caveat of “I could be wrong” underlying strongly held beliefs helps even the most difficult conversations, a shared commitment to that caveat helps even more. If enough culture warriors take such an Oath, it could pave the way for a Geneva Convention of the Culture War.

Dirty Bias to Clean Bias

It is increasingly hard for media outlets to approximate “performative neutrality,” thanks to the perverse incentives of outrage porn and the need to appease dwindling subscribers for survival. Is there a way to satisfy the collective hunger for “unbiased news”? While we try to figure that out, cynicism spreads, as rightists increasingly find traditional media’s claims of neutrality laughable. Is there an alternative?

We could all start by putting our skin in the game, by being honest about our biases and tribal affiliations. We could abandon the pretense to neutrality and more honestly engage with each other, knowing where we stand. Arguments could go to our philosophical foundations more quickly, instead of expending themselves on object-level disagreement.

We call this “clean bias,” an admission of an epistemic framework and value structure. It is in contrast to “dirty bias,” unspoken and denied framework and values while purporting universality. Thanks to the reality crisis, we are shedding our faith in universally imposed and agreed-upon truths. Clean bias is a necessary part of a new peace in our fractured reality. A first step could be for memetic creators, from journalists to bloggers, to commit to including their foundational presumptions in their bios.

Reinventing Debate

Debate is broken. Nobody actually likes “gotcha interviews” or debates plagued with strawmanning, question-begging, bad faith, and side-stepping. Debate needs to be rebuilt. We suggest that debate currently tries to inhabit two contradictory roles. On the one hand, it is a source of entertainment through combat; On the other, it is an avenue for improved understanding and wisdom. We propose that these two roles should be formally separated into distinct types of debates: Sport Debates and Sensemaking Debates.

In Sport Debates, participants debate for combat and entertainment. This would gamify the desire to engage in verbal combat for its own sake, with truth as a potential byproduct. They could be viewed as the UFC of the mind. While it may seem cynical to sponsor an avenue for the fiery and often toxic form debates can take, we think that diverting those urges away from sensemaking desires is a good harm-reduction strategy.

In Sensemaking Debates, participants debate for understanding and exploration. This would allow the purported values of debate to actually flourish. This can also include philosophical sandboxing, the adoption of ideologies as a method actor. Spaces could be made where participants take on ideological roles so as to better understand them, and to develop the skill to take them off.

David Brin’s idea of “Disputation Arenas” and William MacAskill’s “Anti-Debates” can map over to the two types of debates, with Bryan Caplan’s “Ideological Turing Test” as another potential modality that falls somewhere between both types. Peter, the co-author of this white paper, has been experimenting with both of these debate modalities inside his Intellectual Explorers Club. He welcomes suggestions and participants.

Disrupting and Emancipating Philosophy

Due to technological innovation, industries are being disrupted the world-over, from the sharing economy to AI developments. We suggest that it is time for philosophy to endure similar disruptions. In Disabling Professions, Ivan Illich argues that professionalization can have a damaging effect on society, as expert culture induces knowledge-distance, blindness, and reliance on experts by non-experts. While Illich’s focus was the medical establishment, this also applies to philosophy, which has been inaccessible to most non-professionals for decades. This has in turn led to a sense of philosophy’s irrelevance amongst non-academics.

But as practical philosopher Andrew Taggart points out, philosophy is much more than an academic discipline, it is as a way of life: “Philosophy is not theoretical discourse but a way of being. Philosophical discourse, accordingly, appears only when necessary and is always put in the service of leading a certain kind of life.” Indeed, we are seeing the beginnings of a reclaiming of philosophy as a way of life in the new popularity of the longform podcast and of philosophies of virtue, such as Stoicism.

Our hope is that with these and other disruptions to the philosophical status quo, people will gain the tools to think critically and avoid being drawn into convenient and prepackaged worldviews. Philosophy could be a guard against the pressure to join an existing memetic tribe. R.J. Hollingdale’s aphorism may come to fruition: “If we thought more for ourselves we would have very many more bad books and very many more good ones.”

Memetic Mediators

A new role might be required in the Culture War, that of the Memetic Mediator. This mediator would be a pan-tribalist participant who has the ability to communicate across tribes in a way that seems fair and reasonable to each tribe. They would have the mental agility, empathy, and wisdom needed to shift between a multitude of perspectives.

Memetic mediators could be called in for memetic battles where both participants prefer peace to continued civil decay, but cannot come to an accord without facilitation. These mediators would require a multitude of tools at their disposal. They would need to be fluent in multiple tribal paradigms and give the impression of fairness. And because each tribe has their own method and claims to truth, Memetic Mediators would have to be skilled at finding any common ground and building from it.

As we do not have an existing example to point to, we can only speculate that the role will emerge out of necessity in the coming war. They could even emerge as consultants for social media companies.

Grey Pills as Acid Tests

Venkatesh Rao has introduced the term “grey pilling,” which he views as the third pill in the blue-red pill dichotomy. Blue pills are unquestioned consensus realities we are socialized into. A red pill, as Venkatesh puts it, is:

a dose of information that awakens you to the existence of a world beyond the one you are unconsciously immersed in, like a fish being taken out of water. Red-pill moments sensitize you to the previously invisible boundaries and structural lies of the world you knew, and make you alive to astounding possibilities beyond it.

A grey pill, according to Venkatesh, is the process of “relearning the value of questioning and doubt after you’ve been seduced by answers and certainties; it’s leaving comforting ‘secret’ societies for continued intellectual growth.” Grey pills can engender an existential crisis, but at the right dose they can provide a confident unknowing and a sexy uncertainty, what Stephen Fry calls “passionate and positive doubt.” In a world of tyrannical certainty, grey pilling may be an ethical act.

In 1964, Ken Kesey, smitten with the experience that LSD provided him, drove around the country with his Merry Band of Pranksters and offered “acid tests” to anyone they could find with the intent to open minds and transform the consciousness of society. Some may argue that they were successful in doing so, as his adventures chronicled in Tom Wolfe’s book The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test are credited with giving birth to the hippie movement. What if we grey-pilled the way Kesey acid-tested?

This would be the return of Socrates, the original gadfly, who grey-pilled anyone who dared to converse with him. The method of the Street Epistemologists are instructive and may be repurposed for this proposal. Their conversational method of innocently starting dialog is well-structured, but instead of atheists inquiring into the epistemic methodology of their “irrational” interlocutors, performative agnostics could inquire with the intention to get mutually, philosophically lost. This may be our most dangerous, and most fun, speculation.

Human Skills to Protean Tribalism

Management theorist Robert Katz made a distinction between three critical skills for professional success: technical skills, conceptual skills, and human skills. Technical skills are practical skill-sets that can be mastered. Conceptual skills are effective ways of thinking about complex problems. And human skills can be understood as the ability to connect with what is “human” about another person. While the “marketing mentality” invokes the need for social skills, which are instrumental towards salesmanship or leadership persuasion, “human skills” invokes the framework of authentic relationships with other humans. It has the potential to lend itself to a non-instrumental view of relationships. In Buberian terms, this is a movement from an I-It way of relating to one of I-Thou.

The Authentic Relating and Circling Movement aims to cultivate WE Spaces, which are intersubjective I-Thou spaces where collective consciousness can emerge. For individuals concerned by their own culpability in the Culture War, these spaces give an opportunity to develop Human Skills. We speculate that if one becomes skilled at relating to another for its own sake, across tribal affiliation, it may allow people to bypass tribalistic affinities and a Protean Tribalism to emerge. One’s tribe would be fluid and context-based, in contrast to the increasingly rigid identities we currently find comfort in.

Workshops for Depolarization

The Culture War is a vicious cycle — those who suffer from it feel they have to perpetuate it. Initiating conversations about alternatives can be the start of a positive feedback loop. Individuals looking to improve the atmosphere in their communities could initiate workshops to that end.

A promising example to this end is the OpenMind platform. As per its website, “OpenMind is a psychology-based educational platform designed to depolarize campuses, companies, organizations, and communities. OpenMind helps people foster intellectual humility and mutual understanding, while equipping them with the essential cognitive skills to engage constructively across differences.” A combination of online program and workshop, OpenMind is one avenue to develop viewpoint diversity and diffuse political tensions in relationships. Any organized, good faith approach to repairing fraying communities is likely to have a positive effect.",www.medium.com,center,nRDrjWWaV9hN1QZe

While some harsh tech coverage was warranted , he said , “ there has been kind of an influx of takedowns . ”
At another point in the discussion , multiple sources tell ███ that Figs co-founder and co-CEO Trina Spear said she didn ’ t understand what gave the reporters the right to investigate private companies . Instead , she suggested the “ markets ” should decide .
Spear denied saying this in a statement given to ███ . “ This quote is inaccurate and is being falsely attributed to me . I did not make this statement nor do I agree with its sentiments. ” Spear did not respond to follow-up questions .
To many tech executives and investors , this was cancel culture going too far
The Clubhouse discussion was sparked by a tweet from New York Times journalist Taylor Lorenz regarding the CEO of the luggage company Away . The executive , Steph Korey , had been railing against the media on Instagram . Lorenz posted screenshots of the tirade , writing , “ Steph Korey , the disgraced former CEO of Away luggage company , is ranting on IG stories about the media . Her posts are incoherent and it ’ s disappointing to see a woman who ran a luggage brand perpetuate falsehoods like this abt an industry she clearly has 0 understanding of . ”
The post exploded on Twitter , prompting a wave of harassment from venture capitalists and other tech executives who felt Lorenz was being unfair . A “ cancel Taylor Lorenz ” Twitter account popped up , and a parody website resurfaced . “ Every CEO , founder , investor , and engineer in tech sees the vitriolic tweets these employees of media corporations put out , ” wrote Balaji Srinivasan , an angel investor who previously worked at Andreessen Horowitz . “ Then they turn around and feign neutrality by writing passive voice articles . We get it : you hate us . And you ’ re competitors . ”
Investors had been defending Korey since December 2019 , when ███ published a series of investigative articles detailing employee complaints about the CEO ’ s management style . The articles , which drew wide attention , were followed by a fresh wave of reports about working conditions at venture-backed startups like Outdoor Voices , Bird , and The Wing .
“ Overall , it seems like cancel culture has become this really easy thing to deflect to . ”
To many tech executives and investors , this was cancel culture going too far . “ 100 % of companies could have a negative article written about them , and without any fishing at all . All the reporter has to do is decide he wants to write a negative article , ” tweeted venture capitalist Paul Graham after the first Away report was published .
Away employees felt Korey ’ s defenders were missing the point . “ Overall , it seems like cancel culture has become this really easy thing to deflect to , instead of needing to say there ’ s a solid issue here I need to pay attention to , ” says a current member of Away ’ s leadership team . “ The default has become ‘ this is a hit piece , this is a snarky journalist trying to get clicks. ’ I think there ’ s a genuine group of people who haven ’ t had the first hand experience that sources in these stories have had . ”
If the venture capitalists ’ rhetoric feels familiar , it ’ s because the tactics aren ’ t new . In 2014 , under the banner of “ ethics in games journalism , ” an online mob attacked outspoken women and progressive figures within the game industry for months . Eron Gjoni penned a vengeful screed about his ex , developer Zoe Quinn , in August 2014 , which Gamergate supporters used to create a narrative about the games media at large . In addition to doxxing and harassing Quinn , Gamergaters coordinated harassment against several other prominent women with vicious online attacks ; figures like Brianna Wu fled their homes out of concern for personal safety . Gamergaters also badgered advertisers in an effort to silence voices they disagreed with .
Despite Gamergaters ’ best efforts to push a narrative about paid-for coverage and collusion in the industry , no such corruption ever came to light . In the time since , the Gamergate crowd has shown little interest in actual ethical concerns in games , such as exploitative labor practices and sexual harassment and abuse perpetrated by powerful figures at the top .
This strategy has resurfaced elsewhere , marking the emergence of a culture war that has shaped the internet and even American politics . In Silicon Valley , harassers have latched on to “ ethics in journalism ” to legitimize their attacks and turn the conversation away from the larger issue : a conflict between tech workers and executives .
Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz — which invested $ 10 million in Clubhouse directly and bought up an additional $ 2 million of previous investors ’ shares — was early to tap the power of media to raise the profiles of its startups . “ Unlike established venture firms such as Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia , which let the press come to them , Andreessen Horowitz has gone on the offensive , pitching stories about its startups , leaking news to reporters , and planting itself right in the middle of the technology news churn , ” Bloomberg News wrote in 2014 .
The firm ’ s co-founder , Marc Andreessen , “ loves Twitter because ‘ reporters are obsessed with it . It ’ s like a tube and I have loudspeakers installed in every reporting cubicle around the world , ’ ” according to a May 2015 New Yorker profile .
But Silicon Valley ’ s relationship with the media began to change in October 2015 , when The Wall Street Journal published the first of a series of blockbuster stories that exposed high-flying blood-testing startup Theranos as a scam . The news embarrassed journalists who ’ d written glowing profiles of Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes and inspired a fresh generation of investigative reporting on the tech industry . Andreessen defended Holmes throughout , blocking Twitter users who questioned his remarks , though he hadn ’ t invested in the startup .
The sources of The Wall Street Journal ’ s reporting were current and former employees of Theranos . In the 2018 Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal , employees of that company also revealed that millions of users had their data harvested without consent , another turning point for how the media covered tech companies . In the past few years , story after story has been driven by employees and contractors at tech companies disillusioned by their working conditions and their products ’ effects on society .
“ What they ’ re trying to do is destabilize the ability to be critical about tech CEOs . ”
This shift posed something of a problem for founder-centric VCs . “ I think the Andreessen marching order , which is a great one , is to defend the founders at any cost , ” Upstream co-founder Alex Taub says . He adds that while it ’ s good for founders , it gets complicated when those people are accused of abuse or fraud .
Similarly , unquestioningly backing the founder while dismissing worker concerns isn ’ t good public relations , but refusing to stand by the founders could inhibit future investments . The answer , when it presented itself , was simple : go after the media instead .
“ There ’ s sort of this larger project going on where they are trying to transmute accountability for CEOs , and the rising worker movements with values they don ’ t agree [ with ] , into what they are going to reframe as part of the ‘ cancel culture ’ problem , because that ’ s the thing that has larger purchase , that there ’ s pushback on , ” one well-known tech CEO tells ███ . “ What they ’ re trying to do is destabilize the ability to be critical about tech CEOs . ”
“ I am convinced that most people in the tech world do not understand the role of a free media in a liberal society , ” Can Duruk , a product manager at Very Good Security , wrote in his newsletter , The Margins , in January . “ The media is not there to be your friend . It ’ s there to inform the public , and make you feel self-aware . ”
Andreessen Horowitz did not respond to a request for comment on this story .
The tension between tech journalism and venture capital was at the heart of the discussion that took place on Clubhouse on July 1st . In an hour-long audio clip obtained by ███ and first reported by Vice , some speakers painted CEOs as the victims and questioned why the industry needed journalists .
“ I believe in standing up for people who do not have a voice , who can not stand up for themselves , ” said Srinivasan when asked during the discussion about defending Steph Korey , the CEO of Away , who New York Times journalist Taylor Lorenz had tweeted about . On the recording , Felicia Horowitz , the founder of the Horowitz Family Foundation and wife of a16z founder Ben Horowitz , added : “ You can ’ t fucking hit somebody , attack them and just say , ‘ Hey , I have ovaries and therefore , you can ’ t fight back . ’ ”
“ The New York Times company is not the free press . ”
Srinivasan also pushed his belief that the industry needed to move away from professional journalists . “ The New York Times company is not the free press . You are the free press . You the citizen , ” he said . “ As citizens it ’ s your responsibility and mine to hold every institution accountable. ” Later , he added that the reason media companies won ’ t issue retractions is that “ their business model is literally marketing themselves as the truth ... They are not the truth , mathematics is the truth . ”
The next day , Srinivasan issued a $ 1,000 bounty ( to be paid in bitcoin ) for a retraction or correction to a February 13th Recode article about Silicon Valley ’ s early response to the coronavirus . The story , entitled “ ‘ No handshakes , please ’ : The tech industry is terrified of the coronavirus , ” opens with an anecdote : “ Andreessen Horowitz recently put up a sign on its door , cautioning eager startup founders and business partners who walk into its offices : ‘ Due to the Coronavirus , no Handshakes please . Thank you . ’ ”
The first sentence is supported by a photograph of the sign in question ; the rest of the piece is about the tech industry ’ s early response to the virus , which was substantially more aggressive than the state and federal response at the time . ( Recode , like ███ , is owned by Vox Media . )
Asked about these bounties and whether they lead to harassment , Srinivasan replied : “ Do you think attacking female founders for profit , till they get fired , constitutes harassment ? ” He then began tweeting about ███ ’ s coverage of Away , saying our strategy was to “ pretend cancel culture isn ’ t real ” and then to “ crash a company ’ s stock price , making everyone poorer , while pretending to care about employees. ” ( Away is not a publicly traded company . )
“ You ’ re making some boogeyman about journalists rather than talking about the real situation . ”
The tenor of the Clubhouse discussion didn ’ t sit well with some of the listeners . “ It felt fairly one-sided , ” says a woman who was listening to the call and requested anonymity because she currently works in tech and does not want to face retaliation . “ There were a couple people who ’ d worked in comms before and tried to even it out . But there wasn ’ t a lot of active dissent . And the moderators never asked for dissent to come forward . With a large audience you have to actively ask people . ”
An app builder who was listening in agreed . “ They ’ re all under the premise that running a company as CEO is very , very hard , sometimes stuff goes on . We should get a pass . You ’ re making some boogeyman about journalists rather than talking about the real situation . Or being held accountable . ”
After the main discussion died down , a group of younger tech workers moved to another room in Clubhouse ( a process called “ rerooming ” ) . There , they rehashed the debate — and why some had felt it was unproductive . “ It was mostly women talking , ” the app builder said . “ It almost became a therapy session talking about how painful the first discussion was made . ”
Clubhouse co-founder Paul Davison joined and asked the group for feedback on how the app could make discussions more productive or inclusive . The talk then shifted to a product feedback session , where people brought up the need for more moderation .
A spokesperson for Clubhouse declined to comment for this story .
A preview of the tech industry ’ s animosity toward the Times occurred on Twitter the week before the Lorenz kerfuffle erupted , when Scott Alexander — a pseudonym — deleted his blog , SlateStarCodex , which centered on rationalist thought . In a final post , Alexander claimed The New York Times was going to “ dox ” him by revealing his real name in an article — an article he believed couldn ’ t be written if the blog was taken down .

After all , workers wouldn ’ t have to leak their stories to the media if companies responded to their concerns .","On July 1st, a group of venture capitalists and well-known tech elites logged on to the invite-only social platform Clubhouse to discuss a pressing issue in Silicon Valley: journalists canceling CEOs. “When it comes to our industry, specifically how the tech industry is covered, there’s a really, really toxic dynamic that exists right now,” said Nait Jones, a venture capitalist at Andreessen Horowitz. While some harsh tech coverage was warranted, he said, “there has been kind of an influx of takedowns.”

At another point in the discussion, multiple sources tell The Verge that Figs co-founder and co-CEO Trina Spear said she didn’t understand what gave the reporters the right to investigate private companies. Instead, she suggested the “markets” should decide.

Spear denied saying this in a statement given to The Verge. “This quote is inaccurate and is being falsely attributed to me. I did not make this statement nor do I agree with its sentiments.” Spear did not respond to follow-up questions.

To many tech executives and investors, this was cancel culture going too far

The Clubhouse discussion was sparked by a tweet from New York Times journalist Taylor Lorenz regarding the CEO of the luggage company Away. The executive, Steph Korey, had been railing against the media on Instagram. Lorenz posted screenshots of the tirade, writing, “Steph Korey, the disgraced former CEO of Away luggage company, is ranting on IG stories about the media. Her posts are incoherent and it’s disappointing to see a woman who ran a luggage brand perpetuate falsehoods like this abt an industry she clearly has 0 understanding of.”

The post exploded on Twitter, prompting a wave of harassment from venture capitalists and other tech executives who felt Lorenz was being unfair. A “cancel Taylor Lorenz” Twitter account popped up, and a parody website resurfaced. “Every CEO, founder, investor, and engineer in tech sees the vitriolic tweets these employees of media corporations put out,” wrote Balaji Srinivasan, an angel investor who previously worked at Andreessen Horowitz. “Then they turn around and feign neutrality by writing passive voice articles. We get it: you hate us. And you’re competitors.”

Investors had been defending Korey since December 2019, when The Verge published a series of investigative articles detailing employee complaints about the CEO’s management style. The articles, which drew wide attention, were followed by a fresh wave of reports about working conditions at venture-backed startups like Outdoor Voices, Bird, and The Wing.

“Overall, it seems like cancel culture has become this really easy thing to deflect to.”

To many tech executives and investors, this was cancel culture going too far. “100% of companies could have a negative article written about them, and without any fishing at all. All the reporter has to do is decide he wants to write a negative article,” tweeted venture capitalist Paul Graham after the first Away report was published.

Away employees felt Korey’s defenders were missing the point. “Overall, it seems like cancel culture has become this really easy thing to deflect to, instead of needing to say there’s a solid issue here I need to pay attention to,” says a current member of Away’s leadership team. “The default has become ‘this is a hit piece, this is a snarky journalist trying to get clicks.’ I think there’s a genuine group of people who haven’t had the first hand experience that sources in these stories have had.”

If the venture capitalists’ rhetoric feels familiar, it’s because the tactics aren’t new. In 2014, under the banner of “ethics in games journalism,” an online mob attacked outspoken women and progressive figures within the game industry for months. Eron Gjoni penned a vengeful screed about his ex, developer Zoe Quinn, in August 2014, which Gamergate supporters used to create a narrative about the games media at large. In addition to doxxing and harassing Quinn, Gamergaters coordinated harassment against several other prominent women with vicious online attacks; figures like Brianna Wu fled their homes out of concern for personal safety. Gamergaters also badgered advertisers in an effort to silence voices they disagreed with.

Despite Gamergaters’ best efforts to push a narrative about paid-for coverage and collusion in the industry, no such corruption ever came to light. In the time since, the Gamergate crowd has shown little interest in actual ethical concerns in games, such as exploitative labor practices and sexual harassment and abuse perpetrated by powerful figures at the top.

This strategy has resurfaced elsewhere, marking the emergence of a culture war that has shaped the internet and even American politics. In Silicon Valley, harassers have latched on to “ethics in journalism” to legitimize their attacks and turn the conversation away from the larger issue: a conflict between tech workers and executives.

Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz — which invested $10 million in Clubhouse directly and bought up an additional $2 million of previous investors’ shares — was early to tap the power of media to raise the profiles of its startups. “Unlike established venture firms such as Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia, which let the press come to them, Andreessen Horowitz has gone on the offensive, pitching stories about its startups, leaking news to reporters, and planting itself right in the middle of the technology news churn,” Bloomberg News wrote in 2014.

The firm’s co-founder, Marc Andreessen, “loves Twitter because ‘reporters are obsessed with it. It’s like a tube and I have loudspeakers installed in every reporting cubicle around the world,’” according to a May 2015 New Yorker profile.

But Silicon Valley’s relationship with the media began to change in October 2015, when The Wall Street Journal published the first of a series of blockbuster stories that exposed high-flying blood-testing startup Theranos as a scam. The news embarrassed journalists who’d written glowing profiles of Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes and inspired a fresh generation of investigative reporting on the tech industry. Andreessen defended Holmes throughout, blocking Twitter users who questioned his remarks, though he hadn’t invested in the startup.

The sources of The Wall Street Journal’s reporting were current and former employees of Theranos. In the 2018 Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal, employees of that company also revealed that millions of users had their data harvested without consent, another turning point for how the media covered tech companies. In the past few years, story after story has been driven by employees and contractors at tech companies disillusioned by their working conditions and their products’ effects on society.

“What they’re trying to do is destabilize the ability to be critical about tech CEOs.”

This shift posed something of a problem for founder-centric VCs. “I think the Andreessen marching order, which is a great one, is to defend the founders at any cost,” Upstream co-founder Alex Taub says. He adds that while it’s good for founders, it gets complicated when those people are accused of abuse or fraud.

Similarly, unquestioningly backing the founder while dismissing worker concerns isn’t good public relations, but refusing to stand by the founders could inhibit future investments. The answer, when it presented itself, was simple: go after the media instead.

“There’s sort of this larger project going on where they are trying to transmute accountability for CEOs, and the rising worker movements with values they don’t agree [with], into what they are going to reframe as part of the ‘cancel culture’ problem, because that’s the thing that has larger purchase, that there’s pushback on,” one well-known tech CEO tells The Verge. “What they’re trying to do is destabilize the ability to be critical about tech CEOs.”

“I am convinced that most people in the tech world do not understand the role of a free media in a liberal society,” Can Duruk, a product manager at Very Good Security, wrote in his newsletter, The Margins, in January. “The media is not there to be your friend. It’s there to inform the public, and make you feel self-aware.”

Andreessen Horowitz did not respond to a request for comment on this story.

The tension between tech journalism and venture capital was at the heart of the discussion that took place on Clubhouse on July 1st. In an hour-long audio clip obtained by The Verge and first reported by Vice, some speakers painted CEOs as the victims and questioned why the industry needed journalists.

“I believe in standing up for people who do not have a voice, who cannot stand up for themselves,” said Srinivasan when asked during the discussion about defending Steph Korey, the CEO of Away, who New York Times journalist Taylor Lorenz had tweeted about. On the recording, Felicia Horowitz, the founder of the Horowitz Family Foundation and wife of a16z founder Ben Horowitz, added: “You can’t fucking hit somebody, attack them and just say, ‘Hey, I have ovaries and therefore, you can’t fight back.’”

“The New York Times company is not the free press.”

Srinivasan also pushed his belief that the industry needed to move away from professional journalists. “The New York Times company is not the free press. You are the free press. You the citizen,” he said. “As citizens it’s your responsibility and mine to hold every institution accountable.” Later, he added that the reason media companies won’t issue retractions is that “their business model is literally marketing themselves as the truth ... They are not the truth, mathematics is the truth.”

The next day, Srinivasan issued a $1,000 bounty (to be paid in bitcoin) for a retraction or correction to a February 13th Recode article about Silicon Valley’s early response to the coronavirus. The story, entitled “‘No handshakes, please’: The tech industry is terrified of the coronavirus,” opens with an anecdote: “Andreessen Horowitz recently put up a sign on its door, cautioning eager startup founders and business partners who walk into its offices: ‘Due to the Coronavirus, no Handshakes please. Thank you.’”

The first sentence is supported by a photograph of the sign in question; the rest of the piece is about the tech industry’s early response to the virus, which was substantially more aggressive than the state and federal response at the time. (Recode, like The Verge, is owned by Vox Media.)

Asked about these bounties and whether they lead to harassment, Srinivasan replied: “Do you think attacking female founders for profit, till they get fired, constitutes harassment?” He then began tweeting about The Verge’s coverage of Away, saying our strategy was to “pretend cancel culture isn’t real” and then to “crash a company’s stock price, making everyone poorer, while pretending to care about employees.” (Away is not a publicly traded company.)

“You’re making some boogeyman about journalists rather than talking about the real situation.”

The tenor of the Clubhouse discussion didn’t sit well with some of the listeners. “It felt fairly one-sided,” says a woman who was listening to the call and requested anonymity because she currently works in tech and does not want to face retaliation. “There were a couple people who’d worked in comms before and tried to even it out. But there wasn’t a lot of active dissent. And the moderators never asked for dissent to come forward. With a large audience you have to actively ask people.”

An app builder who was listening in agreed. “They’re all under the premise that running a company as CEO is very, very hard, sometimes stuff goes on. We should get a pass. You’re making some boogeyman about journalists rather than talking about the real situation. Or being held accountable.”

After the main discussion died down, a group of younger tech workers moved to another room in Clubhouse (a process called “rerooming”). There, they rehashed the debate — and why some had felt it was unproductive. “It was mostly women talking,” the app builder said. “It almost became a therapy session talking about how painful the first discussion was made.”

Clubhouse co-founder Paul Davison joined and asked the group for feedback on how the app could make discussions more productive or inclusive. The talk then shifted to a product feedback session, where people brought up the need for more moderation.

A spokesperson for Clubhouse declined to comment for this story.

A preview of the tech industry’s animosity toward the Times occurred on Twitter the week before the Lorenz kerfuffle erupted, when Scott Alexander — a pseudonym — deleted his blog, SlateStarCodex, which centered on rationalist thought. In a final post, Alexander claimed The New York Times was going to “dox” him by revealing his real name in an article — an article he believed couldn’t be written if the blog was taken down. He directed people to contact Times tech editor Pui-Wing Tam, who subsequently received thousands of emails and tweets, some of which were “toxic” in nature, a source familiar with Times’ reporting says. Srinivasan named the reporter on Twitter, who was subsequently harassed as well.

“Alexander, whose role has been to help explain Silicon Valley to itself, was taken up as a mascot and a martyr in a struggle against the Times, which, in the tweets of Srinivasan, Graham, and others, was enlisted as a proxy for all of the gatekeepers—the arbiters of what it is and is not O.K. to say, and who is allowed, by virtue of their identity, to say it,” wrote Gideon Lewis-Kraus in an article about the campaign in The New Yorker.

Ultimately, these efforts ran out of steam, as nothing about Alexander or SlateStarCodex has yet been published by The New York Times. The source familiar with the Times’ reporting says “not a word” of the SlateStarCodex story had been written when Alexander deleted his blog. But the tenor of the discussion had been set.

At the heart of the tech backlash to the media is a fear of getting “canceled” — a nebulous term that’s often used to refer to those who get called out online and may subsequently lose power in real life as a result. For investors and CEOs, the idea that one damning article can throw a whole company into turmoil is infuriating: it often feels like only part of the story is being told — and that part is often unflattering.

But hidden in the discussion is the fact that workers are also at risk of getting “canceled” — and they often have much more to lose. “We don’t have a lot of money or the name recognition that the founders and venture capitalists do,” says a former Away employee. They added that no CEO, male or female, should be able to treat workers poorly — a reference to the argument that male leaders aren’t held to the same standards. “It’s white feminism,” the employee adds. “[The CEO] got to where they were by playing the game and now they’re getting called out for mistreatment. So yes, for years men have been doing the same things. But what makes it okay for men to do this? That was the ‘girl boss’ promise. That women would do it better. But they didn’t.”

Now that the tech industry has grown to be a major cultural force, workers are wondering why they aren’t treated better

“Cancel culture” aside, it seems like there has been a major cultural change in both the tech industry and tech reporting. Ten years ago, tech employees were excited to do something that might change the world for the better. Now that the tech industry has grown to be a major cultural force, workers are wondering why they aren’t treated better. They want to know why their platforms require armies of moderators who frequently get PTSD. Or why their cloud platforms are being used by the military. Or why their facial recognition systems appear to be openly racist.

As a result, tech reporting has focused less on founders and CEOs and more on the hundreds of thousands of workers who power their businesses. For founders and CEOs, that means public calls for their accountability. Some of those are bound to appear on major media outlets.

As Marc Andreessen pointed out in that 2015 New Yorker profile, the future changes in ways one can’t necessarily predict. It is no longer 1999; a founder-focused culture has been the norm in Silicon Valley for at least a decade. This particular reckoning may erode media credibility among some members of the tech community. It’s also possible that founders and CEOs learn to listen to their employees before they go to the press. After all, workers wouldn’t have to leak their stories to the media if companies responded to their concerns.

Who knows? It might even be good business.

What’s happening

Over the past few weeks, Joe Biden has become the overwhelming frontrunner in the Democratic presidential race. His string of primary victories has been powered by support from voters across racial, economic and geographic groups. There’s one demographic, however, that has overwhelmingly thrown its support behind his opponent Bernie Sanders: young voters.

On Super Tuesday, Sanders received 58 percent of support from voters under 30 to Biden’s 17 percent. Despite winning Michigan's primary a week later by a substantial margin, Biden lost the youth vote in the state by 57 points. The dynamic flips with older voters, who overwhelmingly support Biden over Sanders.

This enormous divide between generations has worked in Biden’s favor in the primary because older voters have made up a much larger share of the electorate. Sanders has built much of his case on creating a wave of enthusiasm that compels millions of young people to vote for the first time. Biden has collected a commanding lead in the race in part because that boom in youth turnout hasn’t come to pass.

Why there’s debate

Biden can win the primary without young voters, but he’ll almost certainly need them to defeat Donald Trump in the general election. While it’s unlikely too many young Sanders supporters would flip to Trump, enough of them may stay home on Election Day to tip the scales. Younger voters are generally more liberal, antiestablishment and more likely to support sweeping changes to American democracy. Many of them may be turned off by Biden’s center-left policies and long history as a Washington insider. Biden has also made comments that have upset some young people. ""The younger generation now tells me how tough things are. Give me a break,” he said in 2018.

Others see reasons for optimism that Biden might overcome his poor performance with young voters by November. It’s possible his low numbers are more of a testament to Sanders’s popularity than a widespread dislike of the former vice president. In the likely event that Biden locks up the nomination, many young voters might still support him — perhaps grudgingly — when he’s the only alternative to Trump.

Some political analysts have suggested that Biden should make bold moves to appeal to younger voters, such as picking a young progressive as a running mate. Biden could also pivot his policy platform to the left by adopting some of Sanders’s policy proposals, many of which are broadly popular. More progressive positions on climate policy or student debt relief could increase Biden’s appeal with young voters without alienating his current moderate support. Sanders can also help, some suggest, by enthusiastically endorsing Biden’s bid once the two are no longer competing head-to-head.

What’s next

Biden has shown some early signs of a tack to the left since emerging as the likely nominee. He’s adopted a bankruptcy plan originally proposed by Elizabeth Warren, backed a policy to make public college free for some families and announced he would name a woman as his running mate. Whether these are the first steps in a larger shift to the left on policy — and whether they’ll be effective in courting young voters — remains to be seen.

Even Sanders has struggled to turn out young voters

Social distancing guidelines to prevent the spread of coronavirus have been in place in various forms across the U.S. for nearly two months .

What’s happening

Social distancing guidelines to prevent the spread of coronavirus have been in place in various forms across the U.S. for nearly two months. Such public health measures have led to the emergence of a new social phenomenon: harsh public criticism of people who are perceived as not following the rules.

While shaming has been a feature of online discourse for many years, it has become something of a national pastime since the early days of the outbreak. Whether it’s Gen Z-ers on spring break, baby boomers being chided by their children or celebrities spotted without masks, just about every demographic has been the target of public disapproval.

Social media platforms are filled with posts finger-pointing at so-called #Covidiots for behavior seen as violating safety rules. Some police departments have been flooded with calls about breaches of safety protocols.

Why there’s debate

The motivation behind distance shaming is pretty simple to understand. The coronavirus poses a threat to everyone, and safety measures like social distancing and masks are only effective if followed by society at large. Flouting these rules means making others less safe and can be perceived as an insult to those who have made major personal sacrifices for the greater good. Anyone who acts in that way deserves to be shamed, some argue.

Social pressure can be an effective way to get people who may not be convinced by health warnings to fall in line, experts say. Mitigation methods can be seen as a new form of social etiquette that needs to be enforced by the public to become fully engrained, some argue.

Others say shaming is counterproductive. Being publicly criticized can cause people to feel attacked and actually become more committed to their behavior. The impulse to shame others for minor indiscretions may be a way of exerting a measure of control at a time when so much is uncertain and trust in leaders is low. While it may be momentarily cathartic, shaming others is not a healthy form of self care.

Online shaming can be emotionally damaging, especially in small towns where everyone knows each other. Involving the police can be especially problematic because of an imbalance in how police enforce distancing guidelines in various neighborhoods.

Many instances of shaming are aimed at people who are in fact following health guidelines. Several viral photos that appeared to show packed beaches or parks were taken from angles that make them seem more crowded than they really were.

Shaming is helpful

Shaming forces people to consider their impact on others

“Shaming is most effective when it is addressing collective problems, meaning we are each a potential victim of that bad behavior. It’s hard to imagine a bigger and more collective problem than a global pandemic that’s killing people every day, all over the globe.” — Jennifer Jacquet, Gen

People might forgo risky behavior to avoid being shamed

“If the fear of getting infected isn’t powerful enough, the possibility of having your photo taken and shared publicly is one more reason to stay home — or resist the urge to buy all the toilet paper and cans of soup.” — Jennifer Brown, Colorado Sun

Shaming helps establish important social norms

“The judgement we are feeling when we are in public now, whether directed at others or ourselves, is nothing more than the necessary process of a new etiquette establishing itself. … While it can be intimidating, trying to navigate the new system of manners and protocols, it’s ultimately crucial to making social distancing work. So bring on the shame.” — Calum Marsh, National Post (Canada)

Shame can be effective when aimed at decision makers, not individuals

“Instead of posting a picture of a grocery store clerk without a mask, tweet at the company’s chief executive and urge him or her to make sure the employees are safe. Instead of railing at the kids on the beach, use social media to ask mayors and governors why the beaches are still open.” — Jennifer Weiner, New York Times
