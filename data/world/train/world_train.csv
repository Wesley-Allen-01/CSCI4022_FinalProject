On the same day that NATO warned of Russia moving combat troops into eastern Ukraine, Russia announced Wednesday that it will restart long-range bomber flights near the U.S. from the Caribbean to the Gulf of Mexico.

The muscle-flexing announcement by Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu came just after Russian President Vladimir Putin met with world leaders in China for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.

The strategic bombers, capable of carrying nuclear weapons, will also conduct flights along Russian borders and over the Arctic Ocean, Shoigu said.

""In the current situation, we have to maintain military presence in the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific, as well as the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico,"" he said. The flights will conduct ""reconnaissance missions to monitor foreign powers' military activities and maritime communications,"" he said.

A senior U.S. military official told the Associated Press that Russia never flew bomber patrols over the Gulf of Mexico, even during the Cold War.

The announcement came amid a spike in reports of Russian military violating NATO country borders and airspace, and a few hours after NATO's supreme allied commander, U.S. Gen. Phillip Breedlove, warned that Russia had sent artillery and men into eastern Ukraine.

""We have seen columns of Russian equipment, primarily Russian tanks, Russian artillery, Russian air defense systems and Russian combat troops entering into Ukraine,"" Breedlove said.

Similar statements were issued in recent days by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the White House and Ukrainian authorities, who say pro-Russian separatists appear on the verge of a new offensive that threatens communities between the Russian border and Ukraine's Crimea region, which Russia annexed in March.

Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, denied the assertions of sending troops into Ukraine as ""unfounded statements.""

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko warned this week that the town of Berdyansk is in particular danger.

The White House warned that Russian aggression would violate a cease-fire agreement signed Sept. 5 in Minsk, Belarus, by the separatist leaders, Putin and Poroshenko.

If Russia continues ""escalating the situation,"" it will experience continued economic disruption from U.S. and international sanctions, said Ben Rhodes, who is President Obama's deputy national security adviser.

In August, as Russian tanks and troops were rolling across Ukraine, Putin gave a warning of his own.

""I want to remind you that Russia is one of the most powerful nuclear nations,"" he said while visiting a youth camp near Moscow. ""This is a reality, not just words."" Russia, he said, is ""strengthening our nuclear deterrence forces.""

Special for USA TODAY

MALAGA, Spain — Spanish King Juan Carlos always said that he would die wearing his crown but he unexpectedly stepped down Monday in favor of his son Crown Prince Felipe, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced in a nationwide television broadcast.

The abdication 39 years after Juan Carlos ascended to the throne, a period when the king oversaw Spain's transition to democracy in the wake of the nation's notorious dictator Francisco Franco, comes as corruption scandals have dogged the royal family, and as the monarchy has seen renewed calls for its disbandment.

Juan Carlos, who turned 76 in January, said that he was handing power to Prince Felipe, 46, in order to ""open a new era of hope combining his acquired experience and the drive of a new generation."" Prince Felipe, the monarch's only son, is considered to be well-liked.

""Younger people with new energies (are required) to undertake the reforms that the present juncture demands of us,"" Juan Carlos said, speaking of his decision to abdicate. ""My son Felipe embodies stability,"" he said.

Some Spaniards said they had been waiting for it.

""This is part of an expected chronology (of events),"" said Alberto Garzon, a lawmaker in the Spanish parliament and author of the book The Third Republic — about a future Spain without a monarchy.

Juan Carlos has enjoyed high popularity for decades but in the past few years his approval ratings fell sharply after a series of personal blunders. He took an expensive African safari during the height of the euro crisis. His daughter, Princess Cristina, has been indicted for embezzlement and her husband stands accused of tax evasion and money laundering.

While other European monarchs have come under scrutiny for excessive spending, including the British royal family, none have so far come under pressure to abdicate. The Spanish king's relinquishing of power drew no immediate response from royal families across Europe on Monday.

Even though the debate as to whether he should step down has raged for some time, most Spaniards expressed astonishment at the announcement.

""I always thought he would die with his boots on,"" said Gabriel Camino, 36, from Barcelona.

""It was a surprise but this was a good moment (for his abdication) as there are no elections in sight because that would have made things more complicated,"" said Javier Tajadura, a professor of constitutional law at the University of the Basque Country.

However, his departure comes during a period of upheaval for Spanish politics. The results of the May 25 European Parliament elections left Spain's two major political parties battered. Smaller parties won seats for the first time and more than 2.9 million Spaniards voted for political parties expressly in favor of eliminating the Spanish monarchy.

""(Both big parties) are afraid of those results as they are the only parties in parliament that are truly in favor of the monarchy,"" said Garzon, the author. ""They didn't even get 20% of the total population and they see the writing on the wall.""

As soon as the abdication was announced, Podemos, Izquierda Unida and other smaller political parties and civic associations began demanding a referendum to decide whether to ditch the monarchy.

Thousands of people later demonstrated to abolish the monarchy. More than 5,000 people protested in Barcelona, and about 10,000 in Madrid. Smaller rallies were held elsewhere across the country.

Although Rajoy said he was ""convinced this is the best moment for change"" he also said ""the process will take place in a context of institutional stability.""

Still, even with some in favor of eliminating the monarchy it is not clear if that is likely to happen.

But the conversations tend to go a lot differently than many Americans might expect .
In the US , the common view is that Russians feel aggrieved by the loss of the Soviet Union and all the respect that came with being a global superpower . Russia 's acts of aggression in Europe , in this telling , are all about challenging the American-led order as a way to prove Russia 's might and importance . This aggression is wildly popular among Russians , many Americans believe , because it makes them feel patriotic and powerful to bully the West , and particularly the US , which they blame for Russia 's problems .
`` Russia took off its ideological blinders in 1991 , but America still seems to have them on ''
There is certainly truth to this , but it 's just a piece of the truth . Rather , when you speak to influential people across institutions and the political spectrum in Russia , as Amanda Taub and I did during a recent reporting trip there , the story you hear over and over is one of Russia 's fundamental weakness . And you hear a preoccupation with the United States that goes far beyond what even many Americans , who are famously narcissistic about our country , would expect .
In this telling , Moscow capitulated at the end of the Cold War , and even tried to make itself a friend to the far more powerful United States . But an irrationally aggressive America has instead sought repeatedly to weaken , control , or even destroy Russia . Their country , in this view , is insecure against an overwhelmingly powerful West . Its actions that we see as aggressive are actually defensive . And Moscow is kept safe only by careful vigilance and by the nuclear arsenal that you hear Russians cite over and over .
This is the version of history you hear in Russia from detached foreign policy pragmatists , from pro-Putin ideologues and anti-Putin ideologues , even from members of the pro-Western political opposition who support what they believe be to a Western agenda of weakening Russia .
There 's a quote that speaks perfectly to this Russian worldview — and how Americans misunderstand it — in the most recent issue of Russia in Global Affairs , a Russian foreign policy journal that is widely considered to reflect the views of Russia 's foreign policy establishment . The quote is from a Q & A with Vladimir Lukin , a prominent Russian diplomat and liberal politician who previously served as ambassador to the US :
Interviewer : In his 1994 book `` Diplomacy , '' Henry Kissinger writes that `` integrating Russia into the international system is a key task '' for the United States . But as he was saying this , the Americans were actually pushing Moscow away with their policy . Why ? Vladimir Lukin : It is in the genes . America has a simple ideology – that there is only one truth in the world , that truth is held by God , and God created the United States to be an embodiment of that truth . So the Americans strive to bring this truth to the rest of the world and to make it happy . Only after that will everything be well . This ideology has a strong influence on their policy . A wise traditionalist and a geopolitical expert , Kissinger had good reason to call such politicians `` Trotskyites '' for advocating a world revolution , albeit in their own way , but always in the front and in shining armor . This is a tempting ideology and has been professed by different countries at different times , not only the United States .
Lukin is hardly seen as an anti-American hard-liner in Russia — rather , he 's considered to be an objective expert on the United States and a highly professional diplomat . He is a founding member of the liberal opposition party Yabloko . That he would get the United States so obviously wrong — what Americans would call defending democracy and human rights , he sees as a far more radical and explicitly religious agenda of `` advocating a world revolution '' — is troubling . But his view is a common one , and that tells you a great deal .
The interviewer 's response is similarly telling : `` So Russia took off its ideological blinders in 1991 , but America still seems to have them on . The Soviet Union is gone , but the policy against it is not . ''
This narrative of an inherently aggressive America is one we heard over and over in Moscow , not just from people who support Russian President Vladimir Putin and his aggressive , anti-American policies but even from those who oppose them . In this view , American politics and policies are bent on , and in many ways driven by , a hatred of Russia and desire to destroy or at least control it . Russia has had no choice but to meet American aggression with defensive actions such as putting nuclear-capable missiles in Europe or arming eastern Ukrainian militias at threat of genocidal extermination by American-backed fascists , if only to deter the US from further actions that could lead to all-out war .
It 's not hard to poke holes in this Russian worldview . As Stephen Sestanovich , a longtime senior State Department official who helped engineer the Clinton administration 's Russia policies , wrote in a recent article for the American Interest , even the `` pragmatic '' Russian case for annexing Crimea in March 2014 makes little strategic sense :
Putin has repeatedly claimed that in seizing Crimea he kept the United States from taking over Russia ’ s historic naval base there . Washington , he warned , might have moved its own forces forward so as to change the balance of power in the Black Sea . To this , one has to ask : Which forces , forward from where , and to advance what American goal ? Today the United States no longer even bothers to keep a carrier group in the Mediterranean , as it did for half a century . What would make a Russian military planner think it had any interest in the Black Sea ?
Yet this was the worldview we heard even from professionals and politicians in Russia who oppose anti-Western policies . One foreign policy expert who wished for rapprochement with the West sighed to us that it would be impossible because Hillary Clinton , whom he said was widely viewed as irrationally anti-Russian , would soon take office . At another meeting , a political opposition leader remarked offhand that he hoped the US would be successful in its efforts to engineer regime change in Moscow .
As Sestanovich writes in his essay , `` The idea that the United States aims at a 'color revolution ' in Moscow is the single most frequently repeated theme of official Russian rhetoric . '' This is more than paranoia or government propaganda ; it is the accepted worldview : that Russia is under constant threat from a hostile and irrational United States .
Lukin , at another point in his Q & A , lamented that the US had rejected Moscow 's gestures at cooperation in the 1990s and instead sought to surround Russia with a hostile NATO alliance , thus forcing Russia into a defensive crouch and creating today 's tensions . `` It was the biggest mistake the West made , '' he said , `` and gradually led to the current situation . ''
These fears about America are likely to worsen in Russia if Hillary Clinton becomes president ; many people told us she is seen by many Russians , especially Russian policymakers , as unbendingly hostile to Moscow and bent on the Putin government 's destruction .
`` Hillary is the worst option of any president , '' Fyodor Lukyanov , an influential Russian foreign policy expert who edits a leading foreign affairs journal and heads a foreign policy think tank , told us .
`` Many people here believe that [ she and her team ] will try to come back to the line of the 1990s to encourage Russia into an internal transformation , '' Lukyanov added . `` Not by force , of course , but to encourage some kind of social development that will upend the current system and will promote a new one . ''","The United States comes up constantly when you talk to Russians about their country's place in the world. But the conversations tend to go a lot differently than many Americans might expect.

Actors Sean Penn and Ben Stiller , fashion designer Donna Karan and British business magnate Richard Branson were among the luminaries at the opening of the new Caracol Industrial Park , which is projected to create thousands of jobs more than 100 miles from the quake-ravaged capital of Port-au-Prince .
Hillary Rodham Clinton told a roomful of investors gathered for a luncheon that she had made Haiti a priority when she became secretary of state .
`` We had learned that supporting long-term prosperity in Haiti meant more than providing aid , '' she said . `` It required investments in infrastructure and the economy that would help the Haitian people achieve their own dreams .
`` So we shifted our assistance to investments to address some of the biggest challenges facing this country : creating jobs and sustainable economic growth , '' she added .
Earlier Monday , thousands of Haitians lined the roadway to wave at her motorcade as it wound its way from the newly renovated airport in the seaside city of Cap-Haitien . Clinton and other U.S. officials , including Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and Sen. Patrick Leahy , a Democrat from Vermont , toured a housing development for industrial park workers supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development .
The secretary of state noted there were three presidents gathered in one room to celebrate the opening : her husband , former U.S. President Bill Clinton , current Haitian President Michel Martelly and his predecessor , Rene Preval .
Bill Clinton , now a U.N. special envoy for Haiti , arrived in Caracol separately from his wife .
The Clintons and their allies hope that the $ 300 million industrial facility will transform the northern part of this impoverished country by providing thousands of desperately needed jobs .
But some Haitians say the industrial park does little more than replicate failed efforts from the past and will benefit outsiders more than Haitians . They also worry it will harm some of the few pieces of undamaged environment that still exist in Haiti .
`` It 's really all-in on this project , and there 's a high bar to deliver , '' said Laurent Dubois , a historian who teaches at Duke University and is author of `` Haiti : The Aftershocks of History .

''","Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton encouraged foreigners to invest in Haiti as she and her husband Bill led a star-studded delegation gathered Monday to inaugurate a new industrial park at the center of U.S. efforts to help the country rebuild after the 2010 earthquake.

Actors Sean Penn and Ben Stiller, fashion designer Donna Karan and British business magnate Richard Branson were among the luminaries at the opening of the new Caracol Industrial Park, which is projected to create thousands of jobs more than 100 miles from the quake-ravaged capital of Port-au-Prince.

Hillary Rodham Clinton told a roomful of investors gathered for a luncheon that she had made Haiti a priority when she became secretary of state.

""We had learned that supporting long-term prosperity in Haiti meant more than providing aid,"" she said. ""It required investments in infrastructure and the economy that would help the Haitian people achieve their own dreams.

""So we shifted our assistance to investments to address some of the biggest challenges facing this country: creating jobs and sustainable economic growth,"" she added.

Earlier Monday, thousands of Haitians lined the roadway to wave at her motorcade as it wound its way from the newly renovated airport in the seaside city of Cap-Haitien. Clinton and other U.S. officials, including Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, toured a housing development for industrial park workers supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development.

The secretary of state noted there were three presidents gathered in one room to celebrate the opening: her husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, current Haitian President Michel Martelly and his predecessor, Rene Preval.

Bill Clinton, now a U.N. special envoy for Haiti, arrived in Caracol separately from his wife.

The Clintons and their allies hope that the $300 million industrial facility will transform the northern part of this impoverished country by providing thousands of desperately needed jobs.

But some Haitians say the industrial park does little more than replicate failed efforts from the past and will benefit outsiders more than Haitians. They also worry it will harm some of the few pieces of undamaged environment that still exist in Haiti.

""It's really all-in on this project, and there's a high bar to deliver,"" said Laurent Dubois, a historian who teaches at Duke University and is author of ""Haiti: The Aftershocks of History."" ''It really needs to deliver in a big way so that people will think, yeah, this was the right thing to do.""

The stakes are high in large part because the Clintons have been so heavily involved.

The Caracol project was in the works before the earthquake but it became a top priority for the Obama administration soon after the disaster under Preval. Hillary Rodham Clinton's chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, has made almost monthly visits to the site on Haiti's northern coast.

In a nod to President Barack Obama who was preparing for the final, foreign policy-focused debate later Monday, the secretary of state said the Obama presidency had made Haiti a central focus of its international development efforts.

Monday's trip is her third to Haiti since the earthquake, and there have been more than a dozen visits by her husband, who was co-chairman of an earthquake recovery panel before its mandate ended a year ago.

Unthinkable scenes

On Sunday, President Obama will begin an official visit to Vietnam before continuing on to Japan.

His visit comes nearly a year after Vietnamese leader, General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, was welcomed to the White House.

Such scenes would have been unthinkable in the post-war years. Vietnam had banned citizens from leaving and began efforts to unify the country under a communist ideology.

""Bureaucrats, teachers, and civil servants from the defeated Republic of Vietnam underwent quick courses in re-education,"" says Christopher Goscha, author of the upcoming book, ""A Modern History of Vietnam.""

""However, those who were in the government, security services, and army found themselves doing time in re-education camps. Hundreds perhaps thousands spent years in detention.""

Panicked by these developments, southerners crammed themselves into boats and fled: more than 755,000, according to the UNHCR

The exodus continued as food shortages began to bite.

The Mekong Delta, in southern Vietnam, was home to the best rice fields. But the farmers there were resentful of the new regime and resisted attempts to increase yields.

Even if the southern farmers were amenable, the country's economic five-year plan was wildly ambitious, expecting to grow national income by 14%.

The plan failed. And by 1979 the government had to ration food. Citizens received a mere two kilograms of rice and 200 grams of meat per month.

War with China

Long-running tensions with giant neighbor China erupted following Vietnam's toppling of the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia in 1978/9. Deng Xiaoping vowed to ""teach Vietnam a lesson.""

Within a month the war was over and, according to the Chinese, the lesson taught.

But the Vietnamese also claimed victory, saying they had beaten back their giant northern neighbor. Either way, the conflict helped to sour relations between China and the USSR, which was an ally of Vietnam.

Even though the USSR didn't come to Vietnam's aid in the war, they continued to be the prime funder of the SRV and even created a joint space program.

In 1980, Pham Tuan , a lieutenant colonel in the Vietnam People's Airforce, joined the Soviet Intercosmos program and became the first Asian in space.

As Tuan orbited the Earth, Vietnam's economy began to turn.

New Vietnam?

It was the beginning of a new Vietnam.

The country would become what some have termed Asia's quiet economic success story.

In 1991, President George H.W. Bush implemented a ""roadmap to normalization"" easing the trade embargo that had been in place since the end of the war.

By 1994, American companies could enter the Vietnamese market and Vietnam could integrate with the global economy.

America opened a new embassy in Hanoi in 1995.

They also increased efforts to help clean up vast tracts of land poisoned by Agent Orange and committed to ""clear up its brass"" -- to use a military term -- and help dispose of unexploded remnants of war.

Arms embargo to go?

Today, Vietnam is increasingly worried about the presence of Chinese military in the South China Sea . It wants to buy weapons from the U.S. but is prevented by a decades-old arms embargo.

But the U.S. has said that progress on human rights is important for a full lift of the ban.

Nguyen Tan Dung, the Vietnamese premier, may have some leverage in negotiations because Obama wants to maintain U.S. presence in the region in the face of increasing Chinese assertiveness, analysts say.

""Obama is keen to join Vietnam in containing the expansion of Chinese maritime power into the Pacific,"" says Goscha.

""His visit is a signal to Vietnam of the U.S. readiness to write a new page in American-Vietnamese relations, but it is also part of a wider strategy and series of relationship with other Asian countries worried by China's expansion.""",www.cnn.com,left,q8rLV2SGXtgW09qY

world,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2016/1126/Fidel-Castro-An-iconic-revolutionary-and-longtime-American-nemesis,Fidel Castro: An iconic revolutionary and longtime American nemesis,2016-11-26,"Whitney Eulich, Howard Lafranchi","He was a revolutionary and a liberator : delivering his island nation from the colonial powers and mafia dons that ruled over it from the 16th century halfway into the 20th , and inspiring other independence movements in Latin America and Africa .
He was a dictator and a despot : delivering basic needs but denying basic rights , ultimately turning his nation of 10 million people into what some considered a collective gulag where the individual with a differing political vision was shown the door – to prison or to exile , or even to the firing squad .
Fidel Castro Ruz , who died late Friday night after nearly a half-century of rule over Cuba , leaves the world stage a larger-than-life icon of nationalism and collective struggle . His brother , President Raul Castro , dressed in military uniform , somberly announced the news on state television , concluding with Fidel Castro 's revolutionary rallying cry : `` To victory , always ! ''
Simply “ Fidel ” to a world that across much of its southern half was for decades drawn to his vision of third-world freedom and social liberation , Mr. Castro loved to brag that he had outlasted six – then seven , eight , nine , and ultimately 10 – US presidents , all of whom had sought his demise . But that only underscored the degree to which the Castro mystique and legitimacy depended on a belligerent imperialist power only 90 miles across the Florida Straits .
During his long tenure , Mr. Castro ushered communism into Cuba and brought the US and Cuba to the brink of war during the Cuban Missile Crisis . But he lived to see diplomatic ties with the US restored in 2015 , and President Obama visit the isolated island earlier this year . He served as an inspiration to revolutionary figures in Latin America and Africa , and set the stage for leftist leaders who swept to power across the region in the late 1990s and early 2000s , most notably Venezuela ’ s former President Hugo Chávez , who referred to Castro as his mentor and father . But he also watched his influence wane as democracy and capitalism gained ground .
Whether Cuba is one of the longest-running experiments in social equality or a state ruined under a dictatorship , it ’ s indissoluble from the man known by many as simply “ Fidel. ” His mixed legacy will be debated for years to come . His power on the world stage , while largely symbolic at the time of his death , was emblematic enough that it continues to inspire long after the close of the cold war .
How Castro is remembered “ depends on where you stand , ” says Riordan Roett , director of Latin America studies at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies . “ The left will always hold Castro in high regard as someone who overthrew a dictatorship ” and who embodies Cuban nationalism . “ But if you ’ re on the right , you see repression of the press and of opposition voices . ”
Castro stepped down in February 2008 , just months before the 50th anniversary of the Cuban revolution , handing power to his younger brother , Raul Castro . While still under Castro rule , Cuba has undertaken economic reforms and most recently normalized relations with the United States – a move for which the elder Castro offered his carefully hedged support of in a letter .
“ I do not trust the politics of the United States , nor have I exchanged a word with them , but this is not , in any way , a rejection of a peaceful solution to conflicts , ” Fidel wrote in a letter that was read to a student group marking the 70th anniversary of his graduation from the University of Havana .
He added that Raul had “ taken the relevant steps in line with the prerogatives and authorities awarded to him by the National Assembly and the Cuban Communist Party . ”
Official ties between the US and Cuba long seemed unfathomable – from the heady day a bearded , fatigue-clad , air-punching revolutionary descended from the Sierra Muestra and entered Havana in 1959 to overthrow Fulgencio Batista .
“ Before Castro , Cuba was a banana republic , ” says Wayne Smith , a former chief of the US interests section in Havana and now a senior fellow of the Cuba program at the Center for International Policy in Washington . “ He turned it into a player on the world stage . ”
After taking power , Castro quickly moved to redistribute property and make access to health care a human right . When Castro ’ s guerrilla forces triumphed in 1959 , one-quarter of Cubans could not read or write . Today , the literacy rate is near universal – a model shipped to other developing countries – and Cuba ’ s infant mortality rate is one of the lowest in the world . Racism persists , but not nearly as palpably as in other Latin American nations .
At the same time , Castro showed little tolerance for those who did not support his regime , executing his most vociferous foes and jailing thousands of political dissidents . He shut down media outlets , replacing them with a state voice . Elections were merely rubber-stamp events . He set up neighborhood groups that created a level of paranoia that could hang over every transaction in Cuba , and instituted a feared secret police .
But his ideals , in the end , were hardly sustainable . All Cubans get food supplies , but food has been rationed since 1962 , and the nation failed to support industry . With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 came the collapse of Cuba . In 1980 , when the government announced that anyone who wished to leave the island could , tens of thousands left in an exodus for Miami , in what is now known as the Mariel boat lift . Today roughly 2 million Cuban-Americans live in the United States , more than 1 million in southern Florida .
“ The fact that he survived the loss of the Soviet subsidy and then the pressures of a globalizing economy is one of the more remarkable parts of his legacy , ” says Mr. Smith . “ What Castro is , basically , is an egalitarian , and it may be that egalitarianism won ’ t be part of the 21st century . But , then again , the failings of the current direction suggest it may not be dead . ”
Castro exported his ideals , and manpower , to revolutionaries around the world seeking to emulate his struggles in their own countries .
He was hailed for standing up to the US , through the Bay of Pigs , the Cuban Missile Crisis , and most defiantly in the face of trade restrictions slapped on by President Eisenhower in 1960 and a full trade embargo and stringent travel restrictions imposed by President John F. Kennedy in 1962 . Cuba was on the US list of state-supported terrorism until April 2015 .
Castro continues to inspire many in the region . Even if communism is not the ideal , the push for a more just Latin America with wealth redistributed to the poor has been behind a slew of elections , from Venezuela ’ s ex-President Chávez to Evo Morales in Bolivia to the resurgence of Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua .
“ Latin America creates these larger than life characters : Juan Peron , Salvador Allende , Hugo Chavez , ” says Roett from Johns Hopkins . “ They all have their own little following and important place in Latin American history , but as time goes on … there aren ’ t a lot of people talking about them in the longer term . ”
But that ’ s not likely to be the case for Castro , he says .
“ He really transformed how we look at the left in Latin America , ” Roett says . “ US foreign policy became reactive to Castro and eventually to others in the region . ”
It ’ s a lasting legacy , a point underscored by just how much US-Latin American relations have changed since Castro ’ s time in power . Over the past decade-plus , the region has asserted its autonomy – both diplomatically and economically – from the US , creating regional organizations that don ’ t include the US or Canada , and threatening to boycott the 2009 Summit of the Americas if Cuba wasn ’ t allowed to attend .
“ Fidel changed the way the game was played , ” says Larry Birns , director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs . “ He symbolizes standing up for a Latin America that is authentically free … [ and ] Latin America ’ s relationship with the US is no longer defined by deference to the north . It ’ s now working among equals in the region , ” something Mr. Birns attributes to Castro ’ s legacy .
Castro ’ s resolute anti-Americanism became a jumping-off point for many others , from overt “ anti-imperialist ” name-calling by Chávez , to more subtle messages of independence like Brazil ’ s move to cancel a US state visit after it was revealed the National Security Agency had snooped in the president ’ s emails and text messages .
“ Castro defined Cuban nationalism as the antithesis of the United States , ” Robert Pastor , who under President Carter was the first US official to meet with Castro after diplomatic relations were broken off in 1961 , told The ███ in 2007 . “ But that was not sustainable for a small island off the US , ” said Mr. Pastor , who died in 2014 .
Castro had made few public appearances since falling ill in 2006 , but had appeared on television and maintained his most public profile through penning reflections in the communist daily Granma .
Now pent-up expectations are likely to be unleashed . Raul Castro was behind reforms in the 1990s – called the “ special period ” – triggered by the collapse of Soviet Union subsidies . The US dollar was legalized , and the economy was opened to tourism and some joint ventures from abroad .
But Fidel Castro pushed back on some of those things , with taxes that made private restaurants , for example , harder to operate . Instead , he relied on largesse from other nations – most notably Venezuela , which at one point was sending it some 90,000 barrels of subsidized oil each day .
Lately , Cuba has taken even bigger steps toward reform , and Raul Castro has called for the modernization of the Cuban revolution .
“ There have been changes in the areas of paternalism , idealism , and egalitarianism , ” says Brian Latell , a former CIA analyst and senior researcher at the Institute for Cuban and Cuban American Studies at the University of Miami .
“ I can ’ t think of any three words or concepts that better summarize Fidel Castro ’ s dogma through all the years , ” he says , noting cuts in food rations and health care since Raul came to power . “ Those were articles of faith for Fidel… . The recognition among Cuban leadership today is that Fidel ’ s doctrines didn ’ t work , and need to change , ” says Mr. Latell , who wrote the book , “ After Fidel : Raul Castro and the Future of Cuba 's Revolution . ”
Mr. Pastor once recalled that during his first meeting with Castro in December 1979 , it dawned on him that the bearded leader was talking as if he were the country of Cuba . “ It was like Louis XIV ’ s ‘ I am the state , ’ ” Pastor said .

To many, his legacy encompasses both elements.

Another Castro

Castro stepped down in February 2008, just months before the 50th anniversary of the Cuban revolution, handing power to his younger brother, Raul Castro. While still under Castro rule, Cuba has undertaken economic reforms and most recently normalized relations with the United States – a move for which the elder Castro offered his carefully hedged support of in a letter.

Mariel boat lift

But, then again, the failings of the current direction suggest it may not be dead.”

Revolutionary exports

Castro exported his ideals, and manpower, to revolutionaries around the world seeking to emulate his struggles in their own countries.

He was hailed for standing up to the US, through the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and most defiantly in the face of trade restrictions slapped on by President Eisenhower in 1960 and a full trade embargo and stringent travel restrictions imposed by President John F.

Few appearances

Castro had made few public appearances since falling ill in 2006, but had appeared on television and maintained his most public profile through penning reflections in the communist daily Granma.

Now pent-up expectations are likely to be unleashed. Raul Castro was behind reforms in the 1990s – called the “special period” – triggered by the collapse of Soviet Union subsidies. The US dollar was legalized, and the economy was opened to tourism and some joint ventures from abroad.

BAGHDAD -- Iraqi political leaders conceded Thursday that their embattled government lacks a broad strategy or enough military power to break the grip of Islamic militants who control other parts of the country.

Despite the encroaching threat from the Islamic State militants, Bagdhad has been distracted by political uncertainty over who will lead the nation and prevent the extremists from moving in on the capital.

""Now the priority is defending Baghdad,"" said Zuhair al-Chalabi, a government official who headed an economic development council in Mosul.

Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, whose Shiite-dominated government alienated minority Sunnis now sympathetic to the Islamic State, had sought a third four-year term, even though his support has withered in Iraq and the wider region. But al-Maliki agreed to step down Thursday night, three days after the new president nominated a Shiite politician, Haider al-Abadi, as prime minister.

Some 65 miles away in Fallujah, fierce fighting between the Sunni militants and Iraqi troops loyal to the government killed at least four children Thursday. Fallujah has been held by the Islamic State militants since January. Fallujah hospital director Ahmed Shami said a woman and 10 militants also died in the clash.

The insurgency has driven hundreds of thousands of Iraqis from their homes.

President Obama said Thursday that air strikes would continue against militants. He also praised development of a new government in Baghdad, saying it will be better able to take control of the fight against militants.

IThe U.S. has conducted 25 airstrikes in Iraq since it first intervened last week. About half were designed to hit militant forces in the Kurdish region and the other half were targeted at militants near Mount Sinjar, where tens of thousands of members of a small religious sect had fled, according to Rear Adm, John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary.

The U.S. air strikes are not designed to break the grips the militants have on other parts of the country.

Four Iraqi divisions collapsed when the militants, who call themselves the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, attacked Mosul in June, triggering a wave of attacks by militants who were nearing Irbil, the capital of the Kurdish region, when the U.S. launched air strikes.

Most of the remaining army is now deployed around Baghdad. The government has also helped organize Shiite militias to fight the militants and has encouraged tribes in western Iraq to do likewise. Attempts at counter attacks by Iraqi forces have generally petered out.

Iraqi officials believe it will take a broader effort backed by U.S. airstrikes to dislodge militants in Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, and parts of western Iraq.Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is more than 200 miles from Baghdad and much of the territory in between is controlled by militants or contested.

""It is impossible to get Mosul back without international support,"" Chalabi said.

In a televised statement Thursday, Obama said thousands of lives of Yazidis, the refugees trapped on Mount Sinjar, were saved thanks to U.S. air drops of food and water and airstrikes that held militants at bay. ""We broke the mountain siege of Sinjar,"" Obama said.

Because of the humanitarian effort, Obama said, most Yazidis had escaped to safety and those remaining had adequate supplies of food and water. He said no further rescue operation needs to be undertaken.

Obama said that air strikes designed to protect American personnel in Iraq would continue and the United States stands ready to launch further humanitarian missions if required. He reiterated his pledge to keep combat troops out of Iraq.

Viktor Yanukovych, ousted Saturday from his post as president of Ukraine, is now wanted by authorities in his country on charges of mass murder, the acting interior minister says.

Authorities want Yanukovych and some of his aides to be tried for the deaths of scores of protesters in Kiev last week, acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov writes on his Facebook page.

First, though, officials have to find the 63-year-old Yanukovych — who has accused opponents of staging an illegal coup. He's missing. As Reuters reports:

""According to Avakov's account of events, Yanukovych, after hearing he had been officially replaced in his presidential duties, headed for the Belbek military airport in Crimea. He then went in another direction after learning that the new heads of the interior ministry and state security service were waiting for him there. ""At a private residence in the Balaclava region, he gathered his security guards together and gave them a choice either to stay with him or leave, relinquishing protection from state-appointed bodyguards, Avakov said. ""Some left him, taking with them official state-registered weapons to hand over to the authorities in Crimea.""

Then Yanukovych disappeared again.

Meanwhile, European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton is due in Kiev today. She'll be talking with officials about steps — and money — that are needed to shore up Ukraine's economy. The BBC writes that ""the new interim Finance Minister, Yuriy Kolobov, has said Ukraine needs around $35 billion in urgent foreign aid and asked for an international donors' conference to be held.""

In Kiev's Independence Square, where the demonstrations and violence were centered, some protesters remain camped out. Flowers and other memorials are piling up in places to honor the dozens of people killed there.

world,Christian Science Monitor,1,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2020/0416/Beneath-Trump-WHO-spat-a-US-China-race-for-leadership,"Beneath Trump-WHO spat, a US-China race for leadership",2020-04-16,Howard Lafranchi,"“ Paradoxically it may be that the Chinese become a bigger player ” in global health if they move to fill the void left by a U.S. pullback , says Stephen Morrison , at the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
And if Mr. Trump ’ s aim in suspending WHO funding is to hold China responsible and counter its quest to come out of the pandemic looking like a leader , the approach is likely to backfire , some say .
The president ’ s critics say the move against WHO fits a pattern of Mr. Trump seeking to shift blame for his own failings . But experts in global health say a broader concern is that the withholding of funds sends a terrible message , in particular to poorer countries that even in more normal circumstances depend heavily on WHO .
President Donald Trump ’ s attacks on the World Health Organization are consistent with his criticism of and withdrawal from international organizations and agreements . But the U.S. row with WHO also underscores what many experts say is a troubling lack of global leadership for addressing the coronavirus pandemic , a challenge as grave as anything the world has faced since World War II .
Late in February , when President Donald Trump was still minimizing the impact he anticipated from the coronavirus on the United States , he had only glowing remarks to make about the World Health Organization ’ s role in checking the new global threat .
Along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , WHO was “ working hard and very smart ” to help the world bring the novel coronavirus under control , President Trump tweeted Feb. 24 .
But these days , with the U.S. topping the list of countries with the most reported coronavirus cases and counting more than 33,000 deaths from COVID-19 – and with criticism mounting of the slow and uncoordinated early response to the pandemic from the White House – the president ’ s messaging about the United Nations ’ premier health organization is very different .
On Tuesday Mr. Trump announced from the Rose Garden that he was suspending U.S. funding for WHO – about $ 450 million annually , or just over 20 % of its budget – and railed against the institution charged with promoting “ the health of all peoples ” for causing “ so much death ” by its “ mistakes. ” WHO had failed to warn the world of the seriousness of the new virus early enough , he said , when it could have made a difference .
Moreover , the president charged WHO with abetting China in a disinformation campaign about the coronavirus ’ s origins and subsequent cover-up of the outbreak – actions Mr. Trump said worsened the impact of the virus outside China .
Mr. Trump ’ s attacks on the U.N. structure ’ s global health agency – created along with so many other multilateral institutions as part of a postwar , U.S.-led international order – are consistent with his criticism of and withdrawal from international organizations and agreements . But the U.S. row with WHO also underscores what many international experts say is a troubling lack of global leadership for addressing a challenge as grave as anything the world has faced since World War II .
The president ’ s critics say the move against WHO fits a pattern of Mr. Trump seeking to shift blame for his own failings somewhere else .
But experts in global health issues point to a broader concern , saying Mr. Trump ’ s action sends a terrible message to the world . In particular , they say , to poorer countries with weak health infrastructures that even in more normal circumstances depend heavily on WHO for everything from malaria and polio-eradication programs to maternal and infant health campaigns .
“ One of the things the WHO has been very good about is channeling resources to the global south , to countries with fewer resources to address a challenge like a pandemic , so [ cutting WHO funding ] will be particularly poorly viewed in those countries , ” says Ian Johnstone , a professor of international law and expert in international institutions at Tufts University ’ s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in Medford , Massachusetts .
“ It sends an unfortunate message – one the Trump administration has communicated from the beginning – that it doesn ’ t have much faith in international organizations and is reluctant to engage in international cooperation . ”

Moreover , the Trump administration ’ s efforts to hold China responsible for its early cover-up of the virus outbreak will be undercut by defunding WHO , says Brett Schaefer , an expert in international institutions at the Heritage Foundation in Washington .
“ The U.S. has taken pains to counter Chinese disinformation and focus the world on the fact that Chinese actions and inactions facilitated the spread of COVID-19 and impeded the international response , leading to enormous loss of life and economic hardship , ” says Mr. Schaefer . “ Those efforts will be immediately overshadowed by an announcement that the U.S. is cutting funding to the WHO even as other nations , both developed and developing , are expressing anger toward China for its role in the COVID-19 pandemic . ”
Others say it is simply unrealistic to expect an international organization like WHO , which serves its member states and has very little authority to impose measures on them , to come down hard on a global power like China .
Chinese leader Xi Jinping “ is pushing the narrative that ‘ I intervened and I stopped this inside China , ’ and there ’ s no way that WHO can contradict that , ” says Derek Scissors , China scholar and U.S.-China relations expert at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington .
“ It would be like the [ International Monetary Fund ] contradicting the U.S. government on its economic reporting and forecasts , ” he adds . “ You ’ re just not going to have an international organization like that contradicting its most important members . ”
Health experts close to WHO say its officials , including Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , are frustrated that many of the organization ’ s 194 member states have paid little heed to the global emergency declaration it issued Jan. 30 and subsequent guidance for addressing the pandemic .
Mr. Trump accuses WHO of being slow to inform the world of the gathering threat , but in fact Director-General Tedros , as he is known , has held nearly daily briefings on the health emergency since late January , often issuing guidance and stark warnings on the consequences of not taking swift mitigating actions .
Some global health experts say there was a time when the organization did act quickly and decisively with China to halt the spread of a threatening virus . They point to the tough , early actions that former WHO Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland , a no-nonsense former prime minister of Norway , took in 2002 that are credited with limiting the reach of the SARS epidemic .
Despite the director-general ’ s lack of authority to investigate and censure WHO member states , Ms. Brundtland went ahead and held China ’ s feet to the fire anyway . And now WHO and Ms. Brundtland are widely credited with keeping SARS in check and limiting deaths worldwide to under 1,000 .

Late in February, when President Donald Trump was still minimizing the impact he anticipated from the coronavirus on the United States, he had only glowing remarks to make about the World Health Organization’s role in checking the new global threat.

US President Donald Trump has clashed with German Chancellor Angela Merkel over Russian influence and defence spending, ahead of a Nato summit.

Mr Trump said Germany was ""totally controlled by Russia"" because of the high level of natural gas it imported, and this was a ""bad thing for Nato"".

Mrs Merkel hit back, comparing German independence now with the time when she grew up in the former East Germany.

She also defended her country's contribution to the Western alliance.

The last summit both leaders attended ended in acrimony in a row over trade. Mr Trump later made more conciliatory remarks after he and Mrs Merkel had met on the sidelines of the summit in Brussels on Wednesday.

European Council President Donald Tusk accused him of criticising Europe ""almost daily"", tweeting: ""Dear America, appreciate your allies, after all you don't have that many.""

What exactly did Trump say about Germany?

Germany has the EU's biggest economy and has long been accused by US administrations of failing to contribute its fair share to Nato operations but Mr Trump's comments were particularly stinging.

At a breakfast meeting in Brussels with Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg, the US leader said: ""Germany is totally controlled by Russia because they will be getting from 60% to 70% of their energy from Russia, and a new pipeline, and you tell me if that's appropriate because I think it's not and I think it's a very bad thing for Nato.""

Moscow's potential influence

By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent

In describing Germany as being ""totally controlled by Russia"" and linking this to what the US sees as Berlin's unsatisfactory defence budget, President Trump is underscoring two longstanding US concerns.

US leaders have long warned of what they see as Europe's uncomfortable dependence upon Russian energy supplies. And they have also been arguing for more than a decade that the Europeans should spend more on defence. Mr Trump has given these twin themes a new and more abrasive tone.

While he may well be overstating Germany's dependence upon Russian energy, even many European leaders are well aware of the potential influence that this could give Moscow. It's an area where short-term economic and longer-term security considerations are at variance.

No wonder then that when the US sanctions Russia for its behaviour in Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea it included steps to hamper anyone who helped build or support new Russian pipelines westwards.

What is the spending row about?

Mr Trump's main objection is that all but a handful of member states have still not increased their defence budgets to meet a goal of spending at least 2% of their annual economic output on defence by 2024.

Of Nato's 29 members, just five meet that target this year: the US, Greece, Estonia, the UK and Latvia. However, several, such as Poland and France, are close to the mark.

Some in Nato fear Mr Trump's repeated blunt demands could harm morale, furthering the agenda of President Putin, whom they accuse of seeking to destabilise the West.

world,Al Jazeera,0,https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/time-india-pakistan-repeal-sedition-laws-200220084422316.html,It is time for India and Pakistan to repeal their sedition laws,,Ammar Ali Jan,"It appears to be sedition season on the Indian subcontinent . A relic of the colonial era , the sedition law has become a potent weapon in the hands of the Pakistani and Indian governments to crush dissenting voices .
In December 2019 , Pakistan 's government charged hundreds of people with sedition for taking part in the countrywide Students Solidarity March , which called for the restoration of student unions among other demands . One of the participants in the march , Alamgir Wazir , was arrested on December 2 , and has since been languishing in jail for allegedly `` conspiring to overthrow the government '' .
On January 27 , Manzoor Pashteen , the leader of the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement ( PTM ) , was also arrested on charges of sedition in a late-night raid on his residence in Peshawar . A day later , police arrested and charged with sedition 23 other people , including several young activists from the left-wing Awami Workers Party ( AWP ) , for attending a protest in Islamabad against Pashteen 's arrest .
The PTM is an ethnic Pashtun rights movement that has been calling for accountability for alleged rights abuses committed by Pakistan 's military in its war against the Pakistan Taliban . The peaceful rights movement has been the target of a sustained campaign of intimidation and arrests since its formation .
Activists from AWP and many of PTM 's supporters have been released , but scores of activists remain incarcerated , including Pashteen himself . These individuals face the risk of spending years behind bars merely for daring to criticise the actions of their government . Their ordeal demonstrates the Pakistani state 's eagerness to use the sedition law to silence anyone it perceives as a threat to its authority .
Across the border in India , the sedition law was notoriously invoked against Jawaharlal Nehru University ( JNU ) student leaders Kanaiyha Kumar and Umar Khalid ( among others ) in 2016 , for allegedly shouting `` anti-India '' slogans during a protest . JNU has a reputation for being a hotbed of left-wing dissent . As a result , India 's Hindu-nationalist BJP government believes the institution presents an obstacle to its authoritarian agenda and continuously harasses its faculty and students with frivolous lawsuits .
Earlier this month , a researcher at JNU , Sharjeel Imam , was charged with sedition for participating in the ongoing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act . In recent years , the sedition law has been used against a host of other people , including trade unionists , environmentalists and professors across the country .
What is particularly remarkable about all this is that these unfounded accusations are being hurled through a law which was created and widely used by the British Raj against the insurgent anti-colonial movement in India .
Bal Gangadhar Tilak , one of the most prominent nationalist leaders of colonial India before Gandhi 's emergence on the national stage , was tried several times under the sedition law for `` inciting the public '' through his writings . In his 1916 trial , he was defended by the young barrister , Mohammad Ali Jinnah , who would later go on to become a major proponent of the partition of India and a founding father of the state of Pakistan .
From the 1920s to the 1940s , scores of Indians were tried under the sedition law , including Mahatma Gandhi , Maulana Mohammad Ai Jauhar , Bhagat Singh and M N Roy , among others . Prior to independence , the sedition law was synonymous with the absurdity of colonial rule as British officials used this law to accuse locals of being `` foreign agents '' in their own lands .
Independence activists across the subcontinent who were imprisoned for `` sedition '' carried the charge as a badge of honour . They were viewed by the general public as heroes , because back then being patriotic meant dissenting from those in power .
Yet , at their birth , the nation-states of India and Pakistan were confronted with the paradox of acquiring the twin inheritance of anti-colonial politics premised on popular sovereignty and a colonial state apparatus that was geared towards silencing and terrorising the population . The gap between these two legacies continues to haunt both countries to this day . The sedition law is a reminder that the colonial logic , which sees the state not as a body that is designed to serve the people but a weapon to subdue them , is alive and well today .
One of the most remarkable features of this latest round of repression has been the emphasis on `` seditious speech '' . Today , in neither Pakistan nor India is it necessary to prove that there was in place a plan of action to undermine national sovereignty to charge someone with sedition . Instead , speeches and slogans alone are considered `` proof '' of some deeper conspiracy against the nation-state .
The states are using sedition laws to violently patrol the boundaries of acceptable speech and thought in the public sphere , exposing the vulnerability they feel in the face of righteous and peaceful criticisms of their exclusionary , divisive and dangerous policies .
This sense of insecurity stems from the growing inability of these states to fulfil their responsibilities towards the public . In Pakistan , the Imran Khan-led government has signed one of the most punishing deals with the IMF , resulting in unprecedented austerity . The education budget has been cut by 40 percent and the health sector is being privatised . Meanwhile , wheat shortages have marred the food market and inflation has reached an unprecedented 14 percent .
In India , the economy has also taken a sharp downturn . The economic growth has tumbled from an annual expansion rate of 8.1 percent in the first quarter of 2018 to just 4.5 per cent in the third quarter of last year . Rising unemployment coupled with an agrarian crisis left many poor families with no other option but to cut back their food consumption , shattering Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's promise of delivering `` Acche Din '' ( Good Days ) for the country 's impoverished majority .
Moreover , the growing economic uncertainty has accelerated the need for the region 's ruling classes to produce fake enemies to distract the public from their persistent inability to provide them with a decent standard of living .
This is why an unprecedented number of people across the political spectrum in Pakistan are facing the accusation of being `` an Indian agent '' , while in India , opponents of the government are being branded `` ISI agents '' , in reference to Pakistan 's intelligence agency . And this is why so many people are facing charges for allegedly serving the enemy in both countries today .
Yet , there is growing resistance in both India and Pakistan against the authoritarianism engulfing the region . Two features stand out as salient in these burgeoning movements .
First , they are being led by young citizens who are increasingly wary of the fear and hate-mongering methods that are being used by the ruling elites to convince the public to give up on their most basic rights to safety , employment and free speech . Thousands of students , for example , joined the campaign in India against the discriminatory CAA , posing perhaps the greatest challenge to the Modi government in India .
Similarly , in Pakistan , the Students Solidarity March and the PTM emerged as youth-led movements and managed to unite the public behind a common cause at a time when mainstream political parties appear unable to build an opposition to a faltering political and economic system .
The second striking feature of these movements is that they base their legitimacy on the constitution . In India , the anti-CAA protestors are claiming that such discriminatory laws undermine the basic architecture of the constitution and facilitate India 's drift towards communal majoritarianism . In Pakistan , activists are defending freedom of speech and unionisation as basic elements of the constitution without which democracy becomes meaningless .
In both cases , the state has responded by hurling allegations of treason and imposing sedition charges on the protesters . This led to the bizarre situation where the state 's foremost legal document is transformed into subversive literature , signifying the crisis of legitimacy that haunts authoritarian governments in South Asia .
Activists in both India and Pakistan have recently become more vocal in their demand for the repeal of sedition laws . Indeed , they are asking the pertinent question : who are the people being seditious against if they , themselves are the rulers ? An honest resolution of this question will not only allow the sub-continent to overcome one of the darkest legacies of colonial rule , but it will also aid us in figuring out what it means to be patriotic in a region where nationalism is becoming increasingly insular and punishing .
The views expressed in this article are the author 's own and do not necessarily reflect ███ 's editorial stance .","It appears to be sedition season on the Indian subcontinent. A relic of the colonial era, the sedition law has become a potent weapon in the hands of the Pakistani and Indian governments to crush dissenting voices.

In December 2019, Pakistan's government charged hundreds of people with sedition for taking part in the countrywide Students Solidarity March, which called for the restoration of student unions among other demands. One of the participants in the march, Alamgir Wazir, was arrested on December 2, and has since been languishing in jail for allegedly ""conspiring to overthrow the government"".

On January 27, Manzoor Pashteen, the leader of the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), was also arrested on charges of sedition in a late-night raid on his residence in Peshawar. A day later, police arrested and charged with sedition 23 other people, including several young activists from the left-wing Awami Workers Party (AWP), for attending a protest in Islamabad against Pashteen's arrest.

The PTM is an ethnic Pashtun rights movement that has been calling for accountability for alleged rights abuses committed by Pakistan's military in its war against the Pakistan Taliban. The peaceful rights movement has been the target of a sustained campaign of intimidation and arrests since its formation.

Activists from AWP and many of PTM's supporters have been released, but scores of activists remain incarcerated, including Pashteen himself. These individuals face the risk of spending years behind bars merely for daring to criticise the actions of their government. Their ordeal demonstrates the Pakistani state's eagerness to use the sedition law to silence anyone it perceives as a threat to its authority.

Across the border in India, the sedition law was notoriously invoked against Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student leaders Kanaiyha Kumar and Umar Khalid (among others) in 2016, for allegedly shouting ""anti-India"" slogans during a protest. JNU has a reputation for being a hotbed of left-wing dissent. As a result, India's Hindu-nationalist BJP government believes the institution presents an obstacle to its authoritarian agenda and continuously harasses its faculty and students with frivolous lawsuits.

Earlier this month, a researcher at JNU, Sharjeel Imam, was charged with sedition for participating in the ongoing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act. In recent years, the sedition law has been used against a host of other people, including trade unionists, environmentalists and professors across the country.

What is particularly remarkable about all this is that these unfounded accusations are being hurled through a law which was created and widely used by the British Raj against the insurgent anti-colonial movement in India.

With the USSR distracted in 1941, Finland made a strategic blunder and chose to attack the Soviets

It's difficult to guess why exactly Russia is doing this, but it's making Finland nervous and elevating a longstanding disagreement in Finnish politics about the country's relationship to Russia. Finland, you see, is an unusual case — it shares a long border with Russia and is part of the European Union but not NATO, and while many prominent Finnish politicians including the current prime minister want it to join NATO, that's a controversial view and it doesn't have majority support in the parliament.

A tangled history

Russo-Finnish history is complicated by the fact that, for many years, Finland was part of the Russian Empire. When the Russian Empire collapsed in the wake of World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution, Finland emerged as an independent country. Then, in late-1939, the Soviet Union attacked Finland, seeking to readjust the border.

Finland fought surprisingly effectively during the Winter War, inflicting heavy losses on Soviet forces, but ultimately had to make concessions in order to sue for peace. Then in 1941, Nazi Germany attacked the USSR. With the Soviets distracted, Finland made a strategic blunder and chose to attack the Soviets, hoping to recapture its lost territory. This put democratic Finland into a problematic de facto alliance with Nazi Germany, which of course lost the war.

That left Finland as a bit of an orphan of Cold War politics. The country was democratic, capitalist, and armed to the teeth against possible Soviet aggression, but was not a part of the anti-Soviet alliance system. On the contrary, Finnish foreign policy was oriented toward appeasing the USSR in as many ways as possible — all while preserving the country's independence. After the USSR fell in 1991, Finland moved clearly into the Western sphere by joining the European Union and the Eurozone. But it never made it into NATO.

The NATO debate

Finland's prime minister, Alexander Stubb, favors NATO membership. So does Sauli Niinistö, the country's president. Both Stubb and Niinistö are members of the National Coalition Party. The NCP is currently the main right-of-center party in Finland and the largest party in parliament. It is also the main party that opposed Finland's conciliatory attitude toward the Soviet Union during the Cold War days. Given that the NCP is running the show and its leaders favor NATO membership, you might think NATO membership is in the cards.

But Finland, like many European countries, has seen a surge in electoral support for somewhat fringy euroskeptical parties in recent elections. Consequently, the current coalition government is a broad tent that incorporates Social Democrats, Christian Democrats, and a party representing the country's Swedish-speaking minority. Social Democrats firmly oppose NATO membership, and the terms of the coalition agreement bar Stubb from seeking it. Instead, Finland (and its neighbor Sweden) are both signing deals to enhance cooperation with NATO without joining the alliance outright.

Pros and cons

The upside to NATO membership — security against Russian threats — might seem obvious. But opponents within Finland counter that joining an anti-Russian military alliance would anger Moscow without fundamentally altering the balance of power. Finland has proven in the past that it can deter formal invasion.

At the same time, no military alliance is going to alter Finland's extreme dependence on economic ties to Russia. About 9 percent of Finnish exports head for Russian markets, and over 15 percent of Finnish imports — largely key production inputs such as oil — come from Russia. In this view, Finnish foreign policy needs to emphasize good relations with Russia regardless of the military situation, which would make NATO membership counterproductive.

Finland is scheduled to hold a parliamentary election next spring. In theory, that could lead to the formation of a new coalition that might open the door to NATO membership. In practice, with neither the leading opposition party nor the NCP's main coalition partner supporting NATO, it is difficult to envision a majority for NATO membership being assembled.

“When power, especially military force, is used, the world will consider it legitimate only when convinced that it is being used for the right purpose – for broadly shared aims in accordance with broadly accepted norms,” he said.

He acknowledged more recently that the UN still had its faults. “The UN can be improved, it is not perfect but if it didn’t exist you would have to create it,” he told the BBC in an interview for his 80th birthday in April. “I am a stubborn optimist, I was born an optimist and will remain an optimist.”

A Nigerian government statement said it would `` continue to explore all options for the release and safe return of our girls back to their homes '' after the release of a video by the Boko Haram terrorist network showing what it claimed were some of the schoolgirls kidnapped a month ago .
The video showed about 100 girls , indicating they may have been broken up into smaller groups as some reports have indicated . Fifty-three girls managed to escape and 276 remain missing , according to Nigerian authorities .
Meanwhile , a senior U.S. official told Fox News the Pentagon has deployed military aircraft over Nigeria for manned intelligence and surveillance missions .
The U.S. has sent some 30 people drawn from the State and Defense departments . Among them are five State Department officials , two strategic communications experts , a civil security expert and a regional medical support officer . Four FBI officials with expertise in safe recovery , negotiations and preventing future kidnappings are also part of the group .
The Pentagon said 16 Defense Department personnel were on the team , including planners and advisers who were already in Nigeria and have been redirected to assist the government .
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said at a press briefing Monday that the U.S. had experts in a variety of areas , including reconnaissance and surveillance , working on the case of the missing girls . However he said he did not have a “ catalog ” of the specific resources the experts were using .
The foreign help does not involve boots on the ground but rather experts in intelligence gathering , counter-terrorism and hostage negotiations .
French President Francois Hollande invited Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan and leaders from neighboring Benin , Chad , Cameroon and Niger , as well as representatives of Britain , the EU and the United States , to a summit on Saturday to focus on Boko Haram , terrorism and insecurity in West Africa .
A French official said Jonathan had agreed to attend . He spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the gathering have not been finalized .
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Said Djinnit , his special representative for West Africa , is in Abuja for meetings with the president and other officials on how the United Nations and its member states can help .
The girls ' families have said most of those seized April 15 from a school in the northeastern town of Chibok are Christians .
It was impossible to fully authenticate the video released on Monday , though parents were trying to turn on a generator in Chibok , hoping to watch the video and identify their daughters , said a town leader , Pogu Bitrus .
`` There 's an atmosphere of hope — hope that these girls are alive , whether they have been forced to convert to Islam or not , '' he told The Associated Press by telephone . `` We want to be able to say , 'These are our girls . ' ''
Bitrus said vegetation in the video looked like the Sambisa Forest , some 20 miles from Chibok , where the girls were believed to have been spirited away .
It is not known how many suspected Boko Haram members are detained by security forces . Hundreds were killed last month when leader Abubakar Shekau 's fighters stormed the military 's main northeastern barracks in Maiduguri , the terror group 's birthplace and the headquarters of a year-old military state of emergency to put down the 5-year-old Islamic uprising .
Interior Minister Abba Moro scoffed at Boko Haram 's demand to release prisoners late Monday , telling the BBC the group was in no moral position to make the offer .
`` As far as this government is concerned , the option of [ the ] swap of innocent citizens with people who have taken arms against the country ... is not on the table , '' he said .
But Mike Omri , the director of Nigeria 's National Orientation Agency , told The Associated Press late Monday that the government will `` use whatever kind of action '' it takes to free the girls .
In a video last week , Shekau threatened to sell the girls into slavery . It arrived amid unverified reports that Christians among the students had been forced to convert to Islam and that some were taken to neighboring Cameroon and Chad , where they were forced to marry their abductors . Boko Haram means `` Western education is sinful . ''
The latest video , obtained by The Associated Press , came through channels that have provided previous messages from Shekau , who spoke in the video in the Hausa language of northern Nigeria . Wearing camouflage fatigues , he clutched an assault rifle in the footage , which was imprinted with the Boko Haram insignia — a Quran resting on two crossed assault rifles — and below a black jihadi flag .
The United States put a $ 7 million ransom on Shekau last year .

In what has been billed as one of the largest gatherings of global leaders in recent history , representatives from around the world joined street sweepers , actors and religious figures to pay tribute to Nelson Mandela .
From President Barack Obama to Cuba 's Raul Castro , praise came from all sides in a four-hour memorial service at Johannesburg FNB stadium for the revered statesman , who died Thursday at age 95 .
`` We will never see the likes of Nelson Mandela again , '' Obama said in a speech to roaring cheers .
`` To the people of South Africa -- people of every race and every walk of life -- the world thanks you for sharing Nelson Mandela with us , '' he said , calling him a `` giant of history . ''
Gray skies and pouring rain throughout the service did little to dampen the mood .
Huge poster pictures of Mandela hung around the stadium . In that same place 23 years earlier , Mandela had delivered his first speech after he was released from prison , hailed by supporters as the hope of a new South Africa .
Also known as Soccer City , the stadium was where Mandela made his last public appearance at the World Cup final in July 2010 .
On Tuesday , many people carried banners honoring `` Madiba , '' Mandela 's traditional clan name . Others were draped in materials covered with his face or the green , yellow , black , red and blue colors of the South African flag .
Some had skipped work and lined up for hours to secure seats so that they could pay their respects to a man who 's considered a moral compass and South Africa 's symbol of the struggle against racial oppression .
`` There is no one like Madiba . He was one of a kind , '' South African President Jacob Zuma said .
`` Everyone has had a Mandela moment when this world icon has touched their lives . ''
The memorial service began with a marching band playing the national anthem .
The joyous cries died down as speeches from Mandela 's family and friends , members of the African National Congress , as well as a fellow Robben Island prison inmate , began .
Anguished faces listened quietly as a sorrowful chant to `` Tata Madiba '' filled the air . `` Tata '' means `` father '' in Mandela 's Xhosa tribe .
Mandela 's gift for uniting foes across political and racial divides was still evident at the service .
Walking up the stairs onto the stage to deliver his speech , Obama shook hands with Castro , an unprecedented gesture between the leaders of two nations that have been at loggerheads for more than half a century .
He earlier gave a warm greeting to Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff , kissing her on both cheeks , despite recent tension between the two countries over reports the U.S. government was spying on her communications .
Obama , who like Mandela was his nation 's first black president , has cited Mandela as his own inspiration for entering politics .
`` With honesty , regardless of our station or our circumstance , we must ask : How well have I applied his lessons in my own life ? '' Obama said .
`` It is a question I ask myself , as a man and as a president . We know that like South Africa , the United States had to overcome centuries of racial subjugation . As was true here , it took sacrifice -- the sacrifices of countless people , known and unknown -- to see the dawn of a new day . ''
The presidents of Namibia , India , Cuba and South Africa were also designated speakers , as were Roussef and Chinese Vice President Li Yuanchao .
`` South Africa has lost a hero , they have lost a father . The world has lost a beloved friend and mentor , '' United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said to loud cheers .
`` Nelson Mandela was more than one of the greatest leaders of our time , he was one of the greatest teachers . And he taught by example . ''
The stadium , which can seat around 90,000 people , was not full , and speeches were hard to hear at times . But the celebratory mood was evident as thousands clapped and waved South African flags throughout the service .
Foreign guests included British Prime Minister David Cameron , the Prince of Wales , French President Francois Hollande and Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf .
`` It means a lot because it really is to say goodbye to an extraordinary man and to commemorate someone who did so much not just for South Africa , but also for the world in terms of the inspiration that he gave , '' Cameron told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour .
Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu and members of The Elders , a group of retired statesmen founded by Mandela and others , were also in attendance , including former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter .
The crowds cheered loudly and clapped as a huge screen showed famous faces , such as F.W . de Klerk , the last leader of white South Africa , who shared a Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela for helping to end apartheid .
Mandela 's widow , Graca Machel , and his former wife Winnie Mandela embraced and kissed as they arrived .
The world of entertainment also was well represented , with South African actress Charlize Theron and U2 's Bono in attendance . Celebrity guests also included model Naomi Campbell .
Working off plans developed for years in secret , the South African government planned to use an elite military task force , sniper teams and canine teams to help secure the stadium , CNN 's Arwa Damon reported Monday . In addition , helicopters and military jets frequently flew overhead .
The event rivaled other significant state funerals in recent decades , such as that of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1965 and the 2005 funeral of Pope John Paul II , which attracted some 2 million people to Rome -- among them four kings , five queens , at least 70 presidents and prime ministers and the leaders of 14 other faiths .
Security was also stepped up outside Mandela 's home , where crowds danced under umbrellas . Some even enjoyed the rain , jumping into puddles .
`` We want to respect our father of the nation , our father of the country . That is why we left work to pay that respect to him , '' one South African told CNN .
Send us your stories , memories and photographs of the Nobel Peace prize winner and former South African president
Crews had worked overtime Monday to prepare the stadium for the service .
The government set up overflow locations at stadiums and other facilities throughout the country .
With private vehicles banned from the area around the stadium , the government pressed buses from around the country into service and stepped up train service to move the crowds .
In Soweto township , where Mandela lived before he was imprisoned for 27 years , people waited for three hours for buses to take them to the stadium . Unfazed by the wait , they sang and danced .
While Tuesday 's memorial is the first major event honoring Mandela since his death , it wo n't be the last .
A state funeral will be held Sunday in Mandela 's ancestral hometown of Qunu in South Africa 's Eastern Cape province .
Other speakers at Tuesday 's service included Mandela 's friend and fellow anti-apartheid activist Archbishop Tutu
`` We promise God that we are going to follow the example of Nelson Mandela , '' he said to loud cheers .
Paying tribute to his uncle , Gen. Thanduxolo Mandela said his family has gone through waves of grief , sorrow and anguish after his death .
But `` today , more than any other feeling my family holds is thankfulness for that wonderful life , '' he said , also giving thanks for the outpouring of respect from around the world
`` This universal show of unity is a true reflection of all that Madiba stood for -- peace , justice , unity of all mankind . Let us pledge to keep Madiba 's dream alive . ''

The joyous cries died down as speeches from Mandela's family and friends, members of the African National Congress, as well as a fellow Robben Island prison inmate, began.

Anguished faces listened quietly as a sorrowful chant to ""Tata Madiba"" filled the air. ""Tata"" means ""father"" in Mandela's Xhosa tribe.

'The world has lost a beloved friend and mentor'

Mandela's gift for uniting foes across political and racial divides was still evident at the service.

Walking up the stairs onto the stage to deliver his speech, Obama shook hands with Castro, an unprecedented gesture between the leaders of two nations that have been at loggerheads for more than half a century.

He earlier gave a warm greeting to Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, kissing her on both cheeks, despite recent tension between the two countries over reports the U.S. government was spying on her communications.

Obama, who like Mandela was his nation's first black president, has cited Mandela as his own inspiration for entering politics.

He said his death should prompt self-reflection.

""With honesty, regardless of our station or our circumstance, we must ask: How well have I applied his lessons in my own life?"" Obama said.

""It is a question I ask myself, as a man and as a president. We know that like South Africa, the United States had to overcome centuries of racial subjugation. As was true here, it took sacrifice -- the sacrifices of countless people, known and unknown -- to see the dawn of a new day.""

The presidents of Namibia, India, Cuba and South Africa were also designated speakers, as were Roussef and Chinese Vice President Li Yuanchao.

""South Africa has lost a hero, they have lost a father. The world has lost a beloved friend and mentor,"" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said to loud cheers.

""Nelson Mandela was more than one of the greatest leaders of our time, he was one of the greatest teachers. And he taught by example.""

The stadium, which can seat around 90,000 people, was not full, and speeches were hard to hear at times. But the celebratory mood was evident as thousands clapped and waved South African flags throughout the service.

Presidents and celebrities

Foreign guests included British Prime Minister David Cameron, the Prince of Wales, French President Francois Hollande and Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.

""It means a lot because it really is to say goodbye to an extraordinary man and to commemorate someone who did so much not just for South Africa, but also for the world in terms of the inspiration that he gave,"" Cameron told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.

Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu and members of The Elders, a group of retired statesmen founded by Mandela and others, were also in attendance, including former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.

The crowds cheered loudly and clapped as a huge screen showed famous faces, such as F.W. de Klerk, the last leader of white South Africa, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela for helping to end apartheid.

Mandela's widow, Graca Machel, and his former wife Winnie Mandela embraced and kissed as they arrived.

The world of entertainment also was well represented, with South African actress Charlize Theron and U2's Bono in attendance. Celebrity guests also included model Naomi Campbell.

Tight security

With 91 heads of state attending, security was tight.

Working off plans developed for years in secret, the South African government planned to use an elite military task force, sniper teams and canine teams to help secure the stadium, CNN's Arwa Damon reported Monday. In addition, helicopters and military jets frequently flew overhead.

U.S. officials said they were satisfied with security arrangements.

The event rivaled other significant state funerals in recent decades, such as that of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1965 and the 2005 funeral of Pope John Paul II, which attracted some 2 million people to Rome -- among them four kings, five queens, at least 70 presidents and prime ministers and the leaders of 14 other faiths.

Security was also stepped up outside Mandela's home, where crowds danced under umbrellas. Some even enjoyed the rain, jumping into puddles.

""We want to respect our father of the nation, our father of the country. That is why we left work to pay that respect to him,"" one South African told CNN.

State funeral on Sunday

Crews had worked overtime Monday to prepare the stadium for the service.

The government set up overflow locations at stadiums and other facilities throughout the country.

With private vehicles banned from the area around the stadium, the government pressed buses from around the country into service and stepped up train service to move the crowds.

In Soweto township, where Mandela lived before he was imprisoned for 27 years, people waited for three hours for buses to take them to the stadium. Unfazed by the wait, they sang and danced.

While Tuesday's memorial is the first major event honoring Mandela since his death, it won't be the last.

A state funeral will be held Sunday in Mandela's ancestral hometown of Qunu in South Africa's Eastern Cape province.

Other speakers at Tuesday's service included Mandela's friend and fellow anti-apartheid activist Archbishop Tutu

""We promise God that we are going to follow the example of Nelson Mandela,"" he said to loud cheers.

Mandela family members, including his grandchildren, also spoke.

Paying tribute to his uncle, Gen. Thanduxolo Mandela said his family has gone through waves of grief, sorrow and anguish after his death.

But ""today, more than any other feeling my family holds is thankfulness for that wonderful life,"" he said, also giving thanks for the outpouring of respect from around the world

""This universal show of unity is a true reflection of all that Madiba stood for -- peace, justice, unity of all mankind. Let us pledge to keep Madiba's dream alive.""

The turmoil in Ukraine has swept aside its president , brought about the release a prominent opposition leader and raised fears the country could break apart .
After the bloodshed in the streets of Kiev last week -- the deadliest violence Ukraine has suffered since its independence 22 years ago -- the political twists and turns came thick and fast over the weekend .
As a new week begins , uncertainty has taken a hold in the divided nation as Ukraine tries to reshape its political landscape .

The Parliament voted to oust Yanukovych , a key demand of protesters . It appointed seasoned lawmaker Oleksandr Turchinov as a new speaker who will take on Yanukovych 's duties until new elections in May .
Turchinov , a longtime ally of opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko , has promised a new interim government by Tuesday .
`` We have a legitimate source of authority in Kiev , which is the democratically elected Parliament and a democratically , constitutionally elected speaker of parliament , who is acting president , '' Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski , who helped broker a peace deal between the government and the opposition , said on CNN 's Fareed Zakaria GPS .
But Yanukovych claims he 's still in charge , saying he was forced to leave Kiev because of a `` coup . ''
`` I do n't plan to leave the country . I do n't plan to resign . I am the legitimate President , '' he said Saturday in a televised broadcast .
But acting Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said Monday that arrest warrant has been issued for Yanukovych .
`` As of this morning , a criminal case on mass killings of civilians has been opened . Yanukovych and several other officials have been placed on the wanted list , '' Avakov wrote Monday on his Facebook page .
Unclear . He made his TV broadcast from Kharkiv , a pro-Russian stronghold near the border . And he reportedly tried to board a charter plane Saturday night in the eastern city of Donetsk , but was turned away because he did n't have the right papers .
On Sunday , he was staying at his private residence in Balaklava in the southern region of Crimea , Avakov said , adding that Yanukovych is believed to traveling in three vehicles with his chief of staff .
But Avakov said he does n't know where Yanukovych was Monday .

He 's definitely not in his lavish presidential compound near Kiev that thousands of Ukrainians have now been able to explore after he fled . People have been roaming around the mansion and its vast grounds , staring at the opulence in which Yanukovych lived , including peacocks , vintage cars and a huge galleon-style riverboat for parties .
His political party appears to have turned against him , saying it blames him for the `` robbery and deception '' of the nation . It accused Yanukovych of making illegal orders that led to casualties , financial debt and shame in the eyes of the world .
But it 's notable that Yanukovych was recently in Kharkiv , in eastern Ukraine . It 's his traditional support base and a predominantly Russian-speaking region .
People in the east , the country 's industrial heartland , tend to look to Russia as Ukraine 's key ally . Many of them are suspicious of the Europe-leaning views of those in western Ukraine , who were at the heart of the protests against Yanukovych that filled central Kiev for months .
The demonstrations began after Yanukovych scrapped a European Union trade deal and turned toward Russia for financial support .
A lot of people with Russian heritage in eastern Ukraine feel that their cultural identity is under threat with the pro-European side in the ascendancy in Kiev .
`` I think that divide goes very , very deep -- it 's regional , it 's linguistic , it 's religious , '' New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof , whose father grew up in Ukraine , told CNN 's Zakaria .
In many parts of Ukraine , people have toppled statues of former Russian communist leader Vladimir Lenin , a founder of the Soviet Union . The statues are symbols of Russian pride .
In Kharkiv , a tense rift has opened up between those who want to tear down the city 's Lenin statue , one of the biggest in the country , and those who want to keep it .
Some analysts say they fear parts of eastern Ukraine could push to break away from a pro-Western government in Kiev in favor of Russia .
The task for Yanukovych 's opponents is to chart a course for Ukraine that keeps all sides on board .
Acting President Turchinov said Sunday that Ukraine is ready to talk to Kremlin to try to improve relations , but made clear that Kiev 's return to European integration would be a priority .
Russia 's ambassador to the United Nations , Vitaly Churkin , condemned what he called Western attempts to influence the outcome of the turmoil in Ukraine .
`` Either they do n't understand the consequences of what they 're doing , or they 're engaged in a very provocative game of destabilizing Ukraine and therefore Eastern Europe , '' he said in a post on his official Twitter account .
The Russian foreign ministry says it has recalled its ambassador from Ukraine to Moscow for consultations , citing `` the aggravation of the situation . ''
Everybody 's waiting to see what Russian President Vladimir Putin , a key backer of Yanukovych , does next .
`` If you look through Putin 's eyes specifically , this is his area of interest , '' said David Remnick , the editor of The New Yorker and a former foreign correspondent in Moscow .
Putin , whose country just finished hosting the Winter Olympics in Sochi , wo n't quietly let Ukraine shift into a Western orbit , Remnick said .
`` I think Putin is in a very tough , assertive mode and it has nothing to do with snowboarding , it has to do with his geostrategic , regional interests , '' he said . `` It has to do with differentiating himself from the West , morally as well as politically , and I think he 's a very tough figure to deal with now . ''
National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that it `` would be a grave mistake '' if Putin intervened militarily in the crisis .
`` The United States is on the side of the Ukrainian people , '' she said on NBC 's `` Meet the Press . '' The people expressed themselves peacefully , she said , and Yanukovych `` turned on '' the people by using violence against them .
But Washington has a delicate task getting involved in a crisis in an area that Russia sees as its backyard .
On Sunday , U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about Ukraine , expressing support for the results of the Parliament 's decisions and asking Russia not to not use military force in the country , according to a senior State Department official .
The State Department has warned U.S. citizens to defer all non-essential travel to Ukraine .
Poland 's Sikorski , meanwhile , urged Ukrainian leaders to keep dialogue open with Moscow .
`` The new Ukrainian government needs to be in touch , needs to have a conversation with Russia , which is an important neighbor , just like Poland , '' he said . `` Because , apart from anything else , Ukraine needs the lower gas price and does n't want Russia to play the separatist card . ''
There are plenty of candidates but no clear favorite yet . Turchinov , who Parliament appointed acting leader , is at the helm until elections on May 25 .
`` The challenge for the opposition moving forward from here is going to be maintaining unity , '' said CNN correspondent Phil Black .
Former world champion heavyweight boxer Vitali Klitschko has been the most well-known opposition figure during the crisis . He heads the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms party . There 's also Arseniy Yatsenyuk , a former foreign minister .
Former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko , considered a hero of a 2004 revolution against Yanukovych , was released Saturday after 2½ years behind bars .
She had lost to Yanukovych in elections in 2010 . A year later , she was sentenced to seven years in prison after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with Russia .
After her release , she addressed cheering crowds in Kiev 's Independence Square , calling Yanukovych a `` terrible dictator . ''
`` There 'll be no Ukraine but the Ukraine you want , '' she said . `` And I 'm the guarantor of that Ukraine . ''
She said Sunday that she does n't want to be considered for the nomination for prime minister , suggesting she may have her eye on the presidency .
But some observers say the protests in Kiev have fed a desire for a new , untainted generation of leaders to step forward .
`` A lot of people who made this revolution feel like this movement has created a lot of new leaders , a lot of young leaders -- that now it 's their turn , '' Julia Ioffe , senior editor at The New Republic , told `` CNN Newsroom . ''
The unrest began November , when Yanukovych turned his back on trade talks with the European Union . Instead , Russia offered to lend money to Ukraine in a deal worth billions of dollars and lower the gas prices it charges .
The Ukranian economy is struggling , plagued by corruption , inefficiency and heavy government debt .
But the pact with Russia prompted protesters into the streets of Kiev .
They stayed in the center of the city for months in a standoff with security forces that occasionally flared into the violence .
The situation worsened dramatically last week as clashes between the two sides intensified and gunfire broke out , leaving 88 people dead .
Amid the chaos on the streets , foreign diplomats stepped up efforts to find an agreement between Yanukovych and the opposition to end the fighting .
On Friday , the intense negotiations resulted in a breakthrough deal to reduce the president 's powers and roll back parts of the Constitution , which gave them to him .
Yanukovich then left the capital and security forces withdrew from key protest areas -- setting in motion the changes that unfolded over the weekend .","Story highlights Ousted President Viktor Yanukovych was in Crimea on Sunday, an official says

Hide Caption 12 of 12

It depends whom you ask.

The Parliament voted to oust Yanukovych, a key demand of protesters. It appointed seasoned lawmaker Oleksandr Turchinov as a new speaker who will take on Yanukovych's duties until new elections in May.

Turchinov, a longtime ally of opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko, has promised a new interim government by Tuesday.

""We have a legitimate source of authority in Kiev, which is the democratically elected Parliament and a democratically, constitutionally elected speaker of parliament, who is acting president,"" Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, who helped broker a peace deal between the government and the opposition, said on CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS.

But Yanukovych claims he's still in charge, saying he was forced to leave Kiev because of a ""coup.""

""I don't plan to leave the country. I don't plan to resign. I am the legitimate President,"" he said Saturday in a televised broadcast.

But acting Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said Monday that arrest warrant has been issued for Yanukovych.

""As of this morning, a criminal case on mass killings of civilians has been opened. Yanukovych and several other officials have been placed on the wanted list,"" Avakov wrote Monday on his Facebook page.

Where exactly is Yanukovych?

Unclear. He made his TV broadcast from Kharkiv, a pro-Russian stronghold near the border. And he reportedly tried to board a charter plane Saturday night in the eastern city of Donetsk, but was turned away because he didn't have the right papers.

On Sunday, he was staying at his private residence in Balaklava in the southern region of Crimea, Avakov said, adding that Yanukovych is believed to traveling in three vehicles with his chief of staff.

But Avakov said he doesn't know where Yanukovych was Monday.

He's definitely not in his lavish presidential compound near Kiev that thousands of Ukrainians have now been able to explore after he fled. People have been roaming around the mansion and its vast grounds, staring at the opulence in which Yanukovych lived, including peacocks, vintage cars and a huge galleon-style riverboat for parties.

Does the former president have any support left?

His political party appears to have turned against him, saying it blames him for the ""robbery and deception"" of the nation. It accused Yanukovych of making illegal orders that led to casualties, financial debt and shame in the eyes of the world.

But it's notable that Yanukovych was recently in Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine. It's his traditional support base and a predominantly Russian-speaking region.

People in the east, the country's industrial heartland, tend to look to Russia as Ukraine's key ally. Many of them are suspicious of the Europe-leaning views of those in western Ukraine, who were at the heart of the protests against Yanukovych that filled central Kiev for months.

The demonstrations began after Yanukovych scrapped a European Union trade deal and turned toward Russia for financial support.

Does this mean Ukraine is in danger of splitting?

A lot of people with Russian heritage in eastern Ukraine feel that their cultural identity is under threat with the pro-European side in the ascendancy in Kiev.

""I think that divide goes very, very deep -- it's regional, it's linguistic, it's religious,"" New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, whose father grew up in Ukraine, told CNN's Zakaria.

In many parts of Ukraine, people have toppled statues of former Russian communist leader Vladimir Lenin, a founder of the Soviet Union. The statues are symbols of Russian pride.

In Kharkiv, a tense rift has opened up between those who want to tear down the city's Lenin statue, one of the biggest in the country, and those who want to keep it.

Some analysts say they fear parts of eastern Ukraine could push to break away from a pro-Western government in Kiev in favor of Russia.

The task for Yanukovych's opponents is to chart a course for Ukraine that keeps all sides on board.

""They need to be inclusive,"" said Poland's Sikorski.

Acting President Turchinov said Sunday that Ukraine is ready to talk to Kremlin to try to improve relations, but made clear that Kiev's return to European integration would be a priority.

How has Russia reacted to the political change?

Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, condemned what he called Western attempts to influence the outcome of the turmoil in Ukraine.

""Either they don't understand the consequences of what they're doing, or they're engaged in a very provocative game of destabilizing Ukraine and therefore Eastern Europe,"" he said in a post on his official Twitter account.

The Russian foreign ministry says it has recalled its ambassador from Ukraine to Moscow for consultations, citing ""the aggravation of the situation.""

Everybody's waiting to see what Russian President Vladimir Putin, a key backer of Yanukovych, does next.

""If you look through Putin's eyes specifically, this is his area of interest,"" said David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker and a former foreign correspondent in Moscow.

Putin, whose country just finished hosting the Winter Olympics in Sochi, won't quietly let Ukraine shift into a Western orbit, Remnick said.

""I think Putin is in a very tough, assertive mode and it has nothing to do with snowboarding, it has to do with his geostrategic, regional interests,"" he said. ""It has to do with differentiating himself from the West, morally as well as politically, and I think he's a very tough figure to deal with now.""

What is the U.S. stance?

National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that it ""would be a grave mistake"" if Putin intervened militarily in the crisis.

""The United States is on the side of the Ukrainian people,"" she said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" The people expressed themselves peacefully, she said, and Yanukovych ""turned on"" the people by using violence against them.

But Washington has a delicate task getting involved in a crisis in an area that Russia sees as its backyard.

""This is really complicated for us,"" Remnick said.

On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about Ukraine, expressing support for the results of the Parliament's decisions and asking Russia not to not use military force in the country, according to a senior State Department official.

The State Department has warned U.S. citizens to defer all non-essential travel to Ukraine.

Poland's Sikorski, meanwhile, urged Ukrainian leaders to keep dialogue open with Moscow.

""The new Ukrainian government needs to be in touch, needs to have a conversation with Russia, which is an important neighbor, just like Poland,"" he said. ""Because, apart from anything else, Ukraine needs the lower gas price and doesn't want Russia to play the separatist card.""

Who's likely to lead Ukraine next?

There are plenty of candidates but no clear favorite yet. Turchinov, who Parliament appointed acting leader, is at the helm until elections on May 25.

The anti-Yanukovych coalition is fractious, full of different voices.

""The challenge for the opposition moving forward from here is going to be maintaining unity,"" said CNN correspondent Phil Black.

Former world champion heavyweight boxer Vitali Klitschko has been the most well-known opposition figure during the crisis. He heads the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms party. There's also Arseniy Yatsenyuk, a former foreign minister.

What about Tymoshenko?

Former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, considered a hero of a 2004 revolution against Yanukovych, was released Saturday after 2½ years behind bars.

She had lost to Yanukovych in elections in 2010. A year later, she was sentenced to seven years in prison after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with Russia.

After her release, she addressed cheering crowds in Kiev's Independence Square, calling Yanukovych a ""terrible dictator.""

She then passed on a not-so-subtle message.

""There'll be no Ukraine but the Ukraine you want,"" she said. ""And I'm the guarantor of that Ukraine.""

She said Sunday that she doesn't want to be considered for the nomination for prime minister, suggesting she may have her eye on the presidency.

But some observers say the protests in Kiev have fed a desire for a new, untainted generation of leaders to step forward.

""A lot of people who made this revolution feel like this movement has created a lot of new leaders, a lot of young leaders -- that now it's their turn,"" Julia Ioffe, senior editor at The New Republic, told ""CNN Newsroom .""

How did the changes come about?

The unrest began November, when Yanukovych turned his back on trade talks with the European Union. Instead, Russia offered to lend money to Ukraine in a deal worth billions of dollars and lower the gas prices it charges.

The Ukranian economy is struggling, plagued by corruption, inefficiency and heavy government debt.

But the pact with Russia prompted protesters into the streets of Kiev.

They stayed in the center of the city for months in a standoff with security forces that occasionally flared into the violence.

The situation worsened dramatically last week as clashes between the two sides intensified and gunfire broke out, leaving 88 people dead.

Amid the chaos on the streets, foreign diplomats stepped up efforts to find an agreement between Yanukovych and the opposition to end the fighting.

On Friday, the intense negotiations resulted in a breakthrough deal to reduce the president's powers and roll back parts of the Constitution, which gave them to him.

Yanukovich then left the capital and security forces withdrew from key protest areas -- setting in motion the changes that unfolded over the weekend.",www.cnn.com,left,FapXjMSEA3dqBSaO

""The West... wants to seize Ukraine so to speak, being solely motivated by its own geopolitical ambitions and not the interests of the Ukrainian people,"" Mr Lavrov said, according to AFP.

Russia has ordered new military exercises on its border following the Ukrainian military raids, drawing condemnation from Kiev.

Moscow has tens of thousands of troops along its side of the border and on Friday acting Ukrainian Defence Minister Mikhail Koval said they had come within a kilometre of the border.

On Thursday morning raids by Ukrainian commandos on pro-Russian checkpoints around the town of Sloviansk left at least two separatists dead.

NEW DELHI ( AP ) — Dr. L.N . Dhar vividly remembers the cold morning in Kashmir nearly 30 years ago . He left behind his plush bungalow and a prestigious job at a government hospital , becoming a refugee on the run almost overnight , with nothing but a small bag hurriedly stuffed with whatever clothes and cash he could grab .
He was heeding warnings blared over loudspeakers outside mosques in the Muslim-majority region and on graffiti on walls and windows across the main city of Srinagar .
Kashmiri Hindus got three options : convert to Islam , leave or be killed , Dhar said .
“ For a peace-loving citizen , for an educated class of people , our option was that we left that place , ” he said near his home in New Delhi . “ That was the only option . We had no other choice . ”
Now , Dhar and thousands of other Kashmiris Hindus native to the South Asian region could get an opportunity to return to their homeland after India ’ s Hindu nationalist-led government suddenly stripped political autonomy from its part of Kashmir , tightening its grip in the restive region . But many are wary .
Kashmir ’ s special status dates to 1947 , when India and Pakistan won independence from British rule . Each claimed the region , and they have fought two of their three wars over it , with each now controlling part of it .
The decision to end the status was widely celebrated by Kashmiri Hindus across India — in sharp contrast to the barricaded streets of Srinagar and sporadic but short-lived protests against the government ’ s move .
India imposed a security and communications lockdown before the Aug. 5 decision to avoid an uprising in its only Muslim-majority state , Jammu and Kashmir . Mobile phone services have yet to be restored , leaving Kashmir almost isolated from the rest of the world . A curfew is in place , and Kashmiri leaders have been detained .

Separatist political groups calling for an independent Kashmir had built weapons caches and were gaining popular support . In response to attacks by armed rebels , the Indian government in September 1990 extended a law that gave its armed forces authority to arrest or kill in Kashmir with no or little warning to try to maintain order .

NEW DELHI (AP) — Dr. L.N. Dhar vividly remembers the cold morning in Kashmir nearly 30 years ago. He left behind his plush bungalow and a prestigious job at a government hospital, becoming a refugee on the run almost overnight, with nothing but a small bag hurriedly stuffed with whatever clothes and cash he could grab.

Asked if Russia was prepared to bring its nuclear weapons into play , Putin said : `` We were ready to do it . I talked with colleagues and told them that this ( Crimea ) is our historic territory , Russian people live there , they are in danger , we can not leave them .
`` It was n't us who committed a coup , it was the nationalists and people with extreme beliefs . ''
But this was the worst-case scenario , he added , in the documentary broadcast on state-run channel Rossiya One . `` I do n't think this was actually anyone 's wish -- to turn it into a world conflict . ''
It was n't known when the interview was originally taped . It aired even as speculation mounted about Putin 's health , following an absence of several days from the public stage . He reappeared in public Monday
Before Crimea was formally absorbed by Russia , unidentified armed men had taken control of its administrative buildings and key military sites . A referendum was held on March 16 , 2014 -- a year ago to the day -- on secession from Ukraine .
Ukrainian officials at the time denied there was any threat to Russian citizens in Crimea .
On Monday , Russia 's Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said Putin had ordered Russia 's Northern Fleet and other military units to be placed on full combat alert for snap checks , state media reported .
`` The main aim ... is to evaluate the capabilities of the Northern Fleet to fulfill tasks on ensuring Russia 's military security in the Arctic , '' Shoigu is quoted as saying by Russia 's Tass news agency .
The exercise will involve 38,000 military personnel , 41 warships , 15 submarines and 110 planes and helicopters , Shoigu said , according to Tass .
In the documentary , titled `` Crimea : Way Back Home , '' Putin said Moscow had had no choice but to act .
`` Crimea is n't just any territory for us , it is historically Russian territory , '' he said .
Crimea , a Black Sea peninsula that has been part of Ukraine since 1954 , has a majority Russian population and strong cultural and historical ties to Russia . It is also home to Russia 's Black Sea fleet , at the Sevastopol naval base .
But Putin said he had never thought of `` dismembering '' the peninsula from Ukraine until Yanukovych 's ouster .
`` We can not leave this area and the people who live there to whims of fate , to let the people of Crimea be thrown under the wheels of this nationalist bulldozer , '' he said .
`` I set certain tasks . I did say what and how we should do , but immediately stressed that we would do so only if we are absolutely convinced that the people who live in the Crimea want it . ''
The vast majority of people who voted in the referendum approved secession from Ukraine . But the vote , staged while armed men controlled the region , was dismissed as illegal by Ukraine 's then-interim government in Kiev , the European Union and the United States .
The West responded with financial sanctions against selected Russian figures and Crimean secessionist leaders .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel , meeting with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in Berlin on Monday , reiterated that Europe does not consider Russia 's annexation of Crimea to be legal .
`` It is important that we work for a peaceful solution , and we will not give up before the full sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine has been restored , '' she said . `` This not only includes Crimea but also now in our daily work the areas around Luhansk and Donetsk . ''
Unrest broke out in Ukraine 's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions following Russia 's absorbing of Crimea . A fragile truce is currently in place but the conflict between pro-Russia separatists and Ukrainian forces there has claimed thousands of lives .
Merkel warned that the European Union was ready to impose more sanctions if necessary against Russian interests to help ensure that a peace plan hammered out in Minsk , Belarus , last month is fully implemented .
Putin told the documentary-makers he was certain the United States was behind the ouster of Yanukovych , which Moscow views as an illegal armed coup .
`` Formally , the opposition was primarily supported by Europeans , but we knew very well ... that the real puppeteers were our American partners and friends . It was them who helped prepare nationalists ( and ) combat troops , '' he said .
He also said that sanctions should have been imposed against those who orchestrated what he called a coup , rather than those involved in Crimea 's annexation .
Putin insisted in remarks to reporters last month that there was no chance Crimea would be returned to Ukraine .
In the documentary , Putin said Russia 's Bastion high-precision coastal missile defense systems had been deployed to Crimea to protect the territory -- `` in such a way that they were seen perfectly well from outer space . ''

'Nationalist bulldozer'

In the documentary, titled ""Crimea: Way Back Home,"" Putin said Moscow had had no choice but to act.

""Crimea isn't just any territory for us, it is historically Russian territory,"" he said.

Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula that has been part of Ukraine since 1954, has a majority Russian population and strong cultural and historical ties to Russia. It is also home to Russia's Black Sea fleet, at the Sevastopol naval base.

But Putin said he had never thought of ""dismembering"" the peninsula from Ukraine until Yanukovych's ouster.

He also said that sanctions should have been imposed against those who orchestrated what he called a coup, rather than those involved in Crimea's annexation.

Putin insisted in remarks to reporters last month that there was no chance Crimea would be returned to Ukraine.

And it appears Russia is taking no chances.

The photos, according to the State Department, were taken after flight MH17 was shot down, indicating that the incident has not chastened Russia's attacks on Ukraine.

On Thursday, State Department spokesperson Marie Harf told Reuters that the US had ""evidence that Russia is firing artillery from within Russia to attack Ukrainian military positions."" She added that ""the Russians intend to deliver heavier and more powerful multiple rocket launchers to the separatist forces in Ukraine.""

The US, with these announcements, is clearly trying to at least deter Putin from deepening his military involvement in eastern Ukraine. But the fact that Russia continues to escalate there is a sign that something bigger will have to happen for Putin to step back from the region.",www.vox.com,left,UPAZAFMIrMnI1j5K

""It looks like a 50-mile-wide tornado"" flattened everything in and around the city of Tacloban.

That's how Marine Brig. Gen. Paul Kennedy put it Tuesday on Morning Edition. Kennedy, who has flown over the areas where Haiyan hit, spoke with NPR's Linda Wertheimer.

The area, ""as you would expect with 200 mph winds and a 25-foot tidal surge, looks like a bomb went off,"" he said. ""Virtually all of the structures, if they were not made out of concrete or steel, are gone.""

The first priority, Kennedy said, is getting shelter to the survivors. Food, water and medical supplies are also on the way. The U.S., U.K., Australia and Japan are among the nations who are rushing help to the scene. Dozens of international relief groups and U.N. agencies are also there.

On Monday, the U.S. State Dept. announced it is ""cooperating with the Philippines Typhoon Disaster Relief Fund established by The mGive Foundation, a U.S. nonprofit organization, to coordinate donations via mobile phones to benefit victims of the typhoon.""

Officially, the Filipino government reports, the death toll as of Tuesday morning (in the U.S.) stood at 1,774. Authorities are still warning, however, that it's likely more people were killed (note: we wrote about the 10,000 figure at 7 a.m. ET; as you can see at the top of this post, since then the president of the Philippines has said the death toll is likely to be less).

The latest estimate from the government is that about 7 million people were affected by Friday's massive storm. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has a larger figure: 9.8 million. The U.N. also estimates that at least 660,000 of the affected people were forced to evacuate their homes. As of Tuesday morning, the Filipino government said, there were about 320,000 people being sheltered in evacuation centers.

After it disappeared en route from Paris to Cairo last week , some debris from the plane -- including life vests , personal belongings and parts of wreckage -- has been recovered .
Small fragments of human remains have also been found , and officials in the Egyptian capital are trying to identify and match them to victims . Families of the victims have nearly completed giving DNA samples to help with the grim task , EgyptAir 's vice chairman Ahmed Adel told CNN on Tuesday .
But it remains too early to determine from examining the remains whether or not there was an explosion on the flight , an official at the morgue told CNN .
Adel said that media reports suggesting otherwise were `` all speculation . ''
`` Any high velocity impact leads to defragmentations , and this is not indicative of what caused the accident , '' he said . `` Let 's not jump to conclusions . ''
A key focus of the search is for the plane 's fuselage and the critical black boxes , which are expected to provide vital clues about what happened to the aircraft . Adel said EgyptAir had no information about the location of the fuselage , and that the multinational search team was focusing on an area `` about the size of Connecticut . ''
At the heart of the confusion over the final moments of the flight are conflicting reports from Greek and Egyptian authorities .
The flight was at 37,000 feet when it lost contact above the Mediterranean early on May 19 , shortly before the aircraft was scheduled to exit Greek airspace and enter Egyptian airspace .
Initially , Greek Defense Minister Panos Kammenos said that , upon entering Egyptian airspace , the aircraft swerved `` 90 degrees left and then 360 degrees '' before plunging dramatically .
The head of Egypt 's National Air Navigation Services Company is challenging that account . Administrative board chairman Mohi El-Din Azmi told Egyptian state-run media Al-Ahram on Sunday that the plane did not swerve or lose altitude before it disappeared off the radar .
JUST WATCHED EgyptAir crash : Intensifying hunt for black boxes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH EgyptAir crash : Intensifying hunt for black boxes 03:15
Asked Tuesday about the conflicting accounts , Adel said that `` the decisive information is going to come from the black boxes , and they have not been retrieved yet . ''
Time is working against the investigators -- as is the scope of the search area , with teams searching in waters as much as 10,000 feet deep . Egyptian and French submersibles are working in the area , in an attempt to find the flight data and cockpit voice recorders before their transponder batteries expire .
`` The investigators are up against the clock , '' said aviation analyst Justin Green . `` If they do n't find the black boxes in the next 30 days the job of finding them is going to be much harder because the black boxes may no longer be sending out a sonar ping which will help them identify it . ''
A representative of an organization devoted to families of French passengers said relatives are n't sure they can trust the Egyptian investigation and want more involvement from France .
Stephane Gicquel , secretary general of the French National Federation of the Victims of Catastrophes , said `` there will be a way to track the investigation put in place by the French government with an appointed official to defend the interests of the families in the weeks and years to come . ''
Gicquel said the families are distrustful of Egypt , in part due to how the country `` cooperated very badly with the French authorities '' during the investigation of the 2004 crash of a jet carrying mostly French tourists taking off from the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh .
JUST WATCHED Egyptian minister : 'Wait for the process to finish ' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Egyptian minister : 'Wait for the process to finish ' 02:56
Egyptian government and airline officials have promised to be transparent in the investigation into what happened to the plane .
The Egyptian Civil Aviation Ministry investigative committee is being led by Ayman al-Moqadem , the investigator also in charge of the inquiry into the October crash of a Russian Metrojet airliner over Sinai . That disaster , which killed all 224 aboard , is widely believed to be the work of terrorists .
A preliminary report of the investigation will be available within a month , Moqadem told state media Sunday .
On Saturday , French aviation officials revealed that an automated system aboard the plane sent messages about smoke in the front of the aircraft just before it crashed into the sea early Thursday en route from Paris to Cairo .
France 's revelation confirmed flight data that CNN obtained from an Egyptian source . That technical data -- transmitted through Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System , or ACARS , which sends messages between planes and ground facilities -- shows the plane transmitted 11 electronic messages after it departed Paris .
The first two messages showed engines were functional , but the next message at 00:26 GMT stated a rise in the co-pilot window temperature and sent out messages of smoke in locations such as the lavatory and avionics compartment below the cockpit . The alerts continued until the plane vanished from radar screens .
Flight data show smoke alerts on the plane minutes before the crash early Thursday .
A screen grab of data has time stamps that match the approximate time the aircraft went missing , although aviation experts cautioned the alerts do n't necessarily mean a fire occurred on the Airbus A320 or that the crew even knew about the alerts , which are automatically transmitted .
There have been electrical problems with window anti-ice heaters in A320s . In 2003 , the Federal Aviation Administration required windshields replaced in all A320s in the United States . It 's not known whether Egypt followed the FAA directive .
Before takeoff on the night of May 18 , one of the pilots signed a technical log asserting that the plane was in normal condition , with no technical issues , Al-Ahram reported . The Egyptian outlet published images of the log ; the details are in line with French authorities ' assertion that the plane had passed inspection before takeoff .
With little physical evidence , the possibilities about what happened to the plane remain wide open , from a bomb to a mechanical malfunction to pilot error or even an intentional crash .
No group has claimed responsibility for taking down the jet , and as of now , investigators have found nothing implicating the flight crew or security officials aboard the plane , an Egyptian official said .
Checks of the passenger manifest have so far resulted in no hits on terror watch lists , officials with knowledge of the investigation said .
The jet had routine maintenance checks in Cairo before it left for Paris , the airline said . Earlier Wednesday , the jet was also in Eritrea and Tunisia , data from flight-tracking websites show .","(CNN) The search for EgyptAir Flight 804 continues, amid contradicting reports about the aircraft's final moments.

After it disappeared en route from Paris to Cairo last week, some debris from the plane -- including life vests, personal belongings and parts of wreckage -- has been recovered.

Small fragments of human remains have also been found, and officials in the Egyptian capital are trying to identify and match them to victims. Families of the victims have nearly completed giving DNA samples to help with the grim task, EgyptAir's vice chairman Ahmed Adel told CNN on Tuesday.

But it remains too early to determine from examining the remains whether or not there was an explosion on the flight, an official at the morgue told CNN.

Adel said that media reports suggesting otherwise were ""all speculation.""

""Any high velocity impact leads to defragmentations, and this is not indicative of what caused the accident,"" he said. ""Let's not jump to conclusions.""

A key focus of the search is for the plane's fuselage and the critical black boxes, which are expected to provide vital clues about what happened to the aircraft. Adel said EgyptAir had no information about the location of the fuselage, and that the multinational search team was focusing on an area ""about the size of Connecticut.""

Swerve or no swerve?

At the heart of the confusion over the final moments of the flight are conflicting reports from Greek and Egyptian authorities.

The flight was at 37,000 feet when it lost contact above the Mediterranean early on May 19, shortly before the aircraft was scheduled to exit Greek airspace and enter Egyptian airspace.

Initially, Greek Defense Minister Panos Kammenos said that, upon entering Egyptian airspace, the aircraft swerved ""90 degrees left and then 360 degrees"" before plunging dramatically.

The head of Egypt's National Air Navigation Services Company is challenging that account. Administrative board chairman Mohi El-Din Azmi told Egyptian state-run media Al-Ahram on Sunday that the plane did not swerve or lose altitude before it disappeared off the radar.

Asked Tuesday about the conflicting accounts, Adel said that ""the decisive information is going to come from the black boxes, and they have not been retrieved yet.""

Time is working against the investigators -- as is the scope of the search area, with teams searching in waters as much as 10,000 feet deep. Egyptian and French submersibles are working in the area, in an attempt to find the flight data and cockpit voice recorders before their transponder batteries expire.

""The investigators are up against the clock,"" said aviation analyst Justin Green. ""If they don't find the black boxes in the next 30 days the job of finding them is going to be much harder because the black boxes may no longer be sending out a sonar ping which will help them identify it.""

French families voice concerns

A representative of an organization devoted to families of French passengers said relatives aren't sure they can trust the Egyptian investigation and want more involvement from France.

Stephane Gicquel, secretary general of the French National Federation of the Victims of Catastrophes, said ""there will be a way to track the investigation put in place by the French government with an appointed official to defend the interests of the families in the weeks and years to come.""

Gicquel said the families are distrustful of Egypt, in part due to how the country ""cooperated very badly with the French authorities"" during the investigation of the 2004 crash of a jet carrying mostly French tourists taking off from the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh.

Egyptian government and airline officials have promised to be transparent in the investigation into what happened to the plane.

The Egyptian Civil Aviation Ministry investigative committee is being led by Ayman al-Moqadem, the investigator also in charge of the inquiry into the October crash of a Russian Metrojet airliner over Sinai. That disaster, which killed all 224 aboard, is widely believed to be the work of terrorists.

A preliminary report of the investigation will be available within a month, Moqadem told state media Sunday.

On Saturday, French aviation officials revealed that an automated system aboard the plane sent messages about smoke in the front of the aircraft just before it crashed into the sea early Thursday en route from Paris to Cairo.

France's revelation confirmed flight data that CNN obtained from an Egyptian source. That technical data -- transmitted through Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS, which sends messages between planes and ground facilities -- shows the plane transmitted 11 electronic messages after it departed Paris.

The first two messages showed engines were functional, but the next message at 00:26 GMT stated a rise in the co-pilot window temperature and sent out messages of smoke in locations such as the lavatory and avionics compartment below the cockpit. The alerts continued until the plane vanished from radar screens.

Flight data show smoke alerts on the plane minutes before the crash early Thursday.

A screen grab of data has time stamps that match the approximate time the aircraft went missing, although aviation experts cautioned the alerts don't necessarily mean a fire occurred on the Airbus A320 or that the crew even knew about the alerts, which are automatically transmitted.

There have been electrical problems with window anti-ice heaters in A320s. In 2003, the Federal Aviation Administration required windshields replaced in all A320s in the United States. It's not known whether Egypt followed the FAA directive.

Before takeoff on the night of May 18, one of the pilots signed a technical log asserting that the plane was in normal condition, with no technical issues, Al-Ahram reported. The Egyptian outlet published images of the log; the details are in line with French authorities' assertion that the plane had passed inspection before takeoff.

The theories

With little physical evidence, the possibilities about what happened to the plane remain wide open, from a bomb to a mechanical malfunction to pilot error or even an intentional crash.

No group has claimed responsibility for taking down the jet, and as of now, investigators have found nothing implicating the flight crew or security officials aboard the plane, an Egyptian official said.

Checks of the passenger manifest have so far resulted in no hits on terror watch lists, officials with knowledge of the investigation said.

The jet had routine maintenance checks in Cairo before it left for Paris, the airline said. Earlier Wednesday, the jet was also in Eritrea and Tunisia, data from flight-tracking websites show.",www.cnn.com,left,W0PFvAjVxFOh9OmW

Some countries now clashing with the United States have been foes in the past, while others are longtime allies unaccustomed to tensions with Washington.

It’s the fraying of relations with allies that has lawmakers worried the most.

“Obviously, he’s weakened them,” Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCain2020 Democrats make play for veterans' votes The Memo: Democrats confront prospect of long primary Defending their honor as we hear their testimony MORE (R-Ariz.) said of U.S. alliances. “Duh.”

Last week’s row over Qatar was illustrative of the way Trump has upended international diplomacy.

On Monday, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain cut off diplomatic ties with Qatar and closed all land, sea and air borders.

The United States is allies with all countries involved and in past disputes between the five had mostly stayed out of the fray.

But Trump took sides Tuesday, supporting the Saudi-led bloc over Qatar and taking credit for causing the rift with his visit to the region last month.

Later in the week, Trump tried to move into the role of mediator but was back to bashing Qatar during a Friday press conference.

Experts say the incident is indicative of a larger trend.

“There’s a global reshuffling going on in terms of how international relations work,” Andrew Bishop, deputy director of research for the Eurasia Group, said in an email.

“The Qatari spat falls squarely into this framework. Interestingly enough, the Saudis are replicating at a Gulf level the U.S. approach to global politics. Riyadh wants all [Gulf Cooperation Council] members to make a choice: You’re either with or against us on Iran.

Allies were also visibly uncomfortable during Trump’s NATO speech last month in which he lectured them on defense spending and did not explicitly endorse the mutual defense clause of the alliance’s treaty. Trump finally endorsed Article 5 on Friday, in response to a question from a reporter.

Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement also upset U.S. allies. New French President Emmanuel Macron has been particularly vocal, taking the unusual step of releasing an English-language video statement criticizing the announcement.

Trump may be “unnecessarily endangering” alliances with “unproductive” tension, O’Hanlon said, but the essence of the alliances, such as the welcomed U.S. military presence in various countries, remains the same.

“He could still screw it up tomorrow,” O’Hanlon added.

He declined to detail how U.S. officials came to the conclusion . It is a sentiment that has been echoed by a number of others , who believe the girls already have been moved out of Nigeria and into neighboring countries .

France joins United States, Britain, China in search for girls abducted by group

Nigeria's embattled leader vowed Boko Haram's abduction of hundreds of schoolgirls would be the terror group's undoing, even as authorities admitted Thursday the girls likely have been separated and taken out of the country.

President Goodluck Jonathan's statements come amid mounting international outrage over the mass abduction and the government's largely ineffective effort to subdue Boko Haram

""By God's grace, we will conquer the terrorists. I believe the kidnap of these girls will be the beginning of the end for terror in Nigeria,"" Jonathan said at the opening of the World Economic Forum meeting in Nigeria's capital city of Abuja.

He also acknowledged the offers of help from the United States, Britain, China and France, all of which have offered help in the weeks-old search for the girls who were snatched in mid-April from their beds at an all-girls school in rural northeastern Nigeria.

But the task of recovering the girls appeared to grow more complicated with news that U.S. intelligence believe the 276 girls have been split up.

""We do think they have been broken up into smaller groups,"" U.S. Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said.

He declined to detail how U.S. officials came to the conclusion. It is a sentiment that has been echoed by a number of others, who believe the girls already have been moved out of Nigeria and into neighboring countries.

""The search must be in Niger, Cameroon and Chad, to see if we can find information,"" former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the U.N.'s special envoy for global education, told CNN.

""It's vital to use the information to find the girls before they are dispersed across Africa, which is a very real possibility.""

The girls have not been seen since Boko Haram militants abducted them on April 14 from the Government Girls Secondary School in rural Chibok, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) west of Maiduguri and some 600 miles from the capital of Abuja.

That was followed on Sunday night by another kidnapping, with villagers in Warabe accusing Boko Haram militants of taking at least eight girls between the ages of 12 and 15.

Boko Haram leader takes a new tact

""I abducted your girls,"" he taunted in the video, first obtained by Agence France Presse. ""There is a market for selling humans. Allah says I should sell. He commands me to sell.""

Shehu Sani, a former negotiator between Boko Haram and the government, believes the group targeted the girls to force concessions from the Nigerian government -- beginning perhaps with the release of its followers from prisons.

""The fact Shekau said he would sell the girls and did not say he would kill them is a clear indication that negotiation is possible. Shekau's video is not going to be the last word from the group on the girls,"" he said.

Now, Boko Haram may be going after those trying to find the girls. On Thursday, Nigerian police said one officer was shot in the neck during a gunfight with suspected members of the group on the road between Maiduguri and Chibok.

And on Monday, Boko Haram attacked Gamboru Ngala, a remote state capital near Nigeria's border with Cameroon that has been used as a staging ground for troops in the search for the girls. Some of the at least 310 victims were burned alive.

The assault fits a pattern of revenge-seeking by Boko Haram against those perceived to disagree with the group or those who have provided aid to the Nigerian government.

'Time is of the essence'

The Nigerian government has been under fire by those who say government officials failed to take action in the hours and then days after the girls were abducted. Jonathan, who waited three weeks before speaking to the nation on the matter, and his security ministers have defended the response, saying efforts were under way but could not be disclosed publicly.

Nigeria appeared this week to admit it needed help, accepting offers of assistance from world leaders.

The United States was among a number of nations who repeatedly offered assistance to Nigeria in recent weeks, Kirby said.

The United States is sending a team of law enforcement experts and military advisers. France said Thursday that it would send a ""specialized team"" to help. The British government is also sending a small team, Prime Minister David Cameron's office said. Neither country said exactly what expertise their teams would bring.

Summit originally scheduled to address Afghanistan 's future when troops leave
As Air Force One landed in Estonia 's capital Wednesday , President Barack Obama 's message to Vladimir Putin -- only 500 miles away in Moscow -- was clear : Stay put .
Obama 's trip to the former Soviet state , ahead of this week 's NATO summit in Wales , is meant to reassure nervous Eastern Europe that Putin 's support for separatists in Ukraine does n't mean he has a free pass for territorial gains elsewhere .
In a speech in Tallinn , Obama said the vision of a Europe dedicated to peace and freedom is `` threatened by Russia 's aggression against Ukraine , '' but said NATO will not allow that aggression to go unchecked .
`` We will defend our NATO allies , and that means every ally , '' he said . `` We will be here for Estonia . ... You lost your independence once before . With NATO , you will never lose it again . ''
Added to the schedule only last month , the stop in Estonia supplements the message coming from NATO leaders gathering in Cardiff , Wales , who are set to announce the positioning of troops and equipment closer to Russia in Eastern Europe .

`` One of our goals at the summit over the next several days is to once again project unity across NATO on behalf of Ukraine 's efforts to maintain its sovereignty and territorial integrity , '' Obama said .
He added that Russia was `` paying a heavy price for its actions , '' in part through Western sanctions imposed over Ukraine , and that NATO is poised to do more to help Ukraine defend itself .
He said more European NATO members need to spend a full 2 % of their gross domestic product on defense to keep NATO strong .
The approaching NATO summit is an opportunity for these countries to pledge this , he said .
`` Estonia does it . Every ally must do it , '' he said .
The NATO leaders also must confront the separate threat of militant Islamists making gains in Syria and Iraq , and the brutal beheading of a second American by ISIS , also known as ISIL or the `` Islamic State . ''
Asked about his strategy on the extremist group , Obama said : `` The bottom line is this : Our objective is clear , and that is to degrade and destroy ISIL so it 's no longer a threat not just to Iraq , but also to the region and to the United States .
`` In order for us to accomplish that , the first phase has been to make sure we 've got an Iraqi government that 's in place , and that we are blunting the momentum that ISIL was carrying out .
`` And the airstrikes have done that . But now , what we need to do is make sure that we 've got the regional strategy in place that can support an ongoing effort , not just in the air , but on the ground , to move that forward . ''
The original reason for the summit was to determine how NATO 's mission will proceed in Afghanistan when combat troops depart at the end of the year .
But the global unrest , while causing political strife for Obama in the United States , could provide a new purpose for the 65-year-old NATO alliance , which is suffering an `` identity crisis , '' according to one analyst .
Putin 's actions in Russia have `` required NATO to really adapt and change fairly dramatically , '' said Heather Conley , who directs the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
`` In some ways , NATO should thank Vladimir Putin , because it was really searching for its purpose , '' Conley said .

NATO members that border Russia , watching the once unthinkable breach of Ukraine 's borders , are looking to the military alliance to affirm its commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty 's Article 5 , which provides for collective defense of states under attack .
Ukraine is n't a NATO member , though leaders did invite the country 's new President , Petro Poroshenko , to Wales this week . Other former Soviet states , like Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania , joined NATO in the past decade , hoping to bolster ties to the West while increasing their own security frameworks .
As reassurance to those countries , NATO leaders plan to approve the creation of a `` high-readiness '' force that places new equipment and thousands of troops in Eastern Europe .
White House officials say the move is meant to be defensive rather than a provocation for Russia , though initial reaction from the Kremlin -- which called the move an `` external threat '' -- foreshadowed a potential escalation of the crisis .
NATO and Russia have agreed since 1997 that no permanent NATO troops will be positioned in Eastern Europe , meaning member states will rotate forces through bases closest to Russia .
Charles Kupchan , Obama 's top adviser for European affairs , said leaders will describe the new effort as a `` persistent '' force in the easternmost countries , rather than `` permanent . ''
`` We will see persistent rotation , persistent exercises to ensure that Estonia and that other countries in Central and Eastern Europe are provided the reassurance from NATO and the presence of NATO needed to meet their security needs , '' he said .
Not on the official agenda in Wales , the ongoing spread of ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria will nonetheless play a major role in Obama 's discussions in Wales .
The meeting comes after a video posted Tuesday that shows the beheading of a second American , Steven Sotloff .
The killing of Sotloff follows a threat made by ISIS last month during the videotaped beheading of American journalist James Foley . The latest video threatens the life of another man , a British citizen .

Obama has said he wants to form a coalition of governments willing to take on the group , which has taken over huge swaths of territory and terrorized ethnic minorities . Officials say that could include a role for NATO , though in what capacity is so far unclear -- after all , Obama himself has n't yet decided whether to undertake airstrikes against ISIS in Syria .
Western European leaders must also confront the growing threat of `` homegrown terrorism '' -- citizens leaving to fight with militant groups in Syria and Iraq , and potentially returning to stage a terror attack at home .
The host of the NATO summit , British Prime Minister David Cameron , already announced new measures to combat that threat after a London-accented militant was filmed beheading journalist James Foley .
`` There will have to be an acknowledgment that individual European countries , and certainly the United States , are taking action , actively working militarily on issues relating to Iraq and then potentially Syria , '' said Kathleen Hicks , the director of the international security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
Just as the United States is anxiously watching the final outcome of Afghanistan 's recent election , NATO member states are wondering what their role will be there after this year ends .
Both candidates in the contested vote have said they 'll sign an agreement allowing U.S. troops to remain there past 2014 . But without a winner , the Bilateral Security Agreement remains unsigned .
Hanging over the decision is the security situation in Iraq , which completely unraveled after U.S. troops ' withdrawal . Neither Obama nor his NATO counterparts want the same thing to happen in Afghanistan .
`` We 're moving into a world in which NATO will be less salient in Afghanistan , but in which we want to capitalize on the lessons that we 've learned , the partnerships that we 've built , '' Kupchan said .
NATO last admitted new members in 2009 , but leaders are quick to note this year 's summit is n't about expansion .
The appetite for letting countries like Bosnia and Macedonia -- labeled `` aspirant countries '' -- into the club has waned . It 's hard enough to get the 28 current members to agree on things , officials say .
Case in point : NATO is having a tough time convincing its members to spend more on their militaries , a requirement for membership . The United States spends about 4.4 % of its gross domestic product on defense , according to NATO figures ; the European average is 1.6 % .
NATO 's guidelines encourage countries to spend at least 2 % of their GDP on defense .
`` Part of the reason I think this NATO meeting is going to be so important is to refocus attention on the critical function that NATO plays to make sure that every country is contributing in order to deliver on the promise of our Article 5 assurances , '' Obama said at a news conference last week .
But analysts say that as long as economic conditions in Europe remain bleak , countries will remain hesitant to ramp up their military spending , even as external threats grow .
`` The Ukraine crisis has been a wake-up call , '' said Conley , the Europe program director at CSIS . `` Now , whether the Europeans will hit the snooze button or not , again , I do n't know , but it has certainly shaken them , that they have allowed their military defense spending to atrophy to a point where they are now vulnerable .

Warning Putin

NATO members that border Russia, watching the once unthinkable breach of Ukraine's borders, are looking to the military alliance to affirm its commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty's Article 5, which provides for collective defense of states under attack.

Ukraine isn't a NATO member, though leaders did invite the country's new President, Petro Poroshenko, to Wales this week. Other former Soviet states, like Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, joined NATO in the past decade, hoping to bolster ties to the West while increasing their own security frameworks.

As reassurance to those countries, NATO leaders plan to approve the creation of a ""high-readiness"" force that places new equipment and thousands of troops in Eastern Europe.

White House officials say the move is meant to be defensive rather than a provocation for Russia, though initial reaction from the Kremlin -- which called the move an ""external threat"" -- foreshadowed a potential escalation of the crisis.

NATO and Russia have agreed since 1997 that no permanent NATO troops will be positioned in Eastern Europe, meaning member states will rotate forces through bases closest to Russia.

Charles Kupchan, Obama's top adviser for European affairs, said leaders will describe the new effort as a ""persistent"" force in the easternmost countries, rather than ""permanent.""

""We will see persistent rotation, persistent exercises to ensure that Estonia and that other countries in Central and Eastern Europe are provided the reassurance from NATO and the presence of NATO needed to meet their security needs,"" he said.

Battling ISIS

Not on the official agenda in Wales, the ongoing spread of ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria will nonetheless play a major role in Obama's discussions in Wales.

The meeting comes after a video posted Tuesday that shows the beheading of a second American, Steven Sotloff.

The killing of Sotloff follows a threat made by ISIS last month during the videotaped beheading of American journalist James Foley. The latest video threatens the life of another man, a British citizen.

Obama has said he wants to form a coalition of governments willing to take on the group, which has taken over huge swaths of territory and terrorized ethnic minorities. Officials say that could include a role for NATO, though in what capacity is so far unclear -- after all, Obama himself hasn't yet decided whether to undertake airstrikes against ISIS in Syria.

Western European leaders must also confront the growing threat of ""homegrown terrorism"" -- citizens leaving to fight with militant groups in Syria and Iraq, and potentially returning to stage a terror attack at home.

The host of the NATO summit, British Prime Minister David Cameron, already announced new measures to combat that threat after a London-accented militant was filmed beheading journalist James Foley.

""There will have to be an acknowledgment that individual European countries, and certainly the United States, are taking action, actively working militarily on issues relating to Iraq and then potentially Syria,"" said Kathleen Hicks, the director of the international security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Afghanistan's future

Just as the United States is anxiously watching the final outcome of Afghanistan's recent election, NATO member states are wondering what their role will be there after this year ends.

Both candidates in the contested vote have said they'll sign an agreement allowing U.S. troops to remain there past 2014. But without a winner, the Bilateral Security Agreement remains unsigned.

Hanging over the decision is the security situation in Iraq, which completely unraveled after U.S. troops' withdrawal. Neither Obama nor his NATO counterparts want the same thing to happen in Afghanistan.

""We're moving into a world in which NATO will be less salient in Afghanistan, but in which we want to capitalize on the lessons that we've learned, the partnerships that we've built,"" Kupchan said.

No expansion

NATO last admitted new members in 2009, but leaders are quick to note this year's summit isn't about expansion.

The appetite for letting countries like Bosnia and Macedonia -- labeled ""aspirant countries"" -- into the club has waned. It's hard enough to get the 28 current members to agree on things, officials say.

Case in point: NATO is having a tough time convincing its members to spend more on their militaries, a requirement for membership. The United States spends about 4.4% of its gross domestic product on defense, according to NATO figures; the European average is 1.6%.

NATO's guidelines encourage countries to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense.

""Part of the reason I think this NATO meeting is going to be so important is to refocus attention on the critical function that NATO plays to make sure that every country is contributing in order to deliver on the promise of our Article 5 assurances,"" Obama said at a news conference last week.

But analysts say that as long as economic conditions in Europe remain bleak, countries will remain hesitant to ramp up their military spending, even as external threats grow.

""The Ukraine crisis has been a wake-up call,"" said Conley, the Europe program director at CSIS. ""Now, whether the Europeans will hit the snooze button or not, again, I don't know, but it has certainly shaken them, that they have allowed their military defense spending to atrophy to a point where they are now vulnerable.""",www.cnn.com,left,EetbBFZPeInWvUNE

Tymoshenko, the blond-braided heroine of the 2004 Orange Revolution, is back on the political scene after having been freed from prison.

The current protest movement in Ukraine has been in large part a fight for the country's economic future -- for better jobs and prosperity.

Ukraine has a large potential consumer market, an educated workforce, a significant industrial base and good natural resources, in particular rich farmland. Yet its economy is in tatters.

Ukraine has struggled with corruption, bad government and short-sighted reliance on cheap gas from Russia. Political unrest has pushed up the deficit, sent the currency skidding and may have pushed the economy back into a recession.

ATHENS — There was a time, a week ago, when the Obama White House was focused on questions like who would take over tending to the first lady's vegetable garden.

Now President Barack Obama is setting out on what was supposed to be a fun post-election farewell trip to Greece and Germany with not just his entire domestic record at risk of being gutted by President-elect Donald Trump, but transatlantic new order he cultivated is in the midst of being rejected. His failure to convince people against Brexit no longer looks like a fluke: British voters recoiled at his campaigning for Remain in the spring, and last week, many from his own coalition of voters weren’t compelled by his warnings that Trump would be a threat to all the progress his administration had made and to the safety of the world.

Putin’s government put out a statement on his call with Trump, during which according to the they “not only agreed on the absolutely unsatisfactory state of bilateral relations but also expressed support for active joint efforts to normalize relations and pursue constructive cooperation on the broadest possible range of issues”—words likely to set off a panic in many Eastern European capitals.

And, in a signal that the Kremlin expects the sanctions enacted after Russia’s seizure of Crimea to disappear, the statement added: “They emphasized the importance of establishing a reliable foundation for bilateral ties by developing the trade and economic component.”

The president-elect’s transition team gave only a cursory account of this call, and made no apparent effort to correct or amend Russia’s version of the conversation.

A revamped relationship with Russia could lead to inviting Putin to rejoin the group of leading nations to make the G7 into the G8 again, reversing the decision that booted Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.

At the very least, the next G7 meeting scheduled for May in Sicily is going to look very different from the one Obama attended in Japan this past spring. Other than Merkel, who’s up next October, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose election last October represented to many of the president’s supporters the ascent of an Obama-generation progressive, could be the only familiar face left. Obama's compatriot David Cameron has already been replaced by Theresa May in the U.K. Italian Prime Minister Mateo Renzi, the protégé the president hosted for his final state dinner last month, faces an anti-European Union referendum next month that may force him to resign. Marine Le Pen feels empowered ahead of France’s presidential election next April. And Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe — who is rushing to New York this week to meet Trump — faces his own internal turmoil from some of his turns to the west, including sticking his neck out for the now-dead Trans Pacific Partnership, on top of Japan’s always volatile domestic politics.

On Wednesday, Obama will give a big speech here in the Greek capital that was always meant to be about the future of globalism, said deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes last week. That speech hadn't been written before the election results, he noted, so the text hasn't had to be torn up — but obviously, it's needing to be rethought.

""Look, there are certain things that have endured for decades under administrations of different parties,"" Rhodes said, holding to assumptions that Trump insisted throughout the campaign he would challenge if elected.

""The transatlantic alliance is certainly one of those. The NATO alliance is certainly one of those. We have taken steps during our time in office to reinforce the NATO alliance, to reassure Eastern European allies, to move significant military personnel and equipment to our eastern flank to ensure that those nations are reassured, and also to work with NATO on counterterrorism and deal with refugee flows.""

Knocking the “ ostentatious gesture ” of non-attendance , International Olympic Committee head Thomas Bach declared the organization “ grateful to those who respect the fact that sport can only contribute to the development of peace if it ’ s not used as a stage for political dissent , or for trying to score points in internal or external contexts. ” But the prospect of protest – by politicians , by activistsor by Olympic athletes – looms large over the games .
To parse Olympic politics , this week ███ called up the Nation sports correspondent Dave Zirin , who wrote the book `` Game Over : How Politics Has Turned the Sports World Upside Down , '' and co-authored the memoir of John Wesley Carlos , the bronze medalist whose defiant raised fist defined the 1968 Olympics . Faced with extreme anti-gay laws in Russia , Zirin predicted , “ I think that there are going to be athletes from a lot of different countries , and maybe from Russia itself , that are either going to speak out or do something. ” A condensed version of our conversation follows .
You say that this appears to be the most corrupt Olympics in history . How so ?
Well , you ’ ve never had an Olympics where there is $ 30 billion plus that seems to be just unaccounted for … There is corruption in every Olympics , but it seems like Sochi is just above and beyond anything that we ’ ve seen before . And frankly there are very tangible reasons why that ’ s the case … I think the level of graft is a surprise , but the actuality is not a surprise . Because from the very beginning — forget about the corruption , forget about the kleptocracy – from the very beginning , Vladimir Putin approached the international Olympic committee and said : My goal is not only the Olympics , staging the Olympics , I want to remake this entire region of Russia . And I ’ m going to do it by holding the Winter Olympics in a subtropical climate in the middle of what has been for the last two decades a veritable war zone .
So all of these factors together , everybody knew that this would be very expensive for the Winter Games , which are usually much less expensive than the Summer Games . But I don ’ t think anyone expected it to be the most expensive Olympics in history , and more expensive than every single Winter Olympics combined .
I hope to see a break from the very homogenous , monochromatic sporting environment that we have currently . That ’ s one of the things about the Olympics , which is why it remains so attractive to so many people , is that there ’ s an interesting break from the usual sports that are forced down our throats . So I am excited to see things like the first women ’ s ski jumping competition …
I am also excited at the prospect of activism on the question of LGBT liberation . And I ’ m excited about it because I think it ’ s going to happen on a scale that ’ s international , and won ’ t look like the United States trying to stick a thumb in Putin ’ s eye and all the rest of that , like using LGBT rights as a diplomatic shell game . But I think that there are going to be athletes from a lot of different countries , and maybe from Russia itself , that are either going to speak out or do something .
And I think we can expect political action to take place at the Olympics , because of this movement -- and because we are living in a time , Josh , of unprecedented confidence of LGBT athletes . And that being said , that doesn ’ t mean there isn ’ t still a long ways to go , but relative to where we ’ ve been , I mean the steps have been seismic in recent years .
What are some of the forms that activism could take ?
Because of Russia ’ s laws , a lot of what ’ s being planned is under lock and key . I ’ ve certainly heard some rumors of what could happen … I don ’ t even want to repeat them , one , because I ’ m not entirely sure about the veracity . Two , I ’ m not entirely sure if I wouldn ’ t be exposing people to either persecution , or if there would be preemptive steps that would prevent any kind of activism …
I do know that there are people who are very committed , and very serious . And they feel they ’ ve laid the kind of groundwork that has put Putin in the position that if they do something , they ’ re not going to get arrested . Even though there are people in the Russian parliament , the Russian Duma , who believe that according to the letter of the law they should be arrested , because they would be propagating homosexuality , and that is against the law in Russia … I think enough groundwork and enough attention has been put down that if they do choose to use that platform , that they ’ re going to have the requisite amount of cover to make it home in one piece . And obviously I hope that they ’ re correct .
Given that you coauthored `` The John Carlos Story , '' what is the lesson of that act of protest ? How does that inform how you look at this ?
I would want to give all the credit in the world to Dr. John Carlos , and all the respect in the world for standing so strongly with the LGBT community on this issue . It demonstrates his commitment to universal human rights , and his active presence on every front in the fight for human liberation . He ’ s a tremendous person .
The second thing is the lesson that John projects — the lesson that John has said explicitly — is that athletes have minds , not only bodies . And expecting athletes to just be instruments of physical excellence , yet not have an opinion in their heads about the ways in which their physical excellence has been used politically , is to deny them their humanity .
And therefore , John doesn ’ t think athletes need to speak out . John doesn ’ t think athletes don ’ t need to speak out . John thinks athletes need to be free to follow their conscience . And John always says that the lesson of his life is that it ’ s much worse to regret not doing something than to regret doing something .
The president in his State of the Union said that “ we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being , regardless of race or religion , creed or sexual orientation . And next week the world will see one expression of that commitment when Team USA marches the red , white and blue into the Olympic stadium and brings home the gold. ” Do you agree with that framing of those questions ?
No . I think a step back needs to be taken , and the first question is : Why is the president talking about symbolic LGBT resistance at the Olympics , and not actual [ ly ] speaking out in the State of the Union about [ the Employment Non-Discrimination Act ] or … taking on the fact that there are 29 states in the United States where it ’ s still legal to fire someone on the basis of their sexuality ?
… For two reasons , I have a problem with the president sending the Billie Jean King delegation with Caitlin Cahow , Brian Boitano , openly LGBT Olympians . I have a problem with it on two counts . One , I think doing that in the absence of taking on homophobia , trans-phobia in the United States is a shell game .
And the other … Barack Obama in the past has , like particularly during the Arab Spring , made mention of the fact that if the U.S. went in too aggressively to , say , topple Mubarak , for example , then that would be used as an excuse to further oppress the protesters , if they were being seen as U.S. puppets . And he said that explicitly . He understands that dynamic exists : that the U.S. is not always seen as this magnanimous force for good , and often if it comes into this internal political situation , that can be used as an excuse to crack down on dissent , and propagandize against protestors -- as saying , “ Wait a minute , there are foreign agents ” or what have you .
And I think we have to be extremely mindful of the fact that after the confetti has been cleared , after all the cameras go home , there is still an LGBT community in Russia that ’ s going to have to deal with these laws . And the question then becomes — the only question that matters , Josh , is — are the actions taken by the Olympians going to make the situation on the ground better or worse for the people who are there after the games are over ?
And I have very real concerns that by President Obama using this issue to stick a thumb in Putin ’ s eye — and everybody knows that Russia and the United States have issues that go well beyond this , from Syria , to trade , to the Middle East — that it comes across as using the protests to further the United States ’ other aims . I have to say , when you consider that the U.S. hasn ’ t said anything about its ally India , you know , a country of over a billion people , recently passing homophobic laws -- you don ’ t want to be in a position of selectively being against oppression .
How would you reform the Olympics , in terms of the economics , in terms of the structure , in terms of the content , in terms of how decisions get made ?
I think that there are two ways to go about it . Everywhere the Olympics go , they bring budget-busting economic projects , displacing people from their homes , and the utter militarization of a region . Those are true of every Olympics , whether we ’ re talking about Sochi , whether we ’ re talking about Vancouver , whether we ’ re talking about Atlanta , whether we ’ re talking about Beijing , whether we ’ re talking about Mexico City , whether we ’ re talking about Hitler ’ s Berlin .
I mean , it exists to greater or lesser degrees , but it ’ s there all the same . And so if we ’ re going to remedy , very concretely , those problems , then I think the thing that makes the most sense is having one stable Olympics set . Where the infrastructure can be built and rebuilt -- where you don ’ t have to remove people from their homes . I mean , you stick it somewhere in the world , so you don ’ t get extraordinary acts of hubris like Vladimir Putin saying I ’ m going to put the Olympics in a subtropical climate …
The other way : Well , there ’ s just a lot of people who say that in a sane world , the Olympics should be abolished , because it ’ s just about promoting nationalism . And I don ’ t go down that road entirely , because I think that there ’ s clearly , I mean , an appetite for these kind of sports to be highlighted , and there is art and beauty in these kinds of sports .
I mean , I would love it if it was organized in a way that was less nationalistic , of course . But at the same time … there ’ s a way in which I think , when we celebrate these global sports that places in other parts of the world are able to excel at , that it ’ s actually good for people in the United States to be able to witness that . Often that coverage is skewered toward U.S. athletes . But I think in and of itself , it ’ s good ; I like the concept of a global athletic festival . It ’ s something worth celebrating .
But the way it currently operates , it operates too often … like a neoliberal trojan horse . Where people are excited about the Olympics , and then all of these economic , neoliberal sporting shock doctrine measures are pushed through .
How do you see the moral or political responsibility of fans ? Whether we ’ re talking about the economic policies or the security policies of the Olympics , or the clinging to the name “ Redskins , ” or the alleged abuses in the NCAA , what kind of politics or responsibility goes with being a fan and watching a sport ?
Well , I think the first thing is people got to stop -- I mean , you have seen recently this ferocious pushback from the right wing on this , that is trying to frame this as a left-wing , right-wing issue … These are pretty clearly right or wrong issues . Like , either we are going to have racist team names for a sport , or we ’ re not . So it ’ s not left or right ; it ’ s racism versus anti-racism …
With stadium funding , it ’ s are you for corporate welfare and taxpayers getting soaked , or are you against it ? Are you for NCAA athletes getting exploited within an inch of their lives , or do you support them fighting back ? I mean , this needs to be the way these discussions are framed . Because there ’ s a lot of injustice in sports , for the simple reason that sports are insanely profitable , and they are controlled by a small minority of people , and in that way it ’ s not that different from any other big business .
But the main difference is that I think we have some sort of collective sense of ownership of sports … Who the hell roots for Exxon Mobile over British Petroleum ? ... You say , “ This is my team. ” You don ’ t say , “ This is my gas station. ” And I think that because people have that sense of ownership , they need to exercise it in ways that are more psychological , and demand what they don ’ t like about sports to change .
I mean , I decide who to root for on the basis of what I feel in my gut . There are teams I love from my youth …
But sometimes you don ’ t have a team to root for . And then I think it ’ s always fun to root for a team who , if they win , it kind of provokes an interesting discussion about sports and politics . Maybe that ’ s just me personally . That ’ s just like , for example , I just wrote this piece … If you ’ re not a Broncos fan and you ’ re not a Seahawks fan , root for the Seahawks , because if Russell Wilson , the quarterback for the Seahawks , leads his team to victory , then it really chops away at a lot of very tired tropes that surround the quarterback position : from his height , to his ability to scramble , to the fact that he ’ s a person of color , to the fact that he was a later-round draft pick . And that ’ s kind of cool , that he ’ s able to take some of these tired sports radio tropes and just turn them on their heads .
Well , I try to not root for anybody in the Olympics , honestly . I like rooting for individual stories in the Olympics . And I like just really taking in how interesting I think so many of the events are that are usually denied in mainstream sports coverage…
I think speed skating is amazing , figure skating is amazing … I mean , shoot , I can even get into curling if I ’ ve had a couple of beers .","The 2014 Winter Olympics will have their official kickoff Friday, with an opening ceremony marked in part by the absence of politicians from several high-profile countries.

world,Daily Beast,0,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/20/ukraine-is-on-the-verge-of-war-and-putin-is-to-blame.html,Ukraine Is On the Verge Of War And Putin Is To Blam,2014-02-20,Michael Weiss,"Corpses are piling up in the capital city of a European country again , and the main beneficiary of the ongoing Grand Guignol is now the celebrated master of ceremonies at an international sporting competition .
As of this writing , Ukraine is drawing to a close the bloodiest day of a 72-hour pogrom . Dozens have been killed . The government of Viktor Yanukovych , having lost all credibility weeks ago , has decided to behave as if it now has nothing to lose and no one , outside of Moscow , to impress .
“ Government ” may in fact be too strong a term to use to describe what ’ s left of power structures . Yanukovych already appears more warlord than president . His police force has been firing indiscriminately into the crowds with automatic weapons , joined by roving gangs of loyalist paramilitary units—titushki—who are conspicuous by their own automatic weapons and their yellow arm bands , the latter to keep the police from shooting at them . Hotels have become field hospitals . Bodies of protestors have been found without heads ; others have been laid out in rows reminiscent of Aleppo .
Two Ukrainian journalists were recently yanked out of taxis and beaten savagely , one shot in the chest and killed . Evidence of execution-style gunshots with armor-piercing bullets has emerged . Ukrainian authorities , too , have been shot and killed in what now threatens to become all-out civil war and certainly has the telltale signs of one . Barricades erected line the Maidan , or Independence Square in Kiev , as they do in other cities around the country , sometimes with World War II cannons-cum-monuments . Tires and government buildings have been set alight with Molotov cocktails , their fires burning through the night amidst strangely playful green laser light shows . Before long , this mood suggests , someone ’ s tanks will be rolling into city streets in a replay of Hungary in 1956 or Prague in 1968 .
Perhaps the most salient development today was the report that Russia ’ s spetsnaz ( special forces ) have been deployed by Putin to help put down what was once a peaceful protest movement , but now is seen as a mayhem of Molotov cocktails and riots . According to Tyzhden , a Ukrainian weekly , one such officer was “ captured ” by protestors and displayed before the Euromaidan masses today , his martial insignia of a double-headed eagle , proof to many , if proof were needed , of where he came from and who ’ s actually running the show in Kiev . ( Toomas Hendrik Ilves , the president of Estonia , who knows something about Russia ’ s infiltration of its next-door neighbors , credited this report as plausible and tweeted a link to the Tyzhden article . The Russian embassy in Tallinn accused him of spreading “ lying tweets ” —before deleting the accusation . )
Why did I say it was alarming that this present state of affairs was not foreseen by the West ? Because Putin told us what was imminent . He always has the courtesy to notify in advance , even if we choose not to listen .
Sergei Glazev is his right-hand-man on Russia ’ s “ integration ” with Ukraine , which is more properly understood as re-colonization . Yanuykovych “ has a choice , ” Glazev last month told the house organ of Gazprom , Russia ’ s state-owned gas company and , up until now , Putin ’ s preferred tool for getting what he wants out of Europe . “ Either he defends Ukrainian statehood and puts down the insurrection…or he risks losing power , in which case Ukraine faces growing chaos and internal conflict with no escape to be seen . ”

As of this writing, Ukraine is drawing to a close the bloodiest day of a 72-hour pogrom. Dozens have been killed. The government of Viktor Yanukovych, having lost all credibility weeks ago, has decided to behave as if it now has nothing to lose and no one, outside of Moscow, to impress.

“Government” may in fact be too strong a term to use to describe what’s left of power structures. Yanukovych already appears more warlord than president. His police force has been firing indiscriminately into the crowds with automatic weapons, joined by roving gangs of loyalist paramilitary units—titushki—who are conspicuous by their own automatic weapons and their yellow arm bands, the latter to keep the police from shooting at them. Hotels have become field hospitals. Bodies of protestors have been found without heads; others have been laid out in rows reminiscent of Aleppo.

Two Ukrainian journalists were recently yanked out of taxis and beaten savagely, one shot in the chest and killed. Evidence of execution-style gunshots with armor-piercing bullets has emerged. Ukrainian authorities, too, have been shot and killed in what now threatens to become all-out civil war and certainly has the telltale signs of one. Barricades erected line the Maidan, or Independence Square in Kiev, as they do in other cities around the country, sometimes with World War II cannons-cum-monuments. Tires and government buildings have been set alight with Molotov cocktails, their fires burning through the night amidst strangely playful green laser light shows. Before long, this mood suggests, someone’s tanks will be rolling into city streets in a replay of Hungary in 1956 or Prague in 1968.

Perhaps the most salient development today was the report that Russia’s spetsnaz (special forces) have been deployed by Putin to help put down what was once a peaceful protest movement, but now is seen as a mayhem of Molotov cocktails and riots. According to Tyzhden, a Ukrainian weekly, one such officer was “captured” by protestors and displayed before the Euromaidan masses today, his martial insignia of a double-headed eagle, proof to many, if proof were needed, of where he came from and who’s actually running the show in Kiev. (Toomas Hendrik Ilves, the president of Estonia, who knows something about Russia’s infiltration of its next-door neighbors, credited this report as plausible and tweeted a link to the Tyzhden article. The Russian embassy in Tallinn accused him of spreading “lying tweets”—before deleting the accusation.)

Why did I say it was alarming that this present state of affairs was not foreseen by the West? Because Putin told us what was imminent. He always has the courtesy to notify in advance, even if we choose not to listen.

Sergei Glazev is his right-hand-man on Russia’s “integration” with Ukraine, which is more properly understood as re-colonization. Yanuykovych “has a choice,” Glazev last month told the house organ of Gazprom, Russia’s state-owned gas company and, up until now, Putin’s preferred tool for getting what he wants out of Europe. “Either he defends Ukrainian statehood and puts down the insurrection…or he risks losing power, in which case Ukraine faces growing chaos and internal conflict with no escape to be seen.”

The consequences for not putting down the “insurrection” were further spelled out by the Kremlin. When Yanukovych appeared to go wobbly and offered conciliatory gestures to the opposition late last month (like an Arab dictator in trouble, he sacked and swapped his cabinet, mainly for cosmetic effect, in January), Putin threatened to withhold the $15 billion loan which first enticed Yanukovych to defy the majority of Ukrainians by quashing a very modest but symbolically important association agreement with the European Union. Was it a coincidence, then, that the first day the shooting started—Monday—was also the day that Putin’s Finance Ministry announced that Yanukovych’s punishment would not be meted out and that $2 billion of that loan would instead be dispensed after all? Dialogue may get you trade agreements with Brussels, but crushing skulls gets keeps the bribes coming from Moscow.

It pays to remember that while Putin was, since his St. Petersburg days, always an obvious Chekist and mafioso, he didn’t really start to become one in the Western imagination until the end of his first term, after the so-called “color revolutions” kicked off in the former Soviet states, including and especially in Ukraine. This is because his response to these democratic ferments was to eliminate any and all possibility that they might flourish where they started or, god forbid, spread to Russia itself. His scapegoats then, as now, were the United States and Europe, which he blamed for mucking about in his backyard. So began a gradual and fitful process of re-Sovietization which, since Putin’s return to the presidency, has accelerated rapidly. That return, and that acceleration, are not coincidences either.

The Russian Putin blames the most for bungling Ukraine’s Orange Revolution is Dmitry Medvedev, erstwhile placeholder president, now relegated to the position of sinecurist premier and scapegoat for of Russia’s expanding domestic problems. Medvedev is further burdened with being the meek fool who botched the Russo-Georgian summer war of 2008 (he started it too late and finished it too early, according to Putin) and allowed NATO to depose Muammar Gaddafi with a no-fly zone. Never again, Dima.

Medvedev’s antithesis is a man named Vladislav Surkov, the variously and sporadically employed “grey cardinal” of the Kremlin, who is credited with consolidating Putin’s power, post-Orange Revolution, and conceiving of the concept of “sovereign democracy,” now Russia’s second largest export after oil. Indeed, Surkov has become the Scarlet Pimpernel of Euromaidan, allegedly spotted here, there and everywhere in Ukraine, yet existing only (so far) as a sinister rumor.

Surkovian is an adjective that Westerners would do well acquaint themselves with when trying to understand what’s happening in either Kiev or Moscow.

Phone-tapping American statesmen badmouthing their European counterparts may be pure KGB “tradecraft,” but releasing the audio for all the world to hear is a Surkovian triumph.

Events now unfolding in Ukraine threaten to be yet another, and the options to prevent civil war or the breakup of the country are dwindling. Still, there are options. My friend Edward Lucas has laid out two in Britain’s Daily Telegraph. First, help protect Georgia and Moldova, the other two former Soviet republics now in the “Kremlin’s firing line,” and strengthen our alliance with the Baltic states that keep getting mock-invaded or cyber-attacked by Russia. Second, freeze the U.S. and European-based assets of Yanukovych and his ruling “family”. These are actually very well known to sanctions monitors, and if they require additional assistance, a good place to start is at yanukovich.info.

I’d add to Lucas’ list that Washington and Brussels ought to exploit the cracks now beginning to appear in the Yanukovych monolith. His own functionaries and partisans all seem to realize their man is finished as anything other than a satrap of a revanchist empire-in-the-remaking. More and more of them are resigning, going over to the other side, or declaring their independence.

Syria 's opposition says Russian forces are hitting any opponents of President Bashar Assad — and that civilians are paying a price .
`` We want clear condemnation for the Russian brutality , and we want protection for the civilians , '' Khaled Khoja , leader of the anti-Assad Syrian National Council , said at a news conference in New York .
Criticism that Russia is targeting rebel groups in Syria began soon after the airstrikes started Wednesday .
From Moscow , NPR 's Corey Flintoff reports , `` Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the targets of Wednesday 's airstrikes were chosen in coordination with the Syrian government . ''
Corey adds , `` Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that they should rely on Russia 's defense ministry for information about the strikes , and not on the Pentagon . ''
For U.S. leaders , the airstrikes have stoked concerns that the Russian airstrikes would be used against not only ISIS , but also against moderate rebel groups — including ones that have received U.S.-backed training and support .

The fear among U.S. officials is that Russia will not discriminate and will bomb all rebel groups — including those with ties to the U.S. — to keep Syrian President Bashar Assad in power .
From Matthew Henman , head of IHS Jane 's Terrorism and Insurgency Center :
`` While at least two of the strikes targeted areas of Homs close to where the Islamic State is trying to expand westwards ... the remainder of the strikes targeted a pocket of anti-government militant control to the north of the city of Homs and on key front-line positions . These positions are where militants , including the militant Islamist coalition Jaish al-Fatah , are attempting to expand and advance from Idlib governorate into the Latakia coastal region — the bedrock of the government 's support base . ''
The airstrikes began Wednesday , only one hour after a Russian official alerted the U.S. military that warplanes would begin flying missions in Syria . U.S. and Russian officials say they 'll open communications between their military groups in the region to avoid accidents or potential clashes .
In launching the airstrikes , Russian President Vladimir Putin said he wants to prevent ISIS from increasing its influence in Russia . According to Richard Barrett , the former director of global counter-terrorism operations at British MI6 intelligence service , more than 2,400 Russians have gone to fight for ISIS in Syria — and the violent group has established itself in the northern Caucuses .

But Putin also has a broader goal , Barrett tells NPR 's Morning Edition : `` to sort of confirm his foothold in the Middle East — and his only foothold in the Middle East at the moment is Syria , and try and extend Russian influence into an area which up until now has really been the preserve of the United States . ''
Putin 's plan `` does n't make very much sense , '' Barrett says , `` because it 's easy to get into these things , but it 's difficult to get out . Maybe he does n't want to get out . But the point is , though , I think Russia ... realizes that Assad 's government is on the skids . It 's not going to survive , and certainly , there 's absolutely no hope of it regaining control over the whole of Syria . ''
Russia says it has more than 50 aircraft in the air group taking part in the strikes , and that the base they 're using in Syria is being guarded by a battalion of marines . The Russian operation is relying on drones and satellite data , reports the state-run Tass news agency .
A summary of the airstrikes that was released by Syria 's state news agency listed many targets near the city of Homs in western Syria , an area known for anti-government sentiment that is far from ISIS strongholds such as Raqqa or Palmyra .
In Syria 's new report of its military action released Thursday , the country says its forces hit `` Takfiri terrorist organizations '' — using the Arabic term for extremist Sunnis — in areas such as Quneitra province ( in Syria 's southwest corner below Damascus ) and Aleppo province .

The fear among U.S. officials is that Russia will not discriminate and will bomb all rebel groups — including those with ties to the U.S. — to keep Syrian President Bashar Assad in power.

From Matthew Henman, head of IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Center:

""While at least two of the strikes targeted areas of Homs close to where the Islamic State is trying to expand westwards ... the remainder of the strikes targeted a pocket of anti-government militant control to the north of the city of Homs and on key front-line positions. These positions are where militants, including the militant Islamist coalition Jaish al-Fatah, are attempting to expand and advance from Idlib governorate into the Latakia coastal region — the bedrock of the government's support base.""

The airstrikes began Wednesday, only one hour after a Russian official alerted the U.S. military that warplanes would begin flying missions in Syria. U.S. and Russian officials say they'll open communications between their military groups in the region to avoid accidents or potential clashes.

In launching the airstrikes, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he wants to prevent ISIS from increasing its influence in Russia. According to Richard Barrett, the former director of global counter-terrorism operations at British MI6 intelligence service, more than 2,400 Russians have gone to fight for ISIS in Syria — and the violent group has established itself in the northern Caucuses.

But Putin also has a broader goal, Barrett tells NPR's Morning Edition: ""to sort of confirm his foothold in the Middle East — and his only foothold in the Middle East at the moment is Syria, and try and extend Russian influence into an area which up until now has really been the preserve of the United States.""

Putin's plan ""doesn't make very much sense,"" Barrett says, ""because it's easy to get into these things, but it's difficult to get out. Maybe he doesn't want to get out. But the point is, though, I think Russia ... realizes that Assad's government is on the skids. It's not going to survive, and certainly, there's absolutely no hope of it regaining control over the whole of Syria.""

Russia says it has more than 50 aircraft in the air group taking part in the strikes, and that the base they're using in Syria is being guarded by a battalion of marines. The Russian operation is relying on drones and satellite data, reports the state-run Tass news agency.

A summary of the airstrikes that was released by Syria's state news agency listed many targets near the city of Homs in western Syria, an area known for anti-government sentiment that is far from ISIS strongholds such as Raqqa or Palmyra.

In Syria's new report of its military action released Thursday, the country says its forces hit ""Takfiri terrorist organizations"" — using the Arabic term for extremist Sunnis — in areas such as Quneitra province (in Syria's southwest corner below Damascus) and Aleppo province. The bulletin says many of the attacks targeted Jabhat al-Nusra, the al-Qaida affiliate in Syria.",www.npr.org,center,JKWZGQtIJz4NxRSX

After the images surged through social media, the White House on Wednesday released its own set of photos of Obama's South Africa visit. Perhaps it was no accident that among them was a picture of Obama, the first lady and the Danish prime minister.

But in this one, Obama was talking to his wife, while Thorning-Schmidt seemed preoccupied with her phone.

The ""selfie"" incident was the second unexpected controversy stirred up by the president in South Africa. Earlier, Cuban-American lawmakers publicly objected after Obama -- on his way to deliver his tribute to Mandela -- shook the hand of Raul Castro.

Ukrainian security council spokesman Col. Andriy Lysenko says Ukrainian forces were fired at using Grad missile systems from Russian territory at about 11 a.m .
Lysenko said about an hour and a half later , two columns -- including tanks and other fighting vehicles -- began an attack on a border post .
They later entered Ukraine from Veselo-Voznesenka and Maximovo of the Rostov region in Russia .
Ukrainian border guards retreated because they did n't have heavy equipment .
The incursion reported Thursday continues several weeks of Russian military action in Ukraine . Tanks , armor and soldiers have been streaming across the border , and on Thursday , NATO released several images from last week that show purported Russian tank columns .
`` This is like watching a frog boil , '' a Pentagon official told Fox News . `` They turn up the heat . ''
Meanwhile , a Russian separatist said Thursday that there were up to 4,000 Russian troops in Ukraine .
`` We have never hidden from anybody ( the fact ) there are many Russians among us , '' Alexander Zakharchenko , the prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk Poeple 's Republic , said at a press conference . `` Without their help it would be very difficult for us to fight . ''
Brig . Gen. Nico Tak , a top NATO official , told reporters at NATO headquarters that the ultimate aim of Russia was to stave off defeat for the separatists and turn eastern Ukraine into a `` frozen conflict '' that would destabilize the country `` indefinitely . ''
NATO estimated that another 20,000 Russian troops were right over the Russian border .
Tak said the 1,000 Russian troops operating inside Ukraine was a conservative estimate and provided satellite imaginary showing an incursion of great sophistication . He refused to specify exactly what the `` contact '' with Ukrainian troops was .
A leader of pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine reportedly has admitted that thousands of Russians have been fighting alongside his troops .
Alexander Zakharchenko told Russian television that he estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Russians had joined the ranks , and claimed that they were either former Russian service members or current military personnel on leave , according to the BBC . However , he also insisted that any Russians who went to flight did so voluntarily and not on orders from superiors in Moscow .
Russia 's ambassador to the EU , Vladimir Chizhov , told the BBC that `` NATO has never produced a single piece of evidence '' of Russian troops operating in Ukraine . He said the only Russian soldiers in Ukraine were the 10 captured this week , who Moscow insists had mistakenly wandered across the border .
The Russian Defense Ministry did n't directly deny its troops were in Ukraine , but said the list of Russian military units said to be operating in Ukraine had no relation to reality .
U.S. officials tell Fox News that they believe that Russian special forces are fighting in Ukraine , with one saying `` if you look at a Russian separatist , it is basically a Russian soldier . ''
A senior U.S. defense official also told Fox News that the Pentagon has seen evidence that Russia has fired artillery inside Ukrainian territory at Ukraine military positions in recent days .
`` This is not the first time , '' the official said . However , U.S. officials are not ready to declare that Russia has begun invading Ukraine .
U.S . Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt posted the following statement in three Twitter messages Thursday : `` Russian supplied tanks , armored vehicles , artillery and multiple rocket launchers have been insufficient to defeat Ukraine 's armed forces . So now an increasing number of Russian troops are intervening directly in fighting on Ukrainian territory . Russia has also sent its newest air defense systems including the SA-22 into eastern Ukraine & is now directly involved in the fighting . ''
Ukraine and its Western allies have repeatedly accused Russia of providing weapons and training to the rebels , who declared independence from Kiev in two eastern districts this past April following Russia 's annexation of the Crimean peninsula . Moscow , in turn has repeatedly denied the accusations .
Joseph Dempsey , an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London , said recent images of a military convoy in eastern Ukraine showed the presence of a variant of the T-72 tank which `` is not known to have been exported or operated outside of Russia . ''
The tanks ' presence , he added in a blog published Thursday , `` strongly supports the contention that Russia is supplying arms to separatist forces . ''
Zakharchenko 's admission that Russians had joined the ranks came as the rebels appeared to have captured the strategic town of Novoazovsk in southeastern Ukraine . On Thursday morning , an Associated Press journalist saw rebel checkpoints at the outskirts and was told he could not enter . One of the rebels said there was no fighting in the town .
Novoazovsk , which lies along the road connecting Russia to the Crimean peninsula , had come under shelling for three days , with the rebels entering on Wednesday .
The southeastern portion of Ukraine along the Azov Sea previously had escaped the fighting engulfing areas to the north . The loss of Novoazovsk could open the way for the rebels to advance on the much larger port of Mariupol .
The new southeastern front raises fears that the separatists are seeking to create a land link between Russia and Crimea . If successful , it could give them or Russia control over the entire Sea of Azov and the gas and mineral riches that energy experts believe it contains . Ukraine already has lost roughly half its coastline , several major ports and significant Black Sea mineral rights in March when Russia annexed Crimea .
President Petro Poroshenko announced in a statement published online Thursday that he was canceling a visit to Turkey for the inauguration of newly elected president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and called a snap session of Ukraine 's security council .
`` I have decided to cancel my visit to Turkey because of the sharp escalation of the situation in the Donetsk region ... as Russian forces have entered Ukraine , '' he said .
`` Destabilization of the situation and panic , this is as much of a weapon of the enemy as tanks , '' Poroshenko told the security council , according to the Interfax news agency .
U.N. Undersecretary-General of Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman opened a meeting of the U.N. Security Council Thursday telling members the latest developments mark a `` dangerous escalation in the conflict . ''
Power reminded the council that the meeting was `` the 24th session to try to rein in Russia 's aggressive acts in the Ukraine . ''
`` Every single one has sent a straightforward , unified message : 'Russia , stop this conflict . Russia is not listening , ' '' she said , adding that Russia 's force along the border is the largest it 's been since it started deploying in late May .
State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Thursday that Moscow is engaged in a `` pattern of escalating aggression in Ukraine , '' now including combat forces , armored vehicles , artillery and surface-to-air missiles .
Psaki added that the U.S. could increase economic sanctions against Russia . But she said no such decisions have been made . And to help Ukraine , she said Washington is focused on nonlethal forms of assistance and not military equipment .
Also on Thursday , a pro-government militia fighter told Reuters that in addition to taking Novoazovsk , the rebels had captured a strategic hill just east of Donetsk , one of two major rebel strongholds that Ukrainian forces had surrounded in recent weeks .
The recent reversals by Kiev 's forces have prompted claims from Ukraine that Russian forces have crossed the border in an effort to open a new front and prevent pro-government forces from dealing a decisive blow to the rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk .
In Donetsk , 11 people were killed by shelling during the night , the city administration said in a statement .","Ukrainian border guards retreated Thursday as two columns of Russian tanks streamed into the nation, prompting fears that Russia is creating a land link between its territory and Crimea.

Kennedy","NEW DELHI ( AP ) — Opposition leader Narendra Modi will be India ’ s next prime minister , winning the most decisive election victory the country has seen in more than a quarter century and sweeping the long-dominant Congress party from power , partial results showed Friday .
Modi ’ s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party was winning in enough seats in the lower house of Parliament to exceed the 272-seat majority needed to create a government without forming a coalition with smaller parties , the Election Commission said .
Full results were expected later in the day but Modi ’ s win was all but assured .
As his victory became clear , Modi appeared before a crowd of cheering supporters and noted that he is the first Indian prime minister born after independence from Britain in 1947 .
“ I would like to reassure the nation that while we did not get to fight and die for independence … we have the honor of living for this nation , ” he said .
The outcome was a crushing defeat for the Congress party , which is deeply entwined with the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty that has been at the center of Indian politics for most of the country ’ s post-independence history .
Modi ’ s slick and well-financed campaign promised a revival of economic growth and took advantage of widespread dissatisfaction with the scandal-plagued Congress party . Although he has focused strongly on the economy , Modi has given some hints of his foreign policy leanings , saying the BJP wants to strengthen India ’ s strategic partnership with the U.S. and build on the foundations laid by the last BJP prime minister , Atal Bihari Vajpayee .
Vajpayee , who governed from 1998 to 2004 , rode a bus across the border from India to Pakistan during his term , in what was seen as a bold step in trying to mend ties with India ’ s longtime enemy .
The last time any single party won a majority in India was in 1984 , when an emotional nation gave Congress a staggering victory of more than 400 seats following the assassination of then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi .
The overwhelming victory gives Modi , a 63-year-old career politician , a strong mandate to govern India at a time of deep social and economic change . India is in the throes of rapid urbanization and globalization just as the youth population skyrockets — with many new voters far less deferential to traditional voting patterns focused on family lineage and caste .
For the young Indian voters , the priorities are jobs and development , which Modi put at the forefront of his campaign .
Congress , which has been in power for all but 10 years of the country ’ s history since independence , has been plagued by repeated corruption scandals . Friday ’ s results showed Congress leading in only 42 seats , its worst showing ever .
The leader of the Congress campaign , 43-year-old Rahul Gandhi , failed to inspire public confidence . He was seen as ambivalent at best over winning a job held previously by his father , grandmother and great-grandfather .
“ I wish the new government all the best , ” Rahul Gandhi told reporters Friday afternoon , adding that he held himself responsible for the party ’ s losses .
Immediately after his appearance , his mother , Sonia Gandhi , the president of the party , took the microphone and said she assumes responsibility .
The two took no questions after their brief remarks and Rahul trailed his mother off the stage .
Rahul Gandhi , who first won a seat in Parliament in 2004 , has been viewed as prime-minister-in-waiting for his entire political career , though he never appeared comfortable in the role . When he finally gave the first television interview of his political career earlier this year it made for dull , uninspiring viewing full of vague promises .
In sharp contrast , Modi was quick to publicly mock the Gandhi scion , often referring to the Congress as a “ mother-son ” government .
There was a record turnout in the election , with 66.38 percent of India ’ s 814 million eligible voters casting ballots during the six-week contest , which began April 7 and was held in stages across the country . Turnout in the 2009 general election was 58.13 percent .
“ In the history of independent India , no political party has defeated the Congress party with such a wide margin , ” BJP President Rajnath Singh told a news conference that opened with the blowing of a conch shell , a traditional start to most Hindu rituals .
Modi ’ s campaign was seen by many as a media and marketing coup for a man whose background ties him to bloodshed in Gujarat , where communal rioting in 2002 left more than 1,000 people dead , most of them Muslims . Modi is accused of doing little to stop the rampage , though he denies any wrongdoing and has never been charged with a crime .
Modi was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 for alleged complicity in the riots , although as prime minister he would be virtually assured a visa .
The Obama administration started mending fences in February , when , for the first time in Modi ’ s decade-long tenure as the top official in Gujarat state , the U.S. ambassador met with him . Still , Modi , a Hindu nationalist , is widely seen as a divisive figure and critics have often questioned whether he can be a truly secular leader in a country with many faiths .
But Modi focused on promises of a revival in economic growth , taking advantage of widespread dissatisfaction with the Congress party .
At one point Friday , the benchmark Sensex stock index rose as much as 6.1 percent on news of the BJP ’ s strong showing before closing 0.9 percent higher than Thursday .
Sreeram Chaulia , a political analyst and dean of the Jindal School of International Affairs , said the BJP ’ s image as a purely capitalist , pro-business party resonated across India . That image contrasts with Congress , which is considered more of a welfare party , mixing capitalist reforms with handouts for the poor .
“ A lot of ordinary people believed in ( Modi ‘ s ) message and wanted to give him the strong mandate he was seeking , to see if he could really change things in India , ” Chaulia said . “ There has been growth in the middle class , so of course why have they punished the incumbents ? Because they want more , obviously , something more than subsistence . They want upward mobility . ”
Modi managed to hammer away at Gandhi — specifically the perception that he is nothing more than a feudal prince from a family that views ruling the country as its birthright .
In sharp contrast to the street parties outside the BJP office , a sober scene played out in front of Congress headquarters , where few showed up despite barricades erected to protect supporters from passing road traffic .
Jairam Ramesh , India ’ s rural development minister , lamented his party ’ s defeat but said Congress will survive .
“ I admit that in 2014 , the result is worse than our worst-case scenario , ” he said . “ But the Congress party has a deep reservoir of strength . ”","NEW DELHI (AP) — Opposition leader Narendra Modi will be India’s next prime minister, winning the most decisive election victory the country has seen in more than a quarter century and sweeping the long-dominant Congress party from power, partial results showed Friday.

Still, Modi, a Hindu nationalist, is widely seen as a divisive figure and critics have often questioned whether he can be a truly secular leader in a country with many faiths.

But Modi focused on promises of a revival in economic growth, taking advantage of widespread dissatisfaction with the Congress party.

At one point Friday, the benchmark Sensex stock index rose as much as 6.1 percent on news of the BJP’s strong showing before closing 0.9 percent higher than Thursday.

Sreeram Chaulia, a political analyst and dean of the Jindal School of International Affairs, said the BJP’s image as a purely capitalist, pro-business party resonated across India. That image contrasts with Congress, which is considered more of a welfare party, mixing capitalist reforms with handouts for the poor.

“A lot of ordinary people believed in (Modi‘s) message and wanted to give him the strong mandate he was seeking, to see if he could really change things in India,” Chaulia said. “There has been growth in the middle class, so of course why have they punished the incumbents? Because they want more, obviously, something more than subsistence. They want upward mobility.”

Modi managed to hammer away at Gandhi — specifically the perception that he is nothing more than a feudal prince from a family that views ruling the country as its birthright.

In sharp contrast to the street parties outside the BJP office, a sober scene played out in front of Congress headquarters, where few showed up despite barricades erected to protect supporters from passing road traffic.

Jairam Ramesh, India’s rural development minister, lamented his party’s defeat but said Congress will survive.

“I admit that in 2014, the result is worse than our worst-case scenario,” he said. “But the Congress party has a deep reservoir of strength.”

Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau is seen on the 27-minute video , obtained by the Associated Press , announcing the girls have converted to Islam .
`` Praise be to Allah , the lord of the world , '' chant the girls in the video , as they are seen wearing black and gray hijabs and reciting the Koran in Arabic as they make Islamic declarations of faith . Many of the girls -- who range in age from 15 to 18 -- are barefoot in the video . Some appear fearful , others desolate , and one said in the video that they had not been harmed , the BBC reported .
Three of the girls are shown speaking in the video . Two say they were Christian and have converted to Islam , while the other says she is Muslim .
`` These girls , these girls you occupy yourselves with ... we have indeed liberated them . These girls have become Muslims , '' Shekau says in the video .
The majority of the abducted girls are believed to be Christians , although there are also some Muslims among them .
Shekau also says he would release the girls in exchange for prisoners . There is no indication of when or where the video was recorded , but the location appears to be rural .
When asked about the option of trading the girls for imprisoned militants , U.S. State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said Monday , that is up to Nigeria . “ As you know , Nigeria is in the lead . We are simply supporting their efforts . As you know also the United States ' policy is to deny kidnappers the benefits of their criminal acts including ransoms or concessions , ” Psaki said at a press briefing .
The video received Monday by the AP came through channels that have provided previous messages from Boko Haram leader Shekau , who speaks in the video in the Hausa language of northern Nigeria . He is shown in military fatigues cradling an assault rifle on the video , which is imprinted with the Boko Haram insignia of a Koran resting on two crossed assault rifles and below the black Jihadi flag .
The United States put a $ 7 million bounty on Shekau 's head last year .
The video is the first sighting of the abducted girls since more than 300 were taken April 14 from their school in the northern town of Chibok by Islamist militants . Although more than 50 girls escaped their captors and are now safe , at least 276 remain missing .
The search so far has centered on the Sambisa forest , with Nigerian troops being aided by advisers from the U.S. , Britain and France .
Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren clarified the U.S. presence in Nigeria for reporters Monday , saying there are more than 50 U.S. military personnel and advisors based at the Nigerian Embassy to help “ advise and assist ” in the search for the missing girls . The teams have expertise in “ communications , logistics , civil affairs , and intelligence , ” Warren said .
`` There are no plans to put additional U.S. military forces on the ground in Nigeria , '' Warren added .
When asked about the video , Psaki said U.S. intelligence agents are hoping to use it to help rescue the girls .
“ We have no reason to question its authenticity . Our intelligence experts are combing through every detail of the video for clues that might help in ongoing efforts to secure the release of the girls , ” Psaki said .
The video emerged Monday as the Nigerian government reportedly made `` indirect contact '' with the terrorist group . The report from Sky News did not specify how the two sides got in touch , but a special adviser to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan told Sky News that Nigeria would not pay to secure the girls ' release , `` because the sale of human beings is a crime against humanity . ''
The Nigerian government has been heavily criticized for how it has conducted its search for the missing girls , who were taken after taking final exams . On Friday , the group Amnesty International claimed that Nigerian security forces were aware that a convoy of fighters from Boko Haram was approaching the town of Chibok four hours before the kidnapping , but did nothing to stop the kidnappings .
It is believed that 53 girls were able to escape the kidnappers . One of them , 19-year-old Sarah Lawan , told the Associated Press that her ordeal was `` too terrifying for words , '' and added that she was afraid to go back to school .
Boko Haram , whose name , loosely translated , means `` Western education is forbidden , '' is believed to have killed approximately 1,500 people in Nigeria so far this year , and has been waging an insurgency in the country for the past five years .
Shekau claimed credit for the abductions in a video last week , saying , `` I abducted your girls ! By Allah , I will sell them in the marketplace ! ''
`` This is a clear case of mismanagement of a small group of bandits who have been allowed to really grow into a monstrous terrorist organization that we now have , '' Atiku Abubakar , former vice president of Nigeria , told Sky News .
The search has been made more difficult by the lack of information regarding the girls ' possible whereabouts , with speculation suggesting that they have been split into four groups , with some believed to have been taken across Nigeria 's border .

Miller, David Sherfinski","Amid renewed hope Sunday that a summit next month between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will actually happen , South Korea ’ s president said that Mr. Kim committed over the weekend to a denuclearization of the peninsula and said he wants to work toward peace .
A U.S. delegation arrived in North Korea on Sunday as preparations for the talks continue . Mr. Trump announced last week he was ending them over North Korean hostilities but now says negotiations have picked back up and he spoke Sunday as if the summit was a “ go . ”
“ Our United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong-un and myself . I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day . Kim Jong-un agrees with me on this . It will happen ! ” Mr. Trump tweeted Sunday afternoon .
U.S. lawmakers said that while renewed discussions about the Trump-Kim summit are a positive step , the U.S. can ’ t give away too much and should be wary of any supposed commitments coming from Mr. Kim .
But South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Sunday that the reclusive North Korean leader is indeed committed to a full denuclearization of the peninsula , after the two leaders gathered in an impromptu meeting Saturday in hopes of jump-starting diplomatic talks once more .
Mr . Moon told reporters Sunday that Mr. Kim at a meeting at the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two Koreas “ again made clear his commitment to a complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. ” According to Mr . Moon , the North Korean leader said he ’ s willing to cooperate to end confrontation and work toward peace for the sake of a successful North Korea-U.S. summit .
Mr . Moon said he told Mr. Kim in return that Mr. Trump has a “ firm resolve ” to end hostile relations with North Korea and initiate economic cooperation if Pyongyang implements “ complete denuclearization . ”
According to the State Department , the U.S. team met with North Korean officials at the same DMZ site , the village of Panmunjom . The U.S. delegation reportedly included Sung Kim , U.S. ambassador to the Philippines and a former U.S. special representative for North Korea policy .
“ We ’ re looking at June 12 in Singapore . That hasn ’ t changed , ” Mr. Trump told reporters earlier the weekend .
Mr. Trump called off the summit Thursday following threats of nuclear war from North Korea , only to give fresh hope Friday that negotiations to stage the summit were in the works .
“ I think people want to see if we can get the meeting and get something done , ” Mr. Trump said . “ We get that done and we can be successful in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula , that would be a great thing for North Korea , it would be a great thing for South Korea , it would be great for Japan , it would be great for the world , it would be great for the United States , it would be great for China . ”
But Mr . Moon also made clear that any steps to dial back Mr. Kim ’ s nuclear capabilities could come with strings attached .
“ What Kim is unclear about is that he has concerns about whether his country can surely trust the United States over its promise to end hostile relations ( with North Korea ) and provide a security guarantee if they do denuclearization , ” Mr . Moon said .
The North has previously used the term “ denuclearization ” to demand the United States pull out its 28,500 troops in South Korea and withdraw its so-called “ nuclear umbrella ” security commitment to South Korea and Japan . The North hasn ’ t specified those demands during Mr. Kim ’ s sudden outreach to Seoul and Washington in recent months .
Mr . Moon has insisted Mr. Kim can be persuaded to abandon his nuclear facilities , materials and bombs in a verifiable and irreversible way in exchange for credible security and economic guarantees . Mr . Moon said Sunday that the North ’ s disarmament could be still be a difficult process even if Pyongyang , Washington and Seoul don ’ t differ over what “ complete denuclearization ” of the peninsula means .
Members of Congress said the devil , as is always the case with North Korea , will be in the details .
“ We ’ ve got the South Korean president , I believe , providing a great benefit in this discussion , unless we are not all communicating in the same way , ” said Sen. Roy Blunt , Missouri Republican , on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
“ You know , what does denuclearization mean ? What do they expect to see happen ? And I think these talks can produce results . But we need results and they need to be very visible before the United States creates any benefits , ” he said .
Sen. Marco Rubio , Florida Republican , said he ’ s skeptical that Mr. Kim will agree to completely give up his country ’ s nuclear capabilities , saying the leader has an almost emotional attachment to them and that they make him feel prestigious and powerful .
“ Ultimately , I remain convinced that he does not want to denuclearize — in fact , he will not denuclearize . But he wants to give off this perception that he ’ s this open leader , that he ’ s peaceful , that he ’ s reasonable , ” Mr. Rubio said on ABC ’ s “ This Week . ”
Sen. Chris Coons , Delaware Democrat , said even offering North Korea a summit with the U.S. president is a significant concession , while also saying it ’ s important that North Korea has freed several Americans the country was holding as a confidence-building measure .
“ But let ’ s be clear — twice before North Korea under Kim Jong-un ’ s father committed to full denuclearization in six party talks in 2005 , in 2007 … only to then change their tune , ” Mr. Coons said on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
“ So we ’ re going to have to be very focused , very engaged , ” Mr. Coons said . “ I am hopeful that Secretary [ of State Mike ] Pompeo will brief and engage Congress . And I ’ m hopeful that we ’ ll work together to make sure that this summit is a success . ”
Even Mr. Trump ’ s critics have credited the president for his negotiating skills in his recent dealings with Mr. Kim , and calling the summit a positive step .
“ In some ways , Kim Jong-un may have met his match here with our very unconventional president , ” said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper on CNN ’ s “ State of the Union . ”
Mr. Clapper , who ’ s publicly butted heads with Mr. Trump over issues related to Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s probe , said a summit would be good regardless of whether there is any sort of agreement .
“ Having gone this far , there is value in meeting and greeting , gripping and grinning , and just establishing a rapport , ” he said . “ Yes — I think it would be important to have the summit . ”
• This article was based in part on wire service reports .","The on-again, off-again summit seems to be on again.

But South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Sunday that the reclusive North Korean leader is indeed committed to a full denuclearization of the peninsula, after the two leaders gathered in an impromptu meeting Saturday in hopes of jump-starting diplomatic talks once more.

Mr. Moon told reporters Sunday that Mr. Kim at a meeting at the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two Koreas “again made clear his commitment to a complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” According to Mr. Moon, the North Korean leader said he’s willing to cooperate to end confrontation and work toward peace for the sake of a successful North Korea-U.S. summit.

Mr. Moon said he told Mr. Kim in return that Mr. Trump has a “firm resolve” to end hostile relations with North Korea and initiate economic cooperation if Pyongyang implements “complete denuclearization.”

According to the State Department, the U.S. team met with North Korean officials at the same DMZ site, the village of Panmunjom. The U.S. delegation reportedly included Sung Kim, U.S. ambassador to the Philippines and a former U.S. special representative for North Korea policy.

“We’re looking at June 12 in Singapore. That hasn’t changed,” Mr. Trump told reporters earlier the weekend.

Mr. Trump called off the summit Thursday following threats of nuclear war from North Korea, only to give fresh hope Friday that negotiations to stage the summit were in the works.

“I think people want to see if we can get the meeting and get something done,” Mr. Trump said. “We get that done and we can be successful in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, that would be a great thing for North Korea, it would be a great thing for South Korea, it would be great for Japan, it would be great for the world, it would be great for the United States, it would be great for China.”

But Mr. Moon also made clear that any steps to dial back Mr. Kim’s nuclear capabilities could come with strings attached.

“What Kim is unclear about is that he has concerns about whether his country can surely trust the United States over its promise to end hostile relations (with North Korea) and provide a security guarantee if they do denuclearization,” Mr. Moon said.

The North has previously used the term “denuclearization” to demand the United States pull out its 28,500 troops in South Korea and withdraw its so-called “nuclear umbrella” security commitment to South Korea and Japan. The North hasn’t specified those demands during Mr. Kim’s sudden outreach to Seoul and Washington in recent months.

Mr. Moon has insisted Mr. Kim can be persuaded to abandon his nuclear facilities, materials and bombs in a verifiable and irreversible way in exchange for credible security and economic guarantees. Mr. Moon said Sunday that the North’s disarmament could be still be a difficult process even if Pyongyang, Washington and Seoul don’t differ over what “complete denuclearization” of the peninsula means.

Members of Congress said the devil, as is always the case with North Korea, will be in the details.

“We’ve got the South Korean president, I believe, providing a great benefit in this discussion, unless we are not all communicating in the same way,” said Sen. Roy Blunt, Missouri Republican, on “Fox News Sunday.”

“You know, what does denuclearization mean? What do they expect to see happen? And I think these talks can produce results. But we need results and they need to be very visible before the United States creates any benefits,” he said.

Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, said he’s skeptical that Mr. Kim will agree to completely give up his country’s nuclear capabilities, saying the leader has an almost emotional attachment to them and that they make him feel prestigious and powerful.

“Ultimately, I remain convinced that he does not want to denuclearize — in fact, he will not denuclearize. But he wants to give off this perception that he’s this open leader, that he’s peaceful, that he’s reasonable,” Mr. Rubio said on ABC’s “This Week.”

Sen. Chris Coons, Delaware Democrat, said even offering North Korea a summit with the U.S. president is a significant concession, while also saying it’s important that North Korea has freed several Americans the country was holding as a confidence-building measure.

“But let’s be clear — twice before North Korea under Kim Jong-un’s father committed to full denuclearization in six party talks in 2005, in 2007 … only to then change their tune,” Mr. Coons said on “Fox News Sunday.”

“So we’re going to have to be very focused, very engaged,” Mr. Coons said. “I am hopeful that Secretary [of State Mike] Pompeo will brief and engage Congress. And I’m hopeful that we’ll work together to make sure that this summit is a success.”

Even Mr. Trump’s critics have credited the president for his negotiating skills in his recent dealings with Mr. Kim, and calling the summit a positive step.

“In some ways, Kim Jong-un may have met his match here with our very unconventional president,” said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Mr. Clapper, who’s publicly butted heads with Mr. Trump over issues related to Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe, said a summit would be good regardless of whether there is any sort of agreement.

“Having gone this far, there is value in meeting and greeting, gripping and grinning, and just establishing a rapport,” he said. “Yes — I think it would be important to have the summit.”

Open travel between the U.S. and Havana. Using American credit cards to pay for hotel stays in Cuba. Foreign diplomats able to travel beyond their host cities. Internet connections and freedom of speech.

A host of issues — untouched by officials in either the U.S. or Cuba for decades — will suddenly be on the table this week during rare high-level chats in Havana between the two former foes.

world,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/terrorism-security/2014/0905/At-NATO-summit-vows-of-renewed-efforts-to-contain-Russia,"At NATO summit, vows of renewed efforts to contain Russia",2014-09-05,Dan Murphy,"Leaders of North Atlantic Treaty Organization member gathered in Wales pledged today to contribute troops to an alliance-wide `` rapid reaction '' force . The calls are prompted by what NATO members allege is Russian military support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine .
The focus on Russia and European defense marks a return to NATO 's roots as its decade-long war in land-locked Afghanistan , 4,000 miles from the North Atlantic , winds down . Today is the second day of the annual summit in Newport , Wales of the world 's largest defense alliance .
In a speech , British Prime Minister David Cameron complained that `` Russia is ripping up the rulebook with its annexation of Crimea and its troops on the sovereign soil of Ukraine . '' Mr. Cameron vowed 1,000 British soldiers would be attached to the rapid reaction force . The BBC carries excerpts from his speech .
Mr Cameron said NATO `` must be able to act more swiftly . In 2002 , Nato stood down its high-readiness force . `` I hope that today we can agree a multinational spearhead force deployable anywhere in the world in just two to five days . `` This would be part of a reformed NATO response force with headquarters in Poland , forward units in the eastern allies and pre-positioned equipment and infrastructure to allow more exercises and , if necessary , rapid reinforcement . ''

Leaders of North Atlantic Treaty Organization member gathered in Wales pledged today to contribute troops to an alliance-wide ""rapid reaction"" force. The calls are prompted by what NATO members allege is Russian military support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.

The focus on Russia and European defense marks a return to NATO's roots as its decade-long war in land-locked Afghanistan, 4,000 miles from the North Atlantic, winds down. Today is the second day of the annual summit in Newport, Wales of the world's largest defense alliance.

In a speech, British Prime Minister David Cameron complained that ""Russia is ripping up the rulebook with its annexation of Crimea and its troops on the sovereign soil of Ukraine."" Mr. Cameron vowed 1,000 British soldiers would be attached to the rapid reaction force. The BBC carries excerpts from his speech.

Mr Cameron said NATO ""must be able to act more swiftly. In 2002, Nato stood down its high-readiness force. ""I hope that today we can agree a multinational spearhead force deployable anywhere in the world in just two to five days. ""This would be part of a reformed NATO response force with headquarters in Poland, forward units in the eastern allies and pre-positioned equipment and infrastructure to allow more exercises and, if necessary, rapid reinforcement.""

Mr Maduro has been in office since 2013. He was sworn in for a second term earlier this month, after winning a May 2018 election marred by an opposition boycott and widespread claims of vote-rigging.

Mr Guaidó is the head of the National Assembly. He has said articles within the country's constitution allow him to assume interim power because he believes Mr Maduro's election, and therefore presidency, is invalid.

He has vowed to lead a transitional government and hold free elections.

How has the diplomatic spat flared?

US President Donald Trump recognised Mr Guaidó as Venezuela's new head of state minutes after his declaration in the capital, Caracas, on Wednesday.

Lerner, Alexandra Glorioso","Though many American political junkies will spend 2015 speculating about presidential contenders , you can get a more immediate fix by watching the following slate of important races across the globe . From high-profile gubernatorial and mayoral races in the United States to pivotal national elections abroad , 2015 offers a host of dynamic electoral battles that will serve as a perfect appetizer before 2016-talk truly takes over .
Despite its deep red hue in the past four presidential elections and its two high-profile conservative senators , Kentucky has only had one Republican governor in the last four decades . Current Democratic Gov . Steve Beshear cruised to reelection in 2011 , but can not run again due to term limits , and his current Lt. Gov . Crit Luallen has announced she isn ’ t running . The only big-name Democratic candidate to announce is Attorney General Jack Conway who lost to Rand Paul in 2010 ’ s Senate contest by 10 points . Many Democrats hope Allison Lundergan Grimes will dust herself off after her disappointing loss to Mitch McConnell and throw her hat into the ring . On the Republican side , Louisville Metro Councilman Hal Heiner and State Agricultural Commissioner James Comer have both entered the race . After Democrats lost a bevy of key races in red states during the midterms , this year ’ s November Kentucky race will be a key indicator of whether locally popular Dems like Beshear can still buoy their party in nationally unfavorable waters .
As Nigeria ’ s oft-maligned President Goodluck Jonathan seeks reelection this February , in many ways , the dominant narrative surrounding the contest will have far less to do with the polls and far more to do with the violence many expect the radical Islamist group Boko Haram is capable of perpetrating . Jonathan will have a rematch against former military dictator Muhammadu Buhari who represents the All Progressives Congress , a coalition formed in 2013 that has since banked numerous defections from Jonathan ’ s People ’ s Democratic Party . Jonathan plans to bank on support from the country ’ s Christian south , as he has enraged many Muslims in his party by reneging on a gentleman ’ s agreement that the PDP ’ s top spot would rotate on a two-term basis between a Muslim and a Christian . Violence conducted by Boko Haram , specifically the group ’ s kidnapping of hundreds of schoolgirls in Chibok last April , will be a significant theme of the election . Many analysts expect attacks during the campaign and voting process .
Surprised to see an absolutist Islamist monarchy on the list of 2015 ’ s hottest elections ? Saudi Arabia ’ s municipal elections make the cut not because of their importance to the kingdom ’ s governance—only half of the councils ’ seats are elected and the councils themselves have little power—but rather because they will mark the first elections in which women can both vote and run for office . Still , Saudi women can ’ t drive to the polls and must be accompanied by a male “ guardian ” on every trip outside of the home .

Though many American political junkies will spend 2015 speculating about presidential contenders, you can get a more immediate fix by watching the following slate of important races across the globe. From high-profile gubernatorial and mayoral races in the United States to pivotal national elections abroad, 2015 offers a host of dynamic electoral battles that will serve as a perfect appetizer before 2016-talk truly takes over.

Kentucky’s Gubernatorial Election

Despite its deep red hue in the past four presidential elections and its two high-profile conservative senators, Kentucky has only had one Republican governor in the last four decades. Current Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear cruised to reelection in 2011, but cannot run again due to term limits, and his current Lt. Gov. Crit Luallen has announced she isn’t running. The only big-name Democratic candidate to announce is Attorney General Jack Conway who lost to Rand Paul in 2010’s Senate contest by 10 points. Many Democrats hope Allison Lundergan Grimes will dust herself off after her disappointing loss to Mitch McConnell and throw her hat into the ring. On the Republican side, Louisville Metro Councilman Hal Heiner and State Agricultural Commissioner James Comer have both entered the race. After Democrats lost a bevy of key races in red states during the midterms, this year’s November Kentucky race will be a key indicator of whether locally popular Dems like Beshear can still buoy their party in nationally unfavorable waters.

Nigeria’s General Election

As Nigeria’s oft-maligned President Goodluck Jonathan seeks reelection this February, in many ways, the dominant narrative surrounding the contest will have far less to do with the polls and far more to do with the violence many expect the radical Islamist group Boko Haram is capable of perpetrating. Jonathan will have a rematch against former military dictator Muhammadu Buhari who represents the All Progressives Congress, a coalition formed in 2013 that has since banked numerous defections from Jonathan’s People’s Democratic Party. Jonathan plans to bank on support from the country’s Christian south, as he has enraged many Muslims in his party by reneging on a gentleman’s agreement that the PDP’s top spot would rotate on a two-term basis between a Muslim and a Christian. Violence conducted by Boko Haram, specifically the group’s kidnapping of hundreds of schoolgirls in Chibok last April, will be a significant theme of the election. Many analysts expect attacks during the campaign and voting process.

Saudi Arabia’s Municipal Elections

Surprised to see an absolutist Islamist monarchy on the list of 2015’s hottest elections? Saudi Arabia’s municipal elections make the cut not because of their importance to the kingdom’s governance—only half of the councils’ seats are elected and the councils themselves have little power—but rather because they will mark the first elections in which women can both vote and run for office. Still, Saudi women can’t drive to the polls and must be accompanied by a male “guardian” on every trip outside of the home. Many believe giving women the right to vote was a small concession Saudi Arabia’s government gave to quell dissent during the Arab Spring and is thus a sign of the government’s unwavering hold on power through otherwise tumultuous times in the region.

Spain’s General Election

Spain’s 2015 general election will feature the country’s two dominant parties—the right-wing People’s Party (PP) and the left-wing Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE)—each waning in popularity significantly. Current Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is again leading the PP, but his administration’s approval ratings have suffered due to unpopular austerity measures, accusations of corruption, and economic malaise that led to a historic bailout of its banking sector and increasingly tepid growth as the country limps out of recession. But then again, PSOE’s last Prime Minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, left office in 2011 deeply unpopular with the Spanish economy flailing. PSOE remains largely unpopular as well. Though the country’s unemployment rate has dropped slightly in recent months, it is still stubbornly high, hovering in the mid-20s. During the 2014 European Parliamentary election last May, Spain witnessed the emergence of Podemos (“We Can”) a left-wing populist party that gained 8 percent of the national vote and is performing surprisingly well in early polls for 2015. Podemos aims, among other things, to rewrite the constitution to oust a group of corrupt leaders, raise taxes to pay for more public services and shorten the work week to reduce unemployment.

Chicago’s Mayoral Election

Rahm Emanuel will be fighting for his political life this February, defending an aggressive, albeit controversial first-term record as he seeks reelection. In October 2014 Karen Lewis, the leader of the Chicago Teachers Union and one of Emanuel’s fiercest and most combative critics, announced she would not be able to challenge him due to illness. This left Emanuel with a far easier path to victory, though he could be stymied by the city’s runoff system that might unite a fractured opposition should he fail to gain 50 percent of the vote in the first round. Anti-Rahm sentiment remains high—an August Chicago Tribune poll found that Emanuel’s approval rating is only 35 percent—though a recent poll from David Binder Research shows that his chief opponents, Ald. Robert Fioretti and Cook County Commissioner Jesús G. ""Chuy"" García, have yet to gain significant support.

world,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/sep/18/israels-2-main-political-parties-deadlocked-after-/,Israel's 2 main political parties deadlocked after election,2019-09-18,Aron Heller,"JERUSALEM ( AP ) — Israel ’ s two main political parties were deadlocked Wednesday after an unprecedented repeat election , with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing an uphill battle to hold on to his job .
The election ’ s seeming political kingmaker , Avigdor Lieberman , said he ’ ll insist upon a secular unity government between Netanyahu ’ s Likud and Benny Gantz ’ s Blue and White parties , who based on partial results are currently tied at 32 seats each out of the 120 in parliament .
Without Lieberman ’ s endorsement , both parties appear to have fallen well short of securing a parliamentary majority with their prospective ideological allies .
With results still pouring in , Lieberman insisted the overall picture was unlikely to change . He also demanded a secular “ liberal ” government shorn of the religious and ultra-Orthodox allies the prime minister has long relied upon .
“ The conclusion is clear , everything we said throughout the campaign is coming true , ” he said outside his home in the West Bank settlement of Nokdim . “ There is one and only option : a national unity government that is broad and liberal and we will not join any other option . ”
That could spell serious trouble for the continuation of Netanyahu ’ s lengthy rule .
Gantz , a former military chief , has ruled out sitting with a Netanyahu-led Likud at a time when the prime minister is expected to be indicted on corruption charges in the coming weeks . It raised the specter of an alternate Likud candidate rising to challenge Netanyahu , though most of its senior officials have thus far pledged to stand solidly behind their leader .
Netanyahu , the longest-serving leader is Israeli history , had desperately sought an outright majority with his hard-line and ultra-Orthodox allies in hopes of passing legislation to give him immunity from his expected indictment .
Israel ’ s attorney general has recommended charging Netanyahu with bribery , fraud and breach of trust in three scandals , pending a long-awaited hearing scheduled in the coming weeks . A formal indictment would increase the pressure on Netanyahu to step aside if he does not have immunity .
The partial results released Wednesday by the Central Election Commission were based on a tally of 56 % of the potential electorate . Overall turnout was 69.4 % .
According to the partial results , Likud with its natural allies of religious and ultra-nationalist parties mustered just 56 seats - or five short of the needed majority .

The election’s seeming political kingmaker, Avigdor Lieberman, said he’ll insist upon a secular unity government between Netanyahu’s Likud and Benny Gantz’s Blue and White parties, who based on partial results are currently tied at 32 seats each out of the 120 in parliament.

Without Lieberman’s endorsement, both parties appear to have fallen well short of securing a parliamentary majority with their prospective ideological allies.

With results still pouring in, Lieberman insisted the overall picture was unlikely to change. He also demanded a secular “liberal” government shorn of the religious and ultra-Orthodox allies the prime minister has long relied upon.

“The conclusion is clear, everything we said throughout the campaign is coming true,” he said outside his home in the West Bank settlement of Nokdim. “There is one and only option: a national unity government that is broad and liberal and we will not join any other option.”

That could spell serious trouble for the continuation of Netanyahu’s lengthy rule.

Gantz, a former military chief, has ruled out sitting with a Netanyahu-led Likud at a time when the prime minister is expected to be indicted on corruption charges in the coming weeks. It raised the specter of an alternate Likud candidate rising to challenge Netanyahu, though most of its senior officials have thus far pledged to stand solidly behind their leader.

Netanyahu, the longest-serving leader is Israeli history, had desperately sought an outright majority with his hard-line and ultra-Orthodox allies in hopes of passing legislation to give him immunity from his expected indictment.

Israel’s attorney general has recommended charging Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three scandals, pending a long-awaited hearing scheduled in the coming weeks. A formal indictment would increase the pressure on Netanyahu to step aside if he does not have immunity.

The partial results released Wednesday by the Central Election Commission were based on a tally of 56% of the potential electorate. Overall turnout was 69.4%.

According to the partial results, Likud with its natural allies of religious and ultra-nationalist parties mustered just 56 seats - or five short of the needed majority.

Gantz’s Blue and White and its center-left allies garnered 55 seats, placing Lieberman’s Yisrael Beiteinu and its nine seats in the middle as the deciding factor.

MEXICO CITY — The hard work of Mexican law enforcement, the lure of Hollywood glitz and the fame of iconic actor Sean Penn helped drive the triumphant end to a six-month manhunt for the notorious Mexican drug lord dubbed ""El Chapo,"" Mexican officials said.

Now the lawyers take over, kicking off the legally arduous effort to extradite Joaquin Guzmán to the United States, where he faces trafficking charges dating as far back as 2009 and a federal murder indictment from 2014.

On Sunday, authorities notified Guzman that he is wanted in the USA, beginning extradition proceedings.

The first break in the manhunt came when Guzmán sought out producers and actors for a biographical film about his life, Mexico Attorney General Arely Gomez said. It actually was Guzmán’s contacts with Penn that led authorities to a Guzmán hiding place in October, Reuters and other media outlets reported. Guzmán fled but ultimately was nabbed Friday in Los Mochis, a Mexican coastal city of 250,000 in Guzmán's home state of Sinaloa.

Rolling Stone magazine published an article late Saturday, written by Penn, in which the Academy Award-winning actor tells of flying to Mexico with Mexican actress Kate del Castillo to meet with Guzmán.

Penn lauds Guzmán in the story, calling him, “Robin Hood,” even though El Chapo’s home town of Badiraguato in the rugged Sierra Madre Occidental is among the most marginalized in Mexico, according to government statistics.

The actor and activist described Guzmán's old-school style of doing business by writing, “El Chapo is a businessman first, and only resorts to violence when he deems it advantageous to himself or his business interests.”

El Chapo also coveted the drug-running route through Ciudad Juárez, which neighbors El Paso in Texas. His attempts to control Ciudad Juárez contributed to the region's reputation as the murder capital of the world.

But Guzmán shrugged off any blame for the world's drug epidemic, saying drugs would be supplied whether he ran the cartel or not.

Penn said in the magazine that he raised the issue of billionaire presidential candidate Donald Trump in the visit, since news stories surfaced of Guzmán's putting a $100 million bounty on Trump's head for the GOP candidate's unfavorable comments about Latinos.

Pressure is growing on Saudi Arabia to explain the fate of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met King Salman in Riyadh.

Mr Khashoggi was last seen at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago.

Turkish officials believe Mr Khashoggi was murdered by Saudi agents but the Saudis have denied this.

However, US media are reporting that the Saudis may be preparing to admit that Mr Khashoggi died as a result of an interrogation that went wrong.

Overnight, Turkish police completed a search of the consulate after being admitted by Saudi authorities.

What's likely to come from the Pompeo meeting?

The secretary of state and the king have now met in Riyadh.

While much of what was discussed has yet to be announced, the US State Department said that Mr Pompeo had used the time to thank the king for his ""commitment to a thorough, transparent investigation"" into Mr Khashoggi's disappearance.

Mr Pompeo was also expected to seek further clarification over a conversation between the king and President Donald Trump on Monday.

Reputations may be forever tainted

By Frank Gardner, BBC News

The recent, highly charged exchange of words between Washington and Riyadh now appears to have given way to a mutual search for the least bad explanation. Both countries' leaders know they have an enormous amount to lose if this affair ended up splitting apart their 73-year old strategic partnership.

Iran, as the regional rival to Saudi Arabia, would be the prime beneficiary if the Saudis were to lose their defensive US umbrella. President Trump is also correct when he says thousands of US jobs would be lost, with China and Russia to be among those lining up to replace them.

Which begs the wider question: is the West's relationship with Saudi Arabia so important that it outweighs the need to condemn and punish what many believe was a state-sponsored murder of a journalist inside a consulate?

Hence the urgent dispatching of US Secretary of State for talks with the Saudi leadership. In private there may well be some strong words, in public both countries may want to present a united stand. But one thing is certain: whatever narrative emerges, the international reputation of the Saudi Crown Prince and power-behind-the-throne Mohammed Bin Salman will forever be tainted by this affair.

What happened with the consulate search?

For the first time since the journalist disappeared on 2 October, Turkish investigators were allowed to enter the building.

A Saudi team entered first on Monday, followed roughly an hour later by Turkish forensic police.

world,USA TODAY,1,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/04/03/kenya-university-attack/25230247/,Militants warn Kenya school attack only 'the beginning',2015-04-03,,"GARISSA , Kenya — Tension and anxiety remained high Friday as the Kenyan military launched a campaign to flush out terrorists linked to the Garissa University College massacre .
The campaign came as Kenyan Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinett imposed a curfew on the borderlands with Somalia from 6:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. local time .
Few businesses remained open early on Friday evening before the curfew took hold . Some said the heavily armed Kenyan troops were overly zealous in rooting out Al Shabaab terrorists who have claimed responsibility for the attacks .
`` It 's not safe here for us as residents , '' said Abdikadir Adolwa . `` The soldiers are whipping residents to force them to identify terrorists . The military have terrorized this area and we fear going to the streets of the town . ''
Many residents who could stay outside the town opted to leave while the troops were present .
`` They 're arresting people who have no national identity cards , '' said Nathar Abdkir Balza , a mother of five , who owns a hotel in Garissa . `` You can be arrested for loitering . ''
Ethnic Somalis especially have deserted the area . Al Shabaab hails from nearby Somalia .
`` The Somalis like miraa but they are now afraid to come to town and buy it , '' said Kevin Kariuki , who sells miraa , or khat , an African plant that has slightly intoxicating effects when chewed .
Earlier Friday , the Kenyan government appealed for help in capturing nine men , described as `` bloodthirsty , armed and dangerous , '' in the wake of an attack on Garissa University that left 148 people dead .
Attackers from the Somali-based terror group al-Shabab told university students before they were killed that `` this is the beginning of more attacks '' targeting schools and universities in the country , the Kenya-based Standard reported .
The four gunmen were killed Thursday as security forces moved to end the 15-hour siege , which appeared to target Christians and Islamic converts . Two security guards , one policeman and one soldier were among the dead . At least 79 people were injured , and more than 500 students held hostage were rescued .
Interior Minister Joseph Nkaissery updated the casualties figures Friday , saying the gunmen killed 148 people . He said 142 of the dead were students , three were policemen and three were soldiers . Nkaissery added that 104 people were wounded .
Survivor Claire Mumo , a student , was in the college when the terrorists attacked on Thursday .
`` I was woken up by gunshot sounds inside our dormitory . The four gunmen I noticed ordered everybody to lie down before they started shooting at us , '' said Mumo . `` The blood of my friend spilled on my head when she was shot . The gunmen thought they had shot and killed me . ''
The gunmen left her alone because they thought she was already dead , she said . As she lay on the floor , she heard them carry out their plans .
`` I heard them asking and separating Muslims and Christians students . Then shortly I heard sounds of gunshots , '' Mumo added . `` I only came out when I saw our security forces collecting bodies . I will never forget this attack . I 'm lucky to be alive . ''
Survivor Helen Titus said one of the first things that the al-Shabab gunmen did when they entered the campus early Thursday was to head for a lecture hall where Christians were in prayer . Al-Shabab is a Somalia-based Islamic extremist group with ties to al-Qaida .
`` They investigated our area . They knew everything , '' Titus told The Associated Press outside a hospital in Garissa where she was being treated for a bullet wound to the wrist .
Titus , a 21-year-old English literature student , said she smeared blood from classmates on her face and hair and lay still at one point in hopes the gunmen would think she was dead .
The gunmen also told students hiding in dormitories to come out , assuring them that they would not be killed , said Titus , who wore a patient 's gown as she sat on a bench in the hospital yard .

USA TODAY

GARISSA, Kenya — Tension and anxiety remained high Friday as the Kenyan military launched a campaign to flush out terrorists linked to the Garissa University College massacre.

The campaign came as Kenyan Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinett imposed a curfew on the borderlands with Somalia from 6:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. local time.

Few businesses remained open early on Friday evening before the curfew took hold. Some said the heavily armed Kenyan troops were overly zealous in rooting out Al Shabaab terrorists who have claimed responsibility for the attacks.

""It's not safe here for us as residents,"" said Abdikadir Adolwa. ""The soldiers are whipping residents to force them to identify terrorists. The military have terrorized this area and we fear going to the streets of the town.""

Many residents who could stay outside the town opted to leave while the troops were present.

""They're arresting people who have no national identity cards,"" said Nathar Abdkir Balza, a mother of five, who owns a hotel in Garissa. ""You can be arrested for loitering.""

Ethnic Somalis especially have deserted the area. Al Shabaab hails from nearby Somalia.

""The Somalis like miraa but they are now afraid to come to town and buy it,"" said Kevin Kariuki, who sells miraa, or khat, an African plant that has slightly intoxicating effects when chewed.

Earlier Friday, the Kenyan government appealed for help in capturing nine men, described as ""bloodthirsty, armed and dangerous,"" in the wake of an attack on Garissa University that left 148 people dead.

Attackers from the Somali-based terror group al-Shabab told university students before they were killed that ""this is the beginning of more attacks"" targeting schools and universities in the country, the Kenya-based Standard reported.

The four gunmen were killed Thursday as security forces moved to end the 15-hour siege, which appeared to target Christians and Islamic converts. Two security guards, one policeman and one soldier were among the dead. At least 79 people were injured, and more than 500 students held hostage were rescued.

Interior Minister Joseph Nkaissery updated the casualties figures Friday, saying the gunmen killed 148 people. He said 142 of the dead were students, three were policemen and three were soldiers. Nkaissery added that 104 people were wounded.

Survivor Claire Mumo, a student, was in the college when the terrorists attacked on Thursday.

""I was woken up by gunshot sounds inside our dormitory. The four gunmen I noticed ordered everybody to lie down before they started shooting at us,"" said Mumo. ""The blood of my friend spilled on my head when she was shot. The gunmen thought they had shot and killed me.""

The gunmen left her alone because they thought she was already dead, she said. As she lay on the floor, she heard them carry out their plans.

""I heard them asking and separating Muslims and Christians students. Then shortly I heard sounds of gunshots,"" Mumo added. ""I only came out when I saw our security forces collecting bodies. I will never forget this attack. I'm lucky to be alive.""

Survivor Helen Titus said one of the first things that the al-Shabab gunmen did when they entered the campus early Thursday was to head for a lecture hall where Christians were in prayer. Al-Shabab is a Somalia-based Islamic extremist group with ties to al-Qaida.

""They investigated our area. They knew everything,"" Titus told The Associated Press outside a hospital in Garissa where she was being treated for a bullet wound to the wrist.

Titus, a 21-year-old English literature student, said she smeared blood from classmates on her face and hair and lay still at one point in hopes the gunmen would think she was dead.

The gunmen also told students hiding in dormitories to come out, assuring them that they would not be killed, said Titus, who wore a patient's gown as she sat on a bench in the hospital yard.

""We just wondered whether to come out or not,"" she said. Many students did, whereupon the gunmen started shooting men, saying they would not kill ""ladies,"" Titus said. But they also shot women and targeted Christians, said Titus, who is a Christian.

Esther Wanjiru said she was awake at the time of the attack. Asked if she lost anyone, she said: ""My best friend.""

Another survivor, Nina Kozel, said she was awakened by screaming and that many students escaped by sprinting to the fences and jumping over them. Some suffered bruises, she said. Many men were unable to escape, and hid in vain under beds and in closets in their rooms, according to Kozel.

""They were shot there and then,"" she said.

The mortuaries in Garissa, near the Somali border in northeastern Kenya, were so overwhelmed they had to ship many of the bodies to the capital of Nairobi, 200 miles away, the BBC reported.

The government began evacuating students who survived the Thursday terror attack, but many parents still don't know about their fate of their children.

""I phoned my daughter Susan since yesterday in the morning when I received bad news about the attack, but she didn't pick my calls,"" said Eunice Wangari, a mother of three. ""I don't know if she's still alive or not. The government is taking too long to identify the bodies. I am very stressed.""

Judith Musyoka, 45, and Boaz Musyoka, 55, are still searching for their son, Sammy Mutiso Musau in the wake of the attack that killed 147 students and staff.

""I don't know if my son is still alive,"" said Boaz. ""When I heard the news about terror attack I called him several times but his phone was not going through. I need to know his fate.""

A curfew was imposed for two weeks on Garissa and three neighboring counties. Cabinet Secretary of Education Jacob Kaimenyi ordered the university closed for an unspecified period, sending many students lugging suitcases onto buses Friday.

The Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) advised teachers in the region to leave immediately if they felt unsafe.

""We will not allow our teachers to risk their lives working in an insecure environment,"" said Willison Sosion, chairman of KNUT, who called for Garissa University to be closed permanently.

Some Kenyans were angry that the government didn't take sufficient security precautions. The attack came six days after Britain advised ""against all but essential travel"" to parts of Kenya, including Garissa.

A day before the attack, President Uhuru Kenyatta dismissed that warning as well as an Australian one pertaining to Nairobi and Mombasa, saying: ""Kenya is safe as any country in the world. The travel advisories being issued by our friends are not genuine.""

Garissa Gov. Nathif Jama Adam condemned the attack and demanded the government address security in the region to stop locals from leaving.

""I want to plead with Kenyans to stay here as we work with the government to boost security in our region,"" he said, in particular appealing to Christians in the region. ""We'll not allow terrorists to divide our people on religion lines.""

Kenyan officials offered a $220,000 bounty for Mohammed Mohamud, who they suspect planned the attack. On social media, the Interior Ministry called him ""the mastermind.""

Mohamud, who goes by other aliases, may have been assisted by two youths who conducted surveillance on the university, Kenya's The Star newspaper reported. He reportedly has claimed responsibility for a bus attack that left dozens dead late last year.

National chairperson of the National Muslim Council of Kenya, Nazlin Umar Fazaldin Rajput, criticized the government for failing to shore up security after Somali-based militants attacked civilians in retaliation for Kenyan military operations against their base in Somalia. Kenya began those operations in 2011 after a spate of kidnappings.

""All it took was four poorly armed terrorists against our entire intelligence and armed forces. This is a shame,"" she said. ""It is not the terrorist who is an enemy, the enemy is our failed security apparatus and the officers charged with those dockets.""

Rajput said the Kenyan military can do a better job guarding the borders and the people.

""We have the U.N. and foreign countries giving Kenya intelligence reports, but there is no efficient execution, save to harass innocent Muslims.""

Turkey 's president said he did n't want to escalate the situation , but he needed to protect Turkey 's borders and defend its allies inside Syria .
Russia 's Ministry of Defense condemned the attack and announced three steps it would take after the incident : bombing attacks would be escorted by fighter jets , air defenses would be increased , and military contacts with Turkey would be suspended .
After the attack , Russian President Vladimir Putin used exceptionally strong language . He called the incident a `` stab in the back '' and promised `` significant consequences '' to Turkey .
He said Russia would not tolerate such atrocities . Russia 's foreign minister cancelled his upcoming trip to Turkey .
As tensions rise over Turkey 's downing of a Russian warplane , ███ 's Erick Stakelbeck discusses how President Vladimir Putin 's unpredictability may reverberate across Europe . Watch our Q & A to understand the geopolitical dynamics of a region fraught with chaos :
`` We stated many times the fact that a large amount of oil and oil products are being transferred to the territory of Turkey from the territories seized by ISIS , '' Putin said . `` That is how these gangsters are receiving their financial support . ''
`` Turkey , like every country , has a right to defend its territory and its airspace , '' Obama said . `` I think it is very important right now for us to make sure that the Russians and the Turks are talking to each other , find out exactly what happened , and take measures to discourage any kind of escalation . ''
Turkey -- a NATO member -- asked NATO for an emergency meeting . It was the first time in 50 years a NATO member 's plane shot down a Russian plane .
`` I have previously expressed my concerns about the implications of the military actions of the Russian federation close to NATO borders , '' NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said . `` This highlights the importance of having and respecting arrangements to avoid such incidents in the future . As we have repeatedly made clear , we stand in solidarity with Turkey and support the territorial integrity of our NATO ally Turkey . ''
It remains to be seen if NATO will invoke Article 5 , which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all .
Turkey and Russia both produced evidence they said proved their version of events .
Turkey said the Russian plane violated its airspace after 10 separate warnings . Russia said its plane was targeted over Syrian territory .
After the plane was shot down , Syrian rebel forces aired a video showing them destroying one of the Russian helicopters sent to rescue the pilots . It appears the pilot of the fighter jet died and the co-pilot was rescued .

Incidents like this one can ignite a spark that sets the tinderbox aflame .","JERUSALEM, Israel -- The confrontation between Russia and Turkey entered its second day after Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on its border Tuesday.

Turkey's president said he didn't want to escalate the situation, but he needed to protect Turkey's borders and defend its allies inside Syria.

Russia's Ministry of Defense condemned the attack and announced three steps it would take after the incident: bombing attacks would be escorted by fighter jets, air defenses would be increased, and military contacts with Turkey would be suspended.

After the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin used exceptionally strong language. He called the incident a ""stab in the back"" and promised ""significant consequences"" to Turkey.

He said Russia would not tolerate such atrocities. Russia's foreign minister cancelled his upcoming trip to Turkey.

As tensions rise over Turkey's downing of a Russian warplane, CBN's Erick Stakelbeck discusses how President Vladimir Putin's unpredictability may reverberate across Europe. Watch our Q&A to understand the geopolitical dynamics of a region fraught with chaos:

Putin also accused Turkey of collusion with ISIS.

""We stated many times the fact that a large amount of oil and oil products are being transferred to the territory of Turkey from the territories seized by ISIS,"" Putin said. ""That is how these gangsters are receiving their financial support.""

In Washington, President Barack Obama urged calm.

""Turkey, like every country, has a right to defend its territory and its airspace,"" Obama said. ""I think it is very important right now for us to make sure that the Russians and the Turks are talking to each other, find out exactly what happened, and take measures to discourage any kind of escalation.""

Turkey -- a NATO member -- asked NATO for an emergency meeting. It was the first time in 50 years a NATO member's plane shot down a Russian plane.

""I have previously expressed my concerns about the implications of the military actions of the Russian federation close to NATO borders,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said. ""This highlights the importance of having and respecting arrangements to avoid such incidents in the future. As we have repeatedly made clear, we stand in solidarity with Turkey and support the territorial integrity of our NATO ally Turkey.""

It remains to be seen if NATO will invoke Article 5, which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all.

Turkey and Russia both produced evidence they said proved their version of events.

Turkey said the Russian plane violated its airspace after 10 separate warnings. Russia said its plane was targeted over Syrian territory.

After the plane was shot down, Syrian rebel forces aired a video showing them destroying one of the Russian helicopters sent to rescue the pilots. It appears the pilot of the fighter jet died and the co-pilot was rescued.

Russia and Turkey have a long history of tense relations and the incident exposes two competing alliances seeking to dominate the region: Russia and Shi'ite Iran on the one hand and Sunni Turkey on the other.

When Putin brought Russia into the Syrian civil war, retired U.S. General Jay Garner told CBN News he introduced a new danger to the region.

""In the air, it will be a big problem if he puts fighter aircraft in there and they begin to put in airstrikes against rebel forces while we're putting in airstrikes against Assad forces,"" Garner said. ""How do you 'de-conflict' all that? It's a tinderbox.""

Known until Wednesday as Jorge Bergoglio , the 76-year-old is known as a humble man who denied himself the luxuries that previous Buenos Aires cardinals enjoyed . He came close to becoming pope last time , reportedly gaining the second-highest vote total in several rounds of voting before he bowed out of the running in the conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI .
Groups of supporters waved Argentine flags in St. Peter 's Square as Francis , wearing simple white robes , made his first public appearance as pope .
`` Ladies and Gentlemen , good evening , '' he said before making a reference to his roots in Latin America , which accounts for about 40 percent of the world 's Roman Catholics .
Bergoglio often rode the bus to work , cooked his own meals and regularly visited the slums that ring Argentina 's capital . He considers social outreach , rather than doctrinal battles , to be the essential business of the church .
He accused fellow church leaders of hypocrisy and forgetting that Jesus Christ bathed lepers and ate with prostitutes .
`` Jesus teaches us another way : Go out . Go out and share your testimony , go out and interact with your brothers , go out and share , go out and ask . Become the Word in body as well as spirit , '' Bergoglio told Argentina 's priests last year .
Bergoglio 's legacy as cardinal includes his efforts to repair the reputation of a church that lost many followers by failing to openly challenge Argentina 's murderous 1976-83 dictatorship . He also worked to recover the church 's traditional political influence in society , but his outspoken criticism of President Cristina Kirchner could n't stop her from imposing socially liberal measures that are anathema to the church , from gay marriage and adoption to free contraceptives for all .
`` In our ecclesiastical region there are priests who do n't baptize the children of single mothers because they were n't conceived in the sanctity of marriage , '' Bergoglio told his priests . `` These are today 's hypocrites . Those who clericalize the Church . Those who separate the people of God from salvation . And this poor girl who , rather than returning the child to sender , had the courage to carry it into the world , must wander from parish to parish so that it 's baptized ! ''
Bergoglio compared this concept of Catholicism , `` this Church of 'come inside so we make decisions and announcements between ourselves and those who do n't come in , do n't belong , '' to the Pharisees of Christ 's time — people who congratulate themselves while condemning all others .
This sort of pastoral work , aimed at capturing more souls and building the flock , was an essential skill for any religious leader in the modern era , said Bergoglio 's authorized biographer , Sergio Rubin .
But Bergoglio himself felt most comfortable taking a very low profile , and his personal style was the antithesis of Vatican splendor . `` It 's a very curious thing : When bishops meet , he always wants to sit in the back rows . This sense of humility is very well seen in Rome , '' Rubin said before the 2013 conclave to choose Benedict 's successor .
Bergoglio 's influence seemed to stop at the presidential palace door after Nestor Kirchner and then his wife , Cristina Fernandez , took over the Argentina 's government . His outspoken criticism could n't prevent Argentina from becoming the Latin American country to legalize gay marriage , or stop Fernandez from promoting free contraception and artificial insemination .
His church had no say when the Argentine Supreme Court expanded access to legal abortions in rape cases , and when Bergoglio argued that gay adoptions discriminate against children , Fernandez compared his tone to `` medieval times and the Inquisition . ''
This kind of demonization is unfair , says Rubin , who obtained an extremely rare interview of Bergoglio for his biography , the `` The Jesuit . ''
`` Is Bergoglio a progressive — a liberation theologist even ? No . He 's no third-world priest . Does he criticize the International Monetary Fund , and neoliberalism ? Yes . Does he spend a great deal of time in the slums ? Yes , '' Rubin said .
Bergoglio has stood out for his austerity . Even after he became Argentina 's top church official in 2001 , he never lived in the ornate church mansion where Pope John Paul II stayed when visiting the country , preferring a simple bed in a downtown building , heated by a small stove on frigid weekends . For years , he took public transportation around the city , and cooked his own meals .
Bergoglio almost never granted media interviews , limiting himself to speeches from the pulpit , and was reluctant to contradict his critics , even when he knew their allegations against him were false , said Rubin .
That attitude was burnished as human rights activists tried to force him to answer uncomfortable questions about what church officials knew and did about the dictatorship 's abuses after the 1976 coup .
Many Argentines remain angry over the church 's acknowledged failure to openly confront a regime that was kidnapping and killing thousands of people as it sought to eliminate `` subversive elements '' in society . It 's one reason why more than two-thirds of Argentines describe themselves as Catholic , but fewer than 10 percent regularly attend mass .
Under Bergoglio 's leadership , Argentina 's bishops issued a collective apology in October 2012 for the church 's failures to protect its flock . But the statement blamed the era 's violence in roughly equal measure on both the junta and its enemies .
`` Bergoglio has been very critical of human rights violations during the dictatorship , but he has always also criticized the leftist guerrillas ; he does n't forget that side , '' Rubin said .
The bishops also said `` we exhort those who have information about the location of stolen babies , or who know where bodies were secretly buried , that they realize they are morally obligated to inform the pertinent authorities . ''
That statement came far too late for some activists , who accused Bergoglio of being more concerned about the church 's image than about aiding the many human rights investigations of the Kirchners ' era .
Bergoglio twice invoked his right under Argentine law to refuse to appear in open court , and when he eventually did testify in 2010 , his answers were evasive , human rights attorney Myriam Bregman said .
At least two cases directly involved Bergoglio . One examined the torture of two of his Jesuit priests — Orlando Yorio and Francisco Jalics — who were kidnapped in 1976 from the slums where they advocated liberation theology . Yorio accused Bergoglio of effectively handing them over to the death squads by declining to tell the regime that he endorsed their work . Jalics refused to discuss it after moving into seclusion in a German monastery .
Both men were freed after Bergoglio took extraordinary , behind-the-scenes action to save them — including persuading dictator Jorge Videla 's family priest to call in sick so that he could say Mass in the junta leader 's home , where he privately appealed for mercy . His intervention likely saved their lives , but Bergoglio never shared the details until Rubin interviewed him for the 2010 biography .
Bergoglio — who ran Argentina 's Jesuit order during the dictatorship — told Rubin that he regularly hid people on church property during the dictatorship , and once gave his identity papers to a man with similar features , enabling him to escape across the border . But all this was done in secret , at a time when church leaders publicly endorsed the junta and called on Catholics to restore their `` love for country '' despite the terror in the streets .
Rubin said failing to challenge the dictators was simply pragmatic at a time when so many people were getting killed , and attributed Bergoglio 's later reluctance to share his side of the story as a reflection of his humility .
But Bregman said Bergoglio 's own statements proved church officials knew from early on that the junta was torturing and killing its citizens , and yet publicly endorsed the dictators . `` The dictatorship could not have operated this way without this key support , '' she said .
Bergoglio also was accused of turning his back on a family that lost five relatives to state terror , including a young woman who was 5-months ' pregnant before she was kidnapped and killed in 1977 . The De la Cuadra family appealed to the leader of the Jesuits in Rome , who urged Bergoglio to help them ; Bergoglio then assigned a monsignor to the case . Months passed before the monsignor came back with a written note from a colonel : It revealed that the woman had given birth in captivity to a girl who was given to a family `` too important '' for the adoption to be reversed .
Despite this written evidence in a case he was personally involved with , Bergoglio testified in 2010 that he did n't know about any stolen babies until well after the dictatorship was over .
`` Bergoglio has a very cowardly attitude when it comes to something so terrible as the theft of babies . He says he did n't know anything about it until 1985 , '' said the baby 's aunt , Estela de la Cuadra , whose mother Alicia co-founded the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo in 1977 in hopes of identifying these babies . `` He does n't face this reality and it does n't bother him . The question is how to save his name , save himself . But he ca n't keep these allegations from reaching the public . The people know how he is . ''
Initially trained as a chemist , Bergoglio taught literature , psychology , philosophy and theology before taking over as Buenos Aires archbishop in 1998 . He became cardinal in 2001 , when the economy was collapsing , and won respect for blaming unrestrained capitalism for impoverishing millions of Argentines .
Later , there was little love lost between Bergoglio and Fernandez . Their relations became so frigid that the president stopped attending his annual `` Te Deum '' address , when church leaders traditionally tell political leaders what 's wrong with society .
During the dictatorship era , other church leaders only feebly mentioned a need to respect human rights . When Bergoglio spoke to the powerful , he was much more forceful . In his 2012 address , he said Argentina was being harmed by demagoguery , totalitarianism , corruption and efforts to secure unlimited power . The message resonated in a country whose president was ruling by decree , where political scandals rarely were punished and where top ministers openly lobbied for Fernandez to rule indefinitely .","Pope Francis is the first ever from the Americas, an austere Jesuit intellectual who modernized Argentina's conservative Catholic church.

Kiev , Ukraine ( CNN ) -- Just before midnight Wednesday , Ukraine 's president declared a truce in his tumultuous nation , as well as the start of negotiations aimed at not only preventing further bloodshed but forging a lasting peace .
The statement -- agreed upon with leaders of Ukraine 's three top opposition parties -- seemingly offered a respite from the violence and acrimony that 's marred the last few weeks .
Still , there have been talks before . There was a breakthrough as recently as four days ago , when protesters agreed to move out of Kiev 's City Hall and unblock downtown streets . Then it collapsed in a bloody mess Tuesday on the streets of Kiev .
One thing that has changed is the scale of the violence : Authorities say at least 26 people -- protesters and police alike -- were killed in fierce clashes centered around Kiev 's Maidan , or Independence Square .
The international outrage also has ratcheted up . After weeks of behind-the-scenes work and general calls for a peaceful resolution , Western leaders ramped up their pressure on Wednesday .
As U.S. President Barack Obama said , `` We 're going to be watching closely . ''
He and other Western leaders offered pointed remarks -- and floated possible sanctions -- against Ukraine 's embattled government for its part in the recent violence .
`` We hold the Ukrainian government primarily responsible , '' Obama said , `` for making sure that it is dealing with peaceful protesters in an appropriate way , that the Ukrainian people are able to assemble and speak freely about their interests without fear of repression . ''
If there is a truce , it was n't evident overnight Wednesday in central Kiev .
Persistent explosions rattled the night sky , the apparent product of protesters ' fireworks , security forces ' stun grenades and whatever else .
Demonstrators continued to pick up pavement and rocks , then throw them at police . Security forces themselves responded , including in some cases throwing Molotov cocktails in protesters ' direction .
`` The government would like the world to believe that those on Maidan are just terrorists and extremists to justify the bloodshed , ... that those on Maidan are armed with firearms and rioting , '' Kiev protester MaiaKiev told CNN iReport . `` But it 's not a riot ... It 's a revolution of dignity . ''
The situation began in November , when the opposition hit the streets angry about Yanukovych 's backpedaling from a trade pact with the European Union . That move and Russia 's offer the following month to buy $ 15 billion in Ukrainian debt and slash the price Kiev pays for its gas played into the storyline of Ukraine being a proxy for battles between Russia and the West .
Yet this dispute goes beyond international affairs . It 's also about who controls Ukraine 's future and how , as seen in the opposition 's pressing for constitutional reforms shifting powers from the president to the parliament .
The government 's response to the dissent -- including a sweeping , if short-lived , anti-protest law in January -- further inflamed the opposition .
While the protests in Maidan have been a constant , there have been ebbs and flows in the unrest . The most sudden shift came on Tuesday , two days after a seeming breakthrough . Riot police plowed through the streets with water cannons , stun grenades , night sticks and , in some cases , armored personnel carriers .
Protesters fought back , with some clawing paving stones from the streets and firing Molotov cocktails attached to fireworks from an improvised air cannon . They even set fire to the headquarters of the headquarters of the ruling Party of Regions .
Overnight Tuesday , the situation had become a standoff . The security forces maintained on alert and so did demonstrators , refusing to budge from their physical position in the center of Ukraine 's capital as well as their political positions .
A ring of fire continued to burn along barricades around their camp in the city center . Their cries against President Viktor Yanukovych are continuing too -- accusing him of scuttling an European Union trade pact to cozy up with Russia , resisting reforms that might curb his power and stubbornly , heavy-handedly dealing with the opposition .
As to the Ukrainian government , while security forces held back Wednesday , its officials did not .
In an interview with CNN 's Christiane Amanpour , Foreign Minister Leonid Kozhara said an opposition march Tuesday `` ended with massive riots and aggressive and excessive attacks against the Ukrainian police . ''
The head of Ukraine 's security service was even more forceful , accusing protesters of taking over government offices nationwide and looting 1,500 weapons and 100,000 rounds of ammunition , among other misdeeds .
`` These are concrete acts of terror , '' Oleksander Yakimenko said in a statement announcing an anti-terrorism operation apparently targeting protesters . `` Radical and extremist groups are now a real threat . ''
Yakimenko spoke hours before the announcement of the truce , which two of the opposition leaders -- Vitali Klitschko and Arseniy Yatsenyuk -- later confirmed .
Klitschko , a former world-class boxer who now leads the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform party , said the next round of talks will take place Thursday . Until then , Yanukovych has promised that there will be no further attempts to disperse protesters in Maidan , according to a statement on Klitschko 's party 's website .
`` Today , a key goal is to stop the bloodshed that authorities have provoked and unleashed , '' Klitschko said . `` Now we will see how Yanukovych will stick to his word after promised sanctions from the West . ''

Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Just before midnight Wednesday, Ukraine's president declared a truce in his tumultuous nation, as well as the start of negotiations aimed at not only preventing further bloodshed but forging a lasting peace.

The statement -- agreed upon with leaders of Ukraine's three top opposition parties -- seemingly offered a respite from the violence and acrimony that's marred the last few weeks.

Still, there have been talks before. There was a breakthrough as recently as four days ago, when protesters agreed to move out of Kiev's City Hall and unblock downtown streets. Then it collapsed in a bloody mess Tuesday on the streets of Kiev.

So will this attempt be any different?

One thing that has changed is the scale of the violence: Authorities say at least 26 people -- protesters and police alike -- were killed in fierce clashes centered around Kiev's Maidan, or Independence Square.

The international outrage also has ratcheted up. After weeks of behind-the-scenes work and general calls for a peaceful resolution, Western leaders ramped up their pressure on Wednesday.

As U.S. President Barack Obama said, ""We're going to be watching closely.""

He and other Western leaders offered pointed remarks -- and floated possible sanctions -- against Ukraine's embattled government for its part in the recent violence.

""We hold the Ukrainian government primarily responsible,"" Obama said, ""for making sure that it is dealing with peaceful protesters in an appropriate way, that the Ukrainian people are able to assemble and speak freely about their interests without fear of repression.""

If there is a truce, it wasn't evident overnight Wednesday in central Kiev.

Persistent explosions rattled the night sky, the apparent product of protesters' fireworks, security forces' stun grenades and whatever else.

Demonstrators continued to pick up pavement and rocks, then throw them at police. Security forces themselves responded, including in some cases throwing Molotov cocktails in protesters' direction.

""The government would like the world to believe that those on Maidan are just terrorists and extremists to justify the bloodshed,... that those on Maidan are armed with firearms and rioting,"" Kiev protester MaiaKiev told CNN iReport. ""But it's not a riot ... It's a revolution of dignity.""

Both sides appear dug in

The situation began in November, when the opposition hit the streets angry about Yanukovych's backpedaling from a trade pact with the European Union. That move and Russia's offer the following month to buy $15 billion in Ukrainian debt and slash the price Kiev pays for its gas played into the storyline of Ukraine being a proxy for battles between Russia and the West.

Yet this dispute goes beyond international affairs. It's also about who controls Ukraine's future and how, as seen in the opposition's pressing for constitutional reforms shifting powers from the president to the parliament.

The government's response to the dissent -- including a sweeping, if short-lived, anti-protest law in January -- further inflamed the opposition.

While the protests in Maidan have been a constant, there have been ebbs and flows in the unrest. The most sudden shift came on Tuesday, two days after a seeming breakthrough. Riot police plowed through the streets with water cannons, stun grenades, night sticks and, in some cases, armored personnel carriers.

Protesters fought back, with some clawing paving stones from the streets and firing Molotov cocktails attached to fireworks from an improvised air cannon. They even set fire to the headquarters of the headquarters of the ruling Party of Regions.

Overnight Tuesday, the situation had become a standoff. The security forces maintained on alert and so did demonstrators, refusing to budge from their physical position in the center of Ukraine's capital as well as their political positions.

A ring of fire continued to burn along barricades around their camp in the city center. Their cries against President Viktor Yanukovych are continuing too -- accusing him of scuttling an European Union trade pact to cozy up with Russia, resisting reforms that might curb his power and stubbornly, heavy-handedly dealing with the opposition.

As to the Ukrainian government, while security forces held back Wednesday, its officials did not.

In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Foreign Minister Leonid Kozhara said an opposition march Tuesday ""ended with massive riots and aggressive and excessive attacks against the Ukrainian police.""

The head of Ukraine's security service was even more forceful, accusing protesters of taking over government offices nationwide and looting 1,500 weapons and 100,000 rounds of ammunition, among other misdeeds.

""These are concrete acts of terror,"" Oleksander Yakimenko said in a statement announcing an anti-terrorism operation apparently targeting protesters. ""Radical and extremist groups are now a real threat.""

Yakimenko spoke hours before the announcement of the truce, which two of the opposition leaders -- Vitali Klitschko and Arseniy Yatsenyuk -- later confirmed.

Klitschko, a former world-class boxer who now leads the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform party, said the next round of talks will take place Thursday. Until then, Yanukovych has promised that there will be no further attempts to disperse protesters in Maidan, according to a statement on Klitschko's party's website.

""Today, a key goal is to stop the bloodshed that authorities have provoked and unleashed,"" Klitschko said. ""Now we will see how Yanukovych will stick to his word after promised sanctions from the West.""

Ukraine's top military man replaced

One man who won't be part of the government's anti-terrorism campaign is Ukraine's armed forces chief.

Col. Gen. Volodymyr Zamana has been replaced, according to a statement Wednesday on the president's website.

No reason was given for the dismissal of Zamana, who according to his official bio started in the Soviet military, then rose through the ranks of Ukraine's military before getting the top job in February 2012.

U.S. General Philip Breedlove, the military commander for NATO -- the 23-nation alliance including not just Western Europe and the United States, but Ukraine's neighbors Poland and Romania -- called ""upon the new military leadership in Ukraine to open a dialog (sic) with us to bring this situation to a peaceful resolution.""

In his CNN interview Wednesday, Ukraine's foreign minister insisted that -- despite what he characterized as protesters' provocations -- police have ""strong instructions"" to avoid using ""offensive means.""

And Kozhara rejected reports that the army, whoever leads it, has been authorized to fire on protesters.

""Under no conditions (will) the Ukrainian army ... be used in resolving this political crisis,"" the minister added.

Over the course of a few hours overnight Wednesday, Ukrainian troops moved into defensive positions around bases and weapons depots, according to a U.S. defense official familiar with the latest intelligence. The move is seen by the United States as an effort to ensure the military's facilities remain secure.

U.S. won't issue visas to 20 Ukrainians

After some well-reported infighting about how engaged they'd been in the crisis, Western officials were vocal on Wednesday not just condemning the violence but threatening action.

The foreign ministers of France, Germany and Poland are set to to travel to Kiev on Thursday to survey the situation, before briefing their European Union colleagues in Brussels. After that, they and their U.S. allies could impose sanctions against Yanukovych's government -- especially if there is even more violence.

SOFIA ( ███ ) - Dozens of journalists at the state-run Bulgarian National Radio ( BNR ) staged a protest on Friday in support of media freedom after a colleague known for her coverage of the country ’ s graft-prone judicial system was briefly suspended from her job .
The case drew criticism from human rights groups and the Bulgarian branch of the Association of European Journalists , which spoke of a “ coup against journalistic professionalism ” in a country that has the lowest ranking among the 28 European Union member states for press freedom .
The new head of BNR news , Nikolay Krastev , on Thursday suspended Silvia Velikova , a respected radio anchor and reporter , saying she had violated her contract by urging listeners while on air to join a protest over the appointment of Bulgaria ’ s next chief prosecutor .
But many journalists and others saw the move as politically motivated . Facing a strong backlash , Krastev then resigned and Velikova was reinstated . Amid the turmoil , BNR took its Horizont news channel off the air for five hours and the communications regulation commission said it would investigate the case .
“ I ’ m outraged , ” said Velichka Paunova , 67 , one of dozens of ordinary citizens who also joined the journalists ’ protest , accusing Bulgaria ’ s political establishment of trying to muzzle journalists .
“ It ’ s ugly , it ’ s scandalous . What are they afraid of ? People are not stupid and they understand what this is about . ”
The issue has crystallized the frustration of many Bulgarians with what they see as a corrupt and opaque political elite and an ineffective judiciary , which have often been criticized by the European Commission .
Bulgaria ranked 111th out of 180 countries in the Reporters Without Borders world press freedom index this year - even below countries in the Western Balkans that are not yet EU members .

SOFIA (Reuters) - Dozens of journalists at the state-run Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) staged a protest on Friday in support of media freedom after a colleague known for her coverage of the country’s graft-prone judicial system was briefly suspended from her job.

The case drew criticism from human rights groups and the Bulgarian branch of the Association of European Journalists, which spoke of a “coup against journalistic professionalism” in a country that has the lowest ranking among the 28 European Union member states for press freedom.

The new head of BNR news, Nikolay Krastev, on Thursday suspended Silvia Velikova, a respected radio anchor and reporter, saying she had violated her contract by urging listeners while on air to join a protest over the appointment of Bulgaria’s next chief prosecutor.

But many journalists and others saw the move as politically motivated. Facing a strong backlash, Krastev then resigned and Velikova was reinstated. Amid the turmoil, BNR took its Horizont news channel off the air for five hours and the communications regulation commission said it would investigate the case.

“I’m outraged,” said Velichka Paunova, 67, one of dozens of ordinary citizens who also joined the journalists’ protest, accusing Bulgaria’s political establishment of trying to muzzle journalists.

“It’s ugly, it’s scandalous. What are they afraid of? People are not stupid and they understand what this is about.”

The issue has crystallized the frustration of many Bulgarians with what they see as a corrupt and opaque political elite and an ineffective judiciary, which have often been criticized by the European Commission.

Bulgaria ranked 111th out of 180 countries in the Reporters Without Borders world press freedom index this year - even below countries in the Western Balkans that are not yet EU members.

On Tuesday morning, Gurmit Singh, and thousands of Sikhs from around the world, poured into the eastern city of Nankana Sahib to commemorate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak at the ornate, palatial structure of the Gurdwara Janam Asthan.

Guru Nanak was born in this city in 1469. Today, the predominantly Muslim town attracts Sikh pilgrims from around the globe.

'No difference between us'

At the gurdwara's ""sarovar"" (or sacred pool) where Sikhs take a ceremonial bath, the Indian Sikhs were also joined by Pakistan's own minorities.

The diplomatic dustup arose Saturday when Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte prevented a pair of Turkish ministers from traveling within the Netherlands . Family and Social Policies Minister Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu had intended to attend rallies for the country ’ s Turkish population in support of a controversial constitutional referendum set to take place in Turkey . But Kaya was prevented from entering a diplomatic compound and eventually escorted to Germany , while Cavusoglu was barred from landing in the Netherlands .
“ I have said that I had thought that Nazism was over , but that was wrong , ” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said during a live television address on Sunday . “ Nazism is alive in the west . ”
Turkey has already banned the Dutch ambassador from returning to Turkey and Cavusoglu said the country has “ other steps in mind . ”
“ We ’ ve already begun planning them , ” he said . “ We will certainly take those steps and more . ”
The Dutch barred Cavusoglu from entering because of objections to his intention to attend a referendum rally in Rotterdam . If passed , the new laws would expand Erdogan ’ s powers , which the Dutch see as a step backward from democracy . Turkish officials have been campaigning in various European cities with Turkish populations before the April 16 vote .
The Dutch government said it withdrew permission to land because of `` risks to public order and security . ”
Hundreds of pro-Turkey protesters gathered into the night in Rotterdam . The protests led to a scuffle with police as Dutch officials used a water cannon to disperse the group , Reuters reported .
The dispute also comes just days before the Netherlands goes to the polls next Wednesday for the lower house of Parliament .

Amsterdam political scientist Andre Krouwel said Rutte ’ s moves show voters “ we are the ones who go down in the trenches to defend the Netherlands . ”","Turkey’s president stood firm behind his blistering comments that accused the Dutch government of “Nazism and fascism” and vowed on Sunday the Netherlands would “pay the price” for barring Turkish ministers from the country, a move that has dramatically swelled tensions between the NATO allies.

The diplomatic dustup arose Saturday when Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte prevented a pair of Turkish ministers from traveling within the Netherlands. Family and Social Policies Minister Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu had intended to attend rallies for the country’s Turkish population in support of a controversial constitutional referendum set to take place in Turkey. But Kaya was prevented from entering a diplomatic compound and eventually escorted to Germany, while Cavusoglu was barred from landing in the Netherlands.

“I have said that I had thought that Nazism was over, but that was wrong,” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said during a live television address on Sunday. “Nazism is alive in the west.”

Turkey has already banned the Dutch ambassador from returning to Turkey and Cavusoglu said the country has “other steps in mind.”

“We’ve already begun planning them,” he said. “We will certainly take those steps and more.”

The Dutch barred Cavusoglu from entering because of objections to his intention to attend a referendum rally in Rotterdam. If passed, the new laws would expand Erdogan’s powers, which the Dutch see as a step backward from democracy. Turkish officials have been campaigning in various European cities with Turkish populations before the April 16 vote.

The Dutch government said it withdrew permission to land because of ""risks to public order and security.”

Hundreds of pro-Turkey protesters gathered into the night in Rotterdam. The protests led to a scuffle with police as Dutch officials used a water cannon to disperse the group, Reuters reported.

The dispute also comes just days before the Netherlands goes to the polls next Wednesday for the lower house of Parliament. The campaign has been dominated by issues of identity, with anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders set to make strong gains. Rutte’s strong stance towards Turkey in this weekend’s conflict, however, could help Rutte bolster his own image with the voting public, perhaps helping to stave off Wilders’ charge, experts say.

Amsterdam political scientist Andre Krouwel said Rutte’s moves show voters “we are the ones who go down in the trenches to defend the Netherlands.”

Special for USA TODAY

NAIROBI, Kenya — Armed terrorists stormed a university in northern Kenya on Thursday, killing 147 people, wounding dozens and taking hostages during a 15-hour siege until four militants were killed by security forces. Christians and converts to Islam appeared to have been the targets.

More than 550 students were evacuated and 79 were injured in the standoff on the Garissa University campus, about 90 miles from the Somali border. The Somali-based Islamic terrorist group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack — the al-Qaeda-linked organization's deadliest in Kenya.

Students said the gunmen separated Christians from Muslims and held hostages in a dormitory, where they placed explosives around the Christian hostages, according to Kenya's National Police Service.

Kenyan Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery said some students were killed during morning prayers at the mosque. Jackson Kamau, a student at the university, said the militants killed those who were likely converts to Islam. Locals can differentiate between Somali Muslims born into Islam and those who have converted because they come from different ethnic groups.

""We'll not allow terrorists to divide our country on religious lines,"" said Aden Duale, majority leader in Kenya's National Assembly.

Most of the 147 dead were students. Two security guards, one policeman and one soldier also were killed in the attack, Nkaissery said.

One suspected extremist was arrested as he tried to flee, Nkaissery told a news conference in Nairobi.

Heavy gunfire erupted at the college as the Kenyan military worked to end the siege. Police Inspector General Joseph Boinett said a dusk-to-dawn curfew will be in place in Garissa and three neighboring counties starting Friday through April 16.

The White House strongly condemned the attack and said the United States was providing assistance to the Kenyan government.

""We extend our deep condolences to the families and loved ones of all those killed in this heinous attack, which reportedly included the targeting of Christian students,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a statement.

Latin American leaders have rallied around embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro as relations between Washington and Caracas have plunged to a new low .
Governments from Havana to Buenos Aires have denounced Mr. Obama ’ s executive order labeling Venezuela as a national security threat as unwelcome U.S. meddling in regional affairs . Analysts say the move may do little to improve the volatile situation in Venezuela and could well worsen it .
The Obama administration imposed sanctions against seven high-ranking Venezuelan officials Monday as it accused Mr. Maduro of human rights abuses . It demanded the release of “ all political prisoners , ” including opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez , detained since February 2014 , and Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma , whom the government accuses of plotting a coup .
Mr. Maduro , a former bus driver and union leader who succeeded the populist Chavez in 2013 , fired back that the “ U.S . imperialist elite ” was trying topple his government . Venezuela ’ s allies across the Western Hemisphere have supported that view .
Ecuador called the U.S. order an “ unacceptable attack on Venezuela ’ s sovereignty , ” and Cuba — in the midst of efforts to mend ties with the United States — assured Caracas of its “ unconditional support . ”
The Venezuela spat throws a wrench into U.S. hopes for better relations with Latin America in the wake of the Cuba rapprochement . Many countries in Central and South America have long said the more than 50-year U.S. embargo on Havana was an impediment to better relations with the region as a whole .
Now the Venezuelan Congress , controlled by Maduro supporters , is racing to give the president expanded powers to fight “ imperialism ” from the north , including revived decree power to enact laws for up to six months without legislative approval . The measure could pass as soon as Sunday .
In Argentina , a close ally of President Cristina Fernandez doubled down Thursday by saying that Venezuela could not constitute a threat to a superpower such as the United States .
Sen. Ruperto Godoy , who chairs the Argentine Congress ’ committee on foreign affairs , accused Mr. Obama of exacerbating the problems in Venezuela .
In recent months , Venezuela has been marked by violent repression of protests , price inflation nearing 70 percent , plunging oil revenue with falling global prices and long lines at grocery stores that have led to severe shortages of basic household goods .
“ The attitude of the United States is absolutely exaggerated and surprising , ” Mr. Godoy said in an interview . Acknowledging that he was troubled by some “ incidents ” in Venezuela , the senator insisted that they were internal matters and that the rule of law was intact .
“ Of course I have confidence ” in Mr. Maduro , Mr. Godoy said . “ The government of Venezuela is in [ a position ] to resolve [ this situation ] . ”
In Ecuador , meanwhile , Mr. Obama ’ s executive order was a gift to leftist President Rafael Correa , who was a close friend of Chavez , said Felipe Burbano de Lara , who teaches at the Latin American Social Sciences Institute in Quito .
“ It allows [ Mr. Correa ] to reactivate the talking points of ‘ imperialist destabilization , ’ ” the political scientist said . “ My impression is that the U.S. government committed an error . ”
The Ecuadorean opposition has largely ignored the issue , which seems to play into the president ’ s hand , Mr. Burbano de Lara said , and Mr. Obama stands little chance of changing minds within a ruling class closely allied with Caracas .
“ The Ecuadorean government maintains a permanent silence about the events in Venezuela , ” he said . “ [ Its ] ideological loyalty is more important than any facts . ”
Mr. Obama ’ s executive order seems to have had the least blowback in Venezuela , said Yorelis Acosta de Oliveira , a political scientist at the Central University in the country ’ s capital .
Although the latest sanctions did “ raise dust in the Venezuelan political class , ” the measures had a direct effect on only a small number of high-ranking officials , Ms. Acosta de Oliveira said . But they did serve as an effective propaganda tool for Mr. Maduro .
“ Maduro uses this situation to create a great smokescreen , ” she said . But “ Venezuelan society is worried about other things . ”
Maduro aides show no signs of trying to tamp down the animosity . Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez on Thursday argued that the U.S. debate over a war resolution for fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria also could be laying legal groundwork for a war against Venezuela .
“ The U.S. is preparing to declare war on all countries because requesting authorization to use military force without a geographic restriction means they can invade any country , ” the minister told China ’ s Xinhua News Agency , saying her country is bracing for a Cuba-like economic and financial embargo from Washington .
Whether the dispute with the Obama administration will divert attention from Venezuela ’ s domestic woes is an open question .
Ordinary Venezuelans are trying to manage lives marked by “ chaos , crisis , scarcity and inflation , ” Ms. Acosta de Oliveira said .
The Obama administration was correct when it pointed to Mr. Maduro ’ s human rights abuses , Mr. Burbano de Lara and Ms. Acosta de Oliveira said . The U.S. government also said it was acting partly in response to sanctions announced in Caracas restricting the number of U.S. diplomats allowed in the country .
Since Mr. Maduro succeeded Chavez after his death in 2013 , the number of protests has increased — along with the number of violent responses by authorities at those demonstrations . But with weakened institutions and a fragmented opposition , hopes for change remain limited despite parliamentary elections set for the end of this year .

Rep. Peter King , R-N.Y. , said doing so would be `` terribly arrogant '' and `` wrong . ''
The call for a boycott was made earlier by Rep. Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , during an interview on `` Fox News Sunday . '' He was responding to House Speaker John Boehner 's announcement Friday that the House would vote on a select committee to investigate Benghazi .
The congressman said Democrats should not give the select committee more `` credibility '' by joining , dismissing new evidence that Republicans have called a `` smoking gun '' showing the White House politicized the tragedy .
`` I think it 's a colossal waste of time , '' said Schiff , also a member of the intelligence panel . `` I do n't think it makes sense , really , for Democrats to participate . ''
King , speaking afterward with Fox News , said this would be a `` mistake '' for Democrats as it would show they `` can not defend the administration . ''
`` If Democrats boycott this committee , refuse to take part , the American people are going to conclude , and I think quite rightly , that they feel they have something to hide , '' King said .
Schiff , who called the select committee a `` tremendous red herring , '' acknowledged he does n't know what Democratic leadership will decide .
Fox News was told on Friday that the panel would be bipartisan . Schiff 's comments , though , raise the prospect that his party could try to define the committee as a political vessel by sitting it out . The remarks reflect how the committee , which has not yet been formally approved , already is a political football . It would begin its investigative work in the heat of the midterm election season , poised to level damaging charges against the Obama administration at a sensitive time .
Leading Republicans were adamant that the committee is vital to get to the bottom of what happened in the days and weeks following the Sept. 11 , 2012 , attack which killed four Americans , including a U.S. ambassador .
The tipping point for those , like Boehner , who were hesitant about forming a select committee , was the release of an email that showed a White House adviser reviewing talking points for then-U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice . The email stressed the role of protests over an anti-Islam video -- which is the faulty explanation Rice went on to use to describe the Benghazi attack 's origin on Sunday news shows after the tragedy .
The White House maintains that email referenced protests elsewhere in the Middle East and Africa , but Sen. Kelly Ayotte , R-N.H. , said that claim `` does n't pass the laugh test . ''

Several analysts and officials speaking anonymously with The Times said there was resistance at the time to adding Boko Haram to Washington ’ s official terrorist organizations lists out of concern that doing so would bolster the group ’ s stature on the world stage and — as a result — enhance its ability to grow and recruit new members .
Now , the terror outfit commands a global stage after kidnapping more than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls .
But back in June 2012 , the State Department moved to designate three Boko Haram leaders as “ global terrorists ” with “ close links ” to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghrab .
Despite the designations , and mounting claims by regional experts that Boko Haram was gaining increasing access through AQIM to such military hardware as rocket-propelled grenades from jihadist smuggling networks in Mali and Libya , the Obama administration continued to resist labeling the entire group as a global terrorist organization .
Alternatively , the administration appeared to be acquiescing to a strategy being pushed during 2012 by the Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan to create an amnesty program in which Boko Haram members might avoid prosecution in exchange for laying down their weapons .

A similar approach during the late-2000s had succeeded in taming militant activity in Nigeria ’ s Christian south . But the effort yielded no significant results in the nation ’ s predominantly Muslim north — and was complicated because the Jonathan government ’ s security forces were running rampant in Northern Nigeria .
A Human Rights Watch report in October 2013 cited the implication of the security forces in such “ serious human rights violations ” as execution-style killings of detainees .
That report , along with the rapidly devolving situation in Northern Nigeria , served as backdrop for the State Departments sudden move in November 2013 to officially designate Boko Haram as a terrorist organization , ending what had been a heated debate over the group ’ s status .
What remains to be seen is whether the dispatching of U.S. and British officials to aid Nigerian authorities in attempting to rescue the 276 school girls recently kidnapped by Boko Haram will be followed by a deepening U.S. involvement in the situation .","U.S. officials have told The Washington Times that by mid-2012, a debate was raging behind the scenes at the State Department about how to publicly define the Boko Haram threat and how what exactly Washington should be doing to respond to the mounting violence in Africa’s top oil-producing nation.

Now, the terror outfit commands a global stage after kidnapping more than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls.

But back in June 2012, the State Department moved to designate three Boko Haram leaders as “global terrorists” with “close links” to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghrab.

Despite the designations, and mounting claims by regional experts that Boko Haram was gaining increasing access through AQIM to such military hardware as rocket-propelled grenades from jihadist smuggling networks in Mali and Libya, the Obama administration continued to resist labeling the entire group as a global terrorist organization.

Alternatively, the administration appeared to be acquiescing to a strategy being pushed during 2012 by the Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan to create an amnesty program in which Boko Haram members might avoid prosecution in exchange for laying down their weapons.

A similar approach during the late-2000s had succeeded in taming militant activity in Nigeria’s Christian south. But the effort yielded no significant results in the nation’s predominantly Muslim north — and was complicated because the Jonathan government’s security forces were running rampant in Northern Nigeria.

A Human Rights Watch report in October 2013 cited the implication of the security forces in such “serious human rights violations” as execution-style killings of detainees.

That report, along with the rapidly devolving situation in Northern Nigeria, served as backdrop for the State Departments sudden move in November 2013 to officially designate Boko Haram as a terrorist organization, ending what had been a heated debate over the group’s status.

What remains to be seen is whether the dispatching of U.S. and British officials to aid Nigerian authorities in attempting to rescue the 276 school girls recently kidnapped by Boko Haram will be followed by a deepening U.S. involvement in the situation.

Mishra on Sunday warned Muslim protesters to wind down sit-ins in Jafarabad and Chandbagh areas or face the ire of his supporters. The next day, a Hindu far-right group went on a rampage, resulting in pitched street battles between the communities in parts of northeast Delhi.

Mosques, shops and houses were set on fire, forcing many people from mixed neighbourhoods to move to safer areas. Many journalists were attacked while reporting on the events.

""He [Mishra] said all of this in the presence of the police. If the police had taken action against Mishra on that day itself, so many people would not have died,"" said Dr Anwar.

The doctor, assisted by his three brothers, worked through the night to ensure the injured were given necessary medical aid. He says the situation worsened the following night, Tuesday, as the number of injured increased.

Silence ruled in the city center , only punctuated by the sound of passing police helicopters .
Thursday 's big demonstration against the summit , titled `` Welcome To Hell , '' was the first serious test for the police . Flyers from the organizers instructed people to `` be noisy , angry and combative . '' The police knew that this would be the first gathering of the `` black block '' — the extreme anarchist end of the anti-capitalist movement .
Police officers have saturated the district around the Messehallen convention center for days now . Streets are blocked off . Hundreds of police vans from all over Germany line the pavements . Water cannons have been stationed around the city all week . The central part of Hamburg has been transformed into a fortress , despite statements by the city government that this was not supposed to happen .
On Thursday , the atmosphere turned oppressive . In the empty streets , tourists and residents photographed the anti-G-20 graffiti and the boarded-up shops . Many families have left the city for a long weekend . On some of the arterial routes , the remaining rush hour traffic was held up in big jams due to the passing convoys of the dignitaries , or because the police had blocked off streets .
Thousands of people turned up for the protest march . The organizers expected around 10,000 demonstrators . Some had come dressed in black , but many more did not fit the cliché of the habitual demonstrator . There were women and men , residents and tourists , people in dress shirts and others in workwear .
As the temperatures rose , the old fish market turned into a concert venue , a banner-making workshop , a meeting point . There were speeches , food and music .
Suddenly , a loud cheer erupted in the crowd . A small boat with half a dozen people passed by below the quays , with an anarchist flag fluttering in the breeze . It circled three times , then disappeared upriver .
Dirk Mirkow , who was dressed as an `` armed uprising , '' carrying a toy gun and a placard in front of his body , said he was there for many reasons . `` For example because Donald Trump denies climate change . And because the richest eight men own as much as a large percentage of the world 's population . ''

HAMBURG — With just 24 hours to go until the start of the Group of 20 summit, the usual traffic noise died down in Hamburg. Silence ruled in the city center, only punctuated by the sound of passing police helicopters.

Thursday's big demonstration against the summit, titled ""Welcome To Hell,"" was the first serious test for the police. Flyers from the organizers instructed people to ""be noisy, angry and combative."" The police knew that this would be the first gathering of the ""black block"" — the extreme anarchist end of the anti-capitalist movement.

Police officers have saturated the district around the Messehallen convention center for days now. Streets are blocked off. Hundreds of police vans from all over Germany line the pavements. Water cannons have been stationed around the city all week. The central part of Hamburg has been transformed into a fortress, despite statements by the city government that this was not supposed to happen.

Residents retreat

On Thursday, the atmosphere turned oppressive. In the empty streets, tourists and residents photographed the anti-G-20 graffiti and the boarded-up shops. Many families have left the city for a long weekend. On some of the arterial routes, the remaining rush hour traffic was held up in big jams due to the passing convoys of the dignitaries, or because the police had blocked off streets.

Thousands of people turned up for the protest march. The organizers expected around 10,000 demonstrators. Some had come dressed in black, but many more did not fit the cliché of the habitual demonstrator. There were women and men, residents and tourists, people in dress shirts and others in workwear.

As the temperatures rose, the old fish market turned into a concert venue, a banner-making workshop, a meeting point. There were speeches, food and music.

Suddenly, a loud cheer erupted in the crowd. A small boat with half a dozen people passed by below the quays, with an anarchist flag fluttering in the breeze. It circled three times, then disappeared upriver.

'Right to assemble'

Dirk Mirkow, who was dressed as an ""armed uprising,"" carrying a toy gun and a placard in front of his body, said he was there for many reasons. ""For example because Donald Trump denies climate change. And because the richest eight men own as much as a large percentage of the world's population.""

There was a huge police presence around the market square. The rows of vans, water cannons and officers in heavy riot gear stretched in all directions. When about 100 officers suddenly marched through the crowd along the waterfront, the atmosphere tensed but there were no physical confrontations.

On the short-lived march

Soon after, the organizers started the march. Several hundred demonstrators in black, many of whom wore hoods and had covered their faces, led the way. They moved about 1,300 feet down the road, toward a footbridge that passes overhead.

That's where the demonstration ended. A row of water cannons became visible in the distance, with their blue lights flashing. The police were stopping the march, just as many had expected.

People were ordered to remove any face coverings or the police would take action. Bystanders were told to leave the area.

More officers arrived from all sides. People on the march and the walkway above became increasingly nervous. More police officers with pepper spray canisters and protective gear took up position in the crowd.

It was only a matter of time before things would escalate. People realized that they would be surrounded. Many left via small side streets, but hundreds stayed in the main march. When the water cannon began to drench the crowd and the police began to use pepper spray, it was exactly what many had thought would happen.",www.usatoday.com,center,ptBrnZjA8sC8hZHk

One of two crew members survived the shooting down of a Russian warplane by Turkey on Tuesday, Russian officials say, and was rescued by a Syrian commando unit in an operation that ended early Wednesday.

The news comes as international tensions continue to rise over the incident. As we reported Tuesday, Turkey says the Russian Su-24 fighter jet was in Turkish airspace when it was shot down by Turkish F-16s. Turkey says it warned the Russian warplane 10 times before taking action.

Russia maintains the jet was flying over Syria at the time.

Both Russian crew members appeared to eject from the jet and parachute to the ground, but one was reportedly found dead Tuesday by a Syrian rebel group.

In Canada , there is an inescapable tendency to use another , more influential country ’ s politics to interpret one ’ s own . In the tense lead-up to the federal election on October 21 , a few Canadian leaders have tried to appropriate some of America ’ s far-right revanchist language—so the same must be happening on the progressive end too , right ? Does Canada have a Bernie Sanders ? How about an AOC ? Ad Policy
A former criminal defense lawyer and taker of countless selfies , 40-year-old Singh is the leader of Canada ’ s left-leaning New Democratic Party , and he ’ s racking up the firsts : He was the first politician to wear a turban in Ontario ’ s provincial parliament . ( Singh is an observant Sikh . ) He ’ s the first person of color to lead a major Canadian political party at the national level . And now—after being tapped for the NDP leadership in 2017—he ’ s running his first federal election campaign . Related Article Trudeau ’ s Blackface Is Appalling , and So Are His Policies Sophia Reuss
That means he ’ s probably also the first Canadian party leader to have been accused , at his own event , of trying to impose sharia law ; the first to be chastised on the street for not looking Canadian enough ; and the first whose party members may have begun to defect , in part , because they ’ re worried their constituents won ’ t vote for an NDP headed by a man in a turban .
Despite these hurdles , Singh—whose “ riding , ” or electoral district , is Burnaby South in Greater Vancouver—has been praised in the past few weeks after standing out in the leader debates , in large part because of his relentlessly upbeat messaging . The NDP , a perennial also-ran that lost a lot of ground in the 2015 election , is unlikely to win the election this year either . But the 2019 campaign has been a sort of coming-out party for Singh , following over a year of lukewarm reception as the new NDP leader . And there ’ s a lot for him to capitalize on : The Liberals , under current prime minister Justin Trudeau , have left their progressive promises unfulfilled . The Conservatives , headed by racism apologist Andrew Scheer , are focused on attacking Trudeau ’ s record from the right . Singh , the lesser-known quantity , has used the national campaign to shape his own image as the candidate for working Canadians , while the others are busy glad-handing the 1-percent .
Singh is not as seismic or beloved a figure as Bernie or AOC ( although he ’ s happy to align himself with the latter ) . His own colleagues have criticized him for being inexperienced . Some say he ’ s too in thrall to luxury to lead the working people ’ s party . And the entire NDP is dogged by Canada ’ s faulty electoral system , which could have progressives casting strategic votes for the Liberals instead . Nevertheless , Singh ’ s profile is rising—and , recently , Canadians gave the NDP a bump in the polls .
The NDP bills itself as Canada ’ s social democrat party , with an emphasis on pushing for a real living wage , stronger workers ’ rights , more Medicare funding , universal child care , and a fully progressive agenda that looks out for visible minorities , LGBTQ communities , and indigenous peoples . It has deep connections to organized labor , and its first leader back in 1961 was the legendary Saskatchewan premier Tommy Douglas , credited with creating Canada ’ s universal Medicare system . Douglas is widely considered one of the greatest Canadians of all time , yet the party he founded is perennially in third place , as the centrist Liberals and the right-leaning Conservatives duke it out for the top position . Current Issue View our current issue
However , as politics worldwide has become more polarized and more young voters have become interested in the left , Singh ’ s team is jockeying for advantage . Canadians are feeling squeezed right now : Housing prices skyrocketed in cities such as Toronto and Vancouver over the last decade , while wages lagged significantly behind inflation . Every party running candidates in this election is pitching its plan to help make life more affordable for ordinary , hard-working Canadian . And the NDP is offering to—in classic populist language— “ un-rig ” a system it says favors the rich .
The party ’ s platform this year is called “ A New Deal for People ” : It proposes to spend billions of dollars on dozens of measures , including 500,000 new affordable housing units , a national pharmacare program ( prescriptions aren ’ t covered by Canada ’ s universal Medicare ) , affordable child care , clean water for all indigenous communities , and investment in green transit across the country . The NDP—alongside their competitors on the left , the Green Party—are also pushing for a wealth tax , albeit one much milder than those being proposed by Elizabeth Warren and Sanders south of the border , at a mere 1 percent of supersized incomes .
Singh ’ s success in recent leader debates has NDP supporters hopeful that the party will get back the momentum it was starting to gain in the 2011 election , perhaps the most pivotal in NDP history . That year , the NDP ’ s then-leader Jack Layton led his party to win 103 seats—a historic best—and become the official opposition to long-entrenched Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’ s Conservatives . It was the first time the NDP had formed the opposition , and Layton brought it home while battling prostate cancer and a bad hip . ( He campaigned wielding a cane . ) The media called the NDP ’ s success the “ orange wave , ” after its official party color .
But shortly after the election , Layton ’ s cancer resurged . He took a leave of absence . Less than four months after the orange wave swept the country , he was dead . Without its famous leader , the NDP entered a fallow period . In an attempt to bring the party closer to center , a smooth-talking former Quebec Liberal named Thomas Mulcair was elected party leader in 2012 . The Liberals had lost badly in the previous election ; maybe , some thought , the NDP could maintain or even grow their newly attained standing by filling that centrist void , talking more about balancing the budget and fostering the private sector than about , say , hiking corporate taxes or cracking down on offshore tax havens .
It also gave a political heir named Justin Trudeau—a man who has recently admitted he can ’ t remember how many times he ’ s worn blackface—enough space to swoop in and become the progressive face of the 2015 election . The Liberals ended up winning a majority number of seats in the legislature , and Trudeau became prime minister . Meanwhile , the orange wave slowed to a trickle : the NDP won just 44 seats , less than half of what it won last time , and lost its official opposition status . In 2016 , party delegates handed Mulcair a harsh fate when they voted at the national NDP convention to hold another leadership race a year down the road .
Canadians had clearly identified with Jack Layton ’ s happy-warrior style : He was a proven community organizer who looked like your friend ’ s dad but also someone who ’ d be fun to have a beer with at the local bar . Mulcair was a much less charismatic , more moderate campaigner with a professorial style that played well in Parliament , as he questioned and criticized Harper ’ s Conservatives on seemingly every policy . But his approach left voters cold .
Jagmeet Singh looks and sounds nothing like Layton or Mulcair . Born and raised in Scarborough , Ontario , he ’ s the oldest son of Punjabi immigrants . He talks with a millennial cadence ( “ I ’ m pumped ! ” ) and is probably the only person in Canadian politics getting attention for being a snappy dresser and biking around Toronto . Singh , a provincial lawmaker in Ontario when Mulcair got turfed in 2016 , emerged as a possible breath of fresh air . Young people identify with him . He seems fluent in fashion and pop culture . He speaks openly about having been bullied by classmates and sexually abused as a child . Plus , he has an unmistakably progressive track record at the grassroots level , including giving pro bono legal counsel to marginalized youth and organizing through the Sikh Activist Network .
When Singh was elected NDP leader in 2017 , commentators on the left welcomed a new dawn for the ailing party .
But what followed wasn ’ t pretty . Singh didn ’ t seem to be growing into the job . He made widely mocked gaffes on big issues , from China to gun ownership . Singh had inherited a party that was struggling financially , and the new leader didn ’ t deliver much on fundraising . The NDP ended 2018 deeply in debt .
His own party began to second-guess him , giving him a hard time at a meeting last September for not cleaning up the party ’ s finances . After Singh ousted a Saskatchewan MP who was accused of sexual harassment , party vets in that province penned a letter accusing him of denying the MP due process . Singh has also had to deal with a number of prominent NDP lawmakers deciding , one after the other , to not run in this year ’ s election . In the Maritime province of New Brunswick this fall , both provincial and federal members of the NPD switched to the Green Party—and one cited Singh ’ s race as a reason , claiming that it jeopardized the NDP ’ s chances . ( That same person is now suing the NDP , and Singh , for painting him as a racist . )
This year ’ s federal campaign has exposed Canada ’ s intolerant underside : Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has repeatedly criticized Trudeau ’ s “ soft ” border policies , even dredging up the specter of MS-13—the Central American gang that Trump loves to talk about—as a reason to further secure the US–Canada border . Even further to the right is the People ’ s Party of Canada , led by former Conservative MP Maxime Bernier : he has vowed to stop “ mass immigration ” to Canada , so as to save it from multiculturalism and “ the cult of diversity . ”
Singh—who has spoken about the discrimination he experienced growing up—has also faced widely reported racism since deciding to enter federal politics . And , ironically , it has sometimes given him an opportunity to shine . During his 2017 bid for the party leadership , a woman crashed one of his gatherings in Ontario to accuse Singh of being “ in bed ” with sharia law and the Muslim Brotherhood . “ We don ’ t want to be intimidated by hate , we don ’ t want hatred to ruin a positive event , ” Singh replied . “ So let ’ s show people how to treat someone with love : We welcome you . We love you , we support you. ” More recently , Singh gave a moving response when Trudeau ’ s brown- and blackface scandal broke . When approached by a French-Canadian man who told him to “ cut ” his turban to “ look more like a Canadian , ” Singh dispatched him with grace .
Still , some have criticized Singh for not standing up enough for progressive causes since entering federal politics ; recently , prominent activist and journalist Desmond Cole said he felt let down by Singh not speaking up about police brutality since becoming NDP leader . And although Singh has carved out a prominent spot for himself in Canada ’ s political imagination during this campaign , his party has virtually no chance of beating the Liberals or Conservatives . If the Conservatives win the most seats and the NDP forms a coalition with the Liberals to counter them—a possibility about which both Singh and Trudeau have been noncommittal—then Singh may stay in the spotlight a little longer .
Singh ’ s message has just begun to resonate with Canadians , and he ’ ll have to build on recent success by learning how to command respect from those within his party . Meanwhile , he ’ s stuck trying to talk Canadians out of voting strategically—which , in this election , means not voting for the NDP . “ I feel like this idea of strategic voting has not allowed people to dream big , ” Singh said last weekend . “ I want people to dream big . ”","Ready to fight back?

Not quite—but it does have Jagmeet Singh.

Singh, the lesser-known quantity, has used the national campaign to shape his own image as the candidate for working Canadians, while the others are busy glad-handing the 1-percent.

Singh is not as seismic or beloved a figure as Bernie or AOC (although he’s happy to align himself with the latter). His own colleagues have criticized him for being inexperienced. Some say he’s too in thrall to luxury to lead the working people’s party. And the entire NDP is dogged by Canada’s faulty electoral system, which could have progressives casting strategic votes for the Liberals instead. Nevertheless, Singh’s profile is rising—and, recently, Canadians gave the NDP a bump in the polls.

The NDP bills itself as Canada’s social democrat party, with an emphasis on pushing for a real living wage, stronger workers’ rights, more Medicare funding, universal child care, and a fully progressive agenda that looks out for visible minorities, LGBTQ communities, and indigenous peoples. It has deep connections to organized labor, and its first leader back in 1961 was the legendary Saskatchewan premier Tommy Douglas, credited with creating Canada’s universal Medicare system. Douglas is widely considered one of the greatest Canadians of all time, yet the party he founded is perennially in third place, as the centrist Liberals and the right-leaning Conservatives duke it out for the top position.

However, as politics worldwide has become more polarized and more young voters have become interested in the left, Singh’s team is jockeying for advantage. Canadians are feeling squeezed right now: Housing prices skyrocketed in cities such as Toronto and Vancouver over the last decade, while wages lagged significantly behind inflation. Every party running candidates in this election is pitching its plan to help make life more affordable for ordinary, hard-working Canadian. And the NDP is offering to—in classic populist language—“un-rig” a system it says favors the rich.

The party’s platform this year is called “A New Deal for People”: It proposes to spend billions of dollars on dozens of measures, including 500,000 new affordable housing units, a national pharmacare program (prescriptions aren’t covered by Canada’s universal Medicare), affordable child care, clean water for all indigenous communities, and investment in green transit across the country. The NDP—alongside their competitors on the left, the Green Party—are also pushing for a wealth tax, albeit one much milder than those being proposed by Elizabeth Warren and Sanders south of the border, at a mere 1 percent of supersized incomes.

Singh’s success in recent leader debates has NDP supporters hopeful that the party will get back the momentum it was starting to gain in the 2011 election, perhaps the most pivotal in NDP history. That year, the NDP’s then-leader Jack Layton led his party to win 103 seats—a historic best—and become the official opposition to long-entrenched Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s Conservatives. It was the first time the NDP had formed the opposition, and Layton brought it home while battling prostate cancer and a bad hip. (He campaigned wielding a cane.) The media called the NDP’s success the “orange wave,” after its official party color.

But shortly after the election, Layton’s cancer resurged. He took a leave of absence. Less than four months after the orange wave swept the country, he was dead. Without its famous leader, the NDP entered a fallow period. In an attempt to bring the party closer to center, a smooth-talking former Quebec Liberal named Thomas Mulcair was elected party leader in 2012. The Liberals had lost badly in the previous election; maybe, some thought, the NDP could maintain or even grow their newly attained standing by filling that centrist void, talking more about balancing the budget and fostering the private sector than about, say, hiking corporate taxes or cracking down on offshore tax havens.

It also gave a political heir named Justin Trudeau—a man who has recently admitted he can’t remember how many times he’s worn blackface—enough space to swoop in and become the progressive face of the 2015 election. The Liberals ended up winning a majority number of seats in the legislature, and Trudeau became prime minister. Meanwhile, the orange wave slowed to a trickle: the NDP won just 44 seats, less than half of what it won last time, and lost its official opposition status. In 2016, party delegates handed Mulcair a harsh fate when they voted at the national NDP convention to hold another leadership race a year down the road.

Canadians had clearly identified with Jack Layton’s happy-warrior style: He was a proven community organizer who looked like your friend’s dad but also someone who’d be fun to have a beer with at the local bar. Mulcair was a much less charismatic, more moderate campaigner with a professorial style that played well in Parliament, as he questioned and criticized Harper’s Conservatives on seemingly every policy. But his approach left voters cold.

Jagmeet Singh looks and sounds nothing like Layton or Mulcair. Born and raised in Scarborough, Ontario, he’s the oldest son of Punjabi immigrants. He talks with a millennial cadence (“I’m pumped!”) and is probably the only person in Canadian politics getting attention for being a snappy dresser and biking around Toronto. Singh, a provincial lawmaker in Ontario when Mulcair got turfed in 2016, emerged as a possible breath of fresh air. Young people identify with him. He seems fluent in fashion and pop culture. He speaks openly about having been bullied by classmates and sexually abused as a child. Plus, he has an unmistakably progressive track record at the grassroots level, including giving pro bono legal counsel to marginalized youth and organizing through the Sikh Activist Network.

When Singh was elected NDP leader in 2017, commentators on the left welcomed a new dawn for the ailing party.

But what followed wasn’t pretty. Singh didn’t seem to be growing into the job. He made widely mocked gaffes on big issues, from China to gun ownership. Singh had inherited a party that was struggling financially, and the new leader didn’t deliver much on fundraising. The NDP ended 2018 deeply in debt.

His own party began to second-guess him, giving him a hard time at a meeting last September for not cleaning up the party’s finances. After Singh ousted a Saskatchewan MP who was accused of sexual harassment, party vets in that province penned a letter accusing him of denying the MP due process. Singh has also had to deal with a number of prominent NDP lawmakers deciding, one after the other, to not run in this year’s election. In the Maritime province of New Brunswick this fall, both provincial and federal members of the NPD switched to the Green Party—and one cited Singh’s race as a reason, claiming that it jeopardized the NDP’s chances. (That same person is now suing the NDP, and Singh, for painting him as a racist.)

This year’s federal campaign has exposed Canada’s intolerant underside: Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has repeatedly criticized Trudeau’s “soft” border policies, even dredging up the specter of MS-13—the Central American gang that Trump loves to talk about—as a reason to further secure the US–Canada border. Even further to the right is the People’s Party of Canada, led by former Conservative MP Maxime Bernier: he has vowed to stop “mass immigration” to Canada, so as to save it from multiculturalism and “the cult of diversity.”

Singh—who has spoken about the discrimination he experienced growing up—has also faced widely reported racism since deciding to enter federal politics. And, ironically, it has sometimes given him an opportunity to shine. During his 2017 bid for the party leadership, a woman crashed one of his gatherings in Ontario to accuse Singh of being “in bed” with sharia law and the Muslim Brotherhood. “We don’t want to be intimidated by hate, we don’t want hatred to ruin a positive event,” Singh replied. “So let’s show people how to treat someone with love: We welcome you. We love you, we support you.” More recently, Singh gave a moving response when Trudeau’s brown- and blackface scandal broke. When approached by a French-Canadian man who told him to “cut” his turban to “look more like a Canadian,” Singh dispatched him with grace.

Still, some have criticized Singh for not standing up enough for progressive causes since entering federal politics; recently, prominent activist and journalist Desmond Cole said he felt let down by Singh not speaking up about police brutality since becoming NDP leader. And although Singh has carved out a prominent spot for himself in Canada’s political imagination during this campaign, his party has virtually no chance of beating the Liberals or Conservatives. If the Conservatives win the most seats and the NDP forms a coalition with the Liberals to counter them—a possibility about which both Singh and Trudeau have been noncommittal—then Singh may stay in the spotlight a little longer.

Singh’s message has just begun to resonate with Canadians, and he’ll have to build on recent success by learning how to command respect from those within his party. Meanwhile, he’s stuck trying to talk Canadians out of voting strategically—which, in this election, means not voting for the NDP. “I feel like this idea of strategic voting has not allowed people to dream big,” Singh said last weekend. “I want people to dream big.”",www.thenation.com,left,7RWynzpnwXn7eC4v

Here's a look at a few developments on those front, broken down by region:

Iraq and Syria

NATO has only invoked Article 5 -- which mandates all countries come to the aid of another member of the alliance -- one time, in response to the al Qaeda threat following 9/11.

Now, its member states are intensely focused on ISIS, a relatively new terrorist group that has rampaged through the Middle East, executing American journalists and threatening more Westerners' lives.

No one is saying that NATO is about to repeat what it did over 12 years ago, including sending legions of ground troops into a country as it did Afghanistan. But its leaders are certainly talking tough about ISIS and the prospect of NATO playing a role in attacking it.

Any request by Iraq to NATO for aid in fighting ISIS would be ""considered seriously,"" according to NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who noted the Iraqi government hasn't reached out yet to the alliance.

The United States, however, has coordinated with the Baghdad government to launch airstrikes on ISIS fighters in Iraq and opened the door for similar attacks in Syria. Cameron told CNN that his country supports these American strikes and could take part in further military action.

""We don't rule anything out,"" said Cameron, adding that he wants ISIS ""squeezed out of existence.""

""We will act with partners in our national interest,"" Cameron said.

Yet he, like U.S. officials, stressed that military might alone won't end the threat posed by the Islamist militant group. Cameron said it's imperative local and national authorities in the Middle East take control and offer their citizens a government they can rely on.

""We must recognize,"" Cameron said, ""that what's required is helping those on the ground, rather than some Western intervention (that is) completely over their heads and (leaves) them to pick up the pieces.""

Ukraine

NATO countries' work with the governments of Iraq and Syria have been mixed, at best.

For Syria, they've refused to cooperate at all with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad -- even if he and NATO share a common enemy in ISIS.

Ukraine, though, is a different story.

Western leaders have made a point of supporting the Kiev-based government as it combats a rebel movement that, its officials say, has been supported in most every which way by the Kremlin. And even as Moscow denies any direct involvement, Western officials have demanded the Russia withdraw thousands of troops they say have crossed the border and shelled Ukrainian forces, not to mention pull its troops back from the border.

Terrible yet inspiring traces of D-Day remain in the Normandy landscape.

Omaha Beach, Normandy



On a bluff above the sand and a half-mile from the ocean’s edge at low tide, which was the condition when the first Allied soldiers left their landing craft, a round circle of concrete five feet in diameter provides a collar for a hole in the ground. On the morning of June 6, 1944, the hole was Widerstandsnest (nest of resistance) 62, a German machine-gun emplacement.

Hein Severloh had been in it since shortly after midnight, by which time U.S. aircraft were droning overhead, having dropped young American paratroopers Severloh’s age behind the beaches to disrupt German attempts to rush in reinforcements. Severloh had been billeted near Bayeux, home of the eleventh-century tapestry depicting a cross-Channel invasion that went the other way, taking William, Duke of Normandy, to become William the Conqueror, England’s sovereign.

Severloh believed that he killed hundreds of GIs, so long and slow was their walk to the safety, such as it was, of the five-foot embankment where the beach meets the bluff. Severloh returned here in sorrow and was consoled by survivors of the forces that waded ashore.

Today, a frequently seen bumper sticker proclaims: “War is not the answer.” But here, especially, it is well to remember that whether war is the answer depends on the question.

War was the answer to what ailed Europe in 1944. “In 1942,” writes Timothy Garton Ash of Oxford and Stanford’s Hoover Institution, “there were only four perilously free countries in Europe: Britain, Switzerland, Sweden and Ireland.” Twenty years — a historical blink — later, almost all of Western Europe was free. Twenty years after that, Spain, Portugal and Greece had joined the liberal democracies. Today, for the first time in 2,500 years, most Europeans live under such governments.

Ash argues that Europe cannot define itself negatively — as not America or not Islam. “Europe’s only defining ‘other’ is its own previous self” — its self-destructive, sometimes barbaric past. “This is,” Ash says, “still a very recent past.”

In 1951, just seven years after Severloh and some other Germans surrendered on June 7 to Americans at the village of St. Laurent, Europe began building the institutions that it hoped would keep such young men out of machine-gun emplacements. It created the European Coal and Steel Community, precursor of the Common Market (1958), which led to the single market in 1993 and the common currency in 2002.

The implicit hope was that commerce could tame Europe’s turbulent nations. The perennial problem of politics — mankind’s susceptibility to storms of passions — could perhaps be solved, or at least substantially ameliorated, by getting Europe’s peoples to sublimate their energies in economic activities. The quest for improved material well-being would drain away energies hitherto tapped and channeled by demagogues.

Reminders of Europe’s problematic past were recently found a few miles from St. Laurent. Workers preparing a foundation for a new house overlooking Omaha Beach came upon parts of the bodies of two German soldiers. There was scant media attention to this because such discoveries have not been rare.

Also near here, 21,160 German soldiers are buried at La Cambe Cemetery. Thirty percent — more than 6,000 — were never identified, so some German parents conducted “assumed burials.” They placed metal markers bearing the names of their missing sons near the graves of unknown soldiers who were known to have died near where the parents’ sons were last known to be fighting.

Such heartbreaking stories are written into Normandy’s lovely landscape. At the American Cemetery overlooking this beach, amid the many rows of white marble gravestones, are two, side by side, marking the burial places of Ollie Reed and Ollie Reed Jr., a father and his son. The son, an Army first lieutenant, died in Italy on July 6. His father, an Army colonel, was killed on July 30 in Normandy. Two telegrams notified the father’s wife, the son’s mother. The telegrams arrived in Manhattan, Kan., 45 minutes apart.

The 19th-century French scholar Ernest Renan, from a Brittany town on the English Channel, defined a nation as a community of shared memory — and shared forgetting. Europe’s emotional equipoise, and the transformation of “Europe” from a geographical to a political expression, has required both remembering and forgetting. Americans who make pilgrimages to this haunting place are reminded of their role, and their stake, in that transformation.

When is a Russian invasion of a neighboring country an incursion and an escalation, but not actually an invasion? When acknowledging that is in an invasion would complicate diplomacy to the point that ending the invasion could become much harder.

But there's more behind this confusion than just careful diplomacy. Russian President Vladimir Putin learned a crucial lesson from Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad last year, when the latter got away with using chemical weapons against his own people.

How to cross an American red line: slowly

That lesson is this: the Western world can set all the red lines it wants — don't use chemical weapons, don't invade sovereign countries — but if you cross that red line just a little bit at a time, inching across over weeks and months, rather than crossing it all at once, then Western publics and politicians will get red-line fatigue and lose interest by the time you're across.

There was no clear moment at which Assad had crossed the chemical weapons red line, so one day we woke up and realized he was miles on the wrong side of it, and it was too late to muster enough global outrage to push him back.

Putin's stealth invasion, right out in the open

That's what Putin did in eastern Ukraine this summer. First he began quietly supporting the separatist rebels there, then arming them. Then an awful lot of military-trained Russian nationals started slipping in, as Moscow had done before when invading and annexing Crimea in March.

In July, in the weeks before boneheaded rebels shot down a civilian airliner and killed 298 people, Russia began shipping them high-grade military technology, including surface-to-air missile systems. Shortly after the airliner shoot-down, Russian artillery in Russia began firing at Ukrainian military forces in Ukraine — an overt act of war. Then NATO said it caught Russia sending an ""incursion"" force across the border, which Ukraine claimed to destroy. Later, according to the rebel leader in Ukraine, 30 Russian tanks and up to 1,200 Russian-trained troops did manage to cross. By August 22nd, Russian artillery units were reportedly crossing the border into Ukraine, and a few days later, Ukraine captured ""rebels"" who admitted to being Russian soldiers sent under formal order.

Russia's meddling in eastern Ukraine became a stealth invasion, which has become an overt invasion. But it was all done just gradually enough, and with just enough uncertainty around each incremental escalation, that Russia has managed to invade a sovereign European country, in the year 2014, without sparking any larger war or the credible threat of any substantial response beyond sanctions.

world,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/02/21/ukrainian-presidency-says-deal-reached-at-crisis-talks/,Fresh violence flares in Ukraine as president announces concessions to end crisis,2014-02-21,,"Shots rang out and tension remained high in the streets of Kiev Friday , as Ukrainian protest leaders signed a deal with Ukraine 's president to defuse a political crisis that has left scores dead and hundreds injured .
After hours of European-led negotiations , Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych signed an agreement with opposition leaders Friday that calls for early elections , a new constitution and a new unity government . The deal promises presidential elections will be held no later than December , instead of March 2015 as scheduled .
Many protesters say December is too late -- they want Yanukovych out immediately .
Ukrainian authorities also will now name a new government -- including opposition figures -- within 10 days . The deal says the government will not impose a state of emergency and both sides will refrain from violence .
It 's a `` good compromise for Ukraine . Gives peace a chance . Opens the way for reform and to Europe . Poland and EU support it , '' European Union mediator , Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski , said in a Twitter post Friday .
The Ukrainian parliament approved amnesty for protesters involved in the violent months-long standoff , following the agreement Friday . The parliament also voted to restore the 2004 constitution that limits presidential powers , clawing back some of the powers that Yanukovych had pushed through after being elected in 2010 . Although Yanukovych retains an apparent majority in parliament , his powers are now significantly reduced .
Yanukovych gave in to pressure from European diplomats , offering concessions -- including elections -- and promising to invite the opposition into the government , in an attempt to end the violence .
Opposition leader Oleh Yaroslavovych Tyahnybok says one condition of the agreement was that the present interior minister and prosecutor-general be excluded from any interim government , Reuters reported , citing Interfax .
Russian officials immediately criticized the deal and protesters angry over police violence showed no sign of abandoning their sprawling camp in central Kiev . While opposition leaders agreed that protesters should hand over any weapons and withdraw from occupied buildings and protest camps around the country , it ’ s far from clear whether the thousands of demonstrators camped out in Kiev Friday will go home .
One by one , protesters took to a stage on Independence Square to say they 're not happy and did n't get what they wanted .
A statement on the website of the Health Ministry said 77 people had been killed between Tuesday morning , when the violence began , and Friday morning . The statement said 577 people had been wounded and 369 hospitalized . Opposition sources claimed at least 70 on their side were killed Thursday . There was no way to immediately verify the figures .
European foreign ministers had stayed up all night in Kiev trying to negotiate an end to the standoff , sparked when the president aborted a pact with the European Union in November in favor of close ties with Russia instead .
The U.S. , Russia and European Union are deeply concerned about the future of Ukraine , a nation of 46 million that has divided loyalties between Russia and the West .
Leonid Slutsky , the chairman of the committee in charge of relations with other ex-Soviet nations in the lower house of Russian parliament , told reporters Friday that the agreement serves the interests of the West .
`` We realize where and by whom this agreement has been written . It 's entirely in the interests of the United States and other powers , who want to split Ukraine from Russia , '' Slutsky said .
Slutsky also shrugged off claims that Russia could send its troops to Ukraine , saying Moscow will communicate with any government Ukraine has . “ No matter how bad and hard to deal with the new government is for us , we will deal with it , '' he said . `` We must learn from mistakes we have made . ''
Lawmaker Inna Bogoslovskaya , allied with the opposition , told The AP that December is too late for elections . `` After 77 corpses yesterday ... that changes the stakes , '' she said . `` The Maidan ( protest movement ) demands immediate resignation of the president instead of early elections . ''
Protesters will not abandon occupied buildings until after the constitution is changed , she added .
`` It 's completely not enough , '' said protester Anton Gusev , standing at one of the barricades near city hall . Referring to the election date , he said , `` December or March - what difference does it make ? ''
At the city hall barricade , protesters were busily organizing stacks of tires . The street was crowded with people heading toward the central square .
Several regions in the west of the country are in open revolt against the central government , while many in eastern Ukraine back the president and favor strong ties with Russia , their former Soviet ruler .
In a sign of the high tensions , armed law enforcement officers tried to enter parliament Friday morning during a debate over measures to end the crisis . Shouting lawmakers pushed them out .
The report of a deal followed the worst violence yet in the confrontation between the government and protesters . Demonstrators advanced on police lines in the heart of the Ukrainian capital on Thursday , prompting government snipers to shoot back and kill scores of people in the country 's deadliest day since the breakup of the Soviet Union a quarter-century ago .

The violence is making Ukraine 's economic troubles worse . Ratings agency Standard & Poor 's downgraded Ukraine 's debt rating Friday , saying the country will likely default if there are no significant improvements in the political crisis , which it does not expect .","Shots rang out and tension remained high in the streets of Kiev Friday, as Ukrainian protest leaders signed a deal with Ukraine's president to defuse a political crisis that has left scores dead and hundreds injured.

After hours of European-led negotiations, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych signed an agreement with opposition leaders Friday that calls for early elections, a new constitution and a new unity government. The deal promises presidential elections will be held no later than December, instead of March 2015 as scheduled.

Many protesters say December is too late -- they want Yanukovych out immediately.

Ukrainian authorities also will now name a new government-- including opposition figures --within 10 days. The deal says the government will not impose a state of emergency and both sides will refrain from violence.

It's a ""good compromise for Ukraine. Gives peace a chance. Opens the way for reform and to Europe. Poland and EU support it,'' European Union mediator, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, said in a Twitter post Friday.

The Ukrainian parliament approved amnesty for protesters involved in the violent months-long standoff, following the agreement Friday. The parliament also voted to restore the 2004 constitution that limits presidential powers, clawing back some of the powers that Yanukovych had pushed through after being elected in 2010. Although Yanukovych retains an apparent majority in parliament, his powers are now significantly reduced.

Yanukovych gave in to pressure from European diplomats, offering concessions-- including elections-- and promising to invite the opposition into the government, in an attempt to end the violence.

Opposition leader Oleh Yaroslavovych Tyahnybok says one condition of the agreement was that the present interior minister and prosecutor-general be excluded from any interim government, Reuters reported, citing Interfax.

Russian officials immediately criticized the deal and protesters angry over police violence showed no sign of abandoning their sprawling camp in central Kiev. While opposition leaders agreed that protesters should hand over any weapons and withdraw from occupied buildings and protest camps around the country, it’s far from clear whether the thousands of demonstrators camped out in Kiev Friday will go home.

One by one, protesters took to a stage on Independence Square to say they're not happy and didn't get what they wanted.

A statement on the website of the Health Ministry said 77 people had been killed between Tuesday morning, when the violence began, and Friday morning. The statement said 577 people had been wounded and 369 hospitalized. Opposition sources claimed at least 70 on their side were killed Thursday. There was no way to immediately verify the figures.

European foreign ministers had stayed up all night in Kiev trying to negotiate an end to the standoff, sparked when the president aborted a pact with the European Union in November in favor of close ties with Russia instead.

The U.S., Russia and European Union are deeply concerned about the future of Ukraine, a nation of 46 million that has divided loyalties between Russia and the West.

Leonid Slutsky, the chairman of the committee in charge of relations with other ex-Soviet nations in the lower house of Russian parliament, told reporters Friday that the agreement serves the interests of the West.

""We realize where and by whom this agreement has been written. It's entirely in the interests of the United States and other powers, who want to split Ukraine from Russia,"" Slutsky said.

Slutsky also shrugged off claims that Russia could send its troops to Ukraine, saying Moscow will communicate with any government Ukraine has. “No matter how bad and hard to deal with the new government is for us, we will deal with it,"" he said. ""We must learn from mistakes we have made.""

Lawmaker Inna Bogoslovskaya, allied with the opposition, told The AP that December is too late for elections. ""After 77 corpses yesterday ... that changes the stakes,"" she said. ""The Maidan (protest movement) demands immediate resignation of the president instead of early elections.""

Protesters will not abandon occupied buildings until after the constitution is changed, she added.

""It's completely not enough,"" said protester Anton Gusev, standing at one of the barricades near city hall. Referring to the election date, he said, ""December or March - what difference does it make?""

At the city hall barricade, protesters were busily organizing stacks of tires. The street was crowded with people heading toward the central square.

Several regions in the west of the country are in open revolt against the central government, while many in eastern Ukraine back the president and favor strong ties with Russia, their former Soviet ruler.

In a sign of the high tensions, armed law enforcement officers tried to enter parliament Friday morning during a debate over measures to end the crisis. Shouting lawmakers pushed them out.

The report of a deal followed the worst violence yet in the confrontation between the government and protesters. Demonstrators advanced on police lines in the heart of the Ukrainian capital on Thursday, prompting government snipers to shoot back and kill scores of people in the country's deadliest day since the breakup of the Soviet Union a quarter-century ago.

Protesters across the country are upset over corruption in Ukraine, the lack of democratic rights and the country's ailing economy, which just barely avoided bankruptcy with the first disbursement of a $15 billion bailout promised by Russia.

The violence is making Ukraine's economic troubles worse. Ratings agency Standard & Poor's downgraded Ukraine's debt rating Friday, saying the country will likely default if there are no significant improvements in the political crisis, which it does not expect.

He may have been laying low for fear of being targeted, though the U.S. government believes he remained involved in kidnapping and killing cells.

Analysts describe him as grotesque and fond of sadistic torture techniques, with one former hostage recounting last month how his captor made him dance the tango with him

""Suddenly, he changed and just pushed me down,"" Daniel Rye, a 26-year-old photographer, recalled to Danish broadcaster DR. ""They kicked and hit me. They finished by threatening to cut my nose off with pliers and things like that.""

Speaking to Japanese state broadcaster NHK, Junichi Goto speculated on whether his brother, slain hostage Kenji Goto, might be alive today if the airstrike had happened earlier, though realizing that ISIS' deeds can't be reduced to just one man.

""ISIS continues to kill hostages in the same way it did to Kenji,"" Junichi Goto said. ""I wish no repeat of the tragedy. And I wish ISIS would disappear.""",www.cnn.com,left,JlHmfEt6NYhgqZJS

The political situation in Venezuela is bad

Maduro, a former bus driver who took over as president after former President Hugo Chávez died in 2013, has overseen a catastrophic economic collapse in Venezuela.

Venezuelans suffer from widespread food and medicine shortages, and the majority of the country is living in poverty. Seventy-five percent of the country’s population lost an average of 19 pounds of bodyweight between 2015 and 2016, and the International Monetary Fund expects inflation in Venezuela to reach 13,000 percent in 2018. Thousands of Venezuelans are fleeing the country.

Yet Maduro remains in power. He won reelection in May due to a largely rigged election. He banned two of the most popular opposition leaders, Leopoldo Lopez and Henrique Capriles, from running against him, and implied that any Venezuelans who didn’t vote for him could lose government food subsidies.

His election is likely to worsen the economic crisis in Venezuela: Instead of electing a reformer who might enact the measures necessary to pull the country out of the state it’s in right now, such as addressing its currency exchange policy and diversifying the economy away from oil dependence, the country now has Maduro for another six years. And he remains defiant — in the face of opposition, or alleged assassination attempts.

ISTANBUL — Two powerful blasts rocked the Turkish capital of Ankara early Saturday morning, killing up to 97 people and wounding scores of others in the deadliest attack on the nation's soil in recent history.

The explosions, which came just seconds apart shortly after 10 a.m., occurred during a crowded peace rally near Ankara’s central train station, where hundreds of demonstrators — many of them supporters of the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) — had gathered to protest escalating violence between Turkish security forces and Kurdish separatist insurgents.

He feared death toll could rise even higher, since several of the wounded were in serious condition with burns.

The official death toll was released in a televised news conference by Turkey’s Health Minister Mehmet Muezzinoglu.

The state-run Anadolu Agency said the attacks were carried out with TNT explosives fortified with metal ball-bearings. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which came as the country grapples with mounting violence ahead of fresh parliamentary elections on Nov. 1.

Bolsonaro 's victory caps ones of the most polarizing and violent political campaigns in Brazil 's history , amid a prolonged recession , rising crime rates and widespread corruption scandals .
In a victory speech Sunday , Bolsonaro said he was a `` defender of freedom '' who would run a government that protected citizens who `` follow their duties and respect the laws . ''
`` The laws are for everyone , this is how it will be during our constitutional and democratic government , '' he said .
Bolsonaro was declared the winner by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal after 94 % of the votes were counted , easily defeating his leftist ex-Sao Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad .
Supporters of far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro celebrate in front of his house in Rio de Janeiro on October 28 .
The electoral tribunal released early results showing Bolsonaro leading with 55.54 % of votes to Haddad 's 44.46 % , a difference larger than the amount of votes left to be counted .
But while Bolsonaro 's supporters were rejoicing on Sunday , opponents voiced concerns that his victory could threaten human rights and ecological preservation in the world 's fourth largest democracy .
Speaking earlier in the day , Haddad said Brazil 's democracy was `` at stake '' in Sunday 's vote . `` I believe today is a great day for the country which has arrived at a crossroads , '' he said .
Troubled over Bolsonaro 's promises to open up tracks of the Amazon rainforest to development , environmental groups warned his election would be a `` profound setback . ''
`` His reckless plans to industrialize the Amazon in concert with Brazilian and international agribusiness and mining sectors will bring untold destruction to the planet 's largest rainforest and the communities who call it home , and spell disaster for the global climate , '' Amazon Watch program director Christian Poirier said in a statement to CNN .
Jair Bolsonaro waves after voting in the presidential runoff election in Rio de Janeiro on October 28 .
Bolsonaro won the first round of the elections in October amid a field of 13 candidates , but he fell short of the 50 % needed to win outright and avoid a runoff against Haddad , from the Workers ' Party .

Bolsonaro's victory caps ones of the most polarizing and violent political campaigns in Brazil's history, amid a prolonged recession, rising crime rates and widespread corruption scandals.

In a victory speech Sunday, Bolsonaro said he was a ""defender of freedom"" who would run a government that protected citizens who ""follow their duties and respect the laws.""

""The laws are for everyone, this is how it will be during our constitutional and democratic government,"" he said.

Bolsonaro was declared the winner by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal after 94% of the votes were counted, easily defeating his leftist ex-Sao Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad.

The electoral tribunal released early results showing Bolsonaro leading with 55.54% of votes to Haddad's 44.46%, a difference larger than the amount of votes left to be counted.

But while Bolsonaro's supporters were rejoicing on Sunday, opponents voiced concerns that his victory could threaten human rights and ecological preservation in the world's fourth largest democracy.

Speaking earlier in the day, Haddad said Brazil's democracy was ""at stake"" in Sunday's vote. ""I believe today is a great day for the country which has arrived at a crossroads,"" he said.

Troubled over Bolsonaro's promises to open up tracks of the Amazon rainforest to development, environmental groups warned his election would be a ""profound setback.""

""His reckless plans to industrialize the Amazon in concert with Brazilian and international agribusiness and mining sectors will bring untold destruction to the planet's largest rainforest and the communities who call it home, and spell disaster for the global climate,"" Amazon Watch program director Christian Poirier said in a statement to CNN.

Politically motivated violence

Bolsonaro won the first round of the elections in October amid a field of 13 candidates, but he fell short of the 50% needed to win outright and avoid a runoff against Haddad, from the Workers' Party.

""This has been an unprecedented election,"" said Marco Antonio Teixeira, a political science professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation. ""The rhetoric used by both candidates throughout the campaign has been extremely aggressive.""

That hostility has carried over into the streets. Dozens of politically motivated acts of violence have been registered by voters, journalist and politicians.

Bolsonaro, 63, was stabbed in the stomach last month during a rally in the city of Juiz de Fora, in Minas Gerais state. When he went to cast his ballot on Sunday, the congressman wore body armor and arrived by the back entrance.

The stabbing took him off the campaign trail for weeks as he recovered. But it strengthened his position among Brazilians looking for a change.

Bolsonaro's increased visibility prompted a social media backlash known as #elenao, or #nothim, which gained support throughout the country and internationally.

During his Brazil tour, Pink Floyd co-founder Roger Waters exhibited the slogan on stage in neon lights and chanted ""ele nao"" with the crowd.

Protesters have also taken the chant to the streets during a recent ""Women Against Bolsonaro march"" in Sao Paulo.

""Bolsonaro has opened a Pandora box,"" protest organizer Luka Franca said. ""He's given a voice to an ultra right population who want to voice their prejudice and annihilate anyone who is different.""

Ugly rhetoric

Bolsonaro, who has been compared to US President Donald Trump and Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, has stirred controversy by making misogynistic, racist and homophobic remarks.

He once told a congresswoman that she did not deserve to be raped because she was ""very ugly,"" Brazil's TV Globo reported.

He also said publicly he'd prefer to see his son ""die in an accident"" than a member of his family be homosexual.

NPR 's Corey Flintoff tells our Newscast unit that Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko ordered a cease-fire once separatists agreed to peace talks at a meeting in Belarus .
During a televised press conference , Poroshenko said the peace deal was forged based on a phone conversation he had with Russian President Vladimir Putin .
`` That 's why I think this is very important , '' he said . `` And why this cease-fire should last . ''
`` Ukrainian representatives met the separatists , along with representatives from Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe . `` The negotiations come as Ukrainian troops came under heavy fire from militant forces in Donetsk and near the southern port city of Mariupol . `` Ukraine , the United States and NATO say the separatists are being joined in the assault by elite Russian troops with heavy artillery . `` Russia denies any involvement in the fighting . ''
On his twitter account , Poroshenko said he had ordered his military to stop fighting at 11 a.m . ET .
`` We must do everything possible to stop the bloodshed and put an end to the suffering , '' Poroshenko tweeted .
It 's worth noting that previous cease-fire deals have fallen apart quickly .
Reuters also reports that not much has changed as far as the position of each party is concerned . Igor Plotnitsky , the leader of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People 's Republic , told Reuters that despite the cease-fire deal , it will still seek independence from Ukraine .
As we reported , the potential for a cease-fire was being watched closely by the members of NATO meeting in Wales on Friday .
During a press conference , President Obama said the U.S. was `` hopeful , but based on past experiences also skeptical '' about the brand-new cease-fire that took effect Friday in Ukraine .
Separately , as well as an alliance , NATO members had stepped up their rhetoric in regard to Russia , warning that if Russia invaded a member nation , it would face the full force of NATO , including the United States military .
To that end , NATO announced it was deploying several thousand troops in Eastern Europe and warned that more stringent sanctions could be placed on Russia by member states if it did not de-escalate the situation in Ukraine .

This post was updated at 1 p.m. ET.

The government of Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists in the east say they have stopped fighting, honoring a cease-fire that took effect late Friday afternoon local time.

NPR's Corey Flintoff tells our Newscast unit that Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko ordered a cease-fire once separatists agreed to peace talks at a meeting in Belarus.

During a televised press conference, Poroshenko said the peace deal was forged based on a phone conversation he had with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""That's why I think this is very important,"" he said. ""And why this cease-fire should last.""

Corey adds:

""Ukrainian representatives met the separatists, along with representatives from Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. ""The negotiations come as Ukrainian troops came under heavy fire from militant forces in Donetsk and near the southern port city of Mariupol. ""Ukraine, the United States and NATO say the separatists are being joined in the assault by elite Russian troops with heavy artillery. ""Russia denies any involvement in the fighting.""

On his twitter account, Poroshenko said he had ordered his military to stop fighting at 11 a.m. ET.

Human life, he added, is of the highest value.

""We must do everything possible to stop the bloodshed and put an end to the suffering,"" Poroshenko tweeted.

It's worth noting that previous cease-fire deals have fallen apart quickly.

Reuters also reports that not much has changed as far as the position of each party is concerned. Igor Plotnitsky, the leader of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic, told Reuters that despite the cease-fire deal, it will still seek independence from Ukraine.

As we reported, the potential for a cease-fire was being watched closely by the members of NATO meeting in Wales on Friday.

During a press conference, President Obama said the U.S. was ""hopeful, but based on past experiences also skeptical"" about the brand-new cease-fire that took effect Friday in Ukraine.

Separately, as well as an alliance, NATO members had stepped up their rhetoric in regard to Russia, warning that if Russia invaded a member nation, it would face the full force of NATO, including the United States military.

To that end, NATO announced it was deploying several thousand troops in Eastern Europe and warned that more stringent sanctions could be placed on Russia by member states if it did not de-escalate the situation in Ukraine.

The cease-fire announced Friday fits in with a seven-point peace plan outlined by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday.

Update at 10:40 a.m. ET. Cease-Fire Based On Deal With Putin:

It is still unclear who was behind the attacks.

world,CNN (Web News),0,http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/24/middleeast/warplane-crashes-near-syria-turkey-border/index.html,Putin calls plane's downing by Turkey 'stab in the back',2015-11-24,"Don Melvin, Michael Martinez, Zeynep Bilginsoy","Istanbul ( CNN ) One of the world 's most volatile regions was roiled further Tuesday when Turkey shot down a Russian warplane near the Turkish-Syrian border . Turkey said it hit the plane after it violated Turkey 's airspace and ignored 10 warnings .
One of the two pilots was killed in the air by fire from the ground , according to Russia 's state-run news agency RIA Novosti . The fate of the second pilot was n't disclosed .
Meanwhile , a Russian marine was killed on Tuesday during an operation to rescue the two pilots , who were flying an Su-24 warplane in a combat sortie , according to RIA Novosti .
Turkey and Russia exchanged bellicose language after the downing of the plane , raising fears in the international community that the Syrian conflict could spiral into something wider .
The Russian plane was dealt with because it `` did not answer our warning , '' Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday .
ISIS is n't present at that border area , but Turkmen were there , Erdogan said . Anyone who bombs that area attacks `` our brothers and sisters -- Turkmen , '' Erdogan said in Ankara . Turkmen are a Turkic-speaking , traditionally nomadic people who live primarily in Central Asia , but a small minority of them can be found in the Middle East , primarily in northern Iraq , Iran and Turkey .
Erdogan said the plane incident was not something Turkey wanted to see happen , and `` this does not indicate any animosity '' toward any country .
He added the downed jet was `` one of two '' planes but did n't elaborate beyond that .
It 's been Turkey 's cool approach that has prevented similar incidents up to now , he added .
Turkey 's ambassador to the United States , Serdar Kilic , tweeted : `` Understand this : Turkey is a country whose warnings should be taken seriously and listened to . Do n't test Turkey 's patience . Try to win its friendship . ''
A U.S. official told CNN that a calculation shows the Russian jet was in Turkish airspace for 30 seconds or less . The Turkish government has said that it issued 10 warnings over five minutes but did not say all of those warnings occurred while the jet was in their airspace .
Russian President Vladimir Putin said the downing of the plane would have `` serious consequences for Russia 's relationship with Turkey . ''
JUST WATCHED Russia : Pilot dead , marine killed in rescue attempt Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Russia : Pilot dead , marine killed in rescue attempt 03:45
The shooting of the plane , Putin said , `` represents a stab in the back by the terrorists ' accomplices . I ca n't describe what has happened today in any other way . Our plane was downed over Syrian territory by an air-to-air missile from a Turkish F-16 jet .
`` The plane fell on Syrian territory 4 kilometers ( 2.5 miles ) away from the Turkish border . It was flying 1 kilometer away from the Turkish border when it was attacked . In any case , neither our pilots nor our jet posed any threat to Turkey . That is obvious . They were carrying out an operation fighting against ISIL in Northern Latakia . '' ( ISIL is another acronym for ISIS . )
The two Russian pilots managed to eject their Su-24 plane , the Russian military said .
Two Russian Mi-8 helicopters performed a search-and-rescue operation , but one of them was damaged by small arms fire and made an emergency landing , Russian Lt. Gen. Sergei Rudskoy said . One Russian marine was killed .
`` The helicopter was destroyed by mortar fire conducted from the territory controlled by illegal , armed groups , '' Rudskoy said .
Future Russia airstrikes `` will be carried out only under cover of fighter aircraft , '' Rudskoy said .
Also , the Russian cruiser Moskva will go to the shore zone of Syrian port of Latakia , and the military `` warns that all the potentially dangerous targets will be destroyed , '' Rudskoy said .
New video published on social media by a Syrian rebel group allegedly shows Turkmen rebels shooting at the two ejected pilots landing on the border between Turkey and Syria .
Speaking in Turkish language , a man shouts off-camera , `` do n't shoot at them '' and `` capture them alive , '' referring to the two Russian pilots .
Heavy gunfire can be heard on the video . The rebels also shout , `` God is great ! ''
Erdogan on Tuesday pointed how Turkey has been hosting 2 million Syrian refugees while European countries have panicked over smaller numbers seeking refuge there .
It 's not possible to resolve terrorism or refugee problems without finding a sustainable solution to Syria , but the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad and countries that support it have started a new assault that does not fit with finding a resolution for the area , Erdogan said .
Turkey vehemently opposes the Assad regime . Russia is backing it .
After holding an emergency meeting in Brussels on Tuesday , NATO 's governing body , the North Atlantic Council , said Turkey informed the body about the plane 's downing .
Turkey is a member of NATO , which considers an attack on one of its members to be an attack on them all .
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg urged `` calm and de-escalation '' to resolve the Turkey-Russia situation , but he noted how Russian forces approach allies ' borders .
`` I have previously expressed my concern about the implications of the military actions of the Russian Federation close to NATO 's borders , '' the Stoltenberg said . `` This highlights the importance of having and respecting arrangements to avoid such incidents in the future .
`` As we have repeatedly made clear , we stand in solidarity with Turkey and support the territorial integrity of our NATO ally , Turkey , '' he added .
A NATO official told CNN that `` when Russian jets violated Turkish airspace a few weeks ago , the Council did meet in an extraordinary session , which resulted in a condemnation of the incursion . ''
Not long after the plane was shot down Tuesday morning , spitting fire and diving nose-first toward the ground , Turkey took responsibility . Turkey 's semiofficial outlet , the Anadolu Agency , quoted Turkish presidential sources as saying the Russian Su-24 was `` hit within the framework of engagement rules '' in Syria 's Bayirbucak area , near the border with Turkey .
While ISIS does not operate in the area where the plane went down , other rebel groups do , including al Nusra Front -- al Qaeda 's affiliate in Syria -- along with more moderate U.S.-backed groups .
A Russian plane is seen crashing nose-first in northern Syria .
Abu Ibrahim al-Sheghri , the military leader in the 10th coastal brigade and part of the Turkmen Mountain Military Operation Room , told CNN that the body of one of the pilots had been found in the Nibh Almur area of Syria . The brigade is searching for the other pilot in the same area , he said .
Early this year , Moath al-Kasasbeh , a Jordanian pilot whose plane crashed in Syria the previous December , was burned alive by ISIS while he was trapped in a cage .
U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday that `` Turkey has the right to defend its country and its airspace , '' but he acknowledged that U.S. officials `` do n't have all the information yet . ''
Obama said it was important that Russia and Turkey are in contact with one another to `` take measures to discourage any kind of escalation . ''
He said the plane incident `` points to an ongoing problem with the Russian operations '' in Syria , which are taking place very close to the Turkish border . Russia has been going after `` moderate opposition '' that has the support of Turkey , Obama said .
If Russia instead focused on fighting only ISIS , `` some of those conflicts or potential for escalation are less likely to occur , '' Obama said .
He said the encounter also `` underscores the importance of our moving the political track along as quickly as possible '' when it comes to resolving the Syrian civil war .
Obama made his remarks at a news conference with French President Francois Hollande at the White House , held to discuss the recent terror attacks on Paris .
Hollande called the plane incident `` a serious one '' and said Turkey is providing information to NATO `` so that we can find what really happened . ''
Hollande will be traveling to Russia this week to meet with Putin and discuss taking action against ISIS .
`` We must find a solution to the Syrian crisis , '' Hollande said .
Turkey released a purported image of the flight path of the plane showing it had violated Turkish airspace . Two Turkish F-16s responded `` within engagement rules , '' the country 's officials said .

But the Russian Defense Ministry said `` objective monitoring confirmed '' the plane was not in Turkish airspace .
`` The Su-24 bomber jet was in Syrian airspace at the altitude 6,000 meters , the Russian Defense Ministry said , '' according to Sputnik . `` The pilots were reportedly able to parachute out of the jet before it crashed . ''
Syria has been embroiled for more than four years in a civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people , sent millions of families fleeing and laid waste to cities .
Skirmishes between Turks and Syrians have taken place in the past , with Turkish officials accusing Syrian planes of violating Turkish air space .
Sajjan Gohel , international security director for the Asia-Pacific Foundation , a think tank , described the downing of the plane as `` a very significant escalation . ''
`` It 's very much the last thing that 's needed right now , especially in the aftermath of the Paris attacks , when there was hope that Russia could form an alliance with France and with the United States against ISIS , '' Gohel said . `` This is going to complicate things . This is going to add unnecessary tensions that really were n't required at this critical juncture . ''
He said the downing of the Russian plane would hamper efforts to form a united front against ISIS .
`` This is a situation that unfortunately was almost inevitable at some point , because Turkey has long been accusing Russia of interfering in their airspace , '' Gohel said . `` They 've threatened them in the past . And even though economic relations between the two countries are strong -- politically , there have been tensions recently . ''
Syria 's internal conflict has become a massive proxy war for numerous international powers , both in the region and outside it -- a situation that has added to the perception that incidents such as Tuesday 's plane downing were inevitable .
Currently , the United States , Russia , France , Australia , the Gulf states , Turkey , Israel , Iran , Jordan and Hezbollah are involved , one way or another , in military activity in Syria .
In March 2014 , Turkey shot down a Syrian fighter jet after the warplane strayed into its airspace , according to Erdogan , the current president , who was prime minister at the time .
`` Our F-16s went up in the air and shot that plane down . Why ? Because if you violate my airspace , then from now on , our slap will be hard , '' Erdogan told supporters at a campaign rally in 2014 .
But state-run media in Syria called it an act of `` blatant aggression '' and said the downed plane was over northern Syria at the time .","Istanbul (CNN) One of the world's most volatile regions was roiled further Tuesday when Turkey shot down a Russian warplane near the Turkish-Syrian border.

Erdogan said the plane incident was not something Turkey wanted to see happen, and ""this does not indicate any animosity"" toward any country.

He added the downed jet was ""one of two"" planes but didn't elaborate beyond that.

It's been Turkey's cool approach that has prevented similar incidents up to now, he added.

Turkey's ambassador to the United States, Serdar Kilic, tweeted: ""Understand this: Turkey is a country whose warnings should be taken seriously and listened to. Don't test Turkey's patience. Try to win its friendship.""

A U.S. official told CNN that a calculation shows the Russian jet was in Turkish airspace for 30 seconds or less. The Turkish government has said that it issued 10 warnings over five minutes but did not say all of those warnings occurred while the jet was in their airspace.

'Serious consequences'

Russian President Vladimir Putin said the downing of the plane would have ""serious consequences for Russia's relationship with Turkey.""

The shooting of the plane, Putin said, ""represents a stab in the back by the terrorists' accomplices. I can't describe what has happened today in any other way. Our plane was downed over Syrian territory by an air-to-air missile from a Turkish F-16 jet.

""The plane fell on Syrian territory 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) away from the Turkish border. It was flying 1 kilometer away from the Turkish border when it was attacked. In any case, neither our pilots nor our jet posed any threat to Turkey. That is obvious. They were carrying out an operation fighting against ISIL in Northern Latakia."" (ISIL is another acronym for ISIS.)

What happened

The two Russian pilots managed to eject their Su-24 plane, the Russian military said.

Two Russian Mi-8 helicopters performed a search-and-rescue operation, but one of them was damaged by small arms fire and made an emergency landing, Russian Lt. Gen. Sergei Rudskoy said. One Russian marine was killed.

""The helicopter was destroyed by mortar fire conducted from the territory controlled by illegal, armed groups,"" Rudskoy said.

Future Russia airstrikes ""will be carried out only under cover of fighter aircraft,"" Rudskoy said.

Also, the Russian cruiser Moskva will go to the shore zone of Syrian port of Latakia, and the military ""warns that all the potentially dangerous targets will be destroyed,"" Rudskoy said.

New video published on social media by a Syrian rebel group allegedly shows Turkmen rebels shooting at the two ejected pilots landing on the border between Turkey and Syria.

CNN couldn't immediately confirm the video's claim.

Speaking in Turkish language, a man shouts off-camera, ""don't shoot at them"" and ""capture them alive,"" referring to the two Russian pilots.

Heavy gunfire can be heard on the video. The rebels also shout, ""God is great!""

Erdogan on Tuesday pointed how Turkey has been hosting 2 million Syrian refugees while European countries have panicked over smaller numbers seeking refuge there.

It's not possible to resolve terrorism or refugee problems without finding a sustainable solution to Syria, but the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad and countries that support it have started a new assault that does not fit with finding a resolution for the area, Erdogan said.

Turkey vehemently opposes the Assad regime. Russia is backing it.

NATO calls emergency meeting

After holding an emergency meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, NATO's governing body, the North Atlantic Council, said Turkey informed the body about the plane's downing.

Turkey is a member of NATO, which considers an attack on one of its members to be an attack on them all.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg urged ""calm and de-escalation"" to resolve the Turkey-Russia situation, but he noted how Russian forces approach allies' borders.

""I have previously expressed my concern about the implications of the military actions of the Russian Federation close to NATO's borders,"" the Stoltenberg said. ""This highlights the importance of having and respecting arrangements to avoid such incidents in the future.

""As we have repeatedly made clear, we stand in solidarity with Turkey and support the territorial integrity of our NATO ally, Turkey,"" he added.

NATO continues to follow the matter, Stoltenberg said.

A NATO official told CNN that ""when Russian jets violated Turkish airspace a few weeks ago, the Council did meet in an extraordinary session, which resulted in a condemnation of the incursion.""

Pilots ejected

Not long after the plane was shot down Tuesday morning, spitting fire and diving nose-first toward the ground, Turkey took responsibility. Turkey's semiofficial outlet, the Anadolu Agency, quoted Turkish presidential sources as saying the Russian Su-24 was ""hit within the framework of engagement rules"" in Syria's Bayirbucak area, near the border with Turkey.

Russian officials denied the plane had violated Turkish airspace.

While ISIS does not operate in the area where the plane went down, other rebel groups do, including al Nusra Front -- al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria -- along with more moderate U.S.-backed groups.

A Russian plane is seen crashing nose-first in northern Syria.

Abu Ibrahim al-Sheghri, the military leader in the 10th coastal brigade and part of the Turkmen Mountain Military Operation Room, told CNN that the body of one of the pilots had been found in the Nibh Almur area of Syria. The brigade is searching for the other pilot in the same area, he said.

Early this year, Moath al-Kasasbeh, a Jordanian pilot whose plane crashed in Syria the previous December, was burned alive by ISIS while he was trapped in a cage.

U.S. and French Presidents comment

U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday that ""Turkey has the right to defend its country and its airspace,"" but he acknowledged that U.S. officials ""don't have all the information yet.""

Obama said it was important that Russia and Turkey are in contact with one another to ""take measures to discourage any kind of escalation.""

He said the plane incident ""points to an ongoing problem with the Russian operations"" in Syria, which are taking place very close to the Turkish border. Russia has been going after ""moderate opposition"" that has the support of Turkey, Obama said.

If Russia instead focused on fighting only ISIS, ""some of those conflicts or potential for escalation are less likely to occur,"" Obama said.

He said the encounter also ""underscores the importance of our moving the political track along as quickly as possible"" when it comes to resolving the Syrian civil war.

Obama made his remarks at a news conference with French President Francois Hollande at the White House, held to discuss the recent terror attacks on Paris.

Hollande called the plane incident ""a serious one"" and said Turkey is providing information to NATO ""so that we can find what really happened.""

""We must prevent any escalation,"" Hollande said.

Hollande will be traveling to Russia this week to meet with Putin and discuss taking action against ISIS.

""We must find a solution to the Syrian crisis,"" Hollande said.

A brutal civil war

Turkey released a purported image of the flight path of the plane showing it had violated Turkish airspace. Two Turkish F-16s responded ""within engagement rules,"" the country's officials said.

#BREAKING Flight radar track on downed warplane issued by Turkish military pic.twitter.com/xREQbclVwK — CNN Türk ENG (@CNNTURK_ENG) November 24, 2015

But the Russian Defense Ministry said ""objective monitoring confirmed"" the plane was not in Turkish airspace.

""The Su-24 bomber jet was in Syrian airspace at the altitude 6,000 meters, the Russian Defense Ministry said,"" according to Sputnik. ""The pilots were reportedly able to parachute out of the jet before it crashed.""

Syria has been embroiled for more than four years in a civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people, sent millions of families fleeing and laid waste to cities.

Skirmishes between Turks and Syrians have taken place in the past, with Turkish officials accusing Syrian planes of violating Turkish air space.

'Unnecessary tensions'

Sajjan Gohel, international security director for the Asia-Pacific Foundation, a think tank, described the downing of the plane as ""a very significant escalation.""

""It's very much the last thing that's needed right now, especially in the aftermath of the Paris attacks, when there was hope that Russia could form an alliance with France and with the United States against ISIS,"" Gohel said. ""This is going to complicate things. This is going to add unnecessary tensions that really weren't required at this critical juncture.""

He said the downing of the Russian plane would hamper efforts to form a united front against ISIS.

""This is a situation that unfortunately was almost inevitable at some point, because Turkey has long been accusing Russia of interfering in their airspace,"" Gohel said. ""They've threatened them in the past. And even though economic relations between the two countries are strong -- politically, there have been tensions recently.""

Syria's internal conflict has become a massive proxy war for numerous international powers, both in the region and outside it -- a situation that has added to the perception that incidents such as Tuesday's plane downing were inevitable.

Currently, the United States, Russia, France, Australia, the Gulf states, Turkey, Israel, Iran, Jordan and Hezbollah are involved, one way or another, in military activity in Syria.

In March 2014, Turkey shot down a Syrian fighter jet after the warplane strayed into its airspace, according to Erdogan, the current president, who was prime minister at the time.

""Our F-16s went up in the air and shot that plane down. Why? Because if you violate my airspace, then from now on, our slap will be hard,"" Erdogan told supporters at a campaign rally in 2014.

But state-run media in Syria called it an act of ""blatant aggression"" and said the downed plane was over northern Syria at the time.",www.cnn.com,left,zc4wRHka0ze0E08W

One group of independent observers said Thursday that the damage to the component -- a right wing flaperon -- should give authorities a good indication that the piece came off while the plane was still in the air .
The group , led by American Mobile Satellite Corp. co-founder Mike Exner , points to the small amount of damage to the front of the flaperon and the ragged horizontal tear across the back .
The rear damage could have been caused if the airliner had its flaperon down as it went into the ocean , some members of Exner 's group wrote in a preliminary assessment after looking at photos and videos of the component .
But the lack of damage to the front makes it more likely the plane was in a high-speed , steep , spiral descent and the part fluttered until it broke off , the group said .
Boeing and Australian officials are confident the debris -- found Wednesday off the coast of a remote island in the west Indian Ocean -- came from a Boeing 777 -- and might be from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 , a 777 that disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board .
The plane debris will be transported to France on Friday evening , a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor 's office said . Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre said the piece will arrive in Paris on Saturday and will be sent to Toulouse , the site of the nearest office of the BEA , the French authority responsible for civil aviation accident investigations
Exner 's group -- an informal cadre of aviation experts -- said that if the flaperon were still on the wing when the plane hit water , the front would have been damaged by hitting the part of the wing to which it was attached . And the rear damage looks like it was caused by stress rather than being bent and broken off when the plane hit the water .
But an aircraft component specialist who spoke to CNN disagreed .
The lack of damage to the front section `` tells me that the component could still have likely been back in its original position inside the wing itself , '' said Michael Kenney , senior vice president of Universal Asset Management , which provides plane components to airlines .
Boeing investigators are confident that debris found on a remote island in the Indian Ocean comes from a 777 aircraft , according to a source close to the investigation .
Martin Dolan , chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau , agreed .
`` We are highly confident but it still needs confirmation that it is a part from a 777 aircraft , '' he told CNN 's `` Erin Burnett OutFront . '' `` The only 777 aircraft that we 're aware of in the Indian Ocean that could have led to this part floating is MH370 . But as I said , we still need to confirm that through closer study . ''
People cleaning a beach found the debris Wednesday on Reunion , a French overseas territory in the western Indian Ocean .
The source said Boeing investigators feel confident the piece comes from a 777 because of photos that have been analyzed and a stenciled number that corresponds to a 777 component . A component number is not the same as a part number , which is generally much longer .
Images of the debris also appear to match schematic drawings for the right wing flaperon from a Boeing 777 . A flaperon helps the pilot control the aircraft . It is lightweight and has sealed chambers , making it buoyant .
Despite this confidence , no one is saying the part definitely comes from a 777 , much less MH370 .
Finding the debris is a `` significant development '' in the search for MH370 , Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said .
New debris , which washed ashore Thursday and appears to resemble remnants of a suitcase , is also part of the investigation , Reunion Island police officials confirmed to CNN .
The flight vanished March 8 , 2014 , en route to Beijing . So far , no confirmed trace of it has been found , making it one of history 's biggest aviation mysteries and leaving relatives of passengers and crew members uncertain about the fate of their loved ones
A preliminary assessment by U.S. intelligence agencies , produced in the wake of the MH370 disaster , suggested it was likely someone in the cockpit deliberately caused the aircraft 's movements before the Malaysian airliner disappeared .
Two U.S. officials briefed on the matter told CNN that the assessment , which was not intended for public release , was prepared months ago and was solely based on available satellite and other evidence .
The U.S. intelligence assessment was largely focused on the multiple course changes the aircraft made after it deviated from its scheduled Kuala Lumpur to Beijing route . Analysts determined that , absent any other evidence , it 's most likely someone in the cockpit deliberately moved the aircraft to specific waypoints , crossing Indonesian territory and eventually toward the south Indian Ocean .
Malaysian investigators have n't reported finding any evidence that casts suspicion on the pilots .
The airliner 's crew has been the focus of attention since the mysterious disappearance , but no proof has emerged indicating they intended to destroy the plane . Law enforcement and intelligence agencies from numerous countries examined the plane 's manifest of crew and passengers and found no significant information to suggest anyone on board posed an obvious threat .
If it does turn out to be from Flight 370 , the development would reassure Australian officials that they are looking for the rest of the plane in the right area , Truss and Dolan said .

`` It 's credible that debris from MH370 could have reached the Reunion Islands by now , '' Truss said .
Malaysia Airlines is sending a team of investigators to Paris and a second team to Saint-Denis , Reunion , on Friday , an airline official in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , told CNN .
Normally identification would be aided by a small serial number plate attached to a flaperon , but the part found on the beach appears to be missing the serial number plate , according to photographs .
Other markings may be found on the part , said Kenney , the executive from Universal Asset Management .
Australia is leading the underwater search for the remains of Flight 370 in the southern Indian Ocean , some 2,300 nautical miles ( 3,700 kilometers ) east of Reunion . But Truss said that French and Malaysian authorities will be responsible for establishing whether the debris found off the island came from the missing jetliner .
Australia has offered its help , he said , including asking marine experts to look at photos of the debris to determine whether barnacles on it are `` consistent with something that was floating in the oceans for 16 months or more .

Images of the debris also appear to match schematic drawings for the right wing flaperon from a Boeing 777. A flaperon helps the pilot control the aircraft. It is lightweight and has sealed chambers, making it buoyant.

Despite this confidence, no one is saying the part definitely comes from a 777, much less MH370.

Finding the debris is a ""significant development"" in the search for MH370, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said.

More debris

New debris, which washed ashore Thursday and appears to resemble remnants of a suitcase, is also part of the investigation, Reunion Island police officials confirmed to CNN.

The flight vanished March 8, 2014, en route to Beijing. So far, no confirmed trace of it has been found, making it one of history's biggest aviation mysteries and leaving relatives of passengers and crew members uncertain about the fate of their loved ones

A preliminary assessment by U.S. intelligence agencies, produced in the wake of the MH370 disaster, suggested it was likely someone in the cockpit deliberately caused the aircraft's movements before the Malaysian airliner disappeared.

Two U.S. officials briefed on the matter told CNN that the assessment, which was not intended for public release, was prepared months ago and was solely based on available satellite and other evidence.

The U.S. intelligence assessment was largely focused on the multiple course changes the aircraft made after it deviated from its scheduled Kuala Lumpur to Beijing route. Analysts determined that, absent any other evidence, it's most likely someone in the cockpit deliberately moved the aircraft to specific waypoints, crossing Indonesian territory and eventually toward the south Indian Ocean.

Malaysian investigators haven't reported finding any evidence that casts suspicion on the pilots.

The airliner's crew has been the focus of attention since the mysterious disappearance, but no proof has emerged indicating they intended to destroy the plane . Law enforcement and intelligence agencies from numerous countries examined the plane's manifest of crew and passengers and found no significant information to suggest anyone on board posed an obvious threat.

Missing plate

If it does turn out to be from Flight 370, the development would reassure Australian officials that they are looking for the rest of the plane in the right area, Truss and Dolan said.

""It's credible that debris from MH370 could have reached the Reunion Islands by now,"" Truss said.

Malaysia Airlines is sending a team of investigators to Paris and a second team to Saint-Denis, Reunion, on Friday, an airline official in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, told CNN.

It's unclear how identification will be made.

Normally identification would be aided by a small serial number plate attached to a flaperon, but the part found on the beach appears to be missing the serial number plate, according to photographs.

Other markings may be found on the part, said Kenney, the executive from Universal Asset Management.

Australia is leading the underwater search for the remains of Flight 370 in the southern Indian Ocean, some 2,300 nautical miles (3,700 kilometers) east of Reunion. But Truss said that French and Malaysian authorities will be responsible for establishing whether the debris found off the island came from the missing jetliner.

Australia has offered its help, he said, including asking marine experts to look at photos of the debris to determine whether barnacles on it are ""consistent with something that was floating in the oceans for 16 months or more.""",www.cnn.com,left,jG8XDMl3x21McNWZ
