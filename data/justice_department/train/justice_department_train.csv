Given the anger over events in Ferguson and New York City , the very question seems absurd . But it is not . Behind the polls and demonstrations , there is evidence that blacks trust police at least as much as whites do .
The poll results are hardly surprising . A new Gallup poll confirms blacks place less confidence in police and the criminal justice system . Using survey data from 2006 through 2014 , Gallup found :
* 31 percentage points more blacks than whites believe black males are more likely to go to prison than white males primarily because of discrimination ( 50 percent versus 19 percent ) .
* 7 percentage points more blacks believe the honesty and ethics of police are low/very low ( 17 percent versus 10 percent ) .

If black victims really believe police are racist , why would they report the crime to the police ? Blacks victims don ’ t want other blacks locked up simply due to their race ; they want the criminals who actually committed the crime punished .
Of course people are more likely to report crimes to police if they believe the police will solve them .

At Tuesday 's hearing , Gillibrand noted the importance of commanders ' setting the tone for a unit , but argued that not all commanders are qualified to deal with serious sexual assault cases . `` Not every single commander necessarily wants women in the force , not every single commander believes what a sexual assault is , not every single commander can distinguish between a slap on the ass and a rape , '' said Gillibrand .
Appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee , the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff acknowledged that efforts to curb sexual assault in the military have not been successful . They welcomed discussion of legislative efforts but , said chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen.

Gen. Raymond Odierno , the Army chief of staff , said , `` Legal reform can and should continue to be part of our campaign to end sexual assault '' and called some of the current legislation `` reasonable . ''
But Odierno said removing the authority of commanders to handle assault cases could affect unit discipline and lead to other effects . `` We can not legislate our way out of this problem , '' said Odierno .
Adm. Jonathan Greenert , chief of Naval operations , explained that Naval commanders often have to make difficult decision when they are at sea , adding , `` I believe it is essential that our commanders be involved in each phase of the military justice process . ''
Marine Commandant Gen. James Amos laid out his concerns saying , `` Commanding officers never delegate responsibility . They should never be forced to delegate their authority . ''
Gen. Mark A. Welsh III , from the Air Force , labeled sexual assault in the military a `` cancer `` and said that `` none of us will be standing still '' in trying to end it . However , Welsh added , `` Commanders should n't just be part of the solution . They must be part of the solution or there will be no solution . ''
In his opening statement committee chairman Sen. Carl Levin , D-Mich. , and the committee chairman , said , `` The problem of sexual assault is of such scope and magnitude that it has become a stain on our military .

Sen. James Inhofe ( R-Okla. ) , the ranking Republican on the committee , opposes Gillibrand 's bill , saying , `` No change is possible without commanders as agents of that change . ''
On Tuesday , Gillibrand told the panel of military officers , `` You have lost the trust of the men and women who rely on you .

Last month the Pentagon 's most recent report on sexual assault in the military estimated that as many as 26,000 military members may have been sexually assaulted last year , up from an estimated 19,000 assaults in 2010 .
Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D-Mo . ) said that number was confusing because it describes incidents of `` unwanted sexual contact '' which includes sexual harassment , an unwelcome work environment , touching and rape .
Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) a strong military supporter and former Naval officer who was held as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War , said he is concerned how sexual assault could affect recruitment and retention in the military .

We have extreme left groups masquerading as extreme right groups . We have players on both sides trying to spin up violence . So it 's a complicated situation .
BRET BAIER : But you expect that there 'll be more arrests at the organizing part of it ?
BARR : Yes , sir . You know , I ca n't put a time limit on these investigations , but I think , you know , we are very much focused on getting on top of these groups .
BAIER : Turning the page here to the Durham report and wondering when that is going to come out . You 're now a few months away from an election and there 's some expectation that there 's going to be at least some bombshells in there about the investigation of the investigation into Trump collusion .
BARR : I ca n't address expectations . I can say that even with the disruption of Covid and the fact that our court system is essentially been shut down for a few months , the Durham team has been working very aggressively to move forward . And as I 've also said , this is n't being driven by producing a report . We are trying to get to a point where we can hold accountable anyone who crossed the line and committed a criminal violation . So that 's , I think , what would be the initial stage of a resolution of Durham 's investigation . But I also think that there will be public disclosure and some form of reporters at by appropriate .
BAIER : Well , can you paint a picture of what it looks like as far as the broad nature of it ?
BARR : Well , I think , you know , I think before the election , I think we 're concerned about the motive force behind the very aggressive investigation that was launched into the Trump campaign without , you know , with a very thin , slender reed as a basis for it . It seemed that the bureau was sort of spring loaded at the end of July to drive in there and investigate a campaign .
BARR : And there really was n't much there to do that on . And that became more and more evident as they went by . But they seem to have ignored all the exculpatory evidence that was building up and continued Pell-mell to push it forward . So that 's one area of concern . The other area of concern is that after the election , even though they were closing down some of that , as we 've seen in the Flynn case , and say there 's nothing here , for some reason , they went right back at it , even at a time where the evidentiary support or claim support like the dossier was falling apart . And it 's very hard to understand why they continued to push and even make public testimony that they had an investigation going when it was becoming painfully obvious or should have been obvious to anyone that there was nothing there .
BAIER : You always get lumped in with being political and you 've pushed back against that , the characterization that you 're the president 's attorney . But as you get closer to an election , does n't releasing this report , make it more at risk for falling into that political bucket ?
BARR : I 'm sure there are people who might say that I 've publicly made clear that this has not involved looking at President Obama or Vice President Biden . I think the people that we 're looking at are not at that level . And I think what --
BARR : But , you know , here 's the thing . For the first time in American history , the police organizations and the national security organizations were used to spy on a campaign and there was no basis for it . The media largely drove all kinds of sensational claims were being made about the president . That could have affected the election . And then and then later on in his administration , there were actions taken that really appear to be efforts to sabotage his campaign . And that has to be looked at . And if people want to say that I 'm political because I am looking at those potential abuses of power , so be it . But that 's the job of the attorney general .
BAIER : If you had to characterize the Durham report as , you know , what now ? Is it going to be eye opening for Americans or is this can be kind of a blip ?
BARR : I you know , I 'm very troubled by it . What has been called to my attention so far , but I 'm not going to characterize it beyond that .
BAIER : Can you tell us anything about the investigation to unmasking ?
BARR : You know , unmasking is not by itself illegal , but the patterns of unmasking can tell us something about people 's motivations at any given point of time . So we 're trying to take a look at the whole waterfront on unmasking what was done , especially in 2016 .
BARR : No . As I say , it 's not it 's not against the law to unmask anyone . But I mean , for example , let 's say suppose for a period in the spring , there was a lot of heavy unmasking done on people involved with the Trump campaign . That would be very relevant as to what people were thinking at that time and what their motivations were .
BAIER : You mentioned the Flynn case . You 're in the process of trying to dismiss that charge . The charges yet that Judge Sullivan continues on and has now a shadow prosecutor making a case that it should continue .

But that 's the job of the attorney general , '' Barr declared .","WILLIAM BARR: We have extreme right groups trying to look like extreme left groups. We have extreme left groups masquerading as extreme right groups. We have players on both sides trying to spin up violence. So it's a complicated situation.



BRET BAIER: But you expect that there'll be more arrests at the organizing part of it?



BARR: Yes, sir. You know, I can't put a time limit on these investigations, but I think, you know, we are very much focused on getting on top of these groups.



BAIER: Turning the page here to the Durham report and wondering when that is going to come out. You're now a few months away from an election and there's some expectation that there's going to be at least some bombshells in there about the investigation of the investigation into Trump collusion.



BARR: I can't address expectations. I can say that even with the disruption of Covid and the fact that our court system is essentially been shut down for a few months, the Durham team has been working very aggressively to move forward. And as I've also said, this isn't being driven by producing a report. We are trying to get to a point where we can hold accountable anyone who crossed the line and committed a criminal violation. So that's, I think, what would be the initial stage of a resolution of Durham's investigation. But I also think that there will be public disclosure and some form of reporters at by appropriate.



BAIER: From what you've seen, have crimes been committed?



BARR: Well, I can't say.



BAIER: Well, can you paint a picture of what it looks like as far as the broad nature of it?



BARR: Well, I think, you know, I think before the election, I think we're concerned about the motive force behind the very aggressive investigation that was launched into the Trump campaign without, you know, with a very thin, slender reed as a basis for it. It seemed that the bureau was sort of spring loaded at the end of July to drive in there and investigate a campaign.



BARR: And there really wasn't much there to do that on. And that became more and more evident as they went by. But they seem to have ignored all the exculpatory evidence that was building up and continued Pell-mell to push it forward. So that's one area of concern. The other area of concern is that after the election, even though they were closing down some of that, as we've seen in the Flynn case, and say there's nothing here, for some reason, they went right back at it, even at a time where the evidentiary support or claim support like the dossier was falling apart. And it's very hard to understand why they continued to push and even make public testimony that they had an investigation going when it was becoming painfully obvious or should have been obvious to anyone that there was nothing there.



BAIER: You always get lumped in with being political and you've pushed back against that, the characterization that you're the president's attorney. But as you get closer to an election, doesn't releasing this report, make it more at risk for falling into that political bucket?



BARR: I'm sure there are people who might say that I've publicly made clear that this has not involved looking at President Obama or Vice President Biden. I think the people that we're looking at are not at that level. And I think what--



BAIER: Names we would be familiar with?



BARR: Some of them.



BARR: But, you know, here's the thing. For the first time in American history, the police organizations and the national security organizations were used to spy on a campaign and there was no basis for it. The media largely drove all kinds of sensational claims were being made about the president. That could have affected the election. And then and then later on in his administration, there were actions taken that really appear to be efforts to sabotage his campaign. And that has to be looked at. And if people want to say that I'm political because I am looking at those potential abuses of power, so be it. But that's the job of the attorney general.



BAIER: If you had to characterize the Durham report as, you know, what now? Is it going to be eye opening for Americans or is this can be kind of a blip?



BARR: I you know, I'm very troubled by it. What has been called to my attention so far, but I'm not going to characterize it beyond that.



BAIER: Can you tell us anything about the investigation to unmasking?



BARR: You know, unmasking is not by itself illegal, but the patterns of unmasking can tell us something about people's motivations at any given point of time. So we're trying to take a look at the whole waterfront on unmasking what was done, especially in 2016.



BAIER: And are there criminal implications?



BARR: No. As I say, it's not it's not against the law to unmask anyone. But I mean, for example, let's say suppose for a period in the spring, there was a lot of heavy unmasking done on people involved with the Trump campaign. That would be very relevant as to what people were thinking at that time and what their motivations were.



BAIER: You mentioned the Flynn case. You're in the process of trying to dismiss that charge. The charges yet that Judge Sullivan continues on and has now a shadow prosecutor making a case that it should continue.



BARR: Well, the argument is that it's always been understood that decisions, whether pursue an individual through the prosecution process or holding them criminally accountable is fit. It's vested in the executive branch and not the courts. And he is essentially, in our view, trying to set himself up as an alternative prosecutor. And so have you seen anything like this before? I'm not aware of anything like this before, and I think that's why this is not being argued at the appellate stage in the District of Columbia.



BAIER: I know you can't get in specifics, but the DOJ inspector general identified this top FBI lawyer who fabricated evidence in order to justify this, warned against Carter Page to spy on him. We know that's a crime. Yet there haven't been any charges yet. Is that person still working at the FBI?



BARR: No.



BAIER: And are there charges pending?



BARR: We can't discuss future charges. But I have to say that I do find a little irritating. You know, the propensity in the American public on all sides of the political spectrum when they see something they think could be a criminal violation, I say, why hasn't this person been indicted again? And, you know, there's the old saying that that the wheels of justice grind slow and they do run slow because we have due process and we follow the process.

For years judges have accepted the idea that accounts of detainees at the US prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, should be kept secret. This week, one judge pushed back.

With oversized glasses and short, curly hair, US District Judge Gladys Kessler looks more like a school principal than a person who makes radical judgements about the government.

Sitting in a room decorated with thick, blue carpeting in a courthouse in Washington, she smiled. ""It's always nice to see a full courtroom,"" she said.

A government lawyer began talking, the start of a hearing on the treatment of a Syrian, Abu Wa'el Dhiab, who is waging a hunger strike at Guantanamo.

Dhiab's request from the court is modest - not freedom, even from forced feedings, but a judicial order that changes how he's treated.

He wants, for example, to be force-fed only when he's on the verge of death. He also wants the guards to stop pulling him from his cell when he's taken to a place for the feedings.

His lawyers said he is ""trussed up like an animal"", with guards ""straddling his back"", and is placed in a ""torture chair"".

Then he's fed. He describes the way a ""nurse just jammed a tube in my nose"", causing ""fire-like pain"", according to his lawyers. Another time his nose bled.

Though the department announced after Zimmerman 's acquittal that it would consider a possible federal case , previously filed FBI documents show agents have not turned up any accounts that Zimmerman , before the February 2012 shooting , exhibited racial bias . Sanford police detective Chris Serino also told FBI agents last year that he considered Zimmerman as having `` a little hero complex , but not as a racist . ''
Attorney General Eric Holder , in his first post-verdict comments , confirmed Monday during a speech in Washington , D.C. , that his department continues to investigate while signaling concern for the position of the Martin family and those -- such as the NAACP -- pressuring the DOJ . He said the department is `` mindful of the pain felt by our nation '' over the `` tragic , unnecessary shooting death '' of Martin .
`` The Justice Department shares your concern -- I share your concern , '' Holder said .
He added that the shooting provides an opportunity to speak `` honestly '' about the charged issues involved in the case , and that `` we must not ... let this opportunity pass . '' Holder even appeared to suggest the possibility of bias in this case , saying it 's important to address `` underlying attitudes , mistaken beliefs and stereotypes that serve as the basis for these too common incidents . ''
Still , the attorney general said his department would act in a `` manner that is consistent with the facts and the law . ''
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney indicated that President Obama would keep his distance from the consideration , adding that the merits of the case will be `` evaluated by the professionals at the Department of Justice . ''
But Florida defense attorney Brian Tannebaum told FoxNews.com that the `` number one challenge '' for DOJ is the evidence , or lack thereof .
`` There 's been an acquittal . The evidence has not changed . It 's not like the feds are going to go in and find more evidence , '' he said .
Tannebaum said he understands the Justice Department was responding to intense public sentiment , but `` I do n't foresee it becoming a federal case . ''
The question of racial bias is key because if the Justice Department were to pursue a federal case against Zimmerman , federal hate-crimes law is one of the few tools the department would have .
The statute itself bars `` willfully '' causing injury to someone else `` because of the actual or perceived race , color , religion , or national origin of any person . ''
The department has used federal civil rights law before to pursue defendants who had been acquitted at the state level . But in what is perhaps the most famous such case -- the Rodney King beating -- the circumstances were different .
First , there was a highly publicized video of the King beating . No such video of the Martin shooting is known to exist .
Second , the two officers ultimately convicted on federal charges in that case were charged with using or permitting unreasonable force under `` color of law '' -- this applies only to law enforcement .
The separate federal hate-crimes law applies to both law enforcement and civilians . But it 's not clear how the Justice Department could prove racial bias .
Serino , the Sanford detective , told FBI agents last year that after examining the case , it appeared Zimmerman was suspicious of Martin because of his `` attire , the total circumstances of the encounter and the previous burglary suspects in the community . ''
Serino told the FBI that there had been several burglaries in the area , and that gang members in the community `` typically dressed in black and wore hoodies . ''
`` When Zimmerman saw Martin in a hoody , Zimmerman took it upon himself to view Martin as acting suspicious , '' Serino said , while describing Zimmerman as `` overzealous . '' The FBI document was posted on the Smoking Gun website .
McClatchy also has reported on another set of documents that show FBI agents interviewed a dozens of people in the course of probing possible racial bias but nobody would say Zimmerman showed such bias before the shooting .
Still , the Justice Department agreed to requests from NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous and several lawmakers to keep investigating the defendant .
`` The Department of Justice 's Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division , the United States Attorney 's Office for the Middle District of Florida , and the Federal Bureau of Investigation continue to evaluate the evidence generated during the federal investigation , as well as the evidence and testimony from the state trial , '' the Justice Department said in a statement Sunday . `` Experienced federal prosecutors will [ now ] determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction , and whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the Department 's policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial . ''
The department may find itself in a vulnerable spot , not only because of prior interviews which found no evidence of bias .
Last week , a conservative watchdog accused an obscure agency within the DOJ of helping support the `` pressure campaign '' against Zimmerman in the wake of the shooting last year . Judicial Watch claimed documents and public accounts showed `` extraordinary intervention '' by the department in the campaign that eventually led to Zimmerman 's prosecution .
The department , however , claims that it dispatched agency representatives to reduce tensions in the community - not to take sides .
The department is under heavy pressure from some groups to pursue the case further .
Rep. Charles Rangel , D-N.Y. , and other House Democrats called a press conference on Monday to urge the Justice Department to `` conduct an immediate and thorough investigation . ''
The NAACP started the drive to pressure the DOJ to continue its probe by posting a petition Sunday morning on the website MoveOn.org .
`` The most fundamental of civil rights -- the right to life -- was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin , '' the group wrote .
Attorney General Eric Holder plans to speak at the NAACP convention on Tuesday .","The Justice Department was running into immediate hurdles Monday in its investigation of possible civil rights violations by George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin -- namely, that after examining the case for more than a year, the evidence has not changed.

Serino, the Sanford detective, told FBI agents last year that after examining the case, it appeared Zimmerman was suspicious of Martin because of his ""attire, the total circumstances of the encounter and the previous burglary suspects in the community.""

Serino told the FBI that there had been several burglaries in the area, and that gang members in the community ""typically dressed in black and wore hoodies.""

""When Zimmerman saw Martin in a hoody, Zimmerman took it upon himself to view Martin as acting suspicious,"" Serino said, while describing Zimmerman as ""overzealous."" The FBI document was posted on the Smoking Gun website.

McClatchy also has reported on another set of documents that show FBI agents interviewed a dozens of people in the course of probing possible racial bias but nobody would say Zimmerman showed such bias before the shooting.

Still, the Justice Department agreed to requests from NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous and several lawmakers to keep investigating the defendant.

""The Department of Justice's Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation continue to evaluate the evidence generated during the federal investigation, as well as the evidence and testimony from the state trial,"" the Justice Department said in a statement Sunday. ""Experienced federal prosecutors will [now] determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the Department's policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial.""

The department may find itself in a vulnerable spot, not only because of prior interviews which found no evidence of bias.

Last week, a conservative watchdog accused an obscure agency within the DOJ of helping support the ""pressure campaign"" against Zimmerman in the wake of the shooting last year. Judicial Watch claimed documents and public accounts showed ""extraordinary intervention"" by the department in the campaign that eventually led to Zimmerman's prosecution.

The department, however, claims that it dispatched agency representatives to reduce tensions in the community - not to take sides.

The department is under heavy pressure from some groups to pursue the case further.

Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and other House Democrats called a press conference on Monday to urge the Justice Department to ""conduct an immediate and thorough investigation.""

The NAACP started the drive to pressure the DOJ to continue its probe by posting a petition Sunday morning on the website MoveOn.org.

""The most fundamental of civil rights -- the right to life -- was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin,"" the group wrote.

Attorney General Eric Holder plans to speak at the NAACP convention on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON–Federal prosecutors recommended Tuesday that former national security adviser Michael Flynn serve up to six months in prison for lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian ambassador.

The government's position is a reversal from more than a year ago, when prosecutors urged no prison time for the retired Army lieutenant general. Flynn is one of a half-dozen former aides to President Donald Trump who were convicted or pleaded guilty due to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.

Citing Flynn's attempts to ""thwart"" prosecutors and his ""apparent failure to accept responsibility,"" the government recommended a sentence of up to six months ""to promote respect for the law and adequately deter such criminal conduct.""

He is scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 28.

Last month, a federal judge rejected Flynn's claims that prosecutors forced him to plead guilty and hid evidence that would've exonerated him.

The Obama administration moved on Tuesday to rein in the use of tax-exempt groups for political campaigning.The effort is an attempt to reduce the role of such loosely regulated yet influential super PACS as Crossroads GPS, which was co-founded by GOP political strategist Karl Rove, and Priorities USA, which ran searing ads against rivals of President Barack Obama to support his re-election last year.The Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department proposed new rules that they said would prohibit such groups from using ""candidate-related political activity"" like running advertisements, registering voters or distributing campaign literature as activities that qualify them to be tax-exempt ""social welfare"" organizations.""This proposed guidance is a first critical step toward creating clear-cut definitions of political activity by tax-exempt social welfare organizations,"" said Mark Mazur, the Treasury's assistant secretary for tax policy. ""We are committed to getting this right before issuing final guidance that may affect a broad group of organizations.""It will take time to work through the regulatory process and carefully consider all public feedback as we strive to ensure that the standards for tax-exemption are clear and can be applied consistently,"" Mazur said.The rules would become final after a lengthy comment period, the federal agencies said, giving the super PACS ample time to raise millions of dollars from anonymous donors before next year's congressional elections.Conservative groups bitterly attacked the proposed rules, charging that they represented yet another attack on free speech by the Obama White House.""This is a feeble attempt by the Obama administration to justify its own wrongdoing with the IRS targeting of conservative and tea party groups,” Jay Sekulow, a lawyer representing more than three dozen of the groups in a federal lawsuit against the tax agency, told The New York Times.The lawsuit stemmed from the IRS' monitoring of tea party, conservative, and religious groups for extra scrutiny in their applications for tax-exempt status. A Treasury Department inspector general disclosed in May that the agency was doing the special screenings for those groups seeking 501(c)(4) status.The status allows such organizations to keep their donors private.The IRS screening had occurred between 2010 and through the 2012 presidential election. During the period, IRS agents had placed groups with words like ""tea party and ""patriot"" in their names on a ""be on the lookout"" — or BOLO — list for additional screening of its applications for the tax-exempt status.“Unfortunately, it appears that the same bureaucrats that attempted to suppress the speech of conservative groups in recent years has now put together new rules that apply to (c)4 groups but do not apply to liberal groups like labor unions,” Nick Ryan, founder of the American Future Fund, told the Times.The organization spent at least $25 million on political advertising last year, according to the Times.“I wish I could say I am surprised,” Ryan added, “but I am not.""As 501(c)(4) organizations, the groups can raise millions of dollars to influence elections.They can, however, also be small-scale tea party groups — many had contended that the were singled out by the IRS.House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp questioned the White House's decision.""There continues to be an ongoing investigation, with many documents yet to be uncovered, into how the IRS systematically targeted and abused conservative-leaning groups,"" the Michigan Republican said. ""This smacks of the administration trying to shut down potential critics.""In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court in its Citizens United decision lifted the limits on donations by labor unions and companies to 501(c)(4) groups. This allowed Crossroads, the largest of them, to raise large sums outside the limits that apply to candidates' campaigns and traditional party committees.""Enormous abuses have taken place under the current rules, which have allowed groups largely devoted to campaign activities to operate as nonprofit groups in order to keep secret the donors funding their campaign activities,"" said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, which advocates limits on money in politics.Under current rules, ""social welfare"" groups may conduct some political work as long as it does not remain their primary activity. The proposed rules would block such activities as running ads that ""expressly advocate for a clearly identified political candidate or candidates of a political party"" as fulfilling their tax-exempt mission.In addition, spots that simply mention a politician in urging a certain way to vote — for instance — could not be run 60 days before a general election or 30 days before a primary.The rules also would limit voter drives and voter registration efforts and the distribution of literature.According to the federal agencies, the new rules seek to solidify the current regulations, which are confusing and prone to abuse.""Depending on the details, this could be dramatic,"" Marcus Owens, a former chief of the IRS’ exempt organizations division, told the Times.Treasury and the IRS do not yet have a proposal about what specific proportion of a 501(c)(4) group's activities must promote social welfare and are soliciting input. Essentially, they do not have a recommendation as to what percentage of a group's time and money can be spent on politics.Representatives of both Crossroads and Priorities USA declined to comment to the Times on the proposed rules. The groups, however, are expected to weigh as the process moves forward.Any changes to the regulations likely would not affect the 2014 elections because of legal challenges, but the rule changes could shape the next presidential election, said Kenneth Gross, a campaign finance attorney and former head of enforcement for the Federal Election Commission.""Brightening what are now blurred lines — what is political activity — is not only useful but necessary to have some kind of clarity to a vehicle that has been used to the tune of millions and millions of dollars,"" he said.But Gross cautioned that ""this is a long and winding road before anything is in ink.""The Associated Press contributed to this report.",www.newsmax.com,right,Vt5dCZsAjsn1Y43x

Want to be home more with your wife and kids ? Let ’ s work out your schedule to make that happen . Tell us what we can do to make the job work better for you . Just don ’ t leave .
The Holder stay-or-go conversation had become an annual late summer West Wing ritual . They ’ d ended in 2013 with Holder saying he ’ d stay one more year , and this time the attorney general was sticking to it .
Nothing Obama and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said could change his mind ; none of the appeals to stay to the end of the term were overriding Holder ’ s job exhaustion or health concerns .
“ They really did never give up on trying to keep him , ” said a person close to Holder .
But when Obama finally relented , Holder had some suggestions for who might replace him .
And that ’ s how Loretta Lynch ’ s name got on the White House ’ s list .
How Lynch , a U.S. attorney from New York , got to the top of the list came down to the process of elimination and a really good interview with Obama .
The attorney general is one of the most prominent positions in the administration , and , for a president who ’ s a former constitutional law professor intent on continuing to build a legal legacy , one of the most central . Holder , meanwhile , has been clearly headed toward the door for months , if not years . And still , his resignation sparked a process that many people in and around it felt was epitomized by the hastily assembled Saturday morning announcement of Lynch ’ s nomination in the Roosevelt Room , just a few hours before Obama took off for Asia for a week .
Lynch ’ s nomination , despite a résumé that ’ s as accomplished and uncontroversial as they come for a presidential nominee , still took people by surprise .
“ She would have been eliminated , too , if she wasn ’ t impressive , ” the person close to Holder said . “ It ’ s process of elimination combined with the process of finding someone really good . ”
“ She ’ s in the second round [ of ] serving in one of the most sophisticated jurisdictions in the country , ” said Robert Raben , a former Justice official who remains in touch with the Department and with Holder , explaining the rationale for the nomination .
Raben also pointed to Lynch ’ s work as chairwoman of the Attorney General ’ s Advisory Committee , “ the entity which is a center of power , a crucial decision-making and advisory platform within the Department of Justice . ”
Still , Lynch ’ s name ended up on a list from Holder of suggested replacements for both himself or for outgoing deputy attorney general Jim Cole .
“ Loretta was always the leading candidate for at least the DAG position , ” said a source familiar with the process . “ I don ’ t think she went from zero-to-60 . I think she went from definitely in the mix for one of the two top positions to being the pick for the top position . ”
Even at the White House , there were senior aides who didn ’ t meet her until she arrived for the official nomination announcement .
Lynch wasn ’ t Obama ’ s first choice . He wanted Kathy Ruemmler , his former White House counsel , to replace Holder . Ruemmler , Obama felt , could help him tackle the sentencing reform and perhaps the closing of the Guantánamo Bay detention center that he wants to accomplish before he leaves office .
Privately , Obama would tell people that he wasn ’ t concerned about the inevitable confirmation fight over someone who , as White House counsel , advised Obama on some of the administration ’ s most controversial decisions . She could survive it , he ’ d say .
But his aides had visions of Ruemmler ducking questions from Republican senators by claiming presidential privilege , followed by Republicans ’ unspooling of all the quotes from Democrats like Sens . Chuck Schumer of New York and Dick Durbin of Illinois using identical reasoning to explain why they ’ d voted against the nomination of another former White House counsel , Alberto Gonzales , for attorney general in 2005 .

The Holder stay-or-go conversation had become an annual late summer West Wing ritual. They’d ended in 2013 with Holder saying he’d stay one more year, and this time the attorney general was sticking to it.

Story Continued Below

Nothing Obama and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said could change his mind; none of the appeals to stay to the end of the term were overriding Holder’s job exhaustion or health concerns.

“They really did never give up on trying to keep him,” said a person close to Holder.

But when Obama finally relented, Holder had some suggestions for who might replace him.

And that’s how Loretta Lynch’s name got on the White House’s list.

How Lynch, a U.S. attorney from New York, got to the top of the list came down to the process of elimination and a really good interview with Obama.

The attorney general is one of the most prominent positions in the administration, and, for a president who’s a former constitutional law professor intent on continuing to build a legal legacy, one of the most central. Holder, meanwhile, has been clearly headed toward the door for months, if not years. And still, his resignation sparked a process that many people in and around it felt was epitomized by the hastily assembled Saturday morning announcement of Lynch’s nomination in the Roosevelt Room, just a few hours before Obama took off for Asia for a week.

Lynch’s nomination, despite a résumé that’s as accomplished and uncontroversial as they come for a presidential nominee, still took people by surprise.

“She would have been eliminated, too, if she wasn’t impressive,” the person close to Holder said. “It’s process of elimination combined with the process of finding someone really good.”

“She’s in the second round [of] serving in one of the most sophisticated jurisdictions in the country,” said Robert Raben, a former Justice official who remains in touch with the Department and with Holder, explaining the rationale for the nomination.

Raben also pointed to Lynch’s work as chairwoman of the Attorney General’s Advisory Committee, “the entity which is a center of power, a crucial decision-making and advisory platform within the Department of Justice.”

Still, Lynch’s name ended up on a list from Holder of suggested replacements for both himself or for outgoing deputy attorney general Jim Cole.

“Loretta was always the leading candidate for at least the DAG position,” said a source familiar with the process. “I don’t think she went from zero-to-60. I think she went from definitely in the mix for one of the two top positions to being the pick for the top position.”

Even at the White House, there were senior aides who didn’t meet her until she arrived for the official nomination announcement.

Lynch wasn’t Obama’s first choice. He wanted Kathy Ruemmler, his former White House counsel, to replace Holder. Ruemmler, Obama felt, could help him tackle the sentencing reform and perhaps the closing of the Guantánamo Bay detention center that he wants to accomplish before he leaves office.

Privately, Obama would tell people that he wasn’t concerned about the inevitable confirmation fight over someone who, as White House counsel, advised Obama on some of the administration’s most controversial decisions. She could survive it, he’d say.

But his aides had visions of Ruemmler ducking questions from Republican senators by claiming presidential privilege, followed by Republicans’ unspooling of all the quotes from Democrats like Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York and Dick Durbin of Illinois using identical reasoning to explain why they’d voted against the nomination of another former White House counsel, Alberto Gonzales, for attorney general in 2005.

The sense among many was that aides were eager for Ruemmler to pull out so they wouldn’t have to make the decision for her.",www.politico.com,left,Off5mobSeEljPl5b

Washington (CNN) – Embattled Attorney General Eric Holder's long-time friend Reid Weingarten, the high-powered Washington attorney, came to his defense Thursday telling CNN that off-the-record sessions with media executives were not meant as a mea culpa.

The Justice Department ( DOJ ) announced on Friday that it is finalizing a rule to collect DNA samples from illegal immigrants who are in federal custody .
The DOJ issued a final rule that would authorize the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) to collect DNA samples from immigrants who enter the country illegally and are being detained in federal custody . The rule will allow the department to comply fully with a 2005 law , the DNA Fingerprint Act . The Act requires a federal agency to “ collect DNA samples from individuals who are arrested , facing charges , or convicted or from non-United States persons who are detained under the authority of the United States . ”
Until now , non-U.S. persons have been exempt from the sample collection following an agreement in 2010 between two Obama administration officials , then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and then-DHS Secretary security secretary , Janet Napolitano , in 2010 .
However , that agreement was made to buy time to implement the necessary procedures . But with respect to criminal arrestees , Secretary Napolitano clearly stated that she “ intend [ ed ] to phase-in implementation [ of DNA collection ] over the next year . ”
In July 2010 , then-Attorney General Holder similarly stressed the importance of expeditious compliance with criminal DNA collection requirements , and noted exceptions were granted “ at the present time ” because of “ operational exigencies and resource limitations . ”
The Office of Special Counsel reported to President Donald Trump and Congress in a letter ( pdf ) last August that Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) had failed to comply with the law and collect DNA samples while citing allegations from a whistleblower complaint .

Following that , in October last year , DOJ issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to authorize and direct the DHS to start collecting samples of illegal immigrants . The DOJ and DHS have also worked together to conduct a pilot program for the collection , the statement said . In January , CBP said it had initiated a small-scale pilot program to collect DNA from “ certain individuals ” in custody in two locations in order “ to assess the operational impact of proposed regulatory changes. ” The program will last 90 days .
“ Today ’ s rule assists federal agencies in implementing longstanding aspects of our immigration laws as passed by bipartisan majorities of Congress , ” Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A.

“ The FBI will provide DHS with the DNA collection kits , analyze the samples , and ensure that law enforcement agencies use the results in accordance with the FBI ’ s stringent CODIS privacy requirements , ” the department said .
According to CBP data , border patrol officers apprehended or deemed inadmissible over 1.14 million illegal immigrants at the border during the 2019 fiscal year .

Barr revealed Wednesday that the Justice Department is looking into the possibility that Russian operatives fed disinformation to the Hillary Clinton campaign during the 2016 presidential election season .
Mr. Barr told a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about the expanded scope of a review into “ the activities over the summer of 2016 , ” which included vehemently anti-Trump FBI senior officials making key decisions on the investigations of Mrs. Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump .
One key question is how much the FBI relied on the dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele , using information gleaned from Russian sources , which helped spur the Trump-Russia collusion narrative . The dossier was funded by payments from the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee that were hidden in campaign finance reports behind payments to a law firm .
Republican senators said it ’ s possible that Mr. Steele ’ s Russian sources were intentionally feeding him disinformation , which then made it to the highest levels of the FBI . Indeed , former FBI Director James B. Comey ’ s first personal interaction with Mr. Trump was to brief him on the Steele dossier shortly before his inauguration in January 2017 .
“ That ’ s the definition of collusion , ” said Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa , the chamber ’ s senior Republican .
Mr. Barr said he doesn ’ t know the answer — yet .
“ That is one of the areas that I ’ m reviewing . I ’ m concerned about it , and I don ’ t think it ’ s entirely speculative , ” he told the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Democrats were incensed at the prospect of a counterinvestigation . They said the focus should stay squarely on Mr. Trump and what they believe to be his team ’ s efforts to coordinate with Russia in 2016 — and then obstruct the investigation that resulted . U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the Kremlin ran a major disinformation campaign in 2016 to hurt Mrs. Clinton and boost Mr. Trump in the race .
Sen. Richard J. Durbin , Illinois Democrat , called the Republican efforts “ the so-called lock-her-up defense , ” a reference to a popular Trump campaign trail chant against Mrs. Clinton for her use of a secret unsecured email account while she served as secretary of state under President Barack Obama .
Mr. Durbin said Mrs. Clinton ’ s troubles were old news . “ That is totally unresponsive to the reality of what the American people want to know , ” he said .
Mr. Barr was on Capitol Hill to testify about his handling of special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s final report on the Russian hacking operation , submitted to the Justice Department in late March and revealed to the public in lightly redacted form two weeks ago .
Mr. Mueller concluded that despite their shared interest in defeating Mrs. Clinton , there was no evidence that Mr. Trump or his aides coordinated efforts with Moscow in the election . Mr. Mueller said there was evidence that Mr. Trump tried to hinder investigations into Russia and his presidential campaign , but he didn ’ t reach any firm conclusions on criminality . Mr. Barr , however , did reach conclusions , saying it would have been impossible to make a prosecutable case .
That , ironically , is the same conclusion Mr. Comey came to in 2016 when he exonerated Mrs. Clinton for her emails .
It was later revealed that the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump campaign figures several weeks afterward , though the agency never informed Mr. Trump or his team .
Mr. Barr described the zealous pursuit of Mr. Trump as the work of a few high-placed officials who engaged in “ overreach ” — and who have since been ousted from their jobs .
“ It was a few people in the upper echelons of the bureau and perhaps the department . But those people are no longer there , ” he said .
Mr. Barr previously revealed that he was looking into FBI and Justice Department decisions surrounding the 2016 campaign . Congressional Republicans have long pressed the theory that the FBI investigation began illegitimately , fueled by agents who were intent on discrediting the Republican nominee .
Mr. Barr said he will piggyback on work of the inspector general and investigations completed by congressional committees and Mr. Mueller .
Those promises are likely to thrill Mr. Trump , who has long maintained that any criminal behavior during the campaign is connected to Mrs. Clinton .
The Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee made payments — hidden in campaign finance documents behind a law firm — to Fusion GPS , a Democratic research operation that paid Mr. Steele to investigate reports of Mr. Trump ’ s financial links to Russia .
Mr. Steele produced the dossier that claimed secret meetings between Trump campaign figures and Russian operatives and suggested salacious events such as blackmail-style tapes of a Trump encounter with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room . The Mueller report found no evidence to corroborate either of the allegations .
Mr. Barr said he will review how and when the FBI learned of the Democratic backing for the Steele dossier .
The attorney general said Mr. Trump probably should have been briefed on Russian meddling in the election , including efforts to reach out to his campaign .
“ I can ’ t fathom why it did not happen , ” he said . “ If you are concerned about interference in the election and you have substantial people involved in the campaign who are former U.S. attorneys , you had three former U.S. attorneys there in the campaign . I don ’ t know why the bureau would not have gone and given a defensive briefing . ”
Sen. Ben Sasse , Nebraska Republican , asked whether Mr. Barr would support a change to legislation mandating that presidential nominees be given those kinds of briefings as a matter of course , given foreign governments ’ interests in subverting U.S. elections .
“ The danger from countries like China , Russia and so forth is far more insidious than it has been in the past because of nontraditional collectors that they have operating in the United States , and I think most people are unaware of how pervasive it is and what the risk level is , ” he said . “ I think it actually should go far beyond even campaigns where people involved in government have to be educated on this . ”","Attorney General William P.

Last week , Oregon ’ s Ellen Rosenblum became the latest AG to abdicate her duty to defend state law . And earlier this month , a federal judge struck down Virginia ’ s traditional definition of marriage after Attorney General Mark Herring refused to defend it .
Herring ’ s defense of his abdication was typical of these attorneys general . He said he was putting Virginia “ on the right side of history. ” But the job of an attorney general is law not history , and Herring and the other AGs have failed at that job .
Herring put himself on the wrong side of the Virginia constitution , which bans same-sex marriage , the wrong side of recent Supreme Court rulings and most importantly , on the wrong side of his sworn duty to defend Virginia ’ s laws .
More On This ... Holder gives nod to state AGs to drop defense of gay marriage bans amid court challenges
While he was at it , Herring also violated his ethical obligation to zealously represent his clients -- the people of Virginia -- who enacted the gay marriage ban through a 2006 ballot initiative .
Whether on the state or federal level , an attorney general ’ s obligation to defend the laws he is charged with upholding allows no exceptions for moral indignation , predictions about constitutional evolution , or political ambition ( Herring is already touting his decision in campaign emails ) .
The only recognized exception is where a law is clearly unconstitutional in light of existing legal precedent . “ That ’ s not yet the case with state laws banning same-sex marriage , ” explains Colorado Attorney General John Suthers .
In rulings last June , the Supreme Court explicitly declined to decide whether states can ban same-sex marriage .
The state attorneys general who are putting political correctness above their duty are following in the footsteps of Attorney General Holder , who announced in 2011 that the Justice Department would not defend the Defense of Marriage Act ’ s ( DOMA ) traditional definition of marriage in court because he believes it to be unconstitutional . This despite “ little support in Supreme Court doctrine ” for Holder ’ s constitutional interpretation , according to UCLA Law Professor and gay marriage supporter Adam Winkler .
Until Holder ’ s announcement , U.S. attorneys general of both parties agreed that the Constitution ’ s command that the president “ take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed ” includes a duty to defend all but the most clearly unconstitutional laws .
President Carter ’ s Attorney General , Benjamin Civiletti , emphasized the narrowness of the exception with an example he gave – a law requiring the arrest and imprisonment of all members of the opposition party without trial .
Professor Winkler warns that Holder ’ s decision “ sets a terrible precedent that could well come back to haunt those who are cheering the President ’ s decision . Don ’ t be surprised if a President Palin points to Obama ’ s decision when announcing her refusal to enforce and defend [ ObamaCare ] . ”
The Obama administration ’ s failure to defend DOMA is part of the larger controversy over the president ’ s alleged failure to faithfully execute federal laws , including ObamaCare , welfare reform and immigration laws . There too , dangerous precedents are being set .
Those who are cheering should consider that the executive branch ’ s duty to defend laws is a bedrock principle of our republic . The duty is essential to any democracy , because it makes the executive a servant rather than master of the law , obligating him to abide by the people ’ s judgment unless and until the courts make a final determination that their judgment is irreconcilable with the constitution .
The duty to defend is also essential to our system of checks and balances , which places lawmaking authority in the legislature and – in some states – the voters as well .
By undermining duly enacted laws enshrining a traditional definition of marriage , Holder and the state attorneys general are attempting to usurp that authority .
Similarly , their actions threaten to deprive the courts of their role as the final adjudicators of constitutional challenges , as happened in California when Attorney General Jerry Brown refused to defend the state ’ s gay marriage ban .
If the executive branch were free to approach each law on the books with a de novo constitutional review , the result would be chaos . Every law would become a question mark upon the election of a new president , attorney general or governor .
Abdication of the duty to defend “ will ultimately weaken the legal and moral authority that attorneys general have earned and depend on , ” warns Attorney General Suthers . “ We will become viewed as simply one more player in a political system rather than as legal authorities in a legal system . ”
Given these grave implications , it is remarkable that the actions of Holder and the state AGs have generated so little outrage among the public and media , outside of conservative quarters .
If attorneys general failed to defend other laws governing marriage – say , the requirements for child support – citing their personal view of the constitution , people across the political spectrum would be howling .
The muted response likely reflects just how effective gay marriage advocates have been in politically marginalizing their opponents by portraying them as prejudiced Neanderthals ( never mind that President Obama supported a traditional definition of marriage until 2012 ) . Holder and the state AGs are relying on an air of moral superiority to disguise their lawlessness .
What these attorneys general don ’ t seem to appreciate is that the damage they are doing to the duty to defend can not be cabined to this one issue . They will live to regret the path they paved for generations of AGs eager to usurp legislative power and advance their careers by failing to defend politically inconvenient laws .","next Image 1 of 2

The state attorneys general who are putting political correctness above their duty are following in the footsteps of Attorney General Holder, who announced in 2011 that the Justice Department would not defend the Defense of Marriage Act’s (DOMA) traditional definition of marriage in court because he believes it to be unconstitutional. This despite “little support in Supreme Court doctrine” for Holder’s constitutional interpretation, according to UCLA Law Professor and gay marriage supporter Adam Winkler.

Until Holder’s announcement, U.S. attorneys general of both parties agreed that the Constitution’s command that the president “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed” includes a duty to defend all but the most clearly unconstitutional laws.

President Carter’s Attorney General, Benjamin Civiletti, emphasized the narrowness of the exception with an example he gave – a law requiring the arrest and imprisonment of all members of the opposition party without trial.

Professor Winkler warns that Holder’s decision “sets a terrible precedent that could well come back to haunt those who are cheering the President’s decision. Don’t be surprised if a President Palin points to Obama’s decision when announcing her refusal to enforce and defend [ObamaCare].”

The Obama administration’s failure to defend DOMA is part of the larger controversy over the president’s alleged failure to faithfully execute federal laws, including ObamaCare, welfare reform and immigration laws. There too, dangerous precedents are being set.

Those who are cheering should consider that the executive branch’s duty to defend laws is a bedrock principle of our republic. The duty is essential to any democracy, because it makes the executive a servant rather than master of the law, obligating him to abide by the people’s judgment unless and until the courts make a final determination that their judgment is irreconcilable with the constitution.

The duty to defend is also essential to our system of checks and balances, which places lawmaking authority in the legislature and – in some states – the voters as well.

By undermining duly enacted laws enshrining a traditional definition of marriage, Holder and the state attorneys general are attempting to usurp that authority.

Similarly, their actions threaten to deprive the courts of their role as the final adjudicators of constitutional challenges, as happened in California when Attorney General Jerry Brown refused to defend the state’s gay marriage ban.

If the executive branch were free to approach each law on the books with a de novo constitutional review, the result would be chaos. Every law would become a question mark upon the election of a new president, attorney general or governor.

Abdication of the duty to defend “will ultimately weaken the legal and moral authority that attorneys general have earned and depend on,” warns Attorney General Suthers. “We will become viewed as simply one more player in a political system rather than as legal authorities in a legal system.”

Given these grave implications, it is remarkable that the actions of Holder and the state AGs have generated so little outrage among the public and media, outside of conservative quarters.

If attorneys general failed to defend other laws governing marriage – say, the requirements for child support – citing their personal view of the constitution, people across the political spectrum would be howling.

The muted response likely reflects just how effective gay marriage advocates have been in politically marginalizing their opponents by portraying them as prejudiced Neanderthals (never mind that President Obama supported a traditional definition of marriage until 2012). Holder and the state AGs are relying on an air of moral superiority to disguise their lawlessness.

What these attorneys general don’t seem to appreciate is that the damage they are doing to the duty to defend cannot be cabined to this one issue. They will live to regret the path they paved for generations of AGs eager to usurp legislative power and advance their careers by failing to defend politically inconvenient laws.",www.foxnews.com,right,4JKjcFLuGxSYmFlu

After a two-week trial in which jurors heard testimony about defendant Eddie Ray Routh 's erratic behavior , including statements about anarchy , the apocalypse and pig-human hybrids , they convicted Routh Tuesday night in the deaths of Kyle and Chad Littlefield at a Texas shooting range two years ago .
Routh showed no reaction as a judge sentenced him to life in prison without parole , an automatic sentence since prosecutors did n't seek the death penalty in the capital murder case . As one of his victim 's siblings called him an `` American disgrace '' shortly after , Routh looked back at the man intensely but did n't react otherwise .

Routh 's trial drew intense interest , in part because of the blockbuster film based on former Navy SEAL Kyle 's memoir about his four tours in Iraq .
Jurors had three options : find Routh guilty of capital murder , find him not guilty , or find him not guilty by reason of insanity . If found not guilty by reason of insanity , the court could have initiated proceedings to have him committed to a state mental hospital .

Kyle and Littlefield had taken Routh to the shooting range at Rough Creek Lodge and Resort on Feb. 2 , 2013 , after Routh 's mother asked Kyle to help her troubled son .

justice_department,Fox News (Online),2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-trump-expected-commute-roger-stone-sentence,"Trump expected to commute Roger Stone sentence, days before prison term set to begin",,Brooke Singman,"The White House announced Friday that President Trump signed an Executive Grant of Clemency commuting the `` unjust sentence '' of Roger Stone , just days before the longtime political operative was slated to report to prison to serve more than three years for charges stemming from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation .
In a lengthy statement released late Friday , White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the president had made the decision to commute Stone 's sentence `` in light of the egregious facts and circumstances surrounding his unfair prosecution , arrest , and trial . ''
“ Roger Stone is a victim of the Russia Hoax that the Left and its allies in the media perpetuated for years in an attempt to undermine the Trump Presidency , ” McEnany said in a statement Friday night . “ There was never any collusion between the Trump Campaign , or the Trump Administration , with Russia . Such collusion was never anything other than a fantasy of partisans unable to accept the result of the 2016 election . The collusion delusion spawned endless and farcical investigations , conducted at great taxpayer expense , looking for evidence that did not exist . ”
McEnany added that Mueller ’ s office “ resorted to process-based charges leveled at high-profile people in an attempt to manufacture the false impression of criminality lurking below the surface . ”
“ These charges were the product of recklessness borne of frustration and malice , ” she said .
McEnany touted Stone ’ s career in politics , noting that he worked for nearly 50 years as a consultant for high-profile Republican politicians , including former President Ronald Reagan , Sen. Bob Dole and others , while noting that Stone is also known for `` his outspoken support for President Donald J. Trump and opposition to Hillary Clinton . ''
McEnany went on to blast Mueller ’ s prosecutors for the fashion in which they arrested Stone , noting he is a “ 67 year old man with numerous medical conditions , who had never been convicted of another crime , and that they used “ dozens of FBI agents with automatic weapons and tactical equipment , armored vehicles , and an amphibious unit to execute a pre-dawn raid of his home , where he was with his wife of many years . ”
McEnany went on to add that Stone would “ be put at serious medical risk in prison . ”
Stone was set to report to prison on July 14 to serve 40 months . He was sentenced in February to more than three years in prison after being convicted in November 2019 on seven counts of obstruction , witness tampering and making false statements to Congress . Stone , however , has appealed his conviction and continues to deny any wrongdoing .
`` He has appealed his conviction and is seeking a new trial . He maintains his innocence and has stated that he expects to be fully exonerated by the justice system , '' McEnany said . `` Mr. Stone , like every American , deserves a fair trial and every opportunity to vindicate himself before the courts . ”
She added : “ The President does not wish to interfere with his efforts to do so . At this time , however , and particularly in light of the egregious facts and circumstances surrounding his unfair prosecution , arrest , and trial , the President has determined to commute his sentence . ''
“ Roger Stone has already suffered greatly , ” she added . `` He was treated very unfairly , as were many others in this case . Roger Stone is now a free man ! ”
In a statement to Fox News , Stone 's attorney Grant Smith said : `` Mr. Stone is incredibly honored that President Trump used his awesome and unique power under the Constitution of the United States for this act of mercy . ''
Smith added : `` Mr. and Mrs. Stone appreciate all the consideration the President gave to this matter . ''
Earlier Friday , an appeals court denied Stone 's request to delay reporting for his sentence , saying he must report for prison on Tuesday .
`` In sum , Stone is not legally eligible for further postponement of his reporting date under 18 U.S.C . § 3145 ( c ) , which is the only basis on which he seeks relief from this court . We therefore deny his motion , '' the court wrote in its order .
EXCLUSIVE : ROGER STONE SAYS HE IS 'PRAYING ' FOR CLEMENCY FROM TRUMP , DAYS BEFORE HE IS SET TO REPORT TO PRISON
Trump , for weeks , has signaled he could be open to granting Stone clemency — tweeting last month that Stone was “ a victim of a corrupt and illegal Witch Hunt , one which will go down as the greatest political crime in history . He can sleep well at night ! ”
During an exclusive interview with Fox News this week , Stone said he was “ praying ” for Trump to intervene .
When asked whether he ’ d prefer a pardon or a commutation of his sentence , Stone said “ either one obviously would have an effect , in my opinion , of saving my life . ”
A presidential pardon completely absolves an individual of the crime he or she is found to have committed . A commutation lessens the punishment or eliminates jail time , but leaves the conviction standing .
“ I have deep concerns about going to a prison where there absolutely is COVID virus , and , therefore , either one would have an effect of saving my life , '' Stone said .
He added : “ If I should be fortunate enough to get a commutation , I would continue to fight for vindication . ”
As of Thursday evening , Stone said he had not received any formal communication from the White House on a potential pardon or commutation of his sentence .
`` I think I ’ ll be the last person to know , ” Stone told Fox News . “ He hates leaks , and he hates to be told what to do . I have instructed my lawyers not to contact the lawyers at the White House .
“ The president , who I ’ ve known for 40 years , has an incredible sense of fairness . He is aware that the people trying to destroy Michael Flynn , now trying to destroy me , are the people trying to destroy him , '' Stone said .
He added : `` I certainly think it could happen . I ’ m not going to second-guess the president . ”
STONE SENTENCED TO MORE THAN 3 YEARS IN PRISON FOR LYING TO CONGRESS , WITNESS TAMPERING
Stone was not charged with any underlying crime of coordinating with Russia during the 2016 presidential election , though Mueller ’ s team investigated Stone over tweets claiming to have information about WikiLeaks document dumps prior to their release .
When asked whether Stone felt WikiLeaks influenced the 2016 election , he said : “ Yes . All of it . ”
“ My whole purpose in hyping Wikileaks on Twitter was to make sure the media didn ’ t sweep it under the rug , only because I was told it was politically significant , ” Stone said of his tweets in 2016 , which he said were “ not specific , ” and simply flagged that a WikiLeaks document dump “ would be big ” and was coming .
“ I never discussed it with Trump . I have no idea what he thought about it , we never discussed it , ” Stone said . “ You have to understand something about Donald Trump—when you talk to him on the phone , he talks and you listen . That ’ s kind of the way it works . ”
When asked whether Stone had any regrets over his involvement in 2016 , he said no .
“ I engaged in legitimate , perfectly legal political activity which Mueller ’ s corrupt investigation chose to criminalize , ” Stone said . “ I thought the results of the 2016 election were crucial . ”
Meanwhile , earlier this week , Facebook announced it had removed a network of accounts on the platform and on Instagram allegedly linked to Stone . The company said the accounts were allegedly involved in “ coordinated inauthentic behavior in the United States. ” The networks , according to Facebook , were focused on domestic audiences .
Facebook said it “ identified the full scope ” of the networks “ following the recent public release of search warrants pertaining to the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller in response to a joint petition from The New York Times , CNN , the Associated Press , The Washington Post , and Politico . ”
FACEBOOK SAYS IT TOOK DOWN NETWORK AFFILIATED WITH ROGER STONE THAT INCLUDED FAKE ACCOUNTS
“ Our investigation linked this network to Roger Stone and his associates , ” Facebook said Wednesday .
Stone , however , denied being linked to the accounts , calling Facebook 's accusations “ defamatory , ” and said he did not think it was “ coincidental ” that they made the announcement this week .
“ They ’ ll have a chance to prove it . Words on a press release are assertions and accusations . It is false , ” Stone said . “ It is put up or shut up time very soon . They ’ ll get a chance to show me the illegitimate sites . They don ’ t exist . I don ’ t own hundreds of Facebook pages and I never have . ”
Stone claimed that Facebook 's actions were `` attempted character assassination to derail clemency . ”
Stone told Fox News he plans to file a lawsuit against the social media giant .
“ My lawsuit against Facebook will be a defamation suit , ” he said . “ They have accused me of doing something that they imply is illegal and violated their rules . ”

justice_department,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/may/22/fox-anchor-justice-department-seized-phone-records/,Fox anchor: Justice Department seized phone records for reporter James RosenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parents,2013-05-22,David Sherfinski,"Fox News anchor Bret Baier says that in addition to seizing the phone records of Fox reporter James Rosen , the Department of Justice seized the records of his parents as well in another twist to the still-unraveling saga .
“ We said the different numbers ; we have the documents now , the seized … records relate to James ’ parents ’ home in Staten Island , ” he said on “ Special Report with Bret Baier . ”
On Monday , news reports said the Justice Department seized phone records and emails sent to a private account of Fox News ’ chief Washington correspondent , Mr. Rosen , in an investigation into a 2009 story about U.N. sanctions and North Korea ’ s nuclear program .
In court filings , the department even said Mr. Rosen may have aided and abetted in a crime by trying to pry the information , which was classified , from his source .
The government is prosecuting a State Department adviser Stephen Kim , a North Korea analyst , for revealing secrets to the news organization . He is awaiting trial . No charges have been filed against Mr. Rosen .
Ryan Lizza of the New Yorker reported Tuesday that Ronald C. Machen Jr. , the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia , who is prosecuting the case , seized records “ associated with two phone numbers at the White House , at least five numbers associated with Fox News , and one that has the same area code and exchange as Rosen ’ s personal-cell-phone number ( the last four numbers are redacted ) . ”
The Justice Department has come under fire for the recent disclosure that it subpoenaed the phone records from 20 Associated Press phone lines , used by up to 100 reporters . The Justice Department sought the AP ’ s phone records in an investigation into who leaked information that embarrassed the administration last year , exposing that it had been working to thwart a terrorist attack at a time when officials said they had no specific knowledge of any plots .
CBS News reporter Sheryl Attkisson , who has writing frequently on the botched “ Fast and Furious ” gunrunning scheme , told a Philadelphia radio station Tuesday that her personal and work computers have been “ compromised , ” and that there “ could be some relationship ” between that and what happened with Mr. Rosen and the AP .
“ To our knowledge , the Justice Department has never ‘ compromised ’ Ms. Atkisson ’ s computers , or otherwise sought any information from or concerning any telephone , computer or other media device she may own or use , ” Dean Boyd , a Justice Department spokesman told Politico Tuesday night .
The Justice Department released a statement Monday arguing that “ leaks of classified information to the press can pose a serious risk of harm to our national security and it is important that we pursue these matters using appropriate law enforcement tools . ”
White House press secretary Jay Carney , the former bureau ’ s chief for Time magazine , refused to provide any comment on the matter , saying it was an “ ongoing criminal probe . ”
But during Tuesday ’ s press briefing , he said President Obama does not believe that journalists reporting leaked classified information are committing crimes .
“ If you ’ re asking me whether the president believes that journalists should be prosecuted for doing their jobs , the answer is no , ” Mr. Carney said .
Reporters on Monday had pressed Mr. Carney to say whether he agreed with the tract of labeling Mr. Rosen as a potential criminal co-conspirator in the case .
After the contentious exchange , Mr. Carney discussed the matter with the president .
“ I can tell you in our conversation yesterday he reiterated just how important he believes it is to reporters that all of you and your colleagues are able to do your jobs in a free and open way and , as he has said , he believes there is an important balance to be found here and he thinks the questions about how that balance is being struck are entirely legitimate , and he welcomes the public discussion , ” Mr. Carney said .
When asked whether , as a reporter , he ever had to decide whether to publish classified information , he said he hadn ’ t : “ Not personally . ”
“ It ’ s not about me … as a reporter I think I am more intimately aware of these issues than some folks , ” he said . “ In terms of my past experience , it ’ s not particularly relevant . ”","Fox News anchor Bret Baier says that in addition to seizing the phone records of Fox reporter James Rosen, the Department of Justice seized the records of his parents as well in another twist to the still-unraveling saga.

“We said the different numbers; we have the documents now, the seized … records relate to James’ parents’ home in Staten Island,” he said on “Special Report with Bret Baier.”

On Monday, news reports said the Justice Department seized phone records and emails sent to a private account of Fox News’ chief Washington correspondent, Mr. Rosen, in an investigation into a 2009 story about U.N. sanctions and North Korea’s nuclear program.

In court filings, the department even said Mr. Rosen may have aided and abetted in a crime by trying to pry the information, which was classified, from his source.

The government is prosecuting a State Department adviser Stephen Kim, a North Korea analyst, for revealing secrets to the news organization. He is awaiting trial. No charges have been filed against Mr. Rosen.

Ryan Lizza of the New Yorker reported Tuesday that Ronald C. Machen Jr., the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, who is prosecuting the case, seized records “associated with two phone numbers at the White House, at least five numbers associated with Fox News, and one that has the same area code and exchange as Rosen’s personal-cell-phone number (the last four numbers are redacted).”

The Justice Department has come under fire for the recent disclosure that it subpoenaed the phone records from 20 Associated Press phone lines, used by up to 100 reporters. The Justice Department sought the AP’s phone records in an investigation into who leaked information that embarrassed the administration last year, exposing that it had been working to thwart a terrorist attack at a time when officials said they had no specific knowledge of any plots.

CBS News reporter Sheryl Attkisson, who has writing frequently on the botched “Fast and Furious” gunrunning scheme, told a Philadelphia radio station Tuesday that her personal and work computers have been “compromised,” and that there “could be some relationship” between that and what happened with Mr. Rosen and the AP.

“To our knowledge, the Justice Department has never ‘compromised’ Ms. Atkisson’s computers, or otherwise sought any information from or concerning any telephone, computer or other media device she may own or use,” Dean Boyd, a Justice Department spokesman told Politico Tuesday night.

The Justice Department released a statement Monday arguing that “leaks of classified information to the press can pose a serious risk of harm to our national security and it is important that we pursue these matters using appropriate law enforcement tools.”

White House press secretary Jay Carney, the former bureau’s chief for Time magazine, refused to provide any comment on the matter, saying it was an “ongoing criminal probe.”

But during Tuesday’s press briefing, he said President Obama does not believe that journalists reporting leaked classified information are committing crimes.

“If you’re asking me whether the president believes that journalists should be prosecuted for doing their jobs, the answer is no,” Mr. Carney said.

Reporters on Monday had pressed Mr. Carney to say whether he agreed with the tract of labeling Mr. Rosen as a potential criminal co-conspirator in the case.

justice_department,Reason,2,https://reason.com/2020/02/21/newspaper-lobbyists-and-encryption-foes-join-the-chorus-against-section-230/,Newspaper Lobbyists and Encryption Foes Join the Chorus Against Section 230,2020-02-21,"Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Josh Blackman, Eric Boehm, Charles Oliver, Stewart Baker, Stephanie Slade, Christian Britschgi","The Department of Justice has joined the campaign against Section 230 , the federal law that enables the internet as we know it . Its effort is probably part of Washington 's ongoing battle against encrypted communications . And legacy news media companies are apparently all to happy to help them in this fight .
On Wednesday , the U.S. Department of Justice held a `` public workshop '' on Section 230 . Predictably , it wound being up a greatest hits of the half-truths and paranoid bellyaching commonly employed against this important law .
Section 230 prevents digital companies from being automatically treated as the speaker of any third-party speech they assist in putting online . It also allows companies to moderate content without becoming liable for it . The law was passed in 1996 to address the fact that the then-dominant web companies felt forced to choose between very strictly gate-keeping or allowing a free-for-all if they wanted to avoid civil lawsuits and criminal liability over user-generated speech .
Section 230 has never prevented the Justice Department from enforcing federal criminal statutes against online violators , as many have misleadingly argued . ( For a quick debunking of more Section 230 myths , see this video . ) It acts as a shield against civil lawsuits and against state and local criminal charges .
U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr opened the event yesterday by saying that `` criminals and bad actors now use technology to facilitate and expand the scope of their wrongdoing and the victimization of our fellow citizens . ''
This is the same line of talk Barr has used against encrypted communication .
Barr invoked child exploitation as one ███ to reexamine Section 230 . But the statute was passed explicitly to address this issue , as part of a larger law concerning `` communication decency '' and online pornography . It provides the legal framework that allows companies to actually try to keep exploitative content offline . And nothing in Section 230 prevents the enforcement of federal laws against child pornography and other forms of sexual exploitation .
`` Section 230 has never prevented federal criminal prosecution of those who traffic in [ child sexual abuse material ] —as more than 36,000 individuals were between 2004 and 2017 , '' points out Berin Szoka in a post dissecting draft anti–Section 230 legislation proposed by Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R–S.C. ) . Graham 's bill would amend Section 230 to lower the standard for legal liability , so tech companies need n't `` knowingly '' aid in the transmission of illegal content to be found guilty in civil suits and state criminal prosecutions ; they 'd merely have to be deemed to have acted `` recklessly '' in such matters as content moderation or product design . The legislation would also create a presidential commission to offer `` best practices '' on this front . Taken together , Szoka sees this as a back door to banning end-to-end encryption by declaring it reckless . ( More on that bill from First Amendment lawyer Eric Goldman here . )
Barr 's remarks yesterday did n't explicitly mention giving government backdoors to spy on people . Instead , he played up several popular ( and wrong ) arguments against Section 230 , such as the claim that it 's responsible for `` big tech '' restricting online speech or that it prevents us from having `` safer online spaces . '' Lurking in these comments is the schizophrenic proposition girding a lot of Section 230 opposition : that getting rid of it would somehow permit freer speech online and keep online spaces `` safer '' and more palatable for everyone .
Barr also engaged in the kind of social media exceptionalism common among Section 230 critics , insisting that online platforms today are so radically different than their predecessors as to warrant different rules . In doing so , he suggested that walled-off internet services like AOL had less control over content than their current counterparts and implied that Section 230 only protects social platforms and `` big tech '' companies .
In reality , Section 230 applies to even the smallest companies and groups ( and is more important for ensuring their existence than it is for big companies , whose army of lawyers and moderators have a better chance of weathering a post-230 onslaught of lawsuits from users ) . And it applies to many types of digital entities , including behind-the-scenes web architecture ( such as blogging platforms and email newsletter software ) , consumer review websites , crowdfunding apps , podcast networks , independent message-boards , dating platforms , digital marketing tools , email providers , and many more .
Barr said Wednesday that the Justice Department was `` not here to advocate for a position . '' Yet everything else in his speech suggested otherwise , including his waxing about how civil lawsuits against tech companies ( of the sort disallowed by Section 230 ) could `` work hand-in-hand with the department 's law enforcement efforts . ''
He concluded the talk by saying `` we must remember that the goal of firms is to maximize profit , while the mission of government is to protect American citizens and society . ''
Not everyone in Washington buys this simplistic argument , thank goodness . In a recent Washington Post op-ed , Sen. Ron Wyden ( D–Ore . ) , who co-authored Section 230 , explains how the law protects individual speech rights and pointed out that major media and tech companies have in fact been working with regulators against the law .
`` Occasionally , '' writes Wyden , `` Congress actually passes a law that protects the less powerful elements of our society , the insurgents and the disrupters . That 's what it did in 1996 when it passed [ Section 230 ] . '' He explains that the law `` was written to provide legal protection to online platforms so they could take down objectionable material without being dragged into court . ''
`` Without 230 , social media could n't exist , '' adds Wyden . Neither could movements like Black Lives Matter or # MeToo . `` Whenever laws are passed to put the government in control of speech , the people who get hurt are the least powerful in society . ''
People often pretend government regulation of speech is somehow neutral . But defining permissible speech can change greatly depending on subjective and partisan priorities . Without Section 230 , what online content is permissible and who gets punished would be determined not by an array of private companies but by a centralized political institution with the power to imprison , not just deplatform .
`` I 'm certain this administration would use power to regulate speech to punish its enemies and protect its allies , '' writes Wyden at the Post . `` It would threaten Facebook or YouTube for taking down white supremacist content . It would label Black Lives Matter activists as purveyors of hate . ''
A Democratic administration would approve and disfavor different sorts of speech . But we would still have a partisan and centralized command over the bounds of online communication . And either way , the spoils will go to the big tech companies that are best able to lobby , contribute , curry favor , or otherwise game the system .

Its effort is probably part of Washington's ongoing battle against encrypted communications. And legacy news media companies are apparently all to happy to help them in this fight.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Justice held a ""public workshop"" on Section 230. Predictably, it wound being up a greatest hits of the half-truths and paranoid bellyaching commonly employed against this important law.

Section 230 prevents digital companies from being automatically treated as the speaker of any third-party speech they assist in putting online. It also allows companies to moderate content without becoming liable for it. The law was passed in 1996 to address the fact that the then-dominant web companies felt forced to choose between very strictly gate-keeping or allowing a free-for-all if they wanted to avoid civil lawsuits and criminal liability over user-generated speech.

Section 230 has never prevented the Justice Department from enforcing federal criminal statutes against online violators, as many have misleadingly argued. (For a quick debunking of more Section 230 myths, see this video.) It acts as a shield against civil lawsuits and against state and local criminal charges.

U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr opened the event yesterday by saying that ""criminals and bad actors now use technology to facilitate and expand the scope of their wrongdoing and the victimization of our fellow citizens.""

This is the same line of talk Barr has used against encrypted communication.

Barr invoked child exploitation as one reason to reexamine Section 230. But the statute was passed explicitly to address this issue, as part of a larger law concerning ""communication decency"" and online pornography. It provides the legal framework that allows companies to actually try to keep exploitative content offline. And nothing in Section 230 prevents the enforcement of federal laws against child pornography and other forms of sexual exploitation.

""Section 230 has never prevented federal criminal prosecution of those who traffic in [child sexual abuse material]—as more than 36,000 individuals were between 2004 and 2017,"" points out Berin Szoka in a post dissecting draft anti–Section 230 legislation proposed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R–S.C.). Graham's bill would amend Section 230 to lower the standard for legal liability, so tech companies needn't ""knowingly"" aid in the transmission of illegal content to be found guilty in civil suits and state criminal prosecutions; they'd merely have to be deemed to have acted ""recklessly"" in such matters as content moderation or product design. The legislation would also create a presidential commission to offer ""best practices"" on this front. Taken together, Szoka sees this as a back door to banning end-to-end encryption by declaring it reckless. (More on that bill from First Amendment lawyer Eric Goldman here.)

Barr's remarks yesterday didn't explicitly mention giving government backdoors to spy on people. Instead, he played up several popular (and wrong) arguments against Section 230, such as the claim that it's responsible for ""big tech"" restricting online speech or that it prevents us from having ""safer online spaces."" Lurking in these comments is the schizophrenic proposition girding a lot of Section 230 opposition: that getting rid of it would somehow permit freer speech online and keep online spaces ""safer"" and more palatable for everyone.

Barr also engaged in the kind of social media exceptionalism common among Section 230 critics, insisting that online platforms today are so radically different than their predecessors as to warrant different rules. In doing so, he suggested that walled-off internet services like AOL had less control over content than their current counterparts and implied that Section 230 only protects social platforms and ""big tech"" companies.

In reality, Section 230 applies to even the smallest companies and groups (and is more important for ensuring their existence than it is for big companies, whose army of lawyers and moderators have a better chance of weathering a post-230 onslaught of lawsuits from users). And it applies to many types of digital entities, including behind-the-scenes web architecture (such as blogging platforms and email newsletter software), consumer review websites, crowdfunding apps, podcast networks, independent message-boards, dating platforms, digital marketing tools, email providers, and many more.

Barr said Wednesday that the Justice Department was ""not here to advocate for a position."" Yet everything else in his speech suggested otherwise, including his waxing about how civil lawsuits against tech companies (of the sort disallowed by Section 230) could ""work hand-in-hand with the department's law enforcement efforts.""

He concluded the talk by saying ""we must remember that the goal of firms is to maximize profit, while the mission of government is to protect American citizens and society.""

So: tech companies bad, government good. Got that?

Not everyone in Washington buys this simplistic argument, thank goodness. In a recent Washington Post op-ed, Sen. Ron Wyden (D–Ore.), who co-authored Section 230, explains how the law protects individual speech rights and pointed out that major media and tech companies have in fact been working with regulators against the law.

""Occasionally,"" writes Wyden, ""Congress actually passes a law that protects the less powerful elements of our society, the insurgents and the disrupters. That's what it did in 1996 when it passed [Section 230]."" He explains that the law ""was written to provide legal protection to online platforms so they could take down objectionable material without being dragged into court.""

""Without 230, social media couldn't exist,"" adds Wyden. Neither could movements like Black Lives Matter or #MeToo. ""Whenever laws are passed to put the government in control of speech, the people who get hurt are the least powerful in society.""

People often pretend government regulation of speech is somehow neutral. But defining permissible speech can change greatly depending on subjective and partisan priorities. Without Section 230, what online content is permissible and who gets punished would be determined not by an array of private companies but by a centralized political institution with the power to imprison, not just deplatform.

""I'm certain this administration would use power to regulate speech to punish its enemies and protect its allies,"" writes Wyden at the Post. ""It would threaten Facebook or YouTube for taking down white supremacist content. It would label Black Lives Matter activists as purveyors of hate.""

A Democratic administration would approve and disfavor different sorts of speech. But we would still have a partisan and centralized command over the bounds of online communication. And either way, the spoils will go to the big tech companies that are best able to lobby, contribute, curry favor, or otherwise game the system.

Powerful entities like Facebook, Disney, and IBM are all fighting to re-write the rules for digital speech in their favor. A recent New York Times article detailed how the fight against 230 is being led by a coalition of old media companies resentful of Google, Facebook, etc. and other corporations whose business has been bit into by digital tools. For instance, Marriott has been campaigning against Section 230 as a way to stick it to vacation rental platforms like Airbnb.

An American woman who was released from a Mexican jail cried out for joy when she crossed the border into Arizona . `` I 'm home ! Finally ! '' Yanira Maldonado exclaimed .

She and her husband , Gary , were traveling from Mexico back to the United States when their bus was stopped and searched . Yanira Maldonado allegedly was sitting above the illegal stash .
Maldonado 's case sparked widespread media coverage and attention from U.S. lawmakers as family members pushed for her freedom . At a press conference early Friday in Nogales , Arizona , she thanked journalists , crediting them for her expedited release .
The quality of her conditions in jail also improved as the media coverage increased , she told CNN affiliate KPNX-TV in Phoenix .

The Arizonan and mother of seven had consistently denied the charges against her , and the court determined that the prosecutors did not provide evidence .
Her husband , Gary , tearfully embraced his wife after her release .
Though the court released her back to the United States , legal proceedings are not completely over , Gary Maldonado said . But his wife 's attorney in Mexico will take care of them in her absence .
Security camera footage revealed in court Thursday shows Maldonado and her husband boarding a bus in Mexico last week . They are carrying a purse , two blankets and two bottles of water .
It 's an everyday scene that plays out at bus stations around the world . But in this case , defense attorney Francisco Benitez argued that the images were a crucial piece of evidence .
Why ? Because nothing they 're carrying , he said , could hold the amount of marijuana that Maldonado was accused of smuggling .
Video footage suggests that someone else brought the marijuana aboard the bus , the lawyer said .
Packages of the illegal substance allegedly recovered from under Maldonado 's seat would not have fit in her purse , Benitez said .
Her attorneys also presented documents that show that she and her husband have no criminal records in the United States , Benitez said .
Word that the surveillance video had been shown in court was a big relief , her husband said .
`` That was the key that would help us prove her innocence , '' he said .
`` It showed right on the film clear as day there 's no way you could carry 12 pounds or 5.7 kilos with one arm , '' he said .
The Mexican military officials who arrested Maldonado did n't make their case in court . The soldiers were scheduled to appear Wednesday but did n't show .
Mexican authorities arrested Maldonado , a U.S. citizen , on May 22 as she and her husband were on their way back to Arizona .
Gary Maldonado said he believes Mexican soldiers at the checkpoint wanted a bribe . A Mexican state official also told CNN it appears that Maldonado was framed .
Yanira Maldonado does not necessarily think she was directly targeted . `` Someone smuggled those in there , and I probably sat in the wrong seat , '' she said .
Nonetheless , she called on those who arrested her to `` repent , '' find `` respectable work '' and stop making people suffer .
A regional office of Mexico 's defense ministry said troops conducting a routine investigation stopped the bus Maldonado was riding in and found 12.5 pounds ( 5.7 kilograms ) of a substance that appeared to be marijuana under her seat .
Troops turned the case over to the Mexican attorney general 's office , the defense ministry said . Maldonado was held in a women 's prison in Nogales , Mexico .
`` Reading the Scriptures , reading the Book of Mormon , praying , fasting , '' Maldonado said . `` And all the support that I 've been getting from my family , my husband , my children and everybody out there reaching out to help . ''
Family members ' tearful pleas for her release drew widespread media attention and caught the attention of U.S. officials .
U.S. Rep. Matt Salmon , R-Arizona , said he had spoken about the case with the U.S. ambassador to Mexico and Mexico 's ambassador in Washington .
State Department officials said consular officials met with Maldonado on Wednesday and May 24 .
U.S. diplomats did the same things they would when a U.S. citizen is arrested in a foreign country , but maybe to a higher degree because of the high-profile nature of the case , a senior administration official said .","Story highlights Yanira Maldonado calls for those who arrested her to ""repent""

Maldonado's attorney cites security camera footage as crucial evidence

Maldonado was accused of smuggling drugs on a bus

Mexican court determines prosecutors did not provide evidence.

An American woman who was released from a Mexican jail cried out for joy when she crossed the border into Arizona. ""I'm home! Finally!"" Yanira Maldonado exclaimed.

Mexican authorities detained her last week and put her behind bars over allegations she tried to smuggle 12 pounds of marijuana under a bus seat.

She and her husband, Gary, were traveling from Mexico back to the United States when their bus was stopped and searched. Yanira Maldonado allegedly was sitting above the illegal stash.

The Arizonan and mother of seven had consistently denied the charges against her, and the court determined that the prosecutors did not provide evidence.

Her husband, Gary, tearfully embraced his wife after her release.

Though the court released her back to the United States, legal proceedings are not completely over, Gary Maldonado said. But his wife's attorney in Mexico will take care of them in her absence.

Security footage revealed

Security camera footage revealed in court Thursday shows Maldonado and her husband boarding a bus in Mexico last week. They are carrying a purse, two blankets and two bottles of water.

It's an everyday scene that plays out at bus stations around the world. But in this case, defense attorney Francisco Benitez argued that the images were a crucial piece of evidence.

Why? Because nothing they're carrying, he said, could hold the amount of marijuana that Maldonado was accused of smuggling.

Video footage suggests that someone else brought the marijuana aboard the bus, the lawyer said.

Packages of the illegal substance allegedly recovered from under Maldonado's seat would not have fit in her purse, Benitez said.

Big relief

Her attorneys also presented documents that show that she and her husband have no criminal records in the United States, Benitez said.

Word that the surveillance video had been shown in court was a big relief, her husband said.

""That was the key that would help us prove her innocence,"" he said.

""It showed right on the film clear as day there's no way you could carry 12 pounds or 5.7 kilos with one arm,"" he said.

The Mexican military officials who arrested Maldonado didn't make their case in court. The soldiers were scheduled to appear Wednesday but didn't show.

Official: She was framed

Mexican authorities arrested Maldonado, a U.S. citizen, on May 22 as she and her husband were on their way back to Arizona.

Gary Maldonado said he believes Mexican soldiers at the checkpoint wanted a bribe. A Mexican state official also told CNN it appears that Maldonado was framed.

Yanira Maldonado does not necessarily think she was directly targeted. ""Someone smuggled those in there, and I probably sat in the wrong seat,"" she said.

Nonetheless, she called on those who arrested her to ""repent,"" find ""respectable work"" and stop making people suffer.

A regional office of Mexico's defense ministry said troops conducting a routine investigation stopped the bus Maldonado was riding in and found 12.5 pounds (5.7 kilograms) of a substance that appeared to be marijuana under her seat.

Troops turned the case over to the Mexican attorney general's office, the defense ministry said. Maldonado was held in a women's prison in Nogales, Mexico.

Tearful pleas

""Reading the Scriptures, reading the Book of Mormon, praying, fasting,"" Maldonado said. ""And all the support that I've been getting from my family, my husband, my children and everybody out there reaching out to help.""

Family members' tearful pleas for her release drew widespread media attention and caught the attention of U.S. officials.

U.S. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Arizona, said he had spoken about the case with the U.S. ambassador to Mexico and Mexico's ambassador in Washington.

State Department officials said consular officials met with Maldonado on Wednesday and May 24.

U.S. diplomats did the same things they would when a U.S. citizen is arrested in a foreign country, but maybe to a higher degree because of the high-profile nature of the case, a senior administration official said.",www.cnn.com,left,OyLYeLIBFXCpu6bh

The language is not dramatic, but the message is clear: A much-anticipated report from the Treasury Department's inspector general for tax administration is straightforward about how Internal Revenue Service personnel unfairly singled out some conservative groups for unnecessary scrutiny during the 2012 campaign cycle.

As the report's summary says:

""The IRS used inappropriate criteria that identified for review Tea Party and other organizations applying for tax-exempt status based upon their names or policy positions instead of indications of potential political campaign intervention. Ineffective management:

And in the report, the inspector general says that while IRS personnel did put applications from some other types of organizations through extra reviews, ""we determined during our reviews of statistical samples of I.R.C. § 501(c)(4) tax-exempt applications that all cases with Tea Party, Patriots, or 9/12 in their names were forwarded to the team of specialists"" for added scrutiny. (We added the bold face type.)

Was the extra scrutiny motivated by partisan politics? The report does not reach that conclusion.

Trump denies any collusion. The Kremlin denies any meddling.

Barr has said he will not let himself be bullied by Trump and will protect the integrity of Mueller’s investigation and make public as many of its findings as he can.

Barr has not promised to release Mueller’s report in its entirety. He has warned he may not be allowed to reveal the identities of people who escape prosecution. That stance troubles many Democrats, who say Barr’s expansive views of executive power might lead him to suppress parts of the report.

Washington (CNN) – Sen. Rand Paul took to the Senate floor Wednesday to deliver a 31-minute speech in opposition to the judicial nomination of a former Justice Department official, David Barron.

Barron has drawn the ire of senators on the right and left for legal memos he wrote justifying the killing of an American terrorism suspect overseas with drones.

""I rise today to oppose the nomination of anyone who would argue that the President has the power to kill American citizens not involved in combat,"" Paul said on the Senate floor.

Senators, however, believe they have the votes needed to break to break the GOP filibuster of the Harvard law professor to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which is based in Boston.

In order to secure at least 51 Democratic votes to overcome the filibuster, the White House took the extraordinary step last week of sending the unredacted Justice Department memos to Capitol Hill where senators from both parties could review them in a classified setting in the basement of the Capitol. Top White House lawyers also met privately with Democratic senators to explain the memos and respond to concerns.

""Once everything was explained,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, said Tuesday. ""Most everyone in our caucus is satisfied.""

The administration is preparing to release one of those memos to the public for the first time, officials said Tuesday, though it won't be made public right away. It has to go through a redaction process that will need to be approved by a judge, according to the administration officials.

Paul, who has spearheaded GOP opposition to Barron, is joined by a handful of Democratic senators and the liberal American Civil Liberties Union in opposing Barron.

At issue are memos Barron wrote while working in the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department, which gave the legal reasoning for killing Anwar al-Awlaki, a suspected American al Qaeda operative who was killed with CIA drones in September, 2011.

""It isn't about seeing the Barron memos,"" Paul said. ""It is about what they say. I believe the Barron memos disrespect the Bill of Rights.""

The Kentucky Republican, who has loudly opposed this issue in the past, said he's not trying to defend ""traitors.""

""I can't stand the thought of Americans who consort with and advocate for the enemy. I want to punish Americans who are traitors to their country. But I am also conscious of what these traitors have betrayed,"" he said.

""These traitors are betraying a country that holds dear the precept that we are innocent until proven guilty,"" he continued. ""Aren't we, in a way, betraying our country's principles when we relinquish the right to a jury trial?""

The potential presidential contender famously carried out a 13-hour filibuster over a similar issue. Last time, he was trying to block the nomination of John Brennan to become director of the CIA.

However, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid invoked the ""nuclear option"" late last year, making it incredibly difficult for filibusters to occur against certain presidential nominations.

Four line prosecutors then quit the case.

justice_department,Fox News (Online),2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nadler-prepares-to-subpoena-barr-over-firing-of-us-attorney,Nadler prepares to subpoena Barr over firing of US attorney,,Brooke Singman,"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler is expected to issue a subpoena to compel Attorney General Bill Barr to testify before the panel on the firing of U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman , amid the committee ’ s broad investigation into the alleged “ politicization ” of the Trump Justice Department .
`` We have begun the process to issue that subpoena , '' Nadler , D-N.Y. , said Monday night on MSNBC 's `` The Rachel Maddow Show . ”
DEMS SEIZE ON US ATTORNEY OUSTER TO PURSUE NEW PROBES , HEARINGS
The subpoena reportedly would compel Barr ’ s testimony on July 2 .
The move comes as top congressional Democrats are calling for new probes and hearings concerning the Justice Department after Berman 's ouster over the weekend .
Nadler previously said his panel would “ immediately open an investigation ” into the removal . President Trump apparently fired Berman after he refused to step down , though the president has since distanced himself from the process .
“ Attorney General Bill Barr told us that Geoffrey Berman of the SDNY had resigned—which was untrue , ” Nadler said in a statement . “ Barr told us that the president asked him to fire Mr. Berman—which may also be untrue , given that the president says he had nothing to do with the decision . ”
Nadler added : “ The whole thing smacks of corruption and incompetence , which is what we have come to expect from this President and his Attorney General . ”
Nadler noted that neither the White House nor the Justice Department offered an explanation for Berman ’ s removal .
“ We know that the U.S. Attorney ’ s Office for the Southern District of New York is engaged in investigations aimed at President Trump ’ s inner circle , ” Nadler said . “ We know , from revelations earlier this week , that the President wanted to have ‘ his own people ’ in that office to help him with his personal and political needs . And we know that , time and time again , Bill Barr has reached into ongoing criminal investigations in order to protect the President from their consequences . ”
Meanwhile , Nadler issued subpoenas last week for Justice Department officials Aaron S.J . Zelinsky and John W. Elias , who had filed complaints about the “ unprecedented politicization ” at the DOJ under Barr ’ s leadership .
GRAHAM SAYS HE WO N'T ADVANCE TRUMP NOMINEE FOR SDNY PROSECUTOR WITHOUT SCHUMER , GILLIBRAND CONSENT
Nadler said the two DOJ officials will testify Wednesday and will “ explain why Barr ’ s attempt to fire Mr. Berman is part of a larger , ongoing , and wholly unacceptable pattern of conduct . ”
“ If the President removes Mr. Berman , then we will take additional steps to secure his testimony as well , ” Nadler said .
Nadler also said over the weekend that he is “ sure ” Berman will testify before Congress .
The calls to probe Berman ’ s ouster come after Barr , on Friday night , announced that he would be stepping down from his post at SDNY . Barr and the White House then announced that the president would nominate Jay Clayton , the current chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , to replace him .
But Berman put out a statement saying he learned of his “ departure ” from Barr ’ s press release and had no intention of leaving the job .
By Saturday , Barr , in a letter to Berman , informed him that the president had removed him from his post . Barr wrote that he asked Trump to fire Berman after his Friday night statement .
US ATTORNEY IN NEW YORK DISPUTES BARR CLAIM THAT HE 'S RESIGNING
Barr said Deputy U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss will take over until a permanent successor is in place .
Berman said he would leave `` immediately '' and expressed strong confidence that Strauss can lead the SDNY with integrity and independence .
Trump , however , distanced himself from Berman 's ouster Saturday as he left the White House for Tulsa , Okla. , and said it was Barr 's call .
`` That 's all up to the attorney general , '' Trump said when asked about Berman 's firing . `` Attorney General Barr is working on that . That 's his department , not my department . ”
The Southern District has pursued a number of Trump associates , including the president 's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen , who served a prison sentence for lying to Congress and campaign finance crimes . The office has also been investigating Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani ’ s business dealings , including whether he failed to register as a foreign agent , people familiar with the probe told The Associated Press .

""We have begun the process to issue that subpoena,"" Nadler, D-N.Y., said Monday night on MSNBC's ""The Rachel Maddow Show.”

DEMS SEIZE ON US ATTORNEY OUSTER TO PURSUE NEW PROBES, HEARINGS

The subpoena reportedly would compel Barr’s testimony on July 2.

The move comes as top congressional Democrats are calling for new probes and hearings concerning the Justice Department after Berman's ouster over the weekend.

Nadler previously said his panel would “immediately open an investigation” into the removal. President Trump apparently fired Berman after he refused to step down, though the president has since distanced himself from the process.

“Attorney General Bill Barr told us that Geoffrey Berman of the SDNY had resigned—which was untrue,” Nadler said in a statement. “Barr told us that the president asked him to fire Mr. Berman—which may also be untrue, given that the president says he had nothing to do with the decision.”

Nadler added: “The whole thing smacks of corruption and incompetence, which is what we have come to expect from this President and his Attorney General.”

Nadler noted that neither the White House nor the Justice Department offered an explanation for Berman’s removal.

“We know that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York is engaged in investigations aimed at President Trump’s inner circle,” Nadler said. “We know, from revelations earlier this week, that the President wanted to have ‘his own people’ in that office to help him with his personal and political needs. And we know that, time and time again, Bill Barr has reached into ongoing criminal investigations in order to protect the President from their consequences.”

Meanwhile, Nadler issued subpoenas last week for Justice Department officials Aaron S.J. Zelinsky and John W. Elias, who had filed complaints about the “unprecedented politicization” at the DOJ under Barr’s leadership.

GRAHAM SAYS HE WON'T ADVANCE TRUMP NOMINEE FOR SDNY PROSECUTOR WITHOUT SCHUMER, GILLIBRAND CONSENT

Nadler said the two DOJ officials will testify Wednesday and will “explain why Barr’s attempt to fire Mr. Berman is part of a larger, ongoing, and wholly unacceptable pattern of conduct.”

“If the President removes Mr. Berman, then we will take additional steps to secure his testimony as well,” Nadler said.

Nadler also said over the weekend that he is “sure” Berman will testify before Congress.

The calls to probe Berman’s ouster come after Barr, on Friday night, announced that he would be stepping down from his post at SDNY. Barr and the White House then announced that the president would nominate Jay Clayton, the current chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to replace him.

But Berman put out a statement saying he learned of his “departure” from Barr’s press release and had no intention of leaving the job.

By Saturday, Barr, in a letter to Berman, informed him that the president had removed him from his post. Barr wrote that he asked Trump to fire Berman after his Friday night statement.

US ATTORNEY IN NEW YORK DISPUTES BARR CLAIM THAT HE'S RESIGNING

Barr said Deputy U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss will take over until a permanent successor is in place.

Berman said he would leave ""immediately"" and expressed strong confidence that Strauss can lead the SDNY with integrity and independence.

Trump, however, distanced himself from Berman's ouster Saturday as he left the White House for Tulsa, Okla., and said it was Barr's call.

""That's all up to the attorney general,"" Trump said when asked about Berman's firing. ""Attorney General Barr is working on that. That's his department, not my department.”

The Southern District has pursued a number of Trump associates, including the president's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who served a prison sentence for lying to Congress and campaign finance crimes. The office has also been investigating Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s business dealings, including whether he failed to register as a foreign agent, people familiar with the probe told The Associated Press.

Berman recused himself from directly overseeing the Cohen investigation for reasons that were never disclosed.

Berman has also overseen the prosecution of two Florida businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were associates of Giuliani and tied to the Ukraine impeachment investigation. The men were charged in October with federal campaign finance violations, including hiding the origin of a $325,000 donation to a group supporting Trump’s reelection.

This year has already seen two record-breaking races. In Tennessee this month, three Supreme Court justices raised record sums to defeat a fierce and partisan drive to oust them.

That could make the confirmation process for a new attorney general exceedingly difficult.

“The biggest gripe against Sessions is his recusal,” O’Connell said.

“A lot of the other things that Sessions has done, particularly now that we have an investigation into the Clinton Foundation, I think that overall people are relatively happy with Sessions,” he said.

Some GOP officials believe Trump could move Pruitt or another Senate-confirmed senior administration official into the attorney’s job temporarily, but Trump would spark a firestorm if he skipped the Department of Justice’s line of succession, which would call for Rosenstein to replace Sessions.

One Senate Republican parliamentary expert said the president could not unilaterally appoint someone to fill the attorney general’s job permanently and with full power without Senate confirmation.",www.thehill.com,center,yAUZYqMZ7cSinuGn

What are the details?

According to the Journal, two of the memos Comey gave to lawyer friend Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia University, contain classified information. At the time, Comey redacted information in one memo he knew was classified, while passing on the other unredacted.

However, after Comey left the FBI in May 2017, bureau officials upgraded his second memo to ""confidential,"" the lowest level of classified information.

President Obama says `` Americans have a right to be angry ... and I am angry ''
The former acting IRS commissioner will testify before a House committee on Friday
The nation 's top tax collector resigned Wednesday amid controversy over Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups that applied for federal tax-exempt status .
The official , acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller , was aware employees were targeting conservative groups in May 2012 , according to the agency .
But Miller , then the agency 's deputy commissioner , did n't tell Congress about it when he testified before an oversight committee in July -- despite being questioned on the issue . He was named acting commissioner in November .
An administration official told CNN on Thursday that Obama will appoint a new acting commissioner this week .
Announcing the resignation to reporters Wednesday , President Barack Obama said the agency 's misconduct was `` inexcusable . ''
`` Americans have a right to be angry about it , and I 'm angry about it , '' Obama said .
`` It should not matter what political stripe you 're from . The fact of the matter is , the IRS has to operate with absolute integrity , '' the president said .

Obama pledged to work `` hand in hand '' with Congress as it investigates the matter , and vowed new safeguards will be put in place at the IRS so that `` this does n't happen again . ''
Despite his resignation , Miller is expected to testify Friday at a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee , according to a source familiar with the proceedings .
In an internal message to IRS employees obtained by CNN , Miller said he would be stepping down as commissioner in early June .
`` This has been an incredibly difficult time for the IRS given the events of the past few days , and there is a strong and immediate need to restore public trust in the nation 's tax agency , '' Miller wrote .
News of Miller 's resignation followed revelations that the IRS has identified two `` rogue '' employees in the agency 's Cincinnati office as being principally responsible for the `` overly aggressive '' handling of requests by conservative groups for tax-exempt status , a congressional source told CNN .
Miller said the staffers have already been disciplined , according to another source familiar with Miller 's discussions with congressional investigators . The second source said Miller emphasized that the problem with IRS handling of tax-exempt status for tea party groups was not limited to these two employees .
Miller met with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus of Montana on Tuesday to discuss an appearance before Congress .
Asked Wednesday in a Senate hallway about his meeting with Miller , Baucus told CNN , `` I did not learn as much from the meeting as I would have liked . ''
`` I told him that it was in his best interest to be totally cooperative -- that it 's often the cover-up that causes more problems than the original malfeasance , '' the senator said . `` And just to be totally straight with me and everybody , and he said he would . ''
Meanwhile , Republican congressional leaders on Wednesday accused Obama 's administration of potentially criminal behavior in the handling of requests for tax-exempt status from conservative groups .
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell suggested criminal behavior had occurred , saying that the `` very serious '' allegations involve `` an effort to bring the power of the federal government to bear on those the administration disagreed with in the middle of a heated national election . ''
`` It actually could be , could be criminal and we are determined to get the answers , '' McConnell said .
`` My question is , who 's going to jail over this scandal ? '' he asked .
Boehner told reporters that `` clearly someone violated the law '' in what an IRS inspector general 's report described as delayed processing of applications by groups associated with the political right wing .
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder , who ordered a criminal investigation into the situation , said Wednesday at a congressional hearing that investigators will look at the conduct of IRS offices nationwide .
`` The facts will take us where ever they take us , '' he said .
Holder said the investigation will also examine whether IRS officials lied to Congress about the singling out of conservative groups .
While the allegations originated in the Cincinnati office , the Justice Department inquiry is based out of Washington , Holder said .
The comments came as all 45 Senate Republicans sent the White House a letter that called for the administration to `` comply with all requests related to congressional inquiries without any delay '' involving the controversy .
The letter called the scandal `` yet another completely inexcusable attempt to chill the speech of political opponents and those who would question their government , consistent with a broader pattern of intimidation by arms of your administration to silence political dissent . ''
The clearly coordinated attacks were part of a GOP effort to increase pressure on the Obama administration over the controversy , one of three potential scandals that has the White House on the defensive less than four months into the president 's second term .
According to the report by the agency 's inspector general released Tuesday , the IRS developed and followed a faulty policy to determine whether the applicants were engaged in political activities , which would disqualify the groups from receiving tax-exempt status .
The controversial move began in early 2010 and continued for more than 18 months , the report said , declaring that `` the IRS used inappropriate criteria that identified for review Tea Party and other organizations applying for tax-exempt status based upon their names or policy positions instead of indications of potential political campaign intervention . ''
IRS officials , according to the report , did not consult anyone beyond the agency about the development of the additional screening criteria . They believed that the criteria they came up with were a screening shortcut meant to help with the influx of applications , the report said .
The controversial actions began after the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in the Citizens United case that greatly expanded the ability of corporations , unions and other organizations to participate in election spending , though not through direct contributions to candidates or parties .
After the ruling , the number of politically oriented groups seeking tax exempt status as social welfare organizations under section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) of the federal tax code increased greatly at a time when the federal government , including the IRS , was dealing with austerity measures that reduced or stagnated personnel and resources .
The IRS ' top watchdog found that the criteria used to flag potential political applications resulted in substantial delays and the request of unnecessary information from the groups .
Among the criteria used by IRS officials to flag applications was a `` Be On the Look Out '' list , which was discontinued in 2012 , according to the report .
-- Whether `` Tea Party , '' `` Patriots '' or `` 9/12 Project '' was referenced in the case file .
-- Whether the issues outlined in the application included government spending , government debt or taxes .

President Obama says ""Americans have a right to be angry ... and I am angry""

IRS identifies two ""rogue"" employees, congressional source says

The former acting IRS commissioner will testify before a House committee on Friday

The nation's top tax collector resigned Wednesday amid controversy over Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups that applied for federal tax-exempt status.

The official, acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller, was aware employees were targeting conservative groups in May 2012, according to the agency.

But Miller, then the agency's deputy commissioner, didn't tell Congress about it when he testified before an oversight committee in July -- despite being questioned on the issue. He was named acting commissioner in November.

An administration official told CNN on Thursday that Obama will appoint a new acting commissioner this week.

Announcing the resignation to reporters Wednesday, President Barack Obama said the agency's misconduct was ""inexcusable.""

""Americans have a right to be angry about it, and I'm angry about it,"" Obama said.

""It should not matter what political stripe you're from. The fact of the matter is, the IRS has to operate with absolute integrity,"" the president said.

Obama pledged to work ""hand in hand"" with Congress as it investigates the matter, and vowed new safeguards will be put in place at the IRS so that ""this doesn't happen again.""

Despite his resignation, Miller is expected to testify Friday at a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee, according to a source familiar with the proceedings.

In an internal message to IRS employees obtained by CNN, Miller said he would be stepping down as commissioner in early June.

""This has been an incredibly difficult time for the IRS given the events of the past few days, and there is a strong and immediate need to restore public trust in the nation's tax agency,"" Miller wrote.

'Rogue' employees

News of Miller's resignation followed revelations that the IRS has identified two ""rogue"" employees in the agency's Cincinnati office as being principally responsible for the ""overly aggressive"" handling of requests by conservative groups for tax-exempt status, a congressional source told CNN.

Miller said the staffers have already been disciplined, according to another source familiar with Miller's discussions with congressional investigators. The second source said Miller emphasized that the problem with IRS handling of tax-exempt status for tea party groups was not limited to these two employees.

Miller met with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus of Montana on Tuesday to discuss an appearance before Congress.

Asked Wednesday in a Senate hallway about his meeting with Miller, Baucus told CNN, ""I did not learn as much from the meeting as I would have liked.""

""I told him that it was in his best interest to be totally cooperative -- that it's often the cover-up that causes more problems than the original malfeasance,"" the senator said. ""And just to be totally straight with me and everybody, and he said he would.""

Meanwhile, Republican congressional leaders on Wednesday accused Obama's administration of potentially criminal behavior in the handling of requests for tax-exempt status from conservative groups.

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell suggested criminal behavior had occurred, saying that the ""very serious"" allegations involve ""an effort to bring the power of the federal government to bear on those the administration disagreed with in the middle of a heated national election.""

""It actually could be, could be criminal and we are determined to get the answers,"" McConnell said.

House Speaker John Boehner was more definitive.

""My question is, who's going to jail over this scandal?"" he asked.

Boehner told reporters that ""clearly someone violated the law"" in what an IRS inspector general's report described as delayed processing of applications by groups associated with the political right wing.

Multiple investigations

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who ordered a criminal investigation into the situation, said Wednesday at a congressional hearing that investigators will look at the conduct of IRS offices nationwide.

""The facts will take us where ever they take us,"" he said.

Holder said the investigation will also examine whether IRS officials lied to Congress about the singling out of conservative groups.

While the allegations originated in the Cincinnati office, the Justice Department inquiry is based out of Washington, Holder said.

The comments came as all 45 Senate Republicans sent the White House a letter that called for the administration to ""comply with all requests related to congressional inquiries without any delay"" involving the controversy.

The letter called the scandal ""yet another completely inexcusable attempt to chill the speech of political opponents and those who would question their government, consistent with a broader pattern of intimidation by arms of your administration to silence political dissent.""

The clearly coordinated attacks were part of a GOP effort to increase pressure on the Obama administration over the controversy, one of three potential scandals that has the White House on the defensive less than four months into the president's second term.

According to the report by the agency's inspector general released Tuesday , the IRS developed and followed a faulty policy to determine whether the applicants were engaged in political activities, which would disqualify the groups from receiving tax-exempt status.

The controversial move began in early 2010 and continued for more than 18 months, the report said, declaring that ""the IRS used inappropriate criteria that identified for review Tea Party and other organizations applying for tax-exempt status based upon their names or policy positions instead of indications of potential political campaign intervention.""

IRS officials, according to the report, did not consult anyone beyond the agency about the development of the additional screening criteria. They believed that the criteria they came up with were a screening shortcut meant to help with the influx of applications, the report said.

The controversial actions began after the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in the Citizens United case that greatly expanded the ability of corporations, unions and other organizations to participate in election spending, though not through direct contributions to candidates or parties.

After the ruling, the number of politically oriented groups seeking tax exempt status as social welfare organizations under section 501 (c) (4) of the federal tax code increased greatly at a time when the federal government, including the IRS, was dealing with austerity measures that reduced or stagnated personnel and resources.

The IRS' top watchdog found that the criteria used to flag potential political applications resulted in substantial delays and the request of unnecessary information from the groups.

'Be On the Look Out'

Among the criteria used by IRS officials to flag applications was a ""Be On the Look Out"" list, which was discontinued in 2012, according to the report.

The criteria included:

-- Whether ""Tea Party,"" ""Patriots"" or ""9/12 Project"" was referenced in the case file.

-- Whether the issues outlined in the application included government spending, government debt or taxes.

-- Whether there was advocating or lobbying to ""make America a better place to live.""

-- Whether a statement in the case file criticized how the country is being run.

-- Whether it advocated education about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

The investigation by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration was initiated after congressional complaints began to surface in the media in 2012 that the IRS was targeting conservative groups and holding up applications.

""Whether the inappropriate criterion was shorthand for all potential political cases or not, developing and using criteria that focuses on organization names and policy positions instead of the activities permitted under the Treasury regulations does not promote public confidence that tax-exempt laws are being adhered to impartially,"" the report said.

The IRS welcomed the report, saying that it agreed that aspects of its original approach in handling the influx of tax-exempt applications was inappropriate.

""The IRS is required by law to determine if organizations are engaging in a legally permissible level of political activity. Centralizing these cases was necessary to achieve consistent treatment,"" it said in a statement.

Inefficient management

In a written response included in the report, the IRS commissioner of the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division said there was no criminal behavior behind the actions of the agents, but rather inefficient management.

""We believe the front-line career employees that made the decisions acted out of a desire for efficiency and not out of any political and partisan viewpoint,"" the commissioner wrote.

The report's findings indicate that of the 298 cases reviewed by the IRS inspector general as potential political cases not eligible for tax exempt status: 72 contained the name ""tea party,"" 11 contained ""9/12"" and 13 contained the word ""patriots,"" according to the report. There were 202 cases that did not contain any such reference.

Of those applications still open for review, 160 cases were open from 206 days to more than three years -- through two election cycles.

Among the recommendations made by the Treasury inspector general: The IRS must better document reasons why applications are chosen for review, develop a process to track requests for assistance, develop and provide training to employees before each election cycle and immediately resolve outstanding cases.

In his first interview since the conclusion of the special counsel ’ s investigation , Mr. Rosenstein beat back suggestions that Mr. Barr is trying to mislead the public by releasing only a four-page summary of Robert Mueller ’ s investigation . The attorney general in that letter said the Mueller probe found President Trump and his campaign didn ’ t conspire with Russian interference in the 2016 election but reached no conclusion about whether the president obstructed justice . With the absence of a recommendation , Mr. Barr and Mr. Rosenstein determined Mr. Trump ’ s actions weren ’ t criminal .

“ He ’ s being as forthcoming as he can , and so this notion that he ’ s trying to mislead people , I think is just completely bizarre , ” Mr. Rosenstein said .
Mr. Barr is under intense pressure to quickly produce the edited report amid concerns from Democrats that the attorney general , a longtime advocate of executive-branch authority , is seeking to protect the president from politically damaging information the report may contain . Their worries were heightened after reports that some investigators on Mr. Mueller ’ s team had told associates in recent days that they believe the report is more critical of Mr. Trump on the obstruction issue than Mr. Barr indicated in his summary . Mr. Rosenstein wouldn ’ t say why Mr. Mueller rendered no conclusion on that critical question .
“ It would be one thing if you put out a letter and said , ‘ I ’ m not going to give you the report , ’ ” Mr. Rosenstein said . “ What he said is , ‘ Look , it ’ s going to take a while to process the report .

Mr. Rosenstein wouldn ’ t say how it was going , only that the public should have “ tremendous confidence ” in Mr. Barr .
The rare interview in Mr. Rosenstein ’ s fourth-floor office at the Justice Department came in his waning days on the job , with the special counsel investigation he oversaw now complete and Mr. Trump ’ s nominee to replace him , Deputy Transportation Secretary Jeffrey Rosen , awaiting confirmation by the Senate . After nearly 30 years in the department , Mr. Rosenstein , 54 years old , said he doesn ’ t know what he will do next , only that he hopes to start a new job at the end of the summer .
His remarks came one day after Mr. Barr said he would form a team to examine the origins of a 2016 counterintelligence investigation that conducted what he termed as “ spying ” on people associated with the Trump campaign , a characterization Democrats and some former Justice Department officials , including fired Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey , found disturbing .
Speaking at a conference in San Francisco on Thursday , Mr. Comey said , “ When I hear that kind of language used , it ’ s concerning , because the FBI and Department of Justice conduct court-ordered electronic surveillance . I have never thought of that as spying . ”
It isn ’ t known whether Mr. Barr ’ s review will examine any of Mr. Rosenstein ’ s actions , namely that he approved an application to ask a court to grant continued surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page , who had long been on the radar of U.S. counterintelligence for his communications with Russians .

IRS hearing: The takeaways

The ousted head of the IRS was grilled for four hours Friday, but we still don’t know how the tea party targeting really started.

What we do know from the first hearing since the scandal broke: IRS officials haven’t convinced lawmakers they played it straight with Congress. It’s not over for the IRS workers. And witnesses are being beat up too much for these to be “just the facts” hearings.

Story Continued Below

Here are the top takeaways from Friday’s hearing:

How’d this really start: Who knows?

The big question that’s on everyone’s mind didn’t get answered during the House Ways and Means Committee hearing Friday: Who, exactly, had the bright idea at the IRS to zero in on conservative groups with search terms like “tea party” and “patriot”?

Lawmakers asked Steven Miller, the acting IRS commissioner who has since been forced to resign, to detail how the targeting program began — but his answers didn’t clear up what happened or why.

Miller said a spike in nonprofit applications after the Citizens United case forced agents to centralize its review process. Those employees created the search terms to flag applications, Miller said.

No new news there.

Miller and inspector general J. Russell George both denied that there were political motives behind the extra review given to conservative groups.

“My understanding is that the cases that went into this queue included groups from across the political spectrum,” Miller said.

But under questioning from Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Miller said agents did not create search terms more commonly associated with liberal groups like “progress” or “organizing.”

More — and broader — hearings are coming

Committee Chairman Dave Camp is already expanding the scope of the hearings beyond the targeting scandal.

He’s also drawing in other IRS actions that have had conservatives stewing for a long time — like a March 2012 Huffington Post story that he says disclosed confidential donor information for the National Organization for Marriage.

And he cited a ProPublica article that said the IRS had leaked the applications conservative groups had submitted for tax-exempt status.

“It would be a mistake to treat this as just one scandal,” Camp said.

Jim Gerlach of Pennsylvania picked up on that theme during the hearing, asking Miller about the National Organization for Marriage leak as well as the possible sharing of confidential tax information with the White House.

When Miller said he didn’t know about that, Gerlach asked him — in a tone that made it clear it wasn’t optional — to “check all of your records, all of your notes, all of your emails and get back to this committee.”

Sure, Democrats want everyone to know they’re outraged too. But so far, they’re not demanding that President Barack Obama do more — at least not in public. They’re perfectly happy to take it out on the IRS.

Updated Monday 5/27 3:00 a.m. ET

(CNN)– The parent company of Fox News was aware years ago that the Justice Department was targeting one of its reporters in a leak investigation, sources said.

One law enforcement source said the Justice Department notified a media organization three years ago of a subpoena for detailed telephone records, and a second told CNN that organization was Fox News.



After that news broke, a Fox News executive said the Justice Department notified Fox's parent company News Corporation of the subpoena in May 2010. But Fox News itself apparently never got the word.

The subpoena came as the Justice Department was investigating Stephen Kim, a former State Department worker accused of the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information to James Rosen, a Fox News reporter.

It is standard procedure for Justice Department officials to notify news organizations when they subpoena an outlet or its reporters.

CNN and other media outlets have previously reported a separate Justice Department query into Rosen's e-mails. With the approval of Attorney General Eric Holder, Justice officials obtained a warrant from a federal judge to access Rosen's e-mails.

While Fox News is now acknowledging that the Justice Department notified its parent company about the phone records search, that notice apparently did not include anything about the separate search of Rosen's e-mail.

""In the investigation that led to the indictment of Stephen Kim, the government issued subpoenas for toll records for five phone numbers associated with the media,"" a law enforcement source told CNN. ""Consistent with Department of Justice policies and procedures, the government provided notification of those subpoenas nearly three years ago by certified mail, facsimile and e-mail.""

News Corporation spokesman Nathaniel Brown responded Sunday night in a carefully worded statement.

“While we don't take issue with the DOJ's account that they sent a notice to News Corp, we do not have a record of ever having received it,” Brown said. “We are looking into this matter.”

In a New York Times article, Lawrence A. Jacobs, a former chief legal officer for News Corporation, said he never saw a notification about the phone records. He left the post in June 2011.

“I would have remembered getting a fax from the Justice Department,” Jacobs told the Times in an interview on Sunday. “These are not the kinds of things that happen every day.”

Fox has said it learned of the warrant for e-mails only recently, and newly released court documents show the government was trying to keep the investigation under seal. The network did not disclose to its viewers that the phone records had been subpoenaed.

The government's notice did not detail the extent of the investigation, in which the government labeled Rosen a possible co-conspirator. An FBI affidavit used to obtain the warrant for Rosen's e-mails described him as potentially being an ""aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator"" to the crime of disclosing government secrets.

The Justice Department has come under scrutiny this month as news broke of two government probes into reporters' records. Besides the Rosen case, the Associated Press announced the department had dug into the phone records of its reporters, including work, cell, and home lines.

More than 1,690 federal inmates have qualified for release under the resentencing provisions of the law , and nearly 1,100 have already walked free , the official said .

The Department of Justice revealed Wednesday that the whistleblower complaint related to President Trump 's controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president sparked a referral to the DOJ 's criminal division about whether Trump potentially violated campaign finance law .
However , the criminal division , after reviewing the matter , determined there was no campaign finance violation and `` has concluded the matter , '' a DOJ spokesperson Kerri Kupec said Wednesday . The news comes as Trump faces an impeachment inquiry in the House and a growing number of House Democrats who support such an investigation .
A Justice Department official told reporters that the DOJ spoke to `` knowledgeable people in the White House '' but their determination that there was no criminal violation was primarily based off a memorandum of the call , released by the White House . Questions regarding the Trump Administration 's hold-up of military aid was not a factor in their investigation at all , the official explained , saying they see that as more of a foreign policy issue .
Further explaining the DOJ 's handling of the referral , the official said the criminal division concluded that the information they had gathered did not amount to a criminal violation of campaign finance law because nothing `` of value '' was clearly promised or exchange as a result of the call .
The official said there was no disagreement among the prosecutors in the criminal division , even among career prosecutors , that the call did not amount to a potential campaign finance violation . The Assistant AG for the Criminal Division made the `` final call '' to conclude the matter , and said Attorney General William Barr was `` not involved in the analysis by the criminal division . '' There was no consideration for the AG to formally recuse himself from the matter , the official said , and no consideration of the appointment of a special counsel .
And the DOJ 's Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) opinion that a sitting president could not be indicted did not play a role in the DOJ 's review , the officials said .

According to an opinion drafted by the OLC in this case , the DNI Inspector General Michael Atkinson [ ICIG ] believed the whistleblower constituted a potential `` urgent concern '' related to whether the president was illegally soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 election .
`` According to the ICIG , statements made by the President during the call could be viewed as soliciting a foreign campaign contribution in violation of the campaign-finance laws , '' the OLC opinion said . `` In the ICIG ’ s view , the complaint addresses an “ urgent concern ” for purposes of triggering statutory procedures that require expedited reporting of agency misconduct to the congressional intelligence committees . ''
In the memorandum of the call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy , Trump repeatedly invoked Barr , saying he would have him , along with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani , get in touch with Zelenskiy to investigate how Ukraine may have been involved in the origins of the Russia investigation before turning to press him on investigating former Vice President Joe Biden 's son , Hunter .
In 2014 , the former vice president pushed for the dismissal of a top Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating an oil company that had taken on Biden 's son as a board member . Joe Biden has denied wrongdoing and other international leaders have suggested that his move was appropriate .
`` There 's a lot of talk about Biden 's son , that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that , '' Trump said , according to the memorandum of the call , which is not verbatim . `` So whatever you can do with the attorney general that could be great . ''
The Ukrainian president responded by assuring Trump that a new prosecutor would `` look into the situation . ''
`` He or she will look into the situation , specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue , '' he said , according to the memo .
`` I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it , '' Trump promised , according to the memo .
In the same breath , Trump assures Zelenskiy `` your economy is going to get better and better I predict , '' the memo says .
In a statement , the DOJ spokesperson , Kupec said that the president never followed through in contacting Barr about the matter .
`` The President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son , '' Kupec said . `` The President has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine – on this or any other matter . The Attorney General has not communicated with Ukraine – on this or any other subject . Nor has the Attorney General discussed this matter , or anything relating to Ukraine , with Rudy Giuliani . ''
DOJ officials also said that AG Barr has never been instructed by the president or anyone in the White House to investigate Biden .
The OLC opinion released by DOJ noted the complainant heard from `` unnamed White House officials '' about the call between Trump and Zelenskiy rather than having first-hand information . It said that after the DNI inspector general reviewed the complaint he `` found 'some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate , '' but `` concluded that the complaint 's allegations nonetheless appeared credible . ''
The OLC notes it did not evaluate whether the call was concerning , but reasoned it did not require reporting to Congress because Trump is not a member of the intelligence community and the complaint involved potentially privileged communications .","Trump's DOJ clears president of violating campaign finance law in Ukraine-Biden call The Department of Justice determined the call didn't run afoul of the law.

""According to the ICIG, statements made by the President during the call could be viewed as soliciting a foreign campaign contribution in violation of the campaign-finance laws,"" the OLC opinion said. ""In the ICIG’s view, the complaint addresses an “urgent concern” for purposes of triggering statutory procedures that require expedited reporting of agency misconduct to the congressional intelligence committees.""

In the memorandum of the call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump repeatedly invoked Barr, saying he would have him, along with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, get in touch with Zelenskiy to investigate how Ukraine may have been involved in the origins of the Russia investigation before turning to press him on investigating former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter.

In 2014, the former vice president pushed for the dismissal of a top Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating an oil company that had taken on Biden's son as a board member. Joe Biden has denied wrongdoing and other international leaders have suggested that his move was appropriate.

""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that,"" Trump said, according to the memorandum of the call, which is not verbatim. ""So whatever you can do with the attorney general that could be great.""

The Ukrainian president responded by assuring Trump that a new prosecutor would ""look into the situation.""

""He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue,"" he said, according to the memo.

""I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it,"" Trump promised, according to the memo.

In the same breath, Trump assures Zelenskiy ""your economy is going to get better and better I predict,"" the memo says.

In a statement, the DOJ spokesperson, Kupec said that the president never followed through in contacting Barr about the matter.

""The President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son,"" Kupec said. ""The President has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine – on this or any other matter. The Attorney General has not communicated with Ukraine – on this or any other subject. Nor has the Attorney General discussed this matter, or anything relating to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani.""

DOJ officials also said that AG Barr has never been instructed by the president or anyone in the White House to investigate Biden.

The OLC opinion released by DOJ noted the complainant heard from ""unnamed White House officials"" about the call between Trump and Zelenskiy rather than having first-hand information. It said that after the DNI inspector general reviewed the complaint he ""found 'some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,"" but ""concluded that the complaint's allegations nonetheless appeared credible.""

The OLC notes it did not evaluate whether the call was concerning, but reasoned it did not require reporting to Congress because Trump is not a member of the intelligence community and the complaint involved potentially privileged communications.",www.abcnews.go.com,left,PQRZamBn7jGMYyVS

A classic Washington scandal is unfolding — complete with accusations of lies, abuse of power and questions about coverups.

To add to the intrigue, it involves one of the most hated government agencies: the Internal Revenue Service.

Story Continued Below

It all started Friday, when an IRS official — in an apparently off-handed remark — acknowledged and apologized for wrongly targeting conservative groups seeking nonprofit status.

( Also on POLITICO: IRS knew of tea party targeting)

A firestorm quickly ensued and only deepened over the weekend with revelations that senior IRS officials have known about the targeting practice for several years. Republicans, meanwhile, are calling for additional investigations.

Here are five big questions on the rapidly evolving scandal:

1. What did senior IRS officials know; when did they know it; and were any laws broken?

This is what’s clear: Low-level employees in the IRS’s Cincinnati office began flagging conservative groups as early as 2010, according to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Lois Lerner, who directs the agency’s tax-exempt groups unit, said applications were scrutinized if they included words such as “patriot” or “tea party.”

( Also on POLITICO: Bill would penalize IRS lawbreakers)

For now, it appears that the Cincinnati employees took the initiative on their own to start flagging the applications. Lerner has vehemently dismissed GOP accusations that political motivations fueled the program.

She said the IRS often centralizes applications that need more study when there’s a sudden growth in similar requests for nonprofit status, but that process wasn’t carried out appropriately this time.

Ultimately, about 75 groups were subjected to additional review.

Lerner has so far declined to say when she first learned of the targeting practice and told reporters on Friday she didn’t remember when she notified her bosses.

( Also on POLITICO: GOP outrage at IRS grows)

But a TIGTA report due out this week will say that senior IRS officials knew about the activities as early as 2011. That would seem to contradict testimony then-IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman provided to Congress in 2012 when he told lawmakers that the agency wasn’t providing extra scrutiny to groups because of their political affiliations.

Meanwhile, the details of what the IRS was after are becoming more clear. Lerner said that some of the groups, for instance, were asked for member or donor lists, which isn’t a typical IRS practice.

Lerner said it’s not illegal for the IRS to flag groups for extra review when the agency notices a spike in applications from the same type of organizations.

2. What does this mean for the Obama administration?

The IRS developments couldn’t come at a worse time for the White House, which has spent months courting GOP support for everything from gun control to an overhaul of immigration laws.

If the administration’s recent GOP charm offensive bought any goodwill, it seems to be on short supply now.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) is exactly the type of moderate lawmaker who might support the administration’s policy goals. But she made clear on Sunday that she isn’t pleased with how the White House — and President Barack Obama in particular — is handling the IRS debacle.

“I think that it’s very disappointing the president hasn’t personally condemned this and spoken out,” Collins said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “The president needs to make it crystal clear that this is totally unacceptable in America.”

Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has called for Obama to order a “transparent, governmentwide review” to see if similar practices are happening elsewhere in the administration.",www.politico.com,left,XB6PalKxq57oVN3V

New Documents Show A Pattern Of Harassment At The Department.,,Zoe Tillman,"Documents and interviews reveal new details about a pattern of sexual harassment by a senior Justice Department official , and what the department did — and did not do — in the year since he resigned .
WASHINGTON — In December 2018 , the Justice Department ’ s inspector general dropped a bombshell : Investigators had “ substantiated ” allegations that a senior DOJ official was a repeat sexual harasser . The official , who had retired by that point , harassed five women under his chain of command , the inspector general announced . One woman reported that she was not only harassed , but also sexually assaulted . Another woman reported that she was pressured into having sex to get a promotion . Few details were available at the time . The inspector general ’ s summary of the investigation was barely two pages . The official had worked in the Office of Justice Programs , an arm of the Justice Department that partners with federal , state , and local law enforcement , but he wasn ’ t identified . The summary didn ’ t specify what the women accused him of doing or the time period . Because the official had left the department , there wouldn ’ t be any internal disciplinary process . No criminal charges were filed . Nearly 10 months later , ███ obtained a copy of the inspector general ’ s full report . The 12-page document is redacted but includes a slew of new information , including detailed accounts from two of the women who described a pattern of escalating workplace harassment , as well as investigators ’ findings that the former official “ lacked credibility ” and provided “ conflicting testimony. ” The former official ’ s name is redacted in the inspector general ’ s report , but ███ previously identified him as Edison Aponte , who had worked at DOJ since 1994 , according to a Justice Department spokesperson . Aponte ’ s most recent title was associate deputy director in the Bureau of Justice Assistance , a section within the Office of Justice Programs that provides law enforcement training and grants — including , several sources noted , on issues related to victims of sexual assault and domestic violence .
“ It boggles the mind , ” said Jon Adler , who took over as the head of the Bureau of Justice Assistance in late 2017 . By then , the inspector general ’ s investigation was underway and Aponte had been placed on leave . A source with firsthand knowledge of the investigation originally confirmed Aponte ’ s identity to ███ in December . Reached by phone in December , Aponte said he could not confirm the inspector general ’ s report was about him and hung up . Since then , four current and former Office of Justice Programs employees with firsthand knowledge of the investigation have confirmed that the official described in the inspector general ’ s report is Aponte . ███ also reviewed documents that refer to events described in the report that name him . Aponte did not respond to multiple attempts to reach him for comment in the past month . One woman told the inspector general ’ s office that Aponte ’ s behavior began with inappropriate comments and unwanted touching — she said she put a mirror in her cubicle because he would come up behind her and rub her shoulders — and said he eventually raped her . Aponte denied the assault , but told investigators they had sex .
Another woman told investigators that it started with suggestive comments over drinks . Aponte once took her to a topless bar and asked her what sexual positions she liked , she said . She later felt pressured into a sexual relationship to secure a promotion ; he knew she was struggling financially , she said . Aponte denied that relationship . A third woman told investigators she engaged in a consensual sexual relationship with Aponte . The inspector general concluded that the relationship was still harassment because he was her supervisor ; he should have notified his superior about the relationship and stepped aside as the women ’ s supervisor to avoid even the appearance of a “ loss of impartiality , ” but failed to do so , according to the report . Two other women reported “ uncomfortable ” encounters with him . One of the women who reported being harassed — the one who said he pressured her to have sex in order to get a promotion — received a financial settlement from the Justice Department , a source with firsthand knowledge of the agreement told ███ . The woman and her lawyer declined an interview request .
`` They didn ’ t do anything when I went to them . ... They protected him and they allowed it . ''
The woman who reported that Aponte sexually harassed and raped her agreed to speak with ███ on the condition that she only be identified by her initials , S.C. She said she felt ignored and abandoned by department officials after she first reported being harassed by him in 2012 . She ’ s still angry about how the department handled her situation , and said the fact that Aponte is gone and the inspector general made a public finding of wrongdoing wasn ’ t a satisfying resolution .
“ What he did to those other people , management allowed to have happened — because they didn ’ t do anything when I went to them . They allowed that . They protected him and they allowed it , ” she said . The report doesn ’ t say what happened in the year after the investigation ended , but ███ reviewed documents and interviewed sources inside the department that fill in the timeline . A senior human resources manager told the employees union in January that new “ mandatory ” sexual harassment training for all Office of Justice Programs employees would begin in the spring and that management would consult with the union on a new sexual harassment policy . However , three sources — a union official , a former senior official at OJP , and a current employee — told ███ that none of that has happened to date . A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment . Sexual harassment hasn ’ t just been a problem in one office at the Justice Department . In May 2017 , the inspector general ’ s office alerted then–deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein to “ potential systemic issues ” across DOJ . From 2012 to 2016 , for instance , the inspector general released summaries of 19 substantiated complaints that included sexual misconduct and either involved high-level DOJ officials or were otherwise of “ significant public interest. ” Those and other internal investigations highlighted problems with how sexual harassment was being tracked and punished , the inspector general told Rosenstein . A year later , Rosenstein issued a memo directing every office to follow new guidelines for how to address sexual harassment . The memo outlined “ guiding principles ” for harassment policies and how to punish misconduct . All offices were given 90 days to come up with a system to track complaints . In a June letter to the US Commission on Civil Rights , which has been reviewing sexual harassment in the federal government , the Justice Department ’ s Gender Equality Network ( DOJ GEN ) , an employee group , said it was “ encouraged ” by Rosenstein ’ s memo , but it wasn ’ t enough . “ DOJ GEN believes DOJ must do more to strengthen its sexual harassment and misconduct policies and to ensure that DOJ employees who experience sexual harassment or misconduct are not dismissed and ignored , ” the group wrote . Representatives of DOJ GEN declined to comment .
The inspector general ’ s office began its investigation into Aponte after receiving information in March 2017 from the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees 2830 , the union that represents Office of Justice Programs employees . Aponte was placed on administrative leave at that time , according to a department spokesperson . The report was finished in late October 2018 , just over a month before the office publicly announced its summary of the investigation on Dec. 4 , 2018 .
Nearly 10 months after ███ filed a public records request for the full report , the inspector general ’ s office produced it in late September . The office withheld certain information , citing privacy concerns , so the full extent of what investigators learned remains secret . The unredacted sections of the report don ’ t include dates , so there ’ s no definite timeline for when the harassment alleged by each of the women began . The report is divided into sections detailing each woman ’ s account . The first woman provided a letter to investigators describing a sexual relationship with Aponte and indicated that he was her supervisor throughout that relationship . Aponte initially told the inspector general ’ s office he didn ’ t have a sexual relationship with the woman , but when confronted with information from her letter , he admitted it . “ [ REDACTED ] admitted to the OIG that he exercised bad judgment , especially in view of his position as an [ REDACTED ] , ” according to the report , an apparent reference to Aponte ’ s position as a senior manager . “ [ REDACTED ] admitted that he should not have been involved with his female subordinates in any way that would appear that he was violating ethical rules . [ REDACTED ] admitted further that he had inappropriate relationships with subordinates , and that his communications with them were unprofessional. ” The second woman described in the inspector general ’ s report was S.C. , who fell under Aponte ’ s chain of command in the Bureau of Justice Assistance . She told investigators and , later , ███ that she tried to discourage sexual advances from Aponte , which included repeatedly asking her about her dating life and uninvited touching — she was the one who said she put up a mirror at her desk to deal with unwanted back rubs from Aponte . S.C. also told investigators that Aponte once sexually assaulted her . She said that Aponte followed her home after they had gone as part of a group to an unspecified sports event , and asked to come inside to use the bathroom and for a tour . According to the report , she said that when she rejected his attempts to touch her , he became “ forceful ” and “ sexually assaulted her by having sexual intercourse with her. ” Aponte initially denied any sexual relationship with S.C. , but he later said he ’ d had sex with her while he was her supervisor , according to the report . He denied assaulting her . The report noted that no criminal charges were filed against Aponte . S.C. told ███ that she decided not to go to the police because she didn ’ t want to bring attention to herself or her family . Throughout the interview , S.C. also described being concerned about hurting Aponte ’ s family . The inspector general ’ s description of the third woman ’ s account was brief , and the redactions make it hard to know what exactly happened . Still , the report appears to show that the incident involved Aponte showing a photo to other people and that it made her feel “ very uncomfortable. ” The fourth woman told investigators that Aponte knew she was “ struggling financially ” and that she hoped for a promotion . She said she accepted his invitations for several months to get drinks outside of work — on one occasion , she said , he took her to a topless bar , and after asking her about what sexual positions she liked , she told him to “ go to hell and left. ” Aponte told investigators he didn ’ t remember the incident . At a Christmas party some time later , the woman told investigators that Aponte talked to her about getting funding soon for new positions . When he said he wanted to take her to a bar , she “ felt she had no other choice but to go to the bar with [ REDACTED ] because [ REDACTED ] promotion was near and she desperately wanted the promotion. ” After they left the bar , the woman said Aponte drove to a dark area , parked , and kissed and groped her . She said she pushed him away . “ [ REDACTED ] stated that [ REDACTED ] started talking about the [ REDACTED ] promotions and at the end of the conversation [ LONGER REDACTED SECTION ] , ” the report stated . “ [ REDACTED ] stated that she felt if she did not [ REDACTED ] with [ REDACTED ] then she would not receive her promotion [ LONGER REDACTED SECTION ] . ” Aponte told the inspector general ’ s office that he didn ’ t interact with the woman at all that evening and also didn ’ t recall going out for drinks with her , taking her to a topless bar , or asking her about sexual positions . Eventually , she said , she felt pressured into having sex with Aponte in order to get the promotion , and described two incidents — once after he drove her home during a snowstorm , and once after they had gotten drinks and he parked on a dead-end street — in the period leading up to her being considered for the new job . She said Aponte helped her prepare for the interview , including giving her interview questions in advance , and that she ultimately received the promotion . Aponte denied having sex with her and denied helping her with the interview . He claimed he was being targeted because the woman ’ s request to work remotely had been denied . She reported to investigators that Aponte indicated he had personal information about her and where she lived , and she feared he was threatening her and might try to demand sex again in the future . Marilyn Moses , president of the Office of Justice Programs employees union , told ███ that the woman who reported being pressured into having sex with Aponte in exchange for a promotion received a monetary settlement from the department . Moses declined to specify the amount or share additional details . The woman and her lawyer declined an interview request . The fifth and final woman ’ s account was brief . Most of the details were redacted in the report , but it involved an elevator encounter that made the woman feel “ very uncomfortable. ” Aponte told investigators he didn ’ t remember the incident .
The inspector general ’ s office concluded that the women who reported Aponte were “ credible witnesses. ” The information they provided was “ detailed and specific , ” according to the report , and there wasn ’ t evidence that they ’ d consulted with each other before giving investigators accounts of similar bad behavior by Aponte .
Investigators found that Aponte , on the other hand , “ lacked credibility. ” “ He initially denied any relationship with [ REDACTED ] and [ REDACTED ] , but when confronted with evidence , admitted to having had sexual contact with both subordinates , ” the inspector general ’ s office said in its report . “ He also persistently minimized his misconduct and failed to demonstrate any recognition or appreciation for the seriousness of his actions as a senior manager. ” The report included information about S.C. ’ s efforts to report Aponte to management , but much of it is redacted . According to S.C. ’ s interview with ███ and documents prepared by the employees union in 2013 , she first told a senior Office of Justice Programs official in 2012 that Aponte sexually harassed her . She said she was asked if she wanted to make a formal complaint , but declined because she didn ’ t want to hurt Aponte ’ s family or her own ; Moses said there was no requirement that employees make a formal complaint for management to take action . S.C. said she asked to be transferred to a different department so she wouldn ’ t have to see him , but management refused .
`` I work at the Justice Department and I manage grants to prevent things like this . ''
“ I just was like , so this is what happens ? I work at the Justice Department and I manage grants to prevent things like this , I go to shelters , I meet women that deal with these types of things , and I ’ m dealing with this and I work for the United States government and I ’ ve done nothing wrong ? ” S.C. said .
S.C. told ███ that in addition to unwanted touching , Aponte engaged in other harassing behavior , including commenting on her clothes , taking her phone and going through text messages and photos — she said she started hiding her phone — and questioning why she was wearing makeup , and if it was because she was going on a date . She said they had been friends , so when he made the occasional inappropriate comment early on , she didn ’ t think there was a problem . “ I ’ m the type of person that when I get uncomfortable , I tend to laugh it off and ... I don ’ t like to make other people feel uncomfortable . And that is my biggest downfall , ” S.C. said . “ Even if he said , ‘ Oh , you look good in those pants , ’ or whatever , I would be like , ‘ Shut up , Ed , ’ and I would laugh it off , you know , and just walk out of his office. ” S.C. told the inspector general ’ s office and ███ that Aponte sexually assaulted her , but did not tell DOJ management . She declined to discuss the details of the assault with ███ , saying it was too painful , but did confirm that it happened after a sporting event . Other documents reviewed by ███ show that senior officials at DOJ were put on notice about S.C. ’ s harassment claims against Aponte over several years . In 2013 , when S.C. was facing disciplinary action for allegedly being absent from work without approval , the union sent a letter to management defending her and arguing she was facing retaliation for reporting Aponte the year before , as well as for using leave she was entitled to take under federal law . S.C. was fired in 2014 . In August 2015 , Moses sent a letter to Loretta Lynch , who had just become the US attorney general , alerting her that an employee had reported “ unwanted sexual advances ” by Aponte . The letter didn ’ t name S.C. , but the description of events matches the 2013 union letter . Moses told Lynch that management notified Aponte about the complaint and he denied it , and she questioned the lack of further investigation by officials . Both the 2015 letter to Lynch and the union ’ s 2013 letter defending S.C. against disciplinary action named Aponte . “ In a world where we assess the cost of everything , granting [ S.C. ] ’ s request for a transfer was a no cost solution that would have satisfied her . It would have also bought time for management to thoroughly investigate her claim and potentially prevent further harassment of others , ” Moses wrote in an email to ███ . “ Ultimately management 's inaction over the years has exacted an enormous financial and emotional toll on his victims and all involved in this shameful situation . ”","Documents and interviews reveal new details about a pattern of sexual harassment by a senior Justice Department official, and what the department did — and did not do — in the year since he resigned.

WASHINGTON — In December 2018, the Justice Department’s inspector general dropped a bombshell: Investigators had “substantiated” allegations that a senior DOJ official was a repeat sexual harasser. The official, who had retired by that point, harassed five women under his chain of command, the inspector general announced. One woman reported that she was not only harassed, but also sexually assaulted. Another woman reported that she was pressured into having sex to get a promotion. Few details were available at the time. The inspector general’s summary of the investigation was barely two pages. The official had worked in the Office of Justice Programs, an arm of the Justice Department that partners with federal, state, and local law enforcement, but he wasn’t identified. The summary didn’t specify what the women accused him of doing or the time period. Because the official had left the department, there wouldn’t be any internal disciplinary process. No criminal charges were filed. Nearly 10 months later, BuzzFeed News obtained a copy of the inspector general’s full report. The 12-page document is redacted but includes a slew of new information, including detailed accounts from two of the women who described a pattern of escalating workplace harassment, as well as investigators’ findings that the former official “lacked credibility” and provided “conflicting testimony.” The former official’s name is redacted in the inspector general’s report, but BuzzFeed News previously identified him as Edison Aponte, who had worked at DOJ since 1994, according to a Justice Department spokesperson.

Nearly 10 months after BuzzFeed News filed a public records request for the full report, the inspector general’s office produced it in late September. The office withheld certain information, citing privacy concerns, so the full extent of what investigators learned remains secret. The unredacted sections of the report don’t include dates, so there’s no definite timeline for when the harassment alleged by each of the women began. The report is divided into sections detailing each woman’s account. The first woman provided a letter to investigators describing a sexual relationship with Aponte and indicated that he was her supervisor throughout that relationship. Aponte initially told the inspector general’s office he didn’t have a sexual relationship with the woman, but when confronted with information from her letter, he admitted it. “[REDACTED] admitted to the OIG that he exercised bad judgment, especially in view of his position as an [REDACTED],” according to the report, an apparent reference to Aponte’s position as a senior manager. “[REDACTED] admitted that he should not have been involved with his female subordinates in any way that would appear that he was violating ethical rules. [REDACTED] admitted further that he had inappropriate relationships with subordinates, and that his communications with them were unprofessional.” The second woman described in the inspector general’s report was S.C., who fell under Aponte’s chain of command in the Bureau of Justice Assistance. She told investigators and, later, BuzzFeed News that she tried to discourage sexual advances from Aponte, which included repeatedly asking her about her dating life and uninvited touching — she was the one who said she put up a mirror at her desk to deal with unwanted back rubs from Aponte. S.C. also told investigators that Aponte once sexually assaulted her. She said that Aponte followed her home after they had gone as part of a group to an unspecified sports event, and asked to come inside to use the bathroom and for a tour. According to the report, she said that when she rejected his attempts to touch her, he became “forceful” and “sexually assaulted her by having sexual intercourse with her.” Aponte initially denied any sexual relationship with S.C., but he later said he’d had sex with her while he was her supervisor, according to the report. He denied assaulting her. The report noted that no criminal charges were filed against Aponte. S.C. told BuzzFeed News that she decided not to go to the police because she didn’t want to bring attention to herself or her family. Throughout the interview, S.C. also described being concerned about hurting Aponte’s family. The inspector general’s description of the third woman’s account was brief, and the redactions make it hard to know what exactly happened. Still, the report appears to show that the incident involved Aponte showing a photo to other people and that it made her feel “very uncomfortable.” The fourth woman told investigators that Aponte knew she was “struggling financially” and that she hoped for a promotion. She said she accepted his invitations for several months to get drinks outside of work — on one occasion, she said, he took her to a topless bar, and after asking her about what sexual positions she liked, she told him to “go to hell and left.” Aponte told investigators he didn’t remember the incident. At a Christmas party some time later, the woman told investigators that Aponte talked to her about getting funding soon for new positions. When he said he wanted to take her to a bar, she “felt she had no other choice but to go to the bar with [REDACTED] because [REDACTED] promotion was near and she desperately wanted the promotion.” After they left the bar, the woman said Aponte drove to a dark area, parked, and kissed and groped her. She said she pushed him away. “[REDACTED] stated that [REDACTED] started talking about the [REDACTED] promotions and at the end of the conversation [LONGER REDACTED SECTION],” the report stated. “[REDACTED] stated that she felt if she did not [REDACTED] with [REDACTED] then she would not receive her promotion [LONGER REDACTED SECTION].” Aponte told the inspector general’s office that he didn’t interact with the woman at all that evening and also didn’t recall going out for drinks with her, taking her to a topless bar, or asking her about sexual positions. Eventually, she said, she felt pressured into having sex with Aponte in order to get the promotion, and described two incidents — once after he drove her home during a snowstorm, and once after they had gotten drinks and he parked on a dead-end street — in the period leading up to her being considered for the new job. She said Aponte helped her prepare for the interview, including giving her interview questions in advance, and that she ultimately received the promotion. Aponte denied having sex with her and denied helping her with the interview. He claimed he was being targeted because the woman’s request to work remotely had been denied. She reported to investigators that Aponte indicated he had personal information about her and where she lived, and she feared he was threatening her and might try to demand sex again in the future. Marilyn Moses, president of the Office of Justice Programs employees union, told BuzzFeed News that the woman who reported being pressured into having sex with Aponte in exchange for a promotion received a monetary settlement from the department. Moses declined to specify the amount or share additional details. The woman and her lawyer declined an interview request. The fifth and final woman’s account was brief. Most of the details were redacted in the report, but it involved an elevator encounter that made the woman feel “very uncomfortable.” Aponte told investigators he didn’t remember the incident.

The inspector general’s office concluded that the women who reported Aponte were “credible witnesses.” The information they provided was “detailed and specific,” according to the report, and there wasn’t evidence that they’d consulted with each other before giving investigators accounts of similar bad behavior by Aponte.

Investigators found that Aponte, on the other hand, “lacked credibility.” “He initially denied any relationship with [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], but when confronted with evidence, admitted to having had sexual contact with both subordinates,” the inspector general’s office said in its report. “He also persistently minimized his misconduct and failed to demonstrate any recognition or appreciation for the seriousness of his actions as a senior manager.” The report included information about S.C.’s efforts to report Aponte to management, but much of it is redacted. According to S.C.’s interview with BuzzFeed News and documents prepared by the employees union in 2013, she first told a senior Office of Justice Programs official in 2012 that Aponte sexually harassed her. She said she was asked if she wanted to make a formal complaint, but declined because she didn’t want to hurt Aponte’s family or her own; Moses said there was no requirement that employees make a formal complaint for management to take action. S.C. said she asked to be transferred to a different department so she wouldn’t have to see him, but management refused.

""I work at the Justice Department and I manage grants to prevent things like this.""

“I just was like, so this is what happens? I work at the Justice Department and I manage grants to prevent things like this, I go to shelters, I meet women that deal with these types of things, and I’m dealing with this and I work for the United States government and I’ve done nothing wrong?” S.C. said.

S.C. told BuzzFeed News that in addition to unwanted touching, Aponte engaged in other harassing behavior, including commenting on her clothes, taking her phone and going through text messages and photos — she said she started hiding her phone — and questioning why she was wearing makeup, and if it was because she was going on a date. She said they had been friends, so when he made the occasional inappropriate comment early on, she didn’t think there was a problem. “I’m the type of person that when I get uncomfortable, I tend to laugh it off and ... I don’t like to make other people feel uncomfortable. And that is my biggest downfall,” S.C. said. “Even if he said, ‘Oh, you look good in those pants,’ or whatever, I would be like, ‘Shut up, Ed,’ and I would laugh it off, you know, and just walk out of his office.” S.C. told the inspector general’s office and BuzzFeed News that Aponte sexually assaulted her, but did not tell DOJ management. She declined to discuss the details of the assault with BuzzFeed News, saying it was too painful, but did confirm that it happened after a sporting event. Other documents reviewed by BuzzFeed News show that senior officials at DOJ were put on notice about S.C.’s harassment claims against Aponte over several years. In 2013, when S.C. was facing disciplinary action for allegedly being absent from work without approval, the union sent a letter to management defending her and arguing she was facing retaliation for reporting Aponte the year before, as well as for using leave she was entitled to take under federal law. S.C. was fired in 2014. In August 2015, Moses sent a letter to Loretta Lynch, who had just become the US attorney general, alerting her that an employee had reported “unwanted sexual advances” by Aponte. The letter didn’t name S.C., but the description of events matches the 2013 union letter. Moses told Lynch that management notified Aponte about the complaint and he denied it, and she questioned the lack of further investigation by officials. Both the 2015 letter to Lynch and the union’s 2013 letter defending S.C. against disciplinary action named Aponte. “In a world where we assess the cost of everything, granting [S.C.]’s request for a transfer was a no cost solution that would have satisfied her. It would have also bought time for management to thoroughly investigate her claim and potentially prevent further harassment of others,” Moses wrote in an email to BuzzFeed News. “Ultimately management's inaction over the years has exacted an enormous financial and emotional toll on his victims and all involved in this shameful situation.”
