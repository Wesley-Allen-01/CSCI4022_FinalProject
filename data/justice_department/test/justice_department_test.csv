Though the President is the head of the executive branch, America's real chief law enforcement official is William Barr and there are dramatic signs that even the loyal attorney general is beginning to feel the strain of the last week's legal tumult.

The President's relish in unveiling a new set of clemency decisions in highly sensitive political cases -- days after his meddling in the Roger Stone sentencing recommendations -- is only exacerbating a Justice Department credibility crisis.

Trump stuns with audacity of pardons

But Trump, brazen and unapologetic, announced a flurry of commutations and pardons on Tuesday.

His willingness to intervene in highly charged political cases threatened to obliterate the invisible wall erected between the White House and the Justice Department since the Watergate era -- explicitly designed to avoid suspicions of such interference.

The White House did not provide evidence of a detailed pardon process conducted through the Justice Department, and the President did not explain his decisions at length other than to describe the prosecutions as ""unfair"" and sentences very tough.

Tuesday's moves were only the latest examples of Trump's willingness to use pardons for political advantage.

""I'm allowed to be totally involved,"" the President told reporters before heading off on a western campaign swing.

Trump is undoing years of government prosecutions

In the last few days, in a new activation of always-implied presidential powers, Trump has effectively assumed the authority to undo complex prosecutions, ignore jury decisions and usurp government prosecutors who put years into high-profile cases.

In the process, he's sent a message that convicts with associates who are close to the President politically -- or who can get on Fox News -- will enjoy a more lenient form of justice.

Kerik, for example, is a protege of Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani — who was at the center of the effort to get dirt from Ukraine on Trump's opponents that led to his impeachment.

Blagojevich's wife has often taken to the President's favorite conservative news network to plead his case. And the White House noted in a statement that Milkin's philanthropy had led conservative heroes like Giuliani, Sheldon Adelson and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy to support calls for a pardon.

Trump's recent interventions in the legal process also opened a window into the President's personal morality and the principles which govern his own attitudes to power.

Kerik, Blagojevich and Milken were all convicted of offenses that the President has been accused of committing by his enemies. Their cases involved a blizzard of abuses of power, betraying public trust, soliciting quid pro quo, fogging tax records and lying to investigators.

It is almost as if Trump is arguing implicitly that such corruption should not be criminal at all, but is the normal behavior of powerful men -- such as himself.

It was also notable that Trump specifically noted that Blagojevich was put behind bars by US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, a star legal contemporary of Trump's nemesis, fired former FBI Director James Comey. Fitzgerald prosecuted Libby as well and also joined Comey's legal team in 2017. That the President appears to be taking aim at those associations seems unlikely to be a coincidence.

This became evident in dramatic fashion Tuesday when the entire team prosecuting longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone withdrew from that case after Justice Department higher-ups made clear they planned to override their sentencing recommendation .
But the Stone controversy was just the latest in a series of recent moves by Barr to “ take control of legal matters of personal interest to President Donald Trump , ” as Carol Lee , Ken Dilanian , and Peter Alexander of NBC News reported .
Senior Justice Department officials also intervened to change the sentencing recommendation for another Trump ally , Michael Flynn , last month . Barr put in a close ally in the politically sensitive US Attorney ’ s Office for the District of Columbia job ( in a procedurally unusual way ) . And Barr instituted new rules requiring his personal approval for any new investigations into presidential campaigns , staff , or foreign contributions — something that naturally would help the investigation-plagued Trump campaign .
All this has unfolded as Trump has separately taken revenge on witnesses in the impeachment inquiry : dismissing Alex and Yevgeny Vindman from the National Security Council staff and firing EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland . The president also pulled a Treasury Department nomination for the former US Attorney for DC , who had supervised Stone ’ s prosecution .
It ’ s not clear whether Barr is acting in response to explicit private instructions from Trump , but it ’ s largely irrelevant . Trump has made it unmistakably clear that these are the sorts of things he wants Barr to do — he tweeted before the change to Stone ’ s sentencing recommendation that it should be changed , and he praised Barr personally for doing so afterward .
This is a horrible and very unfair situation . The real crimes were on the other side , as nothing happens to them . Can not allow this miscarriage of justice ! https : //t.co/rHPfYX6Vbv — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) February 11 , 2020
Congratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought . Evidence now clearly shows that the Mueller Scam was improperly brought & tainted . Even Bob Mueller lied to Congress ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) February 12 , 2020
It ’ s a grim situation at the Justice Department . In cases involving President Trump and his allies , it seems career prosecutors will no longer have their judgment respected ; instead , Barr will be waiting in the wings to overrule them if he deems it necessary .
Barr ’ s moves center on the US Attorney ’ s Office for the District of Columbia
The full story of what ’ s going on behind the scenes at the Justice Department remains murky , but many of the recent eyebrow-raising events have centered on the US Attorney ’ s Office for the District of Columbia .
Many of the most important federal prosecutions involving top US government officials end up getting brought by the US Attorney for DC — because , well , that ’ s where the government is .
Since September 2017 , that post had been filled by Jessie Liu , a veteran of the George W. Bush Justice Department who wasn ’ t particularly viewed as a “ Trump person. ” Liu ’ s office took over Roger Stone ’ s prosecution once special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s team wrapped up and pursued it vigorously , winning his conviction at trial . Her office also took over the sentencing process for Michael Flynn and Rick Gates , both of whom were charged in Mueller ’ s probe . There was no indication she was going easy on Trump allies .
Additionally , Liu ’ s office handled two other controversial cases that seem to have ended in embarrassing ways for the administration . Her prosecutors indicted former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig for false statements related to his work with Paul Manafort , but Craig was acquitted at trial . Her team also investigated former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe , a frequent Trump target , for alleged false statements related to a leak — but though leaks suggested McCabe would be indicted , no indictment materialized , for unclear reasons .
In December , President Trump announced his intention to nominate Liu to fill a Treasury Department post . This seemed to be an ordinary enough personnel change after Liu had spent over two years in the post — though she had to be confirmed by the Senate first .
Michael Flynn ’ s sentencing appears to have been the first problem
It started with a new sentencing memo Liu ’ s office filed regarding Flynn , Trump ’ s former national security adviser who pleaded guilty for lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador .
Flynn had initially pleaded guilty to this charge in December 2017 and agreed to cooperate with Mueller ’ s team . Things seemed to be going according to plan as his December 2018 sentencing hearing approached ; prosecutors wrote that a sentence that “ does not impose a term of incarceration ” would be appropriate for him .
Surprisingly , though , at that hearing , the judge in Flynn ’ s case , Emmet Sullivan , raked Flynn over the coals , saying he felt “ disgust ” and “ disdain ” for what Flynn did , and strongly suggested he might give Flynn some prison time . However , Sullivan offered Flynn the opportunity to delay his sentencing to get credit for further cooperation with the government , and Flynn jumped at the chance .
Yet instead of cooperating further , Flynn decided to dump his lawyers and hire a conservative firebrand , Sidney Powell . He also did not agree to give prosecutors the testimony they wanted in a case against one of his business associates , Bijan Rafiekian . Filings from Powell grew increasingly defiant , seeming to reject Flynn ’ s previous acceptance of responsibility for his false statements and imply that Flynn had been set up by the government . ( Powell eventually filed a motion to have Flynn ’ s guilty plea withdrawn . )
The prosecutors in Flynn ’ s case were not at all happy with this turnabout , and as his new sentencing date approached , they let Judge Sullivan know in a January 7 filing .
“ Given the serious nature of the defendant ’ s offense , his apparent failure to accept responsibility , his failure to complete his cooperation ” in Rafiekian ’ s prosecution , “ and the need to promote respect for the law and adequately deter such criminal conduct , the government recommends that the court sentence the defendant within the applicable Guidelines range of 0 to 6 months of incarceration , ” prosecutors wrote .
That is : They had changed their recommendation , and now think Flynn may well deserve to be locked up . And Liu signed off .
Yet about three weeks later , as filings back and forth from the prosecution and defense continued , the government curiously shifted its position . Now , prosecutors stressed , they agreed with the defendant “ that a sentence of probation is a reasonable sentence . ”
According to NBC News , this change came about because “ senior officials at the Justice Department ” intervened . Liu , again , signed off .
Liu was replaced — before she had been confirmed to her new post — with a Barr ally
Liu ’ s exit from the US Attorney ’ s job was odd . Yes , she had been nominated for something else in the Treasury Department , but she hadn ’ t yet been confirmed for it by the Senate . And her confirmation hearing was expected to take place in just a few weeks , so it was unclear why there needed to be such haste in removing her .
Indeed , the New York Times reports that Liu “ initially told colleagues that she would stay on as U.S. attorney until the Senate confirmed her ” — but that she and Barr “ then agreed that she would leave early in the new year so that someone else could run the office if the confirmation process stretched on . ”
And the identity of Liu ’ s replacement may help clarify things . The interim US Attorney for the District of Columbia would be Timothy Shea , one of Barr ’ s “ closest advisers ” ( per the Associated Press ) . Shea had been serving as a counselor to Barr at the Justice Department .
Shea ’ s appointment can certainly be interpreted as an attempt by Barr to bring this US Attorney ’ s office and all the politically charged cases it handles under his control — or , at the very least , under the control of a trusted ally .
And the timing of the Flynn sentencing dust-up certainly raises questions of whether Shea was slotted in — and Liu was pushed out — very quickly in an attempt to prevent something similar from happening again .
By this Monday , it was time for another high-profile sentencing recommendation from the US Attorney ’ s Office for the District of Columbia . This one involved Roger Stone , the longtime Trump adviser who was convicted last November on seven total counts of obstruction , false statements , and witness tampering .
The probation office had calculated that guidelines for a sentence for Stone ’ s crimes would be between 87 and 108 months ( about seven to nine years ) . And prosecutors told the judge in Stone ’ s case that such a sentence would indeed be “ appropriate. ” The new interim US Attorney , Shea , signed on .
Trump flipped his lid . “ Can not allow this miscarriage of justice ! ” he tweeted at 1:48 am on Tuesday .
And later in the morning , word leaked out to a Fox News reporter that indeed the Justice Department would not allow this recommended sentence .
Anonymous Justice Department officials have insisted to various reporters that they were not responding to Trump ’ s tweet in doing this , and that the decision to override the prosecutors was made before the tweet . This claim has been greeted with much skepticism .
As for why Shea allowed the sentencing recommendation in the first place , the New York Times reports that one official claims there was a “ breakdown in management ” and no clear approval was given by top officials .
Whatever happened , it ’ s extraordinarily unusual for federal prosecutors to walk back their sentencing recommendation the very next day . And once it became clear that ’ s what would happen , all four Stone prosecutors withdrew from the case in apparent protest . ( One , Jonathan Kravis , quit the Justice Department entirely ; the other three are remaining . )
After that , a new prosecutor on the case , John Crabb , submitted a filing to the court saying that the previous sentencing memo for Stone “ does not accurately reflect the Department of Justice ’ s position on what would be a reasonable sentence in this matter. ” Crabb wrote that the government believes “ a sentence of incarceration far less than 87 to 108 months ’ imprisonment would be reasonable under the circumstances ” — but that they ’ ll defer to Judge Amy Berman Jackson on what exactly that would be .
The capper on this , for now , occurred Tuesday evening , when Axios ’ s Jonathan Swan reported that Trump would in fact withdraw Jessie Liu ’ s nomination to that Treasury post — a move that meant she would not testify before a Senate committee at a scheduled confirmation hearing later this week . Whether this is an effort to retaliate against the person who oversaw Stone ’ s prosecution or simply an attempt to avoid ugly testimony , it certainly makes Liu ’ s ahead-of-schedule replacement by Shea look even more questionable . ( Liu resigned Wednesday night . )
Meanwhile , Barr ensured Trump can ’ t be investigated without his approval
That ’ s all the recent action ( that we know of ) from this single US Attorney ’ s office , but Barr has also made a much more wide-ranging change that could be of massive importance to President Trump .
NPR reported last Thursday that Barr has instituted a new Justice Department rule requiring his personal approval for the opening of any investigation of a presidential candidate , a campaign , campaign staff , or a potentially illegal foreign contribution .
Remember : Trump ’ s 2016 campaign was eventually plagued not just by the Russia counterintelligence investigation but also by an investigation into hush money for Stormy Daniels ( Michael Cohen eventually pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance law with the payments ) . There have been various investigations of foreign money potentially making its way to the Trump campaign or allied groups ( as well as some involving foreign money to Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign ) .
What Barr is ensuring with this new rule is that there will be no surprises from pesky independent-minded investigators . If it touches a presidential campaign , he will have to sign off on it .
How he will use that authority isn ’ t yet clear . But he and his allies at the top of the Justice Department have already shown a distinct willingness to intervene in procedurally unusual and inappropriate ways in cases of interest to President Trump .
Despite all the drama over the sentencing recommendations for Flynn and Stone , we should note that in both cases , the final decision on sentencing lies with a judge , not prosecutors . So , inappropriate though these moves may be , it ’ s not clear if they will actually change anything . ( Trump does , of course , have the power to pardon both of them or commute their sentences . )
Beyond that , there are some complications to the narrative that the Justice Department is being entirely bent to serve President Trump ’ s interests .
For one , Rudy Giuliani ’ s close allies Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were arrested last October and indicted by prosecutors from the US Attorney ’ s Office for the Southern District of New York ( SDNY ) for campaign finance violations .
Parnas , Fruman , and two other defendants are awaiting trial , and prosecutors have said they expect to file a superseding indictment at some point with further charges . This continuing probe reportedly imperiled Giuliani as well . One would think that a Justice Department wholly responsive to Trump ’ s whims would not be investigating his lawyer .
But though this investigation is headed by SDNY , an office with a reputation for independence , there have been reports that Justice Department leaders in Washington later got involved as well . The current state of the investigation remains unclear .
Other politically controversial choices also await . Barr has appointed John Durham , the US Attorney in Connecticut , to head a freewheeling investigation into purported malfeasance from Trump-Russia investigators . The Justice Department is deciding whether to charge Trump ally Erik Prince with lying to Congress and violating US export laws . The Andrew McCabe investigation is still hanging out there without a clear resolution . News even broke recently that prosecutors were investigating James Comey in connection with years-old leaks .
In all these cases , is the Justice Department going to act like President Trump ’ s political attack machine ( or defense mechanism ) ? Or is it going to respect the judgment of its prosecutors and weigh cases carefully before bringing charges ? We ’ ll have to wait and see . But the signs from Barr of late have not been encouraging .","Attorney General Bill Barr and his allies are centralizing control over the Justice Department and acting in increasingly blatant ways to protect President Donald Trump’s interests and allies.

This became evident in dramatic fashion Tuesday when the entire team prosecuting longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone withdrew from that case after Justice Department higher-ups made clear they planned to override their sentencing recommendation.

But the Stone controversy was just the latest in a series of recent moves by Barr to “take control of legal matters of personal interest to President Donald Trump,” as Carol Lee, Ken Dilanian, and Peter Alexander of NBC News reported.

Senior Justice Department officials also intervened to change the sentencing recommendation for another Trump ally, Michael Flynn, last month. Barr put in a close ally in the politically sensitive US Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia job (in a procedurally unusual way). And Barr instituted new rules requiring his personal approval for any new investigations into presidential campaigns, staff, or foreign contributions — something that naturally would help the investigation-plagued Trump campaign.

All this has unfolded as Trump has separately taken revenge on witnesses in the impeachment inquiry: dismissing Alex and Yevgeny Vindman from the National Security Council staff and firing EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland. The president also pulled a Treasury Department nomination for the former US Attorney for DC, who had supervised Stone’s prosecution.

It’s not clear whether Barr is acting in response to explicit private instructions from Trump, but it’s largely irrelevant. Trump has made it unmistakably clear that these are the sorts of things he wants Barr to do — he tweeted before the change to Stone’s sentencing recommendation that it should be changed, and he praised Barr personally for doing so afterward.

This is a horrible and very unfair situation. The real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them. Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice! https://t.co/rHPfYX6Vbv — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 11, 2020

Congratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought. Evidence now clearly shows that the Mueller Scam was improperly brought & tainted. Even Bob Mueller lied to Congress! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2020

It’s a grim situation at the Justice Department. In cases involving President Trump and his allies, it seems career prosecutors will no longer have their judgment respected; instead, Barr will be waiting in the wings to overrule them if he deems it necessary.

Barr’s moves center on the US Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia

The full story of what’s going on behind the scenes at the Justice Department remains murky, but many of the recent eyebrow-raising events have centered on the US Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia.

Many of the most important federal prosecutions involving top US government officials end up getting brought by the US Attorney for DC — because, well, that’s where the government is.

Since September 2017, that post had been filled by Jessie Liu, a veteran of the George W. Bush Justice Department who wasn’t particularly viewed as a “Trump person.” Liu’s office took over Roger Stone’s prosecution once special counsel Robert Mueller’s team wrapped up and pursued it vigorously, winning his conviction at trial. Her office also took over the sentencing process for Michael Flynn and Rick Gates, both of whom were charged in Mueller’s probe. There was no indication she was going easy on Trump allies.

Additionally, Liu’s office handled two other controversial cases that seem to have ended in embarrassing ways for the administration. Her prosecutors indicted former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig for false statements related to his work with Paul Manafort, but Craig was acquitted at trial. Her team also investigated former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a frequent Trump target, for alleged false statements related to a leak — but though leaks suggested McCabe would be indicted, no indictment materialized, for unclear reasons.

In December, President Trump announced his intention to nominate Liu to fill a Treasury Department post. This seemed to be an ordinary enough personnel change after Liu had spent over two years in the post — though she had to be confirmed by the Senate first.

Then, on January 7, the trouble began.

Michael Flynn’s sentencing appears to have been the first problem

It started with a new sentencing memo Liu’s office filed regarding Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser who pleaded guilty for lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador.

Flynn had initially pleaded guilty to this charge in December 2017 and agreed to cooperate with Mueller’s team. Things seemed to be going according to plan as his December 2018 sentencing hearing approached; prosecutors wrote that a sentence that “does not impose a term of incarceration” would be appropriate for him.

Surprisingly, though, at that hearing, the judge in Flynn’s case, Emmet Sullivan, raked Flynn over the coals, saying he felt “disgust” and “disdain” for what Flynn did, and strongly suggested he might give Flynn some prison time. However, Sullivan offered Flynn the opportunity to delay his sentencing to get credit for further cooperation with the government, and Flynn jumped at the chance.

Yet instead of cooperating further, Flynn decided to dump his lawyers and hire a conservative firebrand, Sidney Powell. He also did not agree to give prosecutors the testimony they wanted in a case against one of his business associates, Bijan Rafiekian. Filings from Powell grew increasingly defiant, seeming to reject Flynn’s previous acceptance of responsibility for his false statements and imply that Flynn had been set up by the government. (Powell eventually filed a motion to have Flynn’s guilty plea withdrawn.)

The prosecutors in Flynn’s case were not at all happy with this turnabout, and as his new sentencing date approached, they let Judge Sullivan know in a January 7 filing.

“Given the serious nature of the defendant’s offense, his apparent failure to accept responsibility, his failure to complete his cooperation” in Rafiekian’s prosecution, “and the need to promote respect for the law and adequately deter such criminal conduct, the government recommends that the court sentence the defendant within the applicable Guidelines range of 0 to 6 months of incarceration,” prosecutors wrote.

That is: They had changed their recommendation, and now think Flynn may well deserve to be locked up. And Liu signed off.

Yet about three weeks later, as filings back and forth from the prosecution and defense continued, the government curiously shifted its position. Now, prosecutors stressed, they agreed with the defendant “that a sentence of probation is a reasonable sentence.”

According to NBC News, this change came about because “senior officials at the Justice Department” intervened. Liu, again, signed off.

That same day, she exited her job.

Liu was replaced — before she had been confirmed to her new post — with a Barr ally

Liu’s exit from the US Attorney’s job was odd. Yes, she had been nominated for something else in the Treasury Department, but she hadn’t yet been confirmed for it by the Senate. And her confirmation hearing was expected to take place in just a few weeks, so it was unclear why there needed to be such haste in removing her.

Indeed, the New York Times reports that Liu “initially told colleagues that she would stay on as U.S. attorney until the Senate confirmed her” — but that she and Barr “then agreed that she would leave early in the new year so that someone else could run the office if the confirmation process stretched on.”

And the identity of Liu’s replacement may help clarify things. The interim US Attorney for the District of Columbia would be Timothy Shea, one of Barr’s “closest advisers” (per the Associated Press). Shea had been serving as a counselor to Barr at the Justice Department.

Shea’s appointment can certainly be interpreted as an attempt by Barr to bring this US Attorney’s office and all the politically charged cases it handles under his control — or, at the very least, under the control of a trusted ally.

And the timing of the Flynn sentencing dust-up certainly raises questions of whether Shea was slotted in — and Liu was pushed out — very quickly in an attempt to prevent something similar from happening again.

Then something similar happened with Roger Stone

By this Monday, it was time for another high-profile sentencing recommendation from the US Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. This one involved Roger Stone, the longtime Trump adviser who was convicted last November on seven total counts of obstruction, false statements, and witness tampering.

The probation office had calculated that guidelines for a sentence for Stone’s crimes would be between 87 and 108 months (about seven to nine years). And prosecutors told the judge in Stone’s case that such a sentence would indeed be “appropriate.” The new interim US Attorney, Shea, signed on.

Trump flipped his lid. “Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!” he tweeted at 1:48 am on Tuesday.

And later in the morning, word leaked out to a Fox News reporter that indeed the Justice Department would not allow this recommended sentence.

Anonymous Justice Department officials have insisted to various reporters that they were not responding to Trump’s tweet in doing this, and that the decision to override the prosecutors was made before the tweet. This claim has been greeted with much skepticism.

As for why Shea allowed the sentencing recommendation in the first place, the New York Times reports that one official claims there was a “breakdown in management” and no clear approval was given by top officials.

Whatever happened, it’s extraordinarily unusual for federal prosecutors to walk back their sentencing recommendation the very next day. And once it became clear that’s what would happen, all four Stone prosecutors withdrew from the case in apparent protest. (One, Jonathan Kravis, quit the Justice Department entirely; the other three are remaining.)

After that, a new prosecutor on the case, John Crabb, submitted a filing to the court saying that the previous sentencing memo for Stone “does not accurately reflect the Department of Justice’s position on what would be a reasonable sentence in this matter.” Crabb wrote that the government believes “a sentence of incarceration far less than 87 to 108 months’ imprisonment would be reasonable under the circumstances” — but that they’ll defer to Judge Amy Berman Jackson on what exactly that would be.

The capper on this, for now, occurred Tuesday evening, when Axios’s Jonathan Swan reported that Trump would in fact withdraw Jessie Liu’s nomination to that Treasury post — a move that meant she would not testify before a Senate committee at a scheduled confirmation hearing later this week. Whether this is an effort to retaliate against the person who oversaw Stone’s prosecution or simply an attempt to avoid ugly testimony, it certainly makes Liu’s ahead-of-schedule replacement by Shea look even more questionable. (Liu resigned Wednesday night.)

Meanwhile, Barr ensured Trump can’t be investigated without his approval

That’s all the recent action (that we know of) from this single US Attorney’s office, but Barr has also made a much more wide-ranging change that could be of massive importance to President Trump.

NPR reported last Thursday that Barr has instituted a new Justice Department rule requiring his personal approval for the opening of any investigation of a presidential candidate, a campaign, campaign staff, or a potentially illegal foreign contribution.

Remember: Trump’s 2016 campaign was eventually plagued not just by the Russia counterintelligence investigation but also by an investigation into hush money for Stormy Daniels (Michael Cohen eventually pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance law with the payments). There have been various investigations of foreign money potentially making its way to the Trump campaign or allied groups (as well as some involving foreign money to Hillary Clinton’s campaign).

What Barr is ensuring with this new rule is that there will be no surprises from pesky independent-minded investigators. If it touches a presidential campaign, he will have to sign off on it.

How he will use that authority isn’t yet clear. But he and his allies at the top of the Justice Department have already shown a distinct willingness to intervene in procedurally unusual and inappropriate ways in cases of interest to President Trump.

So how bad are things?

Despite all the drama over the sentencing recommendations for Flynn and Stone, we should note that in both cases, the final decision on sentencing lies with a judge, not prosecutors. So, inappropriate though these moves may be, it’s not clear if they will actually change anything. (Trump does, of course, have the power to pardon both of them or commute their sentences.)

Beyond that, there are some complications to the narrative that the Justice Department is being entirely bent to serve President Trump’s interests.

For one, Rudy Giuliani’s close allies Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were arrested last October and indicted by prosecutors from the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) for campaign finance violations.

Parnas, Fruman, and two other defendants are awaiting trial, and prosecutors have said they expect to file a superseding indictment at some point with further charges. This continuing probe reportedly imperiled Giuliani as well. One would think that a Justice Department wholly responsive to Trump’s whims would not be investigating his lawyer.

But though this investigation is headed by SDNY, an office with a reputation for independence, there have been reports that Justice Department leaders in Washington later got involved as well. The current state of the investigation remains unclear.

Other politically controversial choices also await. Barr has appointed John Durham, the US Attorney in Connecticut, to head a freewheeling investigation into purported malfeasance from Trump-Russia investigators. The Justice Department is deciding whether to charge Trump ally Erik Prince with lying to Congress and violating US export laws. The Andrew McCabe investigation is still hanging out there without a clear resolution. News even broke recently that prosecutors were investigating James Comey in connection with years-old leaks.

In all these cases, is the Justice Department going to act like President Trump’s political attack machine (or defense mechanism)? Or is it going to respect the judgment of its prosecutors and weigh cases carefully before bringing charges? We’ll have to wait and see.

But for now , her order stands as a sharp rejection of Stone 's plea .
Jackson sentenced Stone to his 40-month jail term in February following his conviction on charges of repeatedly lying to Congress and intimidating a witness to impede the House 's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election .
After his sentencing , Stone 's attorney urged the Bureau of Prisons to consider Stone 's health when setting his surrender date , and BOP responded by agreed to bring him in on June 30 . But earlier this week , Stone moved to delay his report date another two months , citing the risk of coronavirus in federal prisons .
Jackson immediately began a searching inquiry into the matter , pressing Stone and the U.S. attorney 's office for the District of Columbia for details on Stone 's request to obtain a delay . She also asked for details about coronavirus spread in FCI-Jesup .
What she received was evidence that no cases had appeared in the Georgia facility , a fact she emphasized in her order . A July 14 report date , she noted , affords the defendant seventy-five days beyond his original report date .
Jackson also pointedly intimated that inmates in the facility where Stone is facing incarceration might have as much to fear about Stone introducing coronavirus — after spending time traveling and in Florida , a recent hotspot for coronavirus — than he does about contracting it there . Her order will send Stone to his home for about two weeks , the standard self-quarantine period for those potentially exposed to coronavirus .
Jackson 's order came despite prosecutors ' indication they had no objection to Stone 's request for another 60-day delay in his surrender date , citing department-wide policies implemented in response to the coronavirus pandemic .
`` Because of the COVID-19 pandemic , it is currently the U.S. Department of Justice ’ s policy ... to not oppose a defendant ’ s request to extend a voluntary surrender date for up to 60 days , unless the defendant poses an immediate public safety or flight risk , '' the U.S. attorney 's office for Washington , D.C. , said in a late-night filing . `` For that reason—and that reason only—the U.S. Attorney ’ s Office for the District of Columbia does not oppose defendant Roger J. Stone ’ s request to extend his voluntary surrender date for up to 60 days ''
In his request , the 67-year-old Stone cited the health risks he would face behind bars . And in a series of Instagram posts , Stone ratcheted up the rhetoric , claiming he would be facing `` certain '' death if his jail sentence continues as scheduled .
Jackson , though , made clear quickly that she is n't accepting Stone 's contention at face value . After Stone 's initial motion to delay his sentence , Jackson ordered the U.S. attorney 's office for Washington , D.C. — which prosecuted the case — to submit its own filing weighing in on the matter and also to provide details about recent coronavirus testing at the federal prison .
In a subsequent order on Wednesday , Jackson also asked the government to show her any existing Justice Department or U.S. attorney policies about how to handle defendants who request delays in their surrender dates because of coronavirus .
And on Thursday , Jackson inquired further , ordering Stone to provide details about what he told the Bureau of Prisons which set his June 30 reporting date after Jackson denied his motion for a new trial in mid-April .
In its filing , the U.S. attorney ’ s office indicated that Stone ’ s legal team had asked the Bureau of Prisons for the June 30 date on April 17 , citing Stone ’ s health and the risk of coronavirus . BOP agreed .
“ At no point since that original designation has the U.S. Attorney ’ s Office had any role in or attempted to exert any influence over whether BOP should revise the June 30 surrender date , ” the government said in its Thursday night filing .
While prosecutors said the two-month delay was consistent with Bureau of Prisons guidance issued in March , they did not provide the judge with a copy of that policy .
When ███ asked the Bureau of Prisons in March whether virus-related concerns had prompted delays in defendants ’ dates to begin their prison terms , a spokesman replied : “ Individuals with questions about voluntary surrender should consult their attorneys and the U.S . Marshals Service for direction . ”

Nationwide , about 6,400 federal prisoners have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and 89 have died .","Jackson said she intends to make a fuller opinion public next week barring any objections by Stone or the prosecutors in the case. But for now, her order stands as a sharp rejection of Stone's plea.

Jackson sentenced Stone to his 40-month jail term in February following his conviction on charges of repeatedly lying to Congress and intimidating a witness to impede the House's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

After his sentencing, Stone's attorney urged the Bureau of Prisons to consider Stone's health when setting his surrender date, and BOP responded by agreed to bring him in on June 30. But earlier this week, Stone moved to delay his report date another two months, citing the risk of coronavirus in federal prisons.

Jackson immediately began a searching inquiry into the matter, pressing Stone and the U.S. attorney's office for the District of Columbia for details on Stone's request to obtain a delay. She also asked for details about coronavirus spread in FCI-Jesup.

What she received was evidence that no cases had appeared in the Georgia facility, a fact she emphasized in her order. A July 14 report date, she noted, affords the defendant seventy-five days beyond his original report date.

Jackson also pointedly intimated that inmates in the facility where Stone is facing incarceration might have as much to fear about Stone introducing coronavirus — after spending time traveling and in Florida, a recent hotspot for coronavirus — than he does about contracting it there. Her order will send Stone to his home for about two weeks, the standard self-quarantine period for those potentially exposed to coronavirus.

Jackson's order came despite prosecutors' indication they had no objection to Stone's request for another 60-day delay in his surrender date, citing department-wide policies implemented in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

""Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is currently the U.S. Department of Justice’s policy ... to not oppose a defendant’s request to extend a voluntary surrender date for up to 60 days, unless the defendant poses an immediate public safety or flight risk,"" the U.S. attorney's office for Washington, D.C., said in a late-night filing. ""For that reason—and that reason only—the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia does not oppose defendant Roger J. Stone’s request to extend his voluntary surrender date for up to 60 days""

In his request, the 67-year-old Stone cited the health risks he would face behind bars. And in a series of Instagram posts, Stone ratcheted up the rhetoric, claiming he would be facing ""certain"" death if his jail sentence continues as scheduled.

Jackson, though, made clear quickly that she isn't accepting Stone's contention at face value. After Stone's initial motion to delay his sentence, Jackson ordered the U.S. attorney's office for Washington, D.C. — which prosecuted the case — to submit its own filing weighing in on the matter and also to provide details about recent coronavirus testing at the federal prison.

In a subsequent order on Wednesday, Jackson also asked the government to show her any existing Justice Department or U.S. attorney policies about how to handle defendants who request delays in their surrender dates because of coronavirus.

And on Thursday, Jackson inquired further, ordering Stone to provide details about what he told the Bureau of Prisons which set his June 30 reporting date after Jackson denied his motion for a new trial in mid-April.

In its filing, the U.S. attorney’s office indicated that Stone’s legal team had asked the Bureau of Prisons for the June 30 date on April 17, citing Stone’s health and the risk of coronavirus. BOP agreed.

“At no point since that original designation has the U.S. Attorney’s Office had any role in or attempted to exert any influence over whether BOP should revise the June 30 surrender date,” the government said in its Thursday night filing.

While prosecutors said the two-month delay was consistent with Bureau of Prisons guidance issued in March, they did not provide the judge with a copy of that policy.

When POLITICO asked the Bureau of Prisons in March whether virus-related concerns had prompted delays in defendants’ dates to begin their prison terms, a spokesman replied: “Individuals with questions about voluntary surrender should consult their attorneys and the U.S. Marshals Service for direction.”

Given the history of Stone’s case, Jackson appears to be deeply distrustful of both sides, demanding detailed justification and written support from the defense and prosecution for the kinds of assertions that judges often accept based solely on a lawyers’ say-so.

Why does the special counsel need to invent an offense to get a guilty plea ? Why doesn ’ t he demand a plea to one of the several truly egregious statutory crimes he claims have been committed ?
The Multi-Million-Dollar Fraud Indictments . . . and Penny-Ante Plea
On Thursday , February 22 , with now-familiar fanfare , Mueller filed an indictment against Paul Manafort and Richard Gates , alleging extremely serious crimes . Let ’ s put aside for now that the charges have absolutely nothing to do with the stated rationale for Mueller ’ s appointment , namely , Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible Trump-campaign collusion therein .
According to the special counsel , Manafort and Gates conspired to commit more than $ 25 million in bank fraud . In all , the indictment charges nine bank-fraud counts , each carrying a potential penalty of up to 30 years ’ imprisonment ( i.e. , 270 years combined ) . Furthermore , the two defendants are formally charged with $ 14 million in tax fraud ( the indictment ’ s narrative of the offense actually alleges well over twice that amount ) . There are five tax-fraud counts , yielding a potential 15 years ’ imprisonment ( up to three years for each offense ) , against each defendant .
According to the special counsel , Manafort and Gates conspired to commit more than $ 25 million in bank fraud .
Mind you , this indictment , filed in the Eastern District of Virginia , is not a stand-alone . It piles atop an earlier indictment in the District of Columbia . That one , filed back in October , accuses Manafort and Gates of an eye-popping $ 75 million money-laundering conspiracy , a charge that carries a penalty of up to 20 years ’ imprisonment .
The two indictments contain many other felony charges . But sticking with just these most serious ones , we can safely say that , on February 22 , Manafort and Gates were portrayed as high-order federal felons who faced decades of prison time based on financial frauds in the nine-digit range . And while I have previously discussed potential proof problems for the money-laundering charge , proving bank fraud and tax fraud is comparatively straightforward . The indictment indicates that the evidence of these crimes is well documented and daunting .
Yet , the very next day , Friday , February 23 , Mueller permitted Gates to plead guilty to two minor charges — a vaporous “ conspiracy against the United States ” and the process crime of misleading investigators , each carrying a sentence of zero to five years in jail . This flouted Justice Department policies designed to ensure that federal law is enforced evenhandedly across the nation .
In plea negotiations , federal prosecutors are instructed to require that a defendant plead guilty to “ the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of his/her conduct. ” ( See U.S. Attorney ’ s Manual , sec . 27.430 . ) In a properly functioning Justice Department , a defendant is not accused of over $ 100 million in financial fraud and then , within 24 hours , permitted to plead guilty in a wrist-slap deal that drops the major allegations and caps his potential sentence well beneath the penalties applicable by statute .
As outlined above , Mueller accused Gates of significant felonies totaling over 300 years of potential incarceration . Had the special counsel simply demanded a plea to a single bank-fraud count — the most serious statutory crime charged and , according to the indictment ’ s description , an offense that is readily provable — Gates would have faced up to 30 years ’ imprisonment .
If , as all appearances suggest , Mueller ’ s goal is to get Gates to cooperate , such a plea , besides honoring Justice Department guidelines , would have provided plenty of incentive . Under federal law , the prosecutor does not need to sell out the case for a song to induce cooperation . The prosecutor can demand a guilty plea that reflects the gravity of the defendant ’ s actual offenses . Then , if the defendant cooperates fully and truthfully , the law permits the prosecutor to ask the judge to impose a sentence beneath the severe term that would otherwise be called for — a sentence of little or no jail time .
Under federal law , the prosecutor does not need to sell out the case for a song to induce cooperation . The prosecutor can demand a guilty plea that reflects the gravity of the defendant ’ s actual offenses .
The Justice Department ’ s manual further admonishes prosecutors to refrain from guilty pleas that could “ adversely affect the investigation or prosecution of others. ” That is exactly what Mueller has done to the ongoing prosecution of Manafort . By giving Gates a pass on the bank-fraud ( and tax-fraud , and money-laundering ) charges , Mueller signals that these allegations are inflated . A jury could well feel justified in giving Manafort a pass on them , too .
By contrast , let ’ s imagine that Mueller had followed Justice Department protocols by insisting to Gates that nothing less than a guilty plea to the most serious readily provable charge — a 30-year bank-fraud count — would suffice . In his plea allocution , Gates would inevitably have implicated Manafort as his bank-fraud co-conspirator . Manafort would know that , were Gates to testify at trial , he would tell the jury that Manafort conspired with him in the bank-fraud scheme . That would markedly increase the likelihood that Manafort would be convicted of the bank-fraud charges . It would ratchet up the pressure on Manafort to plead guilty . It would help the investigation and prosecution .
Despite the prevalence of tax charges in the Virginia indictment , note that Mueller did not demand that Gates plead guilty to any of them , either . The manual ( in sec . 6-4.245 ) requires the Justice Department ’ s tax division to approve a prosecutor ’ s decision not to proceed on tax charges . Did Mueller , after months of painstaking work by revenue agents , announce a high-profile tax case against Gates only to get the tax division ’ s okay to drop it in less than 24 hours ? ( Mueller ’ s plea agreement with Gates drops the tax counts , among other charges — see agreement , p. 2 , para . 3 . )
Mueller ’ s pleading shenanigans are an affront to the Constitution ’ s separation of powers . To begin with , he undermines Congress ’ s clear intent to punish grave conspiracy offenses with severe penalties . He does this by making promiscuous use of the comparatively minor conspiracy offense set forth in Section 371 of the penal code . We will come momentarily to the manner in which Mueller distorts the fraud provision of this statute . For now , let ’ s focus on the penalty provision .
In its most frequently invoked part , Section 371 prescribes imprisonment for a mere zero to five years for those who conspire “ to commit any offense against the United States ” ( emphasis added ) . Federal prosecutors regard this as a “ catch-all ” provision because it covers all possible federal offenses , no matter how trivial . In particular , Section 371 embraces categories of minor crime that do not contain their own separate conspiracy provisions .
This is in stark contrast to categories of serious crimes — e.g. , narcotics trafficking , terrorism , racketeering , and others we ’ ll come to — for which Congress has enacted separate conspiracy statutes with far more severe penalties . When crimes in these categories occur , prosecutors are schooled that they must charge the conspiracy statute that Congress has tailored to that kind of offense , not the catch-all provision in Section 371 . A concrete example : If a defendant conspires to violate a person ’ s civil rights , the prosecutor must charge him under the “ conspiracy against rights ” statute ( Section 241 ) , in which Congress prescribes penalties of up to ten years ’ imprisonment , life imprisonment , or death , depending on the severity of the violation . Regardless of how anxious he is to induce a guilty plea , the prosecutor is not supposed to charge the case under Section 371 — which would limit the sentence to five years and thus enable the defendant to escape the more severe penalties Congress has decreed for civil-rights crimes .
But this is precisely what has been done by Mueller ’ s team , led in the Manafort-Gates prosecution by Andrew Weissmann . In his sensational narrative of the two-count case to which Gates is pleading guilty , the special counsel “ informs the Court ” that Gates and Manafort “ generated tens of millions of dollars in income ” through allegedly illegitimate business in Ukraine and then “ laundered the money through scores of United States corporations , partnerships , and bank accounts. ” But after all this heavy breathing , we learn that Mueller does not charge Gates with money-laundering conspiracy — an offense for which , to repeat , Congress prescribes a penalty of up to 20 years ’ incarceration . In fact , money laundering does not even rate a mention in the statutory offenses the special counsel claims ( in Count One ) that Gates conspired to violate .
When , after 23 pages of atmospherics about gazillions in fraud on the financial system and the Treasury , we finally get down to the statutory offenses Mueller says that Gates conspired to commit , there are just two minor ones : ( a ) failure to file reports of foreign bank accounts ( the “ FBAR ” charges ) and ( b ) failure to register as a foreign agent ( the “ FARA ” charges , which include false statements to the Justice Department in that connection ) .
To be very specific , Mueller alleges that this was a conspiracy to commit “ the violations of law charged in Counts Three through Six and Ten through Twelve ” of the original indictment ( i.e. , the District of Columbia indictment that hypes the supposed money-laundering scheme that Mueller has abandoned in Gates ’ s plea ) . Notice something strange : Mueller omits Counts Seven through Nine , even though they , too , are FBAR counts . ( See Indictment , pp . 25–26 . )
First , the three FBAR counts Mueller included in the conspiracy ( Three through Six ) are the ones that involve Manafort , not Gates . Mueller has cut out of the conspiracy to which Gates was required to plead guilty the FBAR counts ( Seven through Nine ) that actually involve Gates himself . That is , having already spared Gates from the money-laundering , tax-fraud , and bank-fraud charges announced with such fanfare , Mueller is also shielding Gates from his own alleged FBAR violations .
Second , each of the FBAR charges against Gates in the original indictment had a ten-year maximum sentence under Section 5322 ( b ) of Title 31 , U.S. Code . Gates thus faced a combined 30 years ’ imprisonment on them . But FBAR statutes do not have their own conspiracy provision . By charging Gates with a single Section 371 conspiracy , rather than requiring him to plead guilty to a straight Section 5322 violation , Mueller effectively halved the potential maximum sentence from ten to five years . Moreover , to repeat , the special counsel has stripped Gates ’ s own FBAR offenses out of the conspiracy . He is now depicted as a mere accomplice in Manafort ’ s separate FBAR crimes .
Now let ’ s move on to the FARA aspect of the conspiracy ( Counts Ten through Twelve ) . It seems straightforward : Gates and Manafort are alleged to have acted as foreign agents of the political party that ruled Ukraine for a time ; to have failed to register as such ; and to have made false statements to the government about that work .
Yet , the Justice Department virtually never brings criminal charges against FARA violators ; the failure to register is handled by encouraging foreign agents to comply with the law . Forcing Gates to plead guilty to this charge seems odd , then , to those of us who recall former FBI director James Comey ’ s recommendation against prosecution for a much more serious offense : Hillary Clinton ’ s mishandling of classified information . Even though Mrs. Clinton ’ s conduct may literally have violated a criminal statute , Comey dubiously rationalized that indicting her would be an improper selective prosecution for conduct the Justice Department virtually never treats as a felony . “ No reasonable prosecutor , ” we were told , would charge a case under such circumstances .
But perhaps Mueller reasons ( ahem ) that this is the rare FARA case that warrants prosecution . After all , Gates and Manafort not only failed to register ; they lied to cover up their Ukrainian work . This , then , brings us to the special counsel ’ s other theory for prosecuting Gates over the FARA misconduct — the newfangled , ever-elastic “ conspiracy against the United States . ”
As I pointed out when Mueller first indicted Manafort and Gates , there is no such offense in federal law as “ conspiracy against the United States. ” What Section 371 criminalizes ( besides the afore-described conspiracy “ to commit any offense ” under federal penal law ) is conspiracy “ to defraud the United States ” ( emphasis added ) .
Defraud is a loaded word that prosecutors have a notorious history of stretching beyond recognition . Because an important purpose of the criminal law is to put people of average intelligence on notice of what is forbidden , words in criminal statutes are construed in accordance with their commonsense meaning . The common understanding of “ defraud ” is illegally to obtain money or property from someone by deception . To defraud the United States , then , is to swindle or embezzle from its government . Nevertheless , relying on extravagant precedents from federal circuit courts of appeal , the Justice Department instructs that fraud can theoretically be expanded to include “ any willful impairment of the legitimate functions of government. ” ( See U.S . Attorneys Manual , Criminal Resource Manual Section 923 . )
Mueller has taken this expansive construction and run with it : Anything that two or more people do that in any way hampers the ability of Leviathan to perform its metastasizing functions could conceivably be an actionable “ conspiracy against the United States , ” even if Congress has not seen fit to criminalize it . Thus , two people who fail to register as foreign agents do not just conspire to violate FARA ; they “ conspire against the United States ” by impairing the Justice Department ’ s maintenance of an accurate foreign-agent registry . Two people who fail to file foreign-bank forms “ conspire against the United States ” by impairing the Treasury Department ’ s monitoring of assets held by Americans overseas .
. . . And , just to extend this logic , let ’ s say a president and his subordinates were to fire the FBI director or consider firing a special counsel . Even if the Constitution permits this and no law directly forbids it , mightn ’ t they , too , be deemed to have “ conspired against the United States ” by impairing the government ’ s investigative functions ?
The Supreme Court has never ruled on this theory that prosecutors are empowered to legislate previously unknown crimes on the rationale that government functions have somehow been undermined . The High Court has , however , invalidated a theory that is very close . In the 1980s , the Justice Department attempted to use the federal mail-fraud statute to prosecute corrupt public officials . Prosecutors did not just claim that the officials had stolen money or tangible property ; they further theorized that “ fraud ” included the concept of depriving citizens and the government itself of their “ intangible right ” to have public affairs conducted honestly .
In its 1987 ruling in McNally v. United States , the Supreme Court rejected the notion that prosecutors could construct a “ deprivation of honest services ” crime out of a fraud statute , and it chastised the lower courts for indulging this errant interpretation . The justices reaffirmed the Court ’ s long-held conclusion that
the words “ to defraud ” commonly refer to wronging one in his property rights by dishonest methods or schemes , and usually signify the deprivation of something of value of by trick , deceit , chicane or overreaching .
In the fraud statute , the Court reasoned , Congress was focused on “ frauds involving money or property. ” If there were any ambiguity about this , Congress could clear it up by enacting a more expansive statute “ in clear and definite language. ” But , the justices admonished , “ there are no constructive offenses ” — prosecutors have to content themselves with misconduct that “ is plainly within the statute ” ; only the legislature has the power to invent new crimes .
The lesson is clear : The concept of fraud , including fraud on the government , is to be given its traditional , commonsense meaning of a deprivation of money or tangible property .
Congress promptly took up the Court ’ s invitation and enacted a fraud statute that expressly targeted schemes to deprive people of “ the intangible right of honest services. ” ( See Sec . 1346 of the penal code . ) Even more than “ defraud , ” however , the elusive term “ honest services ” proved ripe for prosecutorial overreach . After defendants repeatedly challenged the statute on vagueness grounds , the Supreme Court finally limited it , in Skilling v. United States ( 2010 ) , to cases involving bribes and kickbacks .
The lesson is clear : The concept of fraud , including fraud on the government , is to be given its traditional , commonsense meaning of a deprivation of money or tangible property . If there is to be criminalization of other kinds of schemes that deprive the government , not of its tangible assets , but of its capacity to carry out its functions effectively , it is for Congress to proscribe these schemes in clear criminal statutes . Prosecutors may not legislate new crimes by mushrooming the definition of “ fraud . ”
Think about how bizarre this is . For public consumption , the special counsel alleges breathtaking felony offenses — bank fraud , tax fraud , and money laundering , crimes involving over $ 100 million when aggregated . Yet , to obtain a guilty plea from one of the allegedly serious felons , Mueller finds it necessary to abandon the hair-raising felonies he purports to have found . If these felonies are readily provable , as Mueller has claimed in his indictments , they are supposed to form the basis of any plea under Justice Department policy . If Gates is the mega-criminal nine-digit fraudster the special counsel has portrayed , he is not supposed to get a slap on the wrist . Yet Mueller accepts a plea to minor charges , including a Section 371 conspiracy that is a prosecutorial invention — designed to shield the allegedly serious felon from penalties Congress has decreed for the misconduct involved .
These charges against Gates and Manafort have nothing to do with “ collusion with Russia , ” the investigation for which Rosenstein appointed Mueller . There is no reason this case could not have been prosecuted by regular Justice Department lawyers . There was no need for a special counsel for this . And regular Justice Department prosecutors , overseen by engaged Justice Department superiors ensuring adherence to well-established Justice Department policies , would not prosecute a case this way .","Special Counsel Robert Mueller in June 2017 ((Reuters/Aaron P. Bernstein))

By giving Gates a pass on the bank-fraud (and tax-fraud, and money-laundering) charges, Mueller signals that these allegations are inflated. A jury could well feel justified in giving Manafort a pass on them, too.

By contrast, let’s imagine that Mueller had followed Justice Department protocols by insisting to Gates that nothing less than a guilty plea to the most serious readily provable charge — a 30-year bank-fraud count — would suffice. In his plea allocution, Gates would inevitably have implicated Manafort as his bank-fraud co-conspirator. Manafort would know that, were Gates to testify at trial, he would tell the jury that Manafort conspired with him in the bank-fraud scheme. That would markedly increase the likelihood that Manafort would be convicted of the bank-fraud charges. It would ratchet up the pressure on Manafort to plead guilty. It would help the investigation and prosecution.

Despite the prevalence of tax charges in the Virginia indictment, note that Mueller did not demand that Gates plead guilty to any of them, either. The manual (in sec. 6-4.245) requires the Justice Department’s tax division to approve a prosecutor’s decision not to proceed on tax charges. Did Mueller, after months of painstaking work by revenue agents, announce a high-profile tax case against Gates only to get the tax division’s okay to drop it in less than 24 hours? (Mueller’s plea agreement with Gates drops the tax counts, among other charges — see agreement, p. 2, para. 3.)

But we’re just getting warmed up.



Using the ‘Catch-all’ Conspiracy Statute to Slash Sentencing Exposure

Mueller’s pleading shenanigans are an affront to the Constitution’s separation of powers. To begin with, he undermines Congress’s clear intent to punish grave conspiracy offenses with severe penalties. He does this by making promiscuous use of the comparatively minor conspiracy offense set forth in Section 371 of the penal code. We will come momentarily to the manner in which Mueller distorts the fraud provision of this statute. For now, let’s focus on the penalty provision.

In its most frequently invoked part, Section 371 prescribes imprisonment for a mere zero to five years for those who conspire “to commit any offense against the United States” (emphasis added). Federal prosecutors regard this as a “catch-all” provision because it covers all possible federal offenses, no matter how trivial. In particular, Section 371 embraces categories of minor crime that do not contain their own separate conspiracy provisions.

This is in stark contrast to categories of serious crimes — e.g., narcotics trafficking, terrorism, racketeering, and others we’ll come to — for which Congress has enacted separate conspiracy statutes with far more severe penalties. When crimes in these categories occur, prosecutors are schooled that they must charge the conspiracy statute that Congress has tailored to that kind of offense, not the catch-all provision in Section 371. A concrete example: If a defendant conspires to violate a person’s civil rights, the prosecutor must charge him under the “conspiracy against rights” statute (Section 241), in which Congress prescribes penalties of up to ten years’ imprisonment, life imprisonment, or death, depending on the severity of the violation. Regardless of how anxious he is to induce a guilty plea, the prosecutor is not supposed to charge the case under Section 371 — which would limit the sentence to five years and thus enable the defendant to escape the more severe penalties Congress has decreed for civil-rights crimes.

But this is precisely what has been done by Mueller’s team, led in the Manafort-Gates prosecution by Andrew Weissmann. In his sensational narrative of the two-count case to which Gates is pleading guilty, the special counsel “informs the Court” that Gates and Manafort “generated tens of millions of dollars in income” through allegedly illegitimate business in Ukraine and then “laundered the money through scores of United States corporations, partnerships, and bank accounts.” But after all this heavy breathing, we learn that Mueller does not charge Gates with money-laundering conspiracy — an offense for which, to repeat, Congress prescribes a penalty of up to 20 years’ incarceration. In fact, money laundering does not even rate a mention in the statutory offenses the special counsel claims (in Count One) that Gates conspired to violate.

When, after 23 pages of atmospherics about gazillions in fraud on the financial system and the Treasury, we finally get down to the statutory offenses Mueller says that Gates conspired to commit, there are just two minor ones: (a) failure to file reports of foreign bank accounts (the “FBAR” charges) and (b) failure to register as a foreign agent (the “FARA” charges, which include false statements to the Justice Department in that connection).

To be very specific, Mueller alleges that this was a conspiracy to commit “the violations of law charged in Counts Three through Six and Ten through Twelve” of the original indictment (i.e., the District of Columbia indictment that hypes the supposed money-laundering scheme that Mueller has abandoned in Gates’s plea). Notice something strange: Mueller omits Counts Seven through Nine, even though they, too, are FBAR counts. (See Indictment, pp. 25–26.)

What’s going on here? Some remarkable sleight-of-hand.

What’s going on here? Some remarkable sleight-of-hand.

First, the three FBAR counts Mueller included in the conspiracy (Three through Six) are the ones that involve Manafort, not Gates. Mueller has cut out of the conspiracy to which Gates was required to plead guilty the FBAR counts (Seven through Nine) that actually involve Gates himself. That is, having already spared Gates from the money-laundering, tax-fraud, and bank-fraud charges announced with such fanfare, Mueller is also shielding Gates from his own alleged FBAR violations.

Second, each of the FBAR charges against Gates in the original indictment had a ten-year maximum sentence under Section 5322(b) of Title 31, U.S. Code. Gates thus faced a combined 30 years’ imprisonment on them. But FBAR statutes do not have their own conspiracy provision. By charging Gates with a single Section 371 conspiracy, rather than requiring him to plead guilty to a straight Section 5322 violation, Mueller effectively halved the potential maximum sentence from ten to five years. Moreover, to repeat, the special counsel has stripped Gates’s own FBAR offenses out of the conspiracy. He is now depicted as a mere accomplice in Manafort’s separate FBAR crimes.

Now let’s move on to the FARA aspect of the conspiracy (Counts Ten through Twelve). It seems straightforward: Gates and Manafort are alleged to have acted as foreign agents of the political party that ruled Ukraine for a time; to have failed to register as such; and to have made false statements to the government about that work.

Yet, the Justice Department virtually never brings criminal charges against FARA violators; the failure to register is handled by encouraging foreign agents to comply with the law. Forcing Gates to plead guilty to this charge seems odd, then, to those of us who recall former FBI director James Comey’s recommendation against prosecution for a much more serious offense: Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified information. Even though Mrs. Clinton’s conduct may literally have violated a criminal statute, Comey dubiously rationalized that indicting her would be an improper selective prosecution for conduct the Justice Department virtually never treats as a felony. “No reasonable prosecutor,” we were told, would charge a case under such circumstances.



‘Conspiracy against the United States’

But perhaps Mueller reasons (ahem) that this is the rare FARA case that warrants prosecution. After all, Gates and Manafort not only failed to register; they lied to cover up their Ukrainian work. This, then, brings us to the special counsel’s other theory for prosecuting Gates over the FARA misconduct — the newfangled, ever-elastic “conspiracy against the United States.”

As I pointed out when Mueller first indicted Manafort and Gates, there is no such offense in federal law as “conspiracy against the United States.” What Section 371 criminalizes (besides the afore-described conspiracy “to commit any offense” under federal penal law) is conspiracy “to defraud the United States” (emphasis added).

Defraud is a loaded word that prosecutors have a notorious history of stretching beyond recognition. Because an important purpose of the criminal law is to put people of average intelligence on notice of what is forbidden, words in criminal statutes are construed in accordance with their commonsense meaning. The common understanding of “defraud” is illegally to obtain money or property from someone by deception. To defraud the United States, then, is to swindle or embezzle from its government. Nevertheless, relying on extravagant precedents from federal circuit courts of appeal, the Justice Department instructs that fraud can theoretically be expanded to include “any willful impairment of the legitimate functions of government.” (See U.S. Attorneys Manual, Criminal Resource Manual Section 923.)

Mueller has taken this expansive construction and run with it: Anything that two or more people do that in any way hampers the ability of Leviathan to perform its metastasizing functions could conceivably be an actionable “conspiracy against the United States,” even if Congress has not seen fit to criminalize it. Thus, two people who fail to register as foreign agents do not just conspire to violate FARA; they “conspire against the United States” by impairing the Justice Department’s maintenance of an accurate foreign-agent registry. Two people who fail to file foreign-bank forms “conspire against the United States” by impairing the Treasury Department’s monitoring of assets held by Americans overseas.

. . . And, just to extend this logic, let’s say a president and his subordinates were to fire the FBI director or consider firing a special counsel. Even if the Constitution permits this and no law directly forbids it, mightn’t they, too, be deemed to have “conspired against the United States” by impairing the government’s investigative functions?

The Supreme Court has never ruled on this theory that prosecutors are empowered to legislate previously unknown crimes on the rationale that government functions have somehow been undermined. The High Court has, however, invalidated a theory that is very close. In the 1980s, the Justice Department attempted to use the federal mail-fraud statute to prosecute corrupt public officials. Prosecutors did not just claim that the officials had stolen money or tangible property; they further theorized that “fraud” included the concept of depriving citizens and the government itself of their “intangible right” to have public affairs conducted honestly.

In its 1987 ruling in McNally v. United States, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that prosecutors could construct a “deprivation of honest services” crime out of a fraud statute, and it chastised the lower courts for indulging this errant interpretation. The justices reaffirmed the Court’s long-held conclusion that

the words “to defraud” commonly refer to wronging one in his property rights by dishonest methods or schemes, and usually signify the deprivation of something of value of by trick, deceit, chicane or overreaching.

(Emphasis added; citations and internal quotation marks omitted.)

In the fraud statute, the Court reasoned, Congress was focused on “frauds involving money or property.” If there were any ambiguity about this, Congress could clear it up by enacting a more expansive statute “in clear and definite language.” But, the justices admonished, “there are no constructive offenses” — prosecutors have to content themselves with misconduct that “is plainly within the statute”; only the legislature has the power to invent new crimes.

The lesson is clear: The concept of fraud, including fraud on the government, is to be given its traditional, commonsense meaning of a deprivation of money or tangible property.

Congress promptly took up the Court’s invitation and enacted a fraud statute that expressly targeted schemes to deprive people of “the intangible right of honest services.” (See Sec. 1346 of the penal code.) Even more than “defraud,” however, the elusive term “honest services” proved ripe for prosecutorial overreach. After defendants repeatedly challenged the statute on vagueness grounds, the Supreme Court finally limited it, in Skilling v. United States (2010), to cases involving bribes and kickbacks.

The lesson is clear: The concept of fraud, including fraud on the government, is to be given its traditional, commonsense meaning of a deprivation of money or tangible property. If there is to be criminalization of other kinds of schemes that deprive the government, not of its tangible assets, but of its capacity to carry out its functions effectively, it is for Congress to proscribe these schemes in clear criminal statutes. Prosecutors may not legislate new crimes by mushrooming the definition of “fraud.”

Yet this is exactly what Mueller is doing.

Think about how bizarre this is. For public consumption, the special counsel alleges breathtaking felony offenses — bank fraud, tax fraud, and money laundering, crimes involving over $100 million when aggregated. Yet, to obtain a guilty plea from one of the allegedly serious felons, Mueller finds it necessary to abandon the hair-raising felonies he purports to have found. If these felonies are readily provable, as Mueller has claimed in his indictments, they are supposed to form the basis of any plea under Justice Department policy. If Gates is the mega-criminal nine-digit fraudster the special counsel has portrayed, he is not supposed to get a slap on the wrist. Yet Mueller accepts a plea to minor charges, including a Section 371 conspiracy that is a prosecutorial invention — designed to shield the allegedly serious felon from penalties Congress has decreed for the misconduct involved.

These charges against Gates and Manafort have nothing to do with “collusion with Russia,” the investigation for which Rosenstein appointed Mueller. There is no reason this case could not have been prosecuted by regular Justice Department lawyers. There was no need for a special counsel for this. And regular Justice Department prosecutors, overseen by engaged Justice Department superiors ensuring adherence to well-established Justice Department policies, would not prosecute a case this way.

( Leah Millis/Reuters )
Instead of praising Barr for releasing to the public what amounts to an off-the-shelf roadmap for impeachment , Democrats are cavalierly talking about throwing Barr in jail .
Ever since Donald Trump came down that Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy for president , we ’ ve heard a great deal about the abuse of norms — constitutional norms , democratic norms , norms of decency , all kinds of norms . For Trump supporters , the president ’ s frequent violations of norms , while occasionally regrettable , were for the most part welcome because they proved he was willing to fight to win . This was necessary , the theory went , because the Left didn ’ t care about norms anymore ; they only cared about winning .
But this view — that the other side plays dirty so we must too — is hardly new to American politics . The sentiment is practically baked into politics . But the degree and intensity of the baking has increased and has come to define whichever side has been out of power over the past few decades .
President Clinton ’ s impeachment on charges of lying under oath to a federal grand jury and obstructing justice came after years of frustration with what was perceived as “ Slick Willie ’ s ” flouting of political norms . The 2000 presidential election recount in Florida and the Supreme Court ’ s role in settling the Bush-Gore recount dispute was all the evidence progressive online activists ( called the “ netroots ” in pre-Twitter nomenclature ) needed to argue that Democrats needed “ fighting Dems ” to play as dirty as they imagined Karl Rove , Bush ’ s supposed Rasputin , was playing .
Partisans invariably think the other side is cheating perhaps just a little bit more than they really are , so when they decide to fight fire with fire , they emulate the worst-imagined tactics of the enemy , creating a race-to-the-bottom dynamic .
And that brings us to the Democrats ’ rush to create a “ constitutional crisis ” where there isn ’ t one . Last week , the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for refusing to hand over a fully unredacted version of the Mueller report in compliance with a subpoena .
It ’ s a wild overreaction given that Barr ’ s decision to release the Mueller report almost in its entirety was purely discretionary . By law , and by custom , Barr was under no obligation to release anything , since the norm is for the Department of Justice to stay silent if it fails to find prosecutable crimes . His only objectionable transgression against traditional norms was offering a Trump-friendly memo accurately , if tendentiously , summarizing the report ’ s conclusions .
That was enough for Democrats to lock in to a “ cover-up ” narrative . Never mind that Barr soon waived all executive privilege claims and released the whole report , redacting only a sliver of material that relied on confidential grand jury testimony and a few sentences that might reveal sources and methods of intelligence gathering . The latter is stuff the Russians would presumably love to see , the former is stuff Barr is barred by law from releasing . If you read the report — and by the fact that you can read it — it ’ s clear there was no cover-up .
As a compromise , Barr invited congressional leaders to look at an even more unredacted version . Representative Jerrold Nadler ( D. , N.Y. ) , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , refused to even look at the report , saying a 99.9 percent redaction-free report wasn ’ t good enough . The notion that a few sentences of blacked-out information are the real “ smoking gun ” is absurd .
Instead of praising Barr for releasing to the public what amounts to an off-the-shelf roadmap for impeachment , Barr is not only being charged with contempt , but Democrats are cavalierly talking about throwing Barr in jail .
The Democrats are on much better legal footing in their pursuit of the president ’ s tax returns , but even here the effort amounts to responding to one violation of norms with another .
Trump should have abided by custom and released his returns , as past presidents have done and as he said he would . But the law says Congress can demand to see them . The law is a bad one prone to abuse , but the Trump administration will still have to comply .

Instead of praising Barr for releasing to the public what amounts to an off-the-shelf roadmap for impeachment, Democrats are cavalierly talking about throwing Barr in jail.

Ever since Donald Trump came down that Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy for president, we’ve heard a great deal about the abuse of norms — constitutional norms, democratic norms, norms of decency, all kinds of norms. For Trump supporters, the president’s frequent violations of norms, while occasionally regrettable, were for the most part welcome because they proved he was willing to fight to win. This was necessary, the theory went, because the Left didn’t care about norms anymore; they only cared about winning.

But this view — that the other side plays dirty so we must too — is hardly new to American politics. The sentiment is practically baked into politics. But the degree and intensity of the baking has increased and has come to define whichever side has been out of power over the past few decades.

President Clinton’s impeachment on charges of lying under oath to a federal grand jury and obstructing justice came after years of frustration with what was perceived as “Slick Willie’s” flouting of political norms. The 2000 presidential election recount in Florida and the Supreme Court’s role in settling the Bush-Gore recount dispute was all the evidence progressive online activists (called the “netroots” in pre-Twitter nomenclature) needed to argue that Democrats needed “fighting Dems” to play as dirty as they imagined Karl Rove, Bush’s supposed Rasputin, was playing.

Partisans invariably think the other side is cheating perhaps just a little bit more than they really are, so when they decide to fight fire with fire, they emulate the worst-imagined tactics of the enemy, creating a race-to-the-bottom dynamic.

And that brings us to the Democrats’ rush to create a “constitutional crisis” where there isn’t one. Last week, the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for refusing to hand over a fully unredacted version of the Mueller report in compliance with a subpoena.

It’s a wild overreaction given that Barr’s decision to release the Mueller report almost in its entirety was purely discretionary. By law, and by custom, Barr was under no obligation to release anything, since the norm is for the Department of Justice to stay silent if it fails to find prosecutable crimes. His only objectionable transgression against traditional norms was offering a Trump-friendly memo accurately, if tendentiously, summarizing the report’s conclusions.

That was enough for Democrats to lock in to a “cover-up” narrative. Never mind that Barr soon waived all executive privilege claims and released the whole report, redacting only a sliver of material that relied on confidential grand jury testimony and a few sentences that might reveal sources and methods of intelligence gathering. The latter is stuff the Russians would presumably love to see, the former is stuff Barr is barred by law from releasing. If you read the report — and by the fact that you can read it — it’s clear there was no cover-up.

As a compromise, Barr invited congressional leaders to look at an even more unredacted version. Representative Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, refused to even look at the report, saying a 99.9 percent redaction-free report wasn’t good enough. The notion that a few sentences of blacked-out information are the real “smoking gun” is absurd.

Instead of praising Barr for releasing to the public what amounts to an off-the-shelf roadmap for impeachment, Barr is not only being charged with contempt, but Democrats are cavalierly talking about throwing Barr in jail.

The Democrats are on much better legal footing in their pursuit of the president’s tax returns, but even here the effort amounts to responding to one violation of norms with another.

Trump should have abided by custom and released his returns, as past presidents have done and as he said he would. But the law says Congress can demand to see them. The law is a bad one prone to abuse, but the Trump administration will still have to comply. But in listening to Democrats explain why they want the returns, you can see how corrupting the desire to get Trump has become.

On MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Representative Bill Pascrell Jr. (D., N.J.) offered his reason for wanting the tax returns: to rub the truth in the faces of “the people who follow Mr. Trump, his base.” Pascrell wants them to say, “We’ve been had.” “I can’t wait for that to happen,” he added.

Pascrell will be sorely disappointed by the capacity of Trump’s base to absorb negative revelations about the president. But that’s beside the point. The White House is wrong when it claims Congress must have a “legislative purpose” to see the returns. But democratic norms suggest that Congress shouldn’t require confidential tax returns to be spilled out just for the purpose of saying “nyah, nyah” to voters or to prove that Democrats are just as willing to fight dirty.

Can the republic survive Attorney General William Barr?

That’s the question that has seized the media and center-left, which have worked themselves into a full-blown panic over an attorney general who is, inarguably, a serious legal figure and one of the adults in the room late in President Trump’s first term.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler , D-N.Y. , over the weekend said his panel would “ immediately open an investigation ” into the removal of Geoffrey Berman , as part of its larger-scale investigation into what he called Attorney General Bill Barr ’ s “ unacceptable politicization ” of the Justice Department . Trump apparently fired Berman after he refused to step down , though the president has since distanced himself from the process .
GRAHAM SAYS HE WO N'T ADVANCE TRUMP NOMINEE FOR SDNY PROSECUTOR WITHOUT SCHUMER , GILLIBRAND CONSENT
“ Attorney General Bill Barr told us that Geoffrey Berman of the SDNY had resigned—which was untrue , ” Nadler wrote . “ Barr told us that the president asked him to fire Mr. Berman—which may also be untrue , given that the president says he had nothing to do with the decision . ”
Nadler added : “ The whole thing smacks of corruption and incompetence , which is what we have come to expect from this President and his Attorney General . ”
Nadler noted that neither the White House nor the Justice Department offered an explanation for Berman ’ s removal .
“ We know that the U.S. Attorney ’ s Office for the Southern District of New York is engaged in investigations aimed at President Trump ’ s inner circle , ” Nadler said . “ We know , from revelations earlier this week , that the President wanted to have ‘ his own people ’ in that office to help him with his personal and political needs . And we know that , time and time again , Bill Barr has reached into ongoing criminal investigations in order to protect the President from their consequences . ”
Nadler ’ s comments come just days after he issued subpoenas for Justice Department officials Aaron S.J . Zelinsky and John W. Elias , who had filed complaints about the “ unprecedented politicization ” at the DOJ under Barr ’ s leadership .
Nadler said the two DOJ officials will testify Wednesday and will “ explain why Barr ’ s attempt to fire Mr. Berman is part of a larger , ongoing , and wholly unacceptable pattern of conduct . ”
“ If the President removes Mr. Berman , then we will take additional steps to secure his testimony as well , ” Nadler said .
Nadler also said over the weekend that he is “ sure ” Berman will testify before Congress .
US ATTORNEY IN NEW YORK DISPUTES BARR CLAIM THAT HE 'S RESIGNING
Meanwhile , House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , also said he hoped that Berman would testify on Capitol Hill , calling the move a part of “ the most disastrous management of the Justice Department in modern memory . ”
Schiff told NBC News ’ “ Meet the Press ” that “ it doesn ’ t come as a surprise ” but it is “ completely demoralizing to the people in the department and dangerous to the rule of law . ”
Meanwhile , the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee , Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif. , called on committee Chairman Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , to launch an investigation and hearings “ regarding political interference in the work of the Justice Department ” and into Berman ’ s removal .
Feinstein also called on Graham to invite Berman himself to testify .
“ Attorney General Barr ’ s intervention in matters that involve the President and his associates undermines the integrity and independence of the Department of Justice , ” Feinstein wrote in a letter to Graham . “ His actions cast doubt on the ability of career Justice Department officials to follow the facts where they lead and to pursue justice in all cases , without fear or favor . ”
The calls to probe Berman ’ s ouster come after Barr , on Friday night , announced that he would be stepping down from his post at SDNY . Barr and the White House then announced that the president would nominate Jay Clayton , the current chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , to replace him .
But Berman put out a statement saying he learned of his “ departure ” from Barr ’ s press release and had no intention of leaving the job .
“ I learned in a press release from the Attorney General tonight that I was ‘ stepping down ’ as United States Attorney , '' Berman said in a statement . `` I have not resigned , and have no intention of resigning , my position , to which I was appointed by the Judges of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York . ”
Berman said he 'd continue to move forward with his investigations and would only leave the post when the Senate confirms his replacement .
BARR SAID TRUMP FIRED SDNY PROSECUTOR WHO REFUSED TO LEAVE , TRUMP SAYS HE 'S 'NOT INVOLVED '
By Saturday , Barr , in a letter to Berman , informed him that the president had removed him from his post . Barr wrote that he asked Trump to fire Berman after his Friday night statement .
`` Unfortunately , with your statement of last night , you have chosen public spectacle over public service , '' Barr said in the letter . `` Because you have declared that you have no intention of resigning , I have asked the President to remove you as of today , and he has done so . ”

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., over the weekend said his panel would “immediately open an investigation” into the removal of Geoffrey Berman, as part of its larger-scale investigation into what he called Attorney General Bill Barr’s “unacceptable politicization” of the Justice Department. Trump apparently fired Berman after he refused to step down, though the president has since distanced himself from the process.

GRAHAM SAYS HE WON'T ADVANCE TRUMP NOMINEE FOR SDNY PROSECUTOR WITHOUT SCHUMER, GILLIBRAND CONSENT

“Attorney General Bill Barr told us that Geoffrey Berman of the SDNY had resigned—which was untrue,” Nadler wrote. “Barr told us that the president asked him to fire Mr. Berman—which may also be untrue, given that the president says he had nothing to do with the decision.”

Nadler added: “The whole thing smacks of corruption and incompetence, which is what we have come to expect from this President and his Attorney General.”

Nadler noted that neither the White House nor the Justice Department offered an explanation for Berman’s removal.

“We know that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York is engaged in investigations aimed at President Trump’s inner circle,” Nadler said. “We know, from revelations earlier this week, that the President wanted to have ‘his own people’ in that office to help him with his personal and political needs. And we know that, time and time again, Bill Barr has reached into ongoing criminal investigations in order to protect the President from their consequences.”

Nadler’s comments come just days after he issued subpoenas for Justice Department officials Aaron S.J. Zelinsky and John W. Elias, who had filed complaints about the “unprecedented politicization” at the DOJ under Barr’s leadership.

Nadler said the two DOJ officials will testify Wednesday and will “explain why Barr’s attempt to fire Mr. Berman is part of a larger, ongoing, and wholly unacceptable pattern of conduct.”

“If the President removes Mr. Berman, then we will take additional steps to secure his testimony as well,” Nadler said.

Nadler also said over the weekend that he is “sure” Berman will testify before Congress.

US ATTORNEY IN NEW YORK DISPUTES BARR CLAIM THAT HE'S RESIGNING

Meanwhile, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., also said he hoped that Berman would testify on Capitol Hill, calling the move a part of “the most disastrous management of the Justice Department in modern memory.”

Schiff told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” that “it doesn’t come as a surprise” but it is “completely demoralizing to the people in the department and dangerous to the rule of law.”

Meanwhile, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., called on committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., to launch an investigation and hearings “regarding political interference in the work of the Justice Department” and into Berman’s removal.

Feinstein also called on Graham to invite Berman himself to testify.

“Attorney General Barr’s intervention in matters that involve the President and his associates undermines the integrity and independence of the Department of Justice,” Feinstein wrote in a letter to Graham. “His actions cast doubt on the ability of career Justice Department officials to follow the facts where they lead and to pursue justice in all cases, without fear or favor.”

The calls to probe Berman’s ouster come after Barr, on Friday night, announced that he would be stepping down from his post at SDNY. Barr and the White House then announced that the president would nominate Jay Clayton, the current chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to replace him.

But Berman put out a statement saying he learned of his “departure” from Barr’s press release and had no intention of leaving the job.

“I learned in a press release from the Attorney General tonight that I was ‘stepping down’ as United States Attorney,"" Berman said in a statement. ""I have not resigned, and have no intention of resigning, my position, to which I was appointed by the Judges of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.”

Berman said he'd continue to move forward with his investigations and would only leave the post when the Senate confirms his replacement.

BARR SAID TRUMP FIRED SDNY PROSECUTOR WHO REFUSED TO LEAVE, TRUMP SAYS HE'S 'NOT INVOLVED'

By Saturday, Barr, in a letter to Berman, informed him that the president had removed him from his post. Barr wrote that he asked Trump to fire Berman after his Friday night statement.

""Unfortunately, with your statement of last night, you have chosen public spectacle over public service,"" Barr said in the letter. ""Because you have declared that you have no intention of resigning, I have asked the President to remove you as of today, and he has done so.”

Barr said Deputy U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss will take over until a permanent successor is in place.

Berman said he would leave ""immediately"" and expressed strong confidence that Strauss can lead the SDNY with integrity and independence.

Trump, however, distanced himself from Berman's ouster Saturday as he left the White House for Tulsa, Okla., and said it was Barr's call.

""That's all up to the attorney general,"" Trump said when asked about Berman's firing. ""Attorney General Barr is working on that. That's his department, not my department.”

""We have a very capable attorney general so that's really up to him,"" Trump said before leaving for his first rally since March. ""I'm not involved.”

In another twist, Graham said he would not take up Clayton's expected nomination to the post unless New York's Democratic senators sign off, signaling the SEC chairman would have an uphill battle to assume the job.

Graham, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he will honor the ""blue slip"" tradition and require the consent of home-state senators to proceed -- in this case, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand.

Schumer and Gillibrand oppose Clayton's nomination and have called on him to withdraw his name from consideration.

Jury selection begins today in the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is accused of planting a bomb near the finish line of the Boston Marathon in 2013 that killed three people and injured more than 260.

Tsarnaev is facing 30 charges, including using a weapon of mass destruction. More than half those counts could result in the death penalty.

With that, here are five things you should know about the trial:

1. 'Not About Guilt':



NPR's Tovia Smith reports that prosecutors have amassed a trove of evidence linking Tsarnaev to the bombings. That's why Northeastern University law professor Daniel Medwed says, ""This case is not about guilt.""

""In my mind,"" Medwed adds, ""this case is really about whether or not he's going to get the death penalty.""

2. Influenced By His Brother:

CBS News reports on the defense strategy in the case:

""The defense has implied in court documents and motions it plans to show Tsarnaev was under the psychological control of his older brother, Tamerlan. "" 'What this defense wants to show is whether or not this was a young man who was influenced and under the influence of his older brother who was the master mind,' CBS News legal analyst Rikki Klieman said.""

Remember, Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with police.

3. Jury Selection Will Take A Long Time:

USA Today explains that jury selection is perhaps the most complicated part of this case. The paper reports:

"" 'This jury selection process is going to be like very few others in a federal criminal case,' said Jeremy Sternberg, a former federal prosecutor who is a partner at Holland & Knight in Boston. 'It's going to take a very long time. ... Its importance cannot be overstated.' ""The scale of the attack was so vast that every potential juror could already know the case on a personal level. It was the largest act of terrorism in Boston's history, and its effects rippled across the region. The bombings left three people dead, injured more than 260 and led to at least 16 people having limbs amputated. The ensuing five-day manhunt climaxed with a daylong, citywide shutdown before Tsarnaev was captured hiding in a backyard boat.""

One big complicating factor: Everyone who was stuck at home that day could be considered a victim.

Because of that, 1,200 people are in the jury pool.

4. Most In Boston Don't Favor The Death Penalty:

A 2013 poll by The Boston Globe found:

""The poll, conducted Sept. 5 through Sept. 12, showed that 57 percent of respondents support a life sentence for Tsarnaev, compared with 33 percent who favor the death penalty. Although capital punishment is barred in Massachusetts, Tsarnaev has been indicted on federal charges, including using weapons of mass destruction, that could bring the death penalty.""

5. Who's Who:

NPR member station WBUR has put together a ""who's who"" of the Tsarnaev trial.

`` The fact of the matter is , Mr. chairman , it 's embarrassing , I apologize , '' Faris Fink said of the two videos produced for the conference at a cost of $ 50,187 .
Fink , the commissioner of the IRS ' Small Business and Self-Employment Division , donned pointy ears for his role as the Vulcan commander on a mission to bring effective tax practices to a faraway planet . That video opened the division 's conference in 2010 — the most expensive of the 225 conferences audited by the IRS 's inspector general in a report this week .
`` I swear to God , I have looked at that video over and over again , and I swear I do not see the redeeming value , '' said Rep. Elijah Cummings , D-Md. , the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee , which is investigating the $ 49 million in conference spending by the IRS from 2010 to 2012 .
He produced a copy of an e-mail between two Marriott hotel employees in Anaheim , noting that Anaheim 's bid for the conference was $ 1 million more than Orlando . `` This sounds like the hotel employees were mocking you , and even taking advantage of the IRS , '' Cummings said .
Chairman Darrell Issa , R-Calif. , said the Internal Revenue Service was `` effectively guilty of tax evasion '' when it gave employees lavish presidential suites , free meals and taxpayer-paid gifts without disclosing that as income . IRS officials said some local employees ineligible for travel expenses were given revised W-2 forms reflecting their expenses as taxable income .
That Anaheim conference cost at least $ 4.1 million — maybe more . When the IRS ' own inspector general audited the Anaheim conference , he found the documentation lacking , Inspector General J. Russell George told the committee Thursday .

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — The tax official responsible for a lavish, $4.1 million conference in Anaheim apologized to Congress for spending at the conference — and for his performance as Mr. Spock in a Star Trek parody video.

""The fact of the matter is, Mr. chairman, it's embarrassing, I apologize,"" Faris Fink said of the two videos produced for the conference at a cost of $50,187.

Fink, the commissioner of the IRS' Small Business and Self-Employment Division, donned pointy ears for his role as the Vulcan commander on a mission to bring effective tax practices to a faraway planet. That video opened the division's conference in 2010 — the most expensive of the 225 conferences audited by the IRS's inspector general in a report this week.

""I swear to God, I have looked at that video over and over again, and I swear I do not see the redeeming value,"" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, which is investigating the $49 million in conference spending by the IRS from 2010 to 2012.

He produced a copy of an e-mail between two Marriott hotel employees in Anaheim, noting that Anaheim's bid for the conference was $1 million more than Orlando. ""This sounds like the hotel employees were mocking you, and even taking advantage of the IRS,"" Cummings said.

STORY:IRS employee conferences cost taxpayers $49 million

Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said the Internal Revenue Service was ""effectively guilty of tax evasion"" when it gave employees lavish presidential suites, free meals and taxpayer-paid gifts without disclosing that as income. IRS officials said some local employees ineligible for travel expenses were given revised W-2 forms reflecting their expenses as taxable income.

That Anaheim conference cost at least $4.1 million — maybe more. When the IRS' own inspector general audited the Anaheim conference, he found the documentation lacking, Inspector General J. Russell George told the committee Thursday.

Danny Werfel, two weeks into his stint as acting IRS commissioner, called the conference ""an unfortunate vestige from a prior era."" He said the spending ""would not occur today."" Wednesday, he initiated termination proceedings against two employees for accepting free food at the conference in violation of ethics rules.

STORY:IRS disciplines employees over conference conduct

The conferences are the second scandal to break at the agency in as many months, following the revelation that the IRS inappropriately held up applications for tax-exempt status by groups with ""Tea Party"" or ""Patriots"" in their names.

Though the incidents are unrelated, both have managed to unite Republicans and Democrats in outrage. Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., said he was ""furious"" about the overspending — especially since he's been an advocate for more funding for the IRS.

""Lavish spending on conferences and absurd training videos is a deep betrayal of IRS supporters fighting to secure adequate resources for the agency, a slap in the face to the many dedicated rank-and-file IRS employees who are careful stewards of taxpayer dollars, and an affront to the American taxpayer,"" he said.

Werfel said the Internal Revenue Service has taken ""bold steps"" to make sure future travel and conference spending is appropriate, but did not elaborate.

Members of Congress say the IRS deliberately withheld information about the scandals from Congress. This week, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., asked for an investigation into why the Treasury Department did not include the IRS conferences in a 2012 report to Congress claiming that the department spent less than $500,000 on conferences over more than seven years.

The National Security Agency and its UK counterpart GCHQ have been developing capabilities to take advantage of `` leaky '' smartphone apps , such as the wildly popular Angry Birds game , that transmit users ' private information across the internet , according to top secret documents .
The data pouring onto communication networks from the new generation of iPhone and Android apps ranges from phone model and screen size to personal details such as age , gender and location . Some apps , the documents state , can share users ' most sensitive information such as sexual orientation – and one app recorded in the material even sends specific sexual preferences such as whether or not the user may be a swinger .
Many smartphone owners will be unaware of the full extent this information is being shared across the internet , and even the most sophisticated would be unlikely to realise that all of it is available for the spy agencies to collect .
Dozens of classified documents , provided to ███ by whistleblower Edward Snowden and reported in partnership with the New York Times and ProPublica , detail the NSA and GCHQ efforts to piggyback on this commercial data collection for their own purposes .
Scooping up information the apps are sending about their users allows the agencies to collect large quantities of mobile phone data from their existing mass surveillance tools – such as cable taps , or from international mobile networks – rather than solely from hacking into individual mobile handsets .
Exploiting phone information and location is a high-priority effort for the intelligence agencies , as terrorists and other intelligence targets make substantial use of phones in planning and carrying out their activities , for example by using phones as triggering devices in conflict zones . The NSA has cumulatively spent more than $ 1bn in its phone targeting efforts .
The disclosures also reveal how much the shift towards smartphone browsing could benefit spy agencies ' collection efforts .
One slide from a May 2010 NSA presentation on getting data from smartphones – breathlessly titled `` Golden Nugget ! '' – sets out the agency 's `` perfect scenario '' : `` Target uploading photo to a social media site taken with a mobile device . What can we get ? ''
The question is answered in the notes to the slide : from that event alone , the agency said it could obtain a `` possible image '' , email selector , phone , buddy lists , and `` a host of other social working data as well as location '' .
In practice , most major social media sites , such as Facebook and Twitter , strip photos of identifying location metadata ( known as EXIF data ) before publication . However , depending on when this is done during upload , such data may still , briefly , be available for collection by the agencies as it travels across the networks .
Depending on what profile information a user had supplied , the documents suggested , the agency would be able to collect almost every key detail of a user 's life : including home country , current location ( through geolocation ) , age , gender , zip code , marital status – options included `` single '' , `` married '' , `` divorced '' , `` swinger '' and more – income , ethnicity , sexual orientation , education level , and number of children .
The agencies also made use of their mobile interception capabilities to collect location information in bulk , from Google and other mapping apps . One basic effort by GCHQ and the NSA was to build a database geolocating every mobile phone mast in the world – meaning that just by taking tower ID from a handset , location information could be gleaned .
A more sophisticated effort , though , relied on intercepting Google Maps queries made on smartphones , and using them to collect large volumes of location information .
So successful was this effort that one 2008 document noted that `` [ i ] t effectively means that anyone using Google Maps on a smartphone is working in support of a GCHQ system . ''
The information generated by each app is chosen by its developers , or by the company that delivers an app 's adverts . The documents do not detail whether the agencies actually collect the potentially sensitive details some apps are capable of storing or transmitting , but any such information would likely qualify as content , rather than metadata .
Data collected from smartphone apps is subject to the same laws and minimisation procedures as all other NSA activity – procedures that the US president , Barack Obama , suggested may be subject to reform in a speech 10 days ago . But the president focused largely on the NSA 's collection of the metadata from US phone calls and made no mention in his address of the large amounts of data the agency collects from smartphone apps .
The latest disclosures could also add to mounting public concern about how the technology sector collects and uses information , especially for those outside the US , who enjoy fewer privacy protections than Americans . A January poll for the Washington Post showed 69 % of US adults were already concerned about how tech companies such as Google used and stored their information .
The documents do not make it clear how much of the information that can be taken from apps is routinely collected , stored or searched , nor how many users may be affected . The NSA says it does not target Americans and its capabilities are deployed only against `` valid foreign intelligence targets '' .
The documents do set out in great detail exactly how much information can be collected from widely popular apps . One document held on GCHQ 's internal Wikipedia-style guide for staff details what can be collected from different apps . Though it uses Android apps for most of its examples , it suggests much of the same data could be taken from equivalent apps on iPhone or other platforms .
The GCHQ documents set out examples of what information can be extracted from different ad platforms , using perhaps the most popular mobile phone game of all time , Angry Birds – which has reportedly been downloaded more than 1.7bn times – as a case study .
From some app platforms , relatively limited , but identifying , information such as exact handset model , the unique ID of the handset , software version , and similar details are all that are transmitted .
Other apps choose to transmit much more data , meaning the agency could potentially net far more . One mobile ad platform , Millennial Media , appeared to offer particularly rich information . Millennial Media 's website states it has partnered with Rovio on a special edition of Angry Birds ; with Farmville maker Zynga ; with Call of Duty developer Activision , and many other major franchises .
Rovio , the maker of Angry Birds , said it had no knowledge of any NSA or GCHQ programs looking to extract data from its apps users .
`` Rovio does n't have any previous knowledge of this matter , and have not been aware of such activity in 3rd party advertising networks , '' said Saara Bergström , Rovio 's VP of marketing and communications . `` Nor do we have any involvement with the organizations you mentioned [ NSA and GCHQ ] . ''
Millennial Media did not respond to a request for comment .
In December , the Washington Post reported on how the NSA could make use of advertising tracking files generated through normal internet browsing – known as cookies – from Google and others to get information on potential targets .
However , the richer personal data available to many apps , coupled with real-time geolocation , and the uniquely identifying handset information many apps transmit give the agencies a far richer data source than conventional web-tracking cookies .
Almost every major website uses cookies to serve targeted advertising and content , as well as streamline the experience for the user , for example by managing logins . One GCHQ document from 2010 notes that cookie data – which generally qualifies as metadata – has become just as important to the spies . In fact , the agencies were sweeping it up in such high volumes that their were struggling to store it .
`` They are gathered in bulk , and are currently our single largest type of events , '' the document stated .
The ability to obtain targeted intelligence by hacking individual handsets has been well documented , both through several years of hacker conferences and previous NSA disclosures in Der Spiegel , and both the NSA and GCHQ have extensive tools ready to deploy against iPhone , Android and other phone platforms .
GCHQ 's targeted tools against individual smartphones are named after characters in the TV series The Smurfs . An ability to make the phone 's microphone 'hot ' , to listen in to conversations , is named `` Nosey Smurf '' . High-precision geolocation is called `` Tracker Smurf '' , power management – an ability to stealthily activate an a phone that is apparently turned off – is `` Dreamy Smurf '' , while the spyware 's self-hiding capabilities are codenamed `` Paranoid Smurf '' .
Those capability names are set out in a much broader 2010 presentation that sheds light on spy agencies ' aspirations for mobile phone interception , and that less-documented mass-collection abilities .
The cover sheet of the document sets out the team 's aspirations :
Another slide details weak spots in where data flows from mobile phone network providers to the wider internet , where the agency attempts to intercept communications . These are locations either within a particular network , or international roaming exchanges ( known as GRXs ) , where data from travellers roaming outside their home country is routed .
These are particularly useful to the agency as data is often only weakly encrypted on such networks , and includes extra information such as handset ID or mobile number – much stronger target identifiers than usual IP addresses or similar information left behind when PCs and laptops browse the internet .
The NSA said its phone interception techniques are only used against valid targets , and are subject to stringent legal safeguards .
`` The communications of people who are not valid foreign intelligence targets are not of interest to the National Security Agency , '' said a spokeswoman in a statement .
`` Any implication that NSA 's foreign intelligence collection is focused on the smartphone or social media communications of everyday Americans is not true . Moreover , NSA does not profile everyday Americans as it carries out its foreign intelligence mission . We collect only those communications that we are authorized by law to collect for valid foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes – regardless of the technical means used by the targets .
`` Because some data of US persons may at times be incidentally collected in NSA 's lawful foreign intelligence mission , privacy protections for US persons exist across the entire process concerning the use , handling , retention , and dissemination of data . In addition , NSA actively works to remove extraneous data , to include that of innocent foreign citizens , as early as possible in the process .
`` Continuous and selective publication of specific techniques and tools lawfully used by NSA to pursue legitimate foreign intelligence targets is detrimental to the security of the United States and our allies – and places at risk those we are sworn to protect . ''
The NSA declined to respond to a series of queries on how routinely capabilities against apps were deployed , or on the specific minimisation procedures used to prevent US citizens ' information being stored through such measures .
GCHQ declined to comment on any of its specific programs , but stressed all of its activities were proportional and complied with UK law .
`` It is a longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters , '' said a spokesman .
`` Furthermore , all of GCHQ 's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework that ensures that our activities are authorised , necessary and proportionate , and that there is rigorous oversight , including from the Secretary of State , the Interception and Intelligence Services Commissioners and the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee . All our operational processes rigorously support this position . ''

The head of the Justice branch of the International Criminal Police Organization , or INTERPOL , told employees to “ earmark a spot ” for his son and “ provide extra attention to his processing for obvious reasons , ” said the department ’ s inspector general .
It ’ s not the first example of nepotism at Eric Holder ’ s Justice Department . A November investigation by the inspector general found that certain offices in the department had a “ pervasive culture of nepotism and favoritism. ” It ’ s at least the fifth inspector general report since 2004 to find hiring problems at the agency .
“ There is no room for nepotism in the federal government ’ s hiring practices , ” said Rep. Bob Goodlatte , a Virginia Republican and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee . “ Those hired to serve taxpayers must earn — not be given — the job . I urge the Department of Justice to take the appropriate disciplinary actions for such an abuse of authority . ”
The INTERPOL office ’ s Executive Director , Warren Lewis , also abused his position to help three people with connections to his son obtain jobs at the agency — even though he had never personally met two of them , investigators said .
“ Lewis had no personal knowledge of their professional abilities , ” the inspector general said . “ After the three individuals all failed to make the certified lists of qualified applicants , Lewis took steps to overcome their exclusion . ”
Ironically , Mr. Lewis is listed as the Justice Department ’ s Ethics Official for his office , according to department records .
Justice representatives said the agency is studying the inspector general ’ s conclusions .
“ The Inspector General ’ s report is currently being reviewed by the appropriate Department of Justice officials , ” said Patrick Rodenbush , a Justice spokesman .
The problems at the INTERPOL office are the latest of several recent examples of troubled hiring practices at Justice offices .
In a report last year focused on the Executive Office for Immigration Review , investigators found the environment of managers hiring their children and friends was so pervasive that it “ infected the entire organization from the highest levels down . ”
Judges , executives and administrators were “ actively involved in placing their relatives in paid student positions ” and “ employees openly advocated for EOIR to hire their relatives , ” the inspector general said .
And in 2012 , inspectors found that various offices in the Justice Department ’ s Justice Management Division had colluded together to hire each other ’ s family .
For example , the assistant human resources director , Pamela Cabell-Edelen , lobbied repeatedly for her daughter to be hired , going so far as to change the requirements of a job vacancy so her child would have a better chance .
Investigators said they also believe that Ms. Cabell-Edelen lied under oath in an attempt to cover up the nepotism accusations , but were unable to take any disciplinary action since she had already retired .
Investigators also noted that one of the offices involved in the hiring schemes — Facilities and Administrative Services Staff — had already been criticized twice by the inspector general in 2004 and 2008 for its repeated hiring of family members and friends .
As for the most recent case at the INTERPOL office , investigators noted that Mr. Lewis had a “ financial interest ” as well as familial in seeing his son was hired as a contractor . The son , Peter , was living with his father and paying rent , meaning the job would ensure he had enough money to go on paying his dad for housing .
And inspectors said that Mr. Lewis — and other INTERPOL managers — used the internship program to benefit friends and acquaintances , giving certain students the unpaid internships that served as a leg-up in seeking a federal job .
Investigators said the officials had abused “ public office for private gain . ”
“ The Intern Coordinator told us that she would not have selected several of the students Lewis referred to her , but that she felt obliged to offer internships to the students who were supported by Lewis , ” the inspector general report said .
INTERPOL is an international law enforcement agency that coordinates efforts between various countries and helps pursue criminals who cross borders . The organization is headquartered in France .","The head of a Justice Department law enforcement office used his position to secure a job for his son and other relatives, the agency’s internal watchdog said Wednesday, the latest in a string of reports that have repeatedly found examples of nepotism at the department.

Justice representatives said the agency is studying the inspector general’s conclusions.

“The Inspector General’s report is currently being reviewed by the appropriate Department of Justice officials,” said Patrick Rodenbush, a Justice spokesman.

The problems at the INTERPOL office are the latest of several recent examples of troubled hiring practices at Justice offices.

In a report last year focused on the Executive Office for Immigration Review, investigators found the environment of managers hiring their children and friends was so pervasive that it “infected the entire organization from the highest levels down.”

Judges, executives and administrators were “actively involved in placing their relatives in paid student positions” and “employees openly advocated for EOIR to hire their relatives,” the inspector general said.

And in 2012, inspectors found that various offices in the Justice Department’s Justice Management Division had colluded together to hire each other’s family.

For example, the assistant human resources director, Pamela Cabell-Edelen, lobbied repeatedly for her daughter to be hired, going so far as to change the requirements of a job vacancy so her child would have a better chance.

Investigators said they also believe that Ms. Cabell-Edelen lied under oath in an attempt to cover up the nepotism accusations, but were unable to take any disciplinary action since she had already retired.

Investigators also noted that one of the offices involved in the hiring schemes — Facilities and Administrative Services Staff — had already been criticized twice by the inspector general in 2004 and 2008 for its repeated hiring of family members and friends.

As for the most recent case at the INTERPOL office, investigators noted that Mr. Lewis had a “financial interest” as well as familial in seeing his son was hired as a contractor. The son, Peter, was living with his father and paying rent, meaning the job would ensure he had enough money to go on paying his dad for housing.

And inspectors said that Mr. Lewis — and other INTERPOL managers — used the internship program to benefit friends and acquaintances, giving certain students the unpaid internships that served as a leg-up in seeking a federal job.

Investigators said the officials had abused “public office for private gain.”

“The Intern Coordinator told us that she would not have selected several of the students Lewis referred to her, but that she felt obliged to offer internships to the students who were supported by Lewis,” the inspector general report said.

INTERPOL is an international law enforcement agency that coordinates efforts between various countries and helps pursue criminals who cross borders. The organization is headquartered in France.

In March 2019 , the IRS added a scheme to its annual “ Dirty Dozen ” list of “ the worst of the worst tax scams. ” That same scheme was targeted , just weeks earlier , when the U.S. Department of Justice filed a fraud lawsuit against a handful of promoters allegedly responsible for generating more than $ 2 billion in improper tax write-offs . And the Senate Finance Committee has been investigating that very same racket , recently demanding thousands of pages of documents from six promoters . Lawmakers from both parties have introduced legislation to halt the same practice .
The scheme they ’ re all trying to kill is what ’ s called a “ syndicated conservation easement , ” which the IRS calls “ abusive ” and says has resulted in bogus deductions for the rich that have cost the U.S. Treasury billions in revenues .
A conservation easement , in its original , legitimate form , is granted when a landowner permanently protects pristine land from development . In that scenario , the public enjoys the benefit of undeveloped land and the taxpayer gets a charitable deduction . By contrast , the syndicated form , created and packaged by profit-seeking middlemen known as “ promoters , ” involves buying up land , finding an appraiser willing to declare that it has huge development value and thus is worth many times the purchase price , then selling stakes in the deal to wealthy investors who extract tax deductions that are often five or more times what they put in . ( ███ investigated syndicated easements in the 2017 article “ The Billion-Dollar Loophole . ” )

But the multifront crackdown seems to be having , at best , a limited effect . There were signs that the pace of syndicated deals has eased , according to an IRS letter to Congress in July 2018 that cited incomplete data ; that ’ s the most recent official statement from the agency , which declined to comment for this article . And some entities doing syndicated projects have seen their business drop or have even left the field . But IRS commissioner Chuck Rettig offered a different picture to the Senate Finance Committee this spring . “ Syndicated transactions have absolutely not declined , ” he testified . “ They ’ re still there . ”
In November , Rettig announced an escalation — including the launch of criminal investigations — in the agency ’ s attempts to stymie syndicated easements . “ We will not stop in our pursuit of everyone involved in the creation , marketing , promotion and wrongful acquisition of artificial , highly inflated deductions based on these aggressive transactions , ” he said in a statement at the time . Three IRS divisions are now conducting coordinated examinations of syndication deals after identifying 125 “ high-risk cases , ” and outside contractors have been hired to assist with the investigative load . More than 80 tax court cases are now pending against partnerships that used the syndicated easement deduction .
The imperviousness of the scam ’ s promoters and investors has left tax experts flummoxed . “ Boy , it isn ’ t like the old days , when people were fearful of the IRS , ” said Steven Miller , who oversaw enforcement and tax-exempt organizations during his 25 years at the IRS and is now national tax director with consulting firm Alliantgroup . “ I ’ m worried people aren ’ t afraid of the cop on the beat any more . ”
Another IRS veteran offered a similar view . “ I thought by now they would have put these guys out of business , ” said former agency commissioner John Koskinen , who took steps against syndicated easements before he left in late 2017 . “ Obviously , if you can get four to seven times your investment back in deductions , that ’ s a good deal . But you really have to have a lot of chutzpah to pull it off . ”
Some promoters continue to flaunt their sales pitches . In November , for example , an Alabama promoter ( which was not sued by the Justice Department ) solicited high net-worth clients with an ad in Barron ’ s , promising , in capital letters , “ TAX DEDUCTIONS AVAILABLE THROUGH CONSERVATION EASEMENTS…100,000 INVESTED YIELDS UP TO 600,000 IN DEDUCTIONS . ”
And sizable deals are still being struck , including by an Atlanta firm called EcoVest Capital , a chief target of the Justice Department lawsuit . According to a private placement memorandum dated Oct. 24 , which was obtained by ███ , EcoVest was planning as many as three new syndicated deals on 1,549 acres in rural Calhoun County , Texas . One , touting a deduction of $ 4.10 for every $ 1 invested , was completed by year-end . ( The Justice Department suit , which is still in its early stage , asserted that EcoVest has been involved in 51 syndication easement deals since 2009 , generating $ 1.7 billion in federal tax deductions . )
On their face , the risk disclosures to potential investors in a syndicated deal seem daunting . For example , the private placement memo for EcoVest ’ s Texas offering warned of a “ very high likelihood that the Property Entity or the Company will be audited by the IRS . ”
But experts cite several reasons for the stubborn survival of this tax-avoidance scheme . The first is that the IRS , which Congress has starved for funding , chiefly wields its clout through individual audits and tax court cases , which invariably take years . And even the dozens of tax court cases the IRS is pursuing target only a fraction of syndicated deals .
More important , the syndicated deals are structured in a way that insulate the wealthy individual investors , leaving the promoters and outside lawyers to do battle with the IRS . Their fight is fueled with “ audit reserves ” of as much as $ 1 million that are set aside as part of every syndication partnership . Some deals even offer “ audit insurance ” from Lloyds of London to offset disallowed write-offs .
“ The way the structure works is pretty buttoned up , ” Miller said . “ The investor sits there and doesn ’ t see immediate pain . You ’ re not going to be bothered by the IRS at the front end . Some of them say : ‘ Well , let me do the math . What ’ s the likelihood of that 40 % penalty ? ’ That ’ s the calculation people are making . ”
Miller believes the deterrent effect will kick in only if more cases personally target individual promoters and deal consultants with tough penalties and professional sanctions . “ Ultimately , ” he said , “ they need to crush a few appraisers like a grape . ”
The “ linchpin ” of the syndicated easements , Miller said , is the inflated appraisal . “ How do I buy something today for a dollar and magically everything I buy is truly worth $ 10 ? That belies rational thought . You just scratch your head . ”
Here ’ s how the appraisal worked in one syndicated deal described in the Justice Department complaint . In 2015 , an EcoVest entity acquired 28 acres in North Myrtle Beach , South Carolina , for $ 1.1 million . The firm raised about $ 9 million from investors who bought the property , then made an easement donation based on a claimed value for what the land would be worth if developed as a multifamily resort . That projection , made by an appraiser hired by the promoters , produced a tax deduction of about $ 39.7 million . The tax writeoff for investors : $ 4.12 for every $ 1 invested .
In a written response to ███ ’ s questions , an EcoVest spokesperson called the government ’ s charges “ baseless ” and insisted that “ none of the appraisals associated with EcoVest sponsored investments are abusive or fraudulent . ”
One appraiser regularly retained by EcoVest and other syndicators also looms large in the Justice Department suit : Claud Clark III , based in Magnolia Springs , Alabama . The complaint notes his involvement in at least 58 syndicated easement deals and alleges that Clark , 66 , “ continually and repeatedly ” generated “ grossly overvalued appraisals . ”
In January 2019 , the Alabama state real estate appraiser board brought a formal complaint against Clark , after a detailed review of one of his easement appraisals found an inflated valuation riddled with errors and omissions . Threatened with loss of his Alabama license , Clark voluntarily surrendered it in April instead . He faces a second complaint filed with state regulators in Louisiana , regarding a 2018 appraisal he did for syndicators in Jefferson Davis Parish .
EcoVest has continued to use Clark . Its October private placement memorandum , which raised $ 19.3 million from investors , did not disclose that he had surrendered his appraisal license in his home state . ( A spokesperson for EcoVest said Clark ’ s relinquishment of his Alabama license wasn ’ t disclosed “ because , under securities laws , it was not material to whether Mr. Clark was authorized to issue an appraisal in Texas — a state with different appraisal rules , regulations , and practices . ” )
Clark did not respond to requests for comment . On Christmas Eve , however , his attorneys filed a 130-page response and counterclaim to the Justice Department complaint , denying any inflated appraisals and accusing government officials , including the IRS commissioner , Rettig , of making “ unlawful disclosures ” of appraisal information from his tax returns in public statements about the litigation .
Promoters of syndicated conservation easements have long been at war with the supporters of traditional easements , who worry that abusive deals will prompt Congress to eliminate the tax break altogether . The traditional conservation community , embodied by the Land Trust Alliance , the Washington , D.C. , association of nonprofit land trusts , began pressing the IRS to crack down nearly a decade ago . ( Land trusts are a key part of the process : The rules for conservation easements require that any property donated to seek an easement deduction must be accepted and maintained by a land trust or government entity . ) The Land Trust Alliance later refused to accredit any trust accepting syndicated deals .
The IRS ’ attempt to crack down on syndicated easements dates back to December 2016 , when the agency took the rare step of designating profit-making syndicated easements as abusive “ listed ” transactions . The IRS demanded special paperwork identifying everyone involved in such deals — from promoters and tax advisers to appraisers and investors — and warned that continued involvement would brand them for investigations and audits .
The agency next took its campaign to tax court , after refusing to back down on dozens of audits rejecting the fat write-offs and demanding back taxes , interest and penalties of up to 40 % .
But with millions at stake , promoters have fought back fiercely . In 2016 , they formed a Washington , D.C.-based advocacy group , called Partnership for Conservation , which has spent more than $ 3 million to date on lobbyists . EcoVest has spent another $ 2.5 million .
The Partnership for Conservation defends the legitimacy of syndicated deals , arguing that the profit motive produces “ tremendous opportunities ” for conservation , according to Robert Ramsay , executive director of the organization . He said that the IRS should limit enforcement to cases of appraisal and valuation abuse , which he calls rare . “ You have to stop with the premise that all of these are egregious and over the top , ” Ramsay said . “ I don ’ t think that ’ s the case . ”
Among the syndicators ’ most fervent supporters is Robert Keller , a conservation biologist who runs the Atlantic Coast Conservancy , a land trust in Jasper , Georgia , and has accepted more syndicated easements than anyone . Keller acknowledged in an interview that his business has slowed , declining from 56 easements in 2017 to 22 in 2019 . His land trust is itself now also under IRS audit for 2014 through 2016 . ( One of the reasons for the decline in volume for Keller : Atlanta-based Ornstein-Schuler , among the most prolific syndicated-easement promoters , announced last January that it was abandoning the business , citing “ recent developments and the uncertainty related to the conservation and gifting of property . ” )
Keller ’ s land trust displays the slogan “ Saving the world — One small piece at a time. ” He is unapologetic about accepting syndicated easements . “ For me , as a conservation biologist , this allows me to put away vast pieces of property , ” Keller said . “ I want to save the world . ”
Keller asserts the campaign against syndicated easements resulted from an unholy political deal between the Land Trust Alliance and IRS . In September , he filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the IRS to force the release of correspondence between the two groups that he claims will provide smoking-gun evidence .

Land Trust Alliance CEO Andrew Bowman called the notion of such a conspiracy “ absurd. ” As he put it : “ Taxpayers are being bilked . The intent of Congress is being violated . And the future viability of land conservation is endangered . The egregious profiteering the IRS has tracked … must end . ”
At the urging of Bowman ’ s group , bipartisan congressional sponsors have , for the past three years , proposed legislation that would kill most syndications by limiting their profitability . It would bar deductions that exceed two and a half times the investment for any easement partnership that owned the land for less than three years .
In July , Congress ’ Joint Committee on Taxation projected that passage of the latest incarnation , the “ Charitable Conservation Easement Program Integrity Act of 2019 , ” would , if enacted , produce $ 7.1 billion in additional tax revenue through 2021 . The bill has yet to get out of committee .

Lawmakers pressing for more heads to roll at the Internal Revenue Service are going to be disappointed.

“Why weren’t more people fired?” Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) demanded at a hearing Tuesday on the IRS’s targeting of conservative groups, channeling the frustration of his colleagues.

Turns out it’s not so easy.

In fact, it appears that no one has been formally reprimanded and a spokesperson for the union representing IRS workers said it hasn’t been called to help any employees yet. Most employees involved in the targeting program are covered by protections for federal workers that could drag out the termination process.

The pressure is building: Lois Lerner, the director of the tax-exempt division at the IRS that oversaw the controversial program, will invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination at a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on Wednesday.

The GOP is also calling for the resignation of Sarah Hall Ingram, an official who used to work in the tax-exempt division and who now oversees the agency’s implementation of the health care overhaul.

Here’s a quick guide to what it would take to show IRS officials the door:

Fire them — and brace for the appeals

The incoming acting IRS Commissioner, Daniel Werfel, could try to clean house — but he’d have to be prepared for a lengthy appeals process.

Under federal rules, a fired government worker has the right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board. He or she can challenge the decision, argue that their actions don’t meet the threshold for termination and ask to be reinstated — especially if there was no warning of trouble in past performance reviews.

The board is set up so fired employees appealing their termination get two chances to prove they should stay. Their first stop is at the merit board’s regional level, which — for the Cincinnati-based IRS employees in question — would be in Chicago.

The initial appeals take an average of 93 days to process, said William Spencer, a spokesman for the board.

If the regional board rules against the IRS employees, they could appeal to the national Washington, D.C.-based board, which takes on average another 245 days.

The IRS employees wouldn’t collect a paycheck during the appeals process. They would get back pay only if they are ultimately reinstated.

Max Stier, who heads Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that recommends ways to improve the federal workforce, says it’s “not impossible” to get rid of federal workers. In 2012, he says, 8,755 federal workers were fired, and others likely resigned to avoid the ax — although there are no estimates of how many because it’s hard to track those kinds of departures.

“At the end of the day, if any agency has an employee who has really done something egregious and they want to get rid of them, they can do it,” Stier said.

Speed it up — and try not to get reversed

There’s also the option of getting the IRS employees out of the way more quickly — at least temporarily — by putting them on administrative leave.

But IRS workers could always fight back if they’ve had positive performance reviews until now — and the board has been known to mitigate penalties if an employee is a first-time rule violator.

Making this case about conduct does make it easier, however, to skip one part of the disciplinary rules for federal workers.",www.politico.com,left,NfJz98KCsYDyzLMt

Barr’s Justice Department

When former Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from any investigation into the 2016 election, in which he’d campaigned for Mr. Trump, the president lambasted him for it. After months of public criticism on Twitter, Mr. Sessions resigned in November 2018.

His replacement, Mr. Barr, has appeared more responsive to the president’s interests.

Mr. Barr returned to the DOJ with a track record of supporting broad presidential power and immunity from investigation.

Since taking office he has opened a review of the Mueller investigation and fired FBI Director James Comey’s actions. He has also opened an “intake process” to vet material that Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, has gathered in Ukraine on former Vice President Joe Biden, who is seeking the Democratic nomination. On Wednesday the president congratulated Mr. Barr “for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control.” Also on Wednesday, Mr. Barr agreed to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, ending a year-long standoff.

Now he 's back on the hot seat testifying before a Senate subcommittee Wednesday .
Barr is responding to Democratic criticism over his summary of Mueller . He says the redacted report will be released next week , but that may not be good enough for Democrats .
`` I do think it 's important that the public have an opportunity to learn the results of the special counsel 's work , '' Barr said .
Testifying before the House Appropriations Committee Tuesday , Barr stuck to his promise to deliver a redacted version of the report in coming days .
`` And so I think that from my standpoint , within a week I will be in a position to release the report to the public , and then I will engage with the chairmen of both Judiciary Committees about that report , and about any further requests that they have , '' Barr said .
Although Barr was officially on Capitol Hill to testify about the Justice Department 's budget , many lawmakers circled back to the Russia investigation .
Rep. Nita Lowey ( D-NY ) said , `` I must say it is extraordinary to evaluate hundreds of pages of evidence legal documents , and finding based on a 22-month-long inquiry , and make definitive legal conclusions in less than 48 hours . Even for someone who has done this job before , I would argue it 's more suspicious than impressive . ''
Democrats have been critical of Barr 's approach and want to see the complete conclusions of the Mueller investigation , threatening to issue a subpoena if they do n't get what they want .
Barr addressed scrutiny of his four-page letter summarizing his main conclusions from Mueller 's nearly 400-page report , stating the Mueller team 's finding that neither President Trump or his campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia 's interference with the 2016 election .
Lowey said , `` All we have is your four-page report which seems to cherry pick to draw most favorable for president . ''
He defended his decision to release that letter instead of summaries written by the special counsel .
`` I think any summary regardless of who prepares it not only runs the risk of , you know , being under-inclusive or over-inclusive but also would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once , '' Barr said . `` I tried to use as much of the special counsel 's own language as I could . They were just stating the bottom line conclusions . ''
House Republicans are ready to move on . Rep. Tom Graves ( R-GA ) said , `` No collusion , no obstruction . It 's over , it 's done . ''
`` Well , the letter - the letter speaks for itself , '' Barr said .
Meanwhile , Barr is also investigating whether the FBI abused its authority in getting wiretaps on Trump aides that fueled the investigation leading to the Mueller probe .
The attorney general testifies before the Senate Wednesday , and he says he will answer more questions from Congress next month after the full Mueller report has been released .","US Attorney General William Barr faced off for the first time Tuesday with House lawmakers about his handling of the Mueller report.

Barr is responding to Democratic criticism over his summary of Mueller. He says the redacted report will be released next week, but that may not be good enough for Democrats.

""I do think it's important that the public have an opportunity to learn the results of the special counsel's work,"" Barr said.

Testifying before the House Appropriations Committee Tuesday, Barr stuck to his promise to deliver a redacted version of the report in coming days.



""And so I think that from my standpoint, within a week I will be in a position to release the report to the public, and then I will engage with the chairmen of both Judiciary Committees about that report, and about any further requests that they have,"" Barr said.

Although Barr was officially on Capitol Hill to testify about the Justice Department's budget, many lawmakers circled back to the Russia investigation.

Rep. Nita Lowey (D-NY) said, ""I must say it is extraordinary to evaluate hundreds of pages of evidence legal documents, and finding based on a 22-month-long inquiry, and make definitive legal conclusions in less than 48 hours. Even for someone who has done this job before, I would argue it's more suspicious than impressive.""

Democrats have been critical of Barr's approach and want to see the complete conclusions of the Mueller investigation, threatening to issue a subpoena if they don't get what they want.

Barr addressed scrutiny of his four-page letter summarizing his main conclusions from Mueller's nearly 400-page report, stating the Mueller team's finding that neither President Trump or his campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia's interference with the 2016 election.

Lowey said, ""All we have is your four-page report which seems to cherry pick to draw most favorable for president.""

He defended his decision to release that letter instead of summaries written by the special counsel.



""I think any summary regardless of who prepares it not only runs the risk of, you know, being under-inclusive or over-inclusive but also would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once,"" Barr said. ""I tried to use as much of the special counsel's own language as I could. They were just stating the bottom line conclusions.""

House Republicans are ready to move on. Rep. Tom Graves (R-GA) said, ""No collusion, no obstruction. It's over, it's done.""

""Well, the letter - the letter speaks for itself,"" Barr said.

Meanwhile, Barr is also investigating whether the FBI abused its authority in getting wiretaps on Trump aides that fueled the investigation leading to the Mueller probe.

Trayvon was walking too slow , so should they be walking too fast ? You know , so I don ’ t think teenagers in whole know exactly what to do now . ”

Martin ’ s family attorney , Benjamin Crump , said they were examining legal options about whether to bring a civil suit and were asking the Justice Department to weigh in .
“ We ’ re asking the Department of Justice to answer that question for us , ” Crump said . “ Can a private citizen with a gun profile and follow our children home ?

“ Obviously , any time you have a person that makes an assumption that a person is up to no good , there ’ s some type of profiling there . Was he racially profiled ?

“ We have always maintained to do things decent and in order , and we think the protests should be peaceful protests , ” Fulton said on NBC . “ We ’ re not saying for them not to protest , because they have a right to protest , they have a right to be heard .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Attorney General William Barr publicly swiped at President Donald Trump on Thursday , declaring the president ’ s tweets about Justice Department prosecutors and open cases “ make it impossible for me to do my job . ”
Barr made the comment during an interview with ABC News just days after his Justice Department overruled its own prosecutors — who had recommended in a court filing that Trump ’ s longtime ally and confidant Roger Stone be sentenced to 7 to 9 years in prison — and took the extraordinary step of lowering the amount of prison time it would seek . The department didn ’ t offer an amended number .
Barr himself has been under fire for the reversal . Still , it was a highly unusual move for a member of the Cabinet to criticize the president — especially a Trump loyalist who shares the president ’ s views on expansive executive powers . Thursday ’ s comment served as a defense of his own integrity — an effort to salvage his own reputation and that of the Department of Justice by publicly rebuking the president he ’ s propped up from Day One of his tenure .
The remarks , made so quickly after the decision to back away from the sentencing , suggested Barr was aware the reversal had chipped away at the department ’ s historic reputation for independence from political sway . But he stopped short of acknowledging wrongdoing by anyone .
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Trump “ wasn ’ t bothered by the comments at all and he has the right , just like any American citizen , to publicly offer his opinions. ” She added , “ The President has full faith and confidence in Attorney General Barr to do his job and uphold the law . ”
But Trump has a low tolerance for criticism , especially public criticism , from his allies and often fires back in kind . And the tempered White House response raised questions of whether Barr ’ s comments were coordinated with the White House .
Barr said Trump ’ s tweets created perception problems for the department that called into question its independence , but he denied there was any order from Trump and said Trump ’ s tweets did not factor into the decision .
Barr joined a roster of high level aides who have publicly criticized Trump , thought the rest left the job first . Former National Security Adviser John Bolton is to publish a book next month detailing his time in the White House including criticism of Trump actions such as his decision to withhold military assistance while seeking a political favor from Ukraine . Former Chief of Staff John Kelly , who has largely kept a low profile since leaving the White House , has grown more open about his unflattering assessments of the president .
Earlier this week , Trump applauded Barr on Twitter for the decision to reverse the sentencing recommendation , writing : “ Congratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought . ”
The department insisted the decision to undo the sentencing recommendation was made Monday night — before Trump blasted the recommendation on Twitter as “ very horrible and unfair ” — and prosecutors had not spoken to the White House about it . The about-face prompted the four attorneys who prosecuted Stone to quit the case . One left the Justice Department altogether .
“ I ’ m happy to say that , in fact , the president has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case , ” Barr said in the ABC interview . “ However , to have public statements and tweets made about the department , about our people ... about cases pending in the department , and about judges before whom we have cases , make it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors in the department that we ’ re doing our work with integrity . ”
National security adviser Robert O ’ Brien told reporters Thursday evening at the White House that Trump tweets to bypass the mainstream press and speak directly to the American people .
“ It ’ s just a different method of communicating with the American people and the president has every right to weigh in , ” O ’ Brien said . “ He ’ s got First Amendment rights , even though he ’ s president . And he ’ s got a right to weigh in with his opinions on the big issues of the day and I think he ’ s going to continue to do that . ”
Stone was convicted in November of tampering with a witness and obstructing the House investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to tip the 2016 election . He ’ s scheduled to be sentenced next week .
Barr said he was “ of course ” prepared to deal with any ramifications from the president for his comments . Administration officials said senior White House aides were not informed of the contents of Barr ’ s interview before it aired .
“ As I said during my confirmation , I came in to serve as attorney general . I am responsible for everything that happens in the department , but the thing I have most responsibility for are the issues that are brought to me for decision , ” Barr said in the interview .
It is extremely rare for Justice Department leaders to reverse the decision of prosecutors on a sentencing recommendation , particularly after that recommendation has been submitted to the court . The actual sentencing is up to the judge .
Meanwhile , the Chief Judge of the D.C. District Court , Beryl A. Howell , also did something unusual : She issued a statement Thursday on the firestorm around the sentencing .
“ The Judges of this court base their sentencing decisions on careful consideration of the actual record in the case before them ; the applicable sentencing guidelines and statutory factors ; the submissions of the parties , the probation office and victims ; and their own judgment and experience , ” she wrote . “ Public criticism or pressure is not a factor . ”
“ What they did to Roger Stone was a disgrace , ” Trump said Thursday during an interview with Geraldo Rivera on Cleveland ’ s Newsradio WTAM .
He said of the prosecutors who resigned in protest : “ I don ’ t think they quit the case . ... I don ’ t think they quit for moral reasons . I think they got caught in the act by me . ”
“ Now what am I going to do , sit back and let a man go to jail maybe for nine years when murderers aren ’ t going to jail ? You have some of the most serious horrible rapists and everything else . They don ’ t go to jail for nine years , ” Trump said .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsay Graham said in a statement that Barr “ has my complete confidence ” and “ is the right man at the right time to reform the department and stand up for the Rule of Law . ”
Earlier this week , Graham said , and Barr later confirmed , that Justice was accepting information that Trump ’ s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani is gathering in Ukraine about Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son .
In the ABC interview , Barr said of the president , “ If he were to say go investigate somebody because — and you sense it ’ s because they ’ re a political opponent — then the attorney general shouldn ’ t carry that out , wouldn ’ t carry that out . ”
Democrats decried the Justice Department ’ s reversal on Stone and called for immediate investigations . Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for the Justice Department ’ s inspector general to step in . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that Barr had “ stooped to such levels ” and that “ the American people deserve better . ”
Barr has been a steady ally of the president ’ s since he returned to the top post at the Justice Department last year .

WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General William Barr publicly swiped at President Donald Trump on Thursday, declaring the president’s tweets about Justice Department prosecutors and open cases “make it impossible for me to do my job.”

Barr made the comment during an interview with ABC News just days after his Justice Department overruled its own prosecutors — who had recommended in a court filing that Trump’s longtime ally and confidant Roger Stone be sentenced to 7 to 9 years in prison — and took the extraordinary step of lowering the amount of prison time it would seek. The department didn’t offer an amended number.

Barr himself has been under fire for the reversal. Still, it was a highly unusual move for a member of the Cabinet to criticize the president — especially a Trump loyalist who shares the president’s views on expansive executive powers. Thursday’s comment served as a defense of his own integrity — an effort to salvage his own reputation and that of the Department of Justice by publicly rebuking the president he’s propped up from Day One of his tenure.

The remarks, made so quickly after the decision to back away from the sentencing, suggested Barr was aware the reversal had chipped away at the department’s historic reputation for independence from political sway. But he stopped short of acknowledging wrongdoing by anyone.

White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Trump “wasn’t bothered by the comments at all and he has the right, just like any American citizen, to publicly offer his opinions.” She added, “The President has full faith and confidence in Attorney General Barr to do his job and uphold the law.”

But Trump has a low tolerance for criticism, especially public criticism, from his allies and often fires back in kind. And the tempered White House response raised questions of whether Barr’s comments were coordinated with the White House.

Barr said Trump’s tweets created perception problems for the department that called into question its independence, but he denied there was any order from Trump and said Trump’s tweets did not factor into the decision.

Barr joined a roster of high level aides who have publicly criticized Trump, thought the rest left the job first. Former National Security Adviser John Bolton is to publish a book next month detailing his time in the White House including criticism of Trump actions such as his decision to withhold military assistance while seeking a political favor from Ukraine. Former Chief of Staff John Kelly, who has largely kept a low profile since leaving the White House, has grown more open about his unflattering assessments of the president.

Earlier this week, Trump applauded Barr on Twitter for the decision to reverse the sentencing recommendation, writing: “Congratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought.”

The department insisted the decision to undo the sentencing recommendation was made Monday night — before Trump blasted the recommendation on Twitter as “very horrible and unfair”— and prosecutors had not spoken to the White House about it. The about-face prompted the four attorneys who prosecuted Stone to quit the case. One left the Justice Department altogether.

“I’m happy to say that, in fact, the president has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case,” Barr said in the ABC interview. “However, to have public statements and tweets made about the department, about our people ... about cases pending in the department, and about judges before whom we have cases, make it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors in the department that we’re doing our work with integrity.”

National security adviser Robert O’Brien told reporters Thursday evening at the White House that Trump tweets to bypass the mainstream press and speak directly to the American people.

“It’s just a different method of communicating with the American people and the president has every right to weigh in,” O’Brien said. “He’s got First Amendment rights, even though he’s president. And he’s got a right to weigh in with his opinions on the big issues of the day and I think he’s going to continue to do that.”

Stone was convicted in November of tampering with a witness and obstructing the House investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to tip the 2016 election. He’s scheduled to be sentenced next week.

Barr said he was “of course” prepared to deal with any ramifications from the president for his comments. Administration officials said senior White House aides were not informed of the contents of Barr’s interview before it aired.

“As I said during my confirmation, I came in to serve as attorney general. I am responsible for everything that happens in the department, but the thing I have most responsibility for are the issues that are brought to me for decision,” Barr said in the interview.

It is extremely rare for Justice Department leaders to reverse the decision of prosecutors on a sentencing recommendation, particularly after that recommendation has been submitted to the court. The actual sentencing is up to the judge.

Meanwhile, the Chief Judge of the D.C. District Court, Beryl A. Howell, also did something unusual: She issued a statement Thursday on the firestorm around the sentencing.

“The Judges of this court base their sentencing decisions on careful consideration of the actual record in the case before them; the applicable sentencing guidelines and statutory factors; the submissions of the parties, the probation office and victims; and their own judgment and experience,” she wrote. “Public criticism or pressure is not a factor.”

“What they did to Roger Stone was a disgrace,” Trump said Thursday during an interview with Geraldo Rivera on Cleveland’s Newsradio WTAM.

He said of the prosecutors who resigned in protest: “I don’t think they quit the case. ... I don’t think they quit for moral reasons. I think they got caught in the act by me.”

“Now what am I going to do, sit back and let a man go to jail maybe for nine years when murderers aren’t going to jail? You have some of the most serious horrible rapists and everything else. They don’t go to jail for nine years,” Trump said.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsay Graham said in a statement that Barr “has my complete confidence” and “is the right man at the right time to reform the department and stand up for the Rule of Law.”

Earlier this week, Graham said, and Barr later confirmed, that Justice was accepting information that Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani is gathering in Ukraine about Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son.

In the ABC interview, Barr said of the president, “If he were to say go investigate somebody because — and you sense it’s because they’re a political opponent — then the attorney general shouldn’t carry that out, wouldn’t carry that out.”

Democrats decried the Justice Department’s reversal on Stone and called for immediate investigations. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for the Justice Department’s inspector general to step in. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that Barr had “stooped to such levels” and that “the American people deserve better.”

Barr has been a steady ally of the president’s since he returned to the top post at the Justice Department last year. He cleared the president of obstruction of justice even when special counsel Robert Mueller had pointedly declined to do so. He declared that the FBI’s Russia investigation, which resulted in charges against Stone, had been based on a “bogus narrative.”

Barr also appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead a criminal inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation, including examining what led the U.S. to open a counterintelligence probe into the Trump campaign and the roles that various countries played.

The common threads in all of this government secrecy and lying are a general rejection of government’s moral obligation to tell the truth, a disturbing yet brazen willingness to evade and avoid the restrictions the Constitution has deliberately built around government, and a glib admission that the government can do as it pleases so long as it can politically get away with it.

The Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause requires that the government treat all similarly situated entities in a similar manner. The Constitution’s First Amendment prohibits the government from using the speech and expressive activities of persons in America as a basis for the disparate treatment of them.

Thus, on its face -- that is, on the basis of what the IRS has admitted and without any further investigation -- we have violations of these constitutional principles. If the IRS were to examine the applications for tax exemption of Media Matters with the same level of scrutiny as it does with Tea Party Patriots, it would not run afoul of these principles.

But Congress has given the IRS broad latitude to scrutinize the behavior of the taxpayers it chooses to scrutinize, and the IRS has given itself authority to probe, prod and plunder wherever it wishes.

I say “given itself,” because the IRS has rule-making power, which when overlooked by Congress (as is almost always the case) actually serves to enhance IRS powers beyond what Congress permits.

Short of criminal behavior such as bribery or conspiracy, the IRS employees who have singled out applications for tax exempt status for more scrutiny based on anticipated political expression are subject to removal from office, but they cannot be prosecuted or sued.

Here again, Congress is to blame, as both Republicans and Democrats have used and abused the IRS to their advantage, and neither party inwardly wants laws that will prevent it from doing so in the future.

Is this what you expect of our tax collectors?

The First Amendment also assures the right of professional journalists to seek and protect their sources, and it gives them immunity from government prosecution or retribution for truthfully publishing matters of material public interest, even when it involves information stolen from the government. The Supreme Court taught us this in the Pentagon Papers case.

Moreover, the Fourth Amendment requires that if the government wants private information about who stole its secrets, it needs a search warrant from a judge.

But the Patriot Act, which was celebrated by some in the media whose telephone records have since been seized, permits federal agents to write their own search warrants when they seek records from a third party like a telephone company and can claim that pursuit of terrorists is at stake.

The Patriot Act makes a mockery of the Fourth Amendment, and the government knows that.

When the government chills free speech, we all suffer. Thomas Jefferson preferred newspapers without government to government without newspapers. Whose personal records will the government authorize itself to seize next?

The lesson of Benghazi is that we had no lawful right to interfere in the domestic affairs of the Libyan government.

It was unlawful for Obama to bomb Col. Qaddafi without a congressional declaration of war. The organized assault on our consulate was the unintended consequence of us using force to infuse American-style democracy on a people whose culture is unable and unwilling to accept it.

But the president’s people were terrified that the murder of our ambassador to Libya during the 2012 presidential campaign might impair Obama’s re-election chances. So they and he tried to rewrite history, and the more they and he lied, the more they and he needed to lie to cover up their original lies.

Would you retain an employee who lied to you about the deaths of innocents and lied more to cover up the original lies?

Now, back to Bush and Obama and the president’s job. According to the Constitution, the president’s first job obligation is to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.

According to the Constitution, that means preserving Americans’ freedom first and safety second.

Freedom is our natural state and is the ultimate natural right. Safety is a need that we ourselves can provide when unimpeded by the government.

If the president keeps us safe but not free, he is not doing his job.

A Senate fight over a sex-trafficking bill that includes a controversial abortion provision has held up Lynch’s nomination for 160 days since Obama announced his choice last Nov. 8, but Minority Leader Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is threatening to break protocol and force a vote on the Senate floor.

“If someone is supportive of the president’s policies, whether you agree with them or not, there should be some deference to the executive,” Bush told reporters. “It should not always be partisan.”

Alluding to the two families to have produced the most presidents, Bush joked that he is not trying to break a tie between his family and the Adamses. (John Adams was the 2nd president, from 1797-1801; his son, John Quincy Adams, was the 6th president, from 1825-1829.)

“That really isn’t my motivation,” Bush said, “but I have to prove that.”

Bush also took a shot at Hillary Clinton’s trip to Chipotle, saying that he cooks at home and that he doesn’t need to go to the fast-casual chain — though sometimes he does.

“Do I go there? Yeah, I go there. The one on US 1. Drive my own car, park my own car, get out of my own car,” he said, according to ABC News, in an apparent reference to Clinton’s stopover in Maumee, Ohio, earlier this week. “Get Chipotle, take it home.”

Bush broke with his strict paleo diet of several months to partake in some blueberry pie at the event.

“To hell with the diet,” he said, according to reports. “Where are the french fries?”

In November 2009 , the Justice Department secretly asked a federal court to grant a search warrant for a personal email account through Yahoo , Inc. servers .

Recently unsealed documents show the government had in 2009 amassed an impressive amount of evidence against Kim , a contractor who no longer works at the State Department .
At the time , an FBI agent making the search warrant request , said , `` I conclude from the foregoing that Mr. Kim and Reporter A have communicated as recently as August 15 , 2009 by email through both the [ redacted ] @ yahoo.com accounts as well as what appears to be a clandestine e-mail account set up by Reporter A , [ redacted ] @ gmail.com , to communicate with Mr. Kim and perhaps other sources of information . ''
And what of reporter Rosen ? As of late 2009 , the government apparently had no interest going after him .

It is clear from the records it is Rosen 's account and that he was at that time , in the government 's eyes , possibly involved in a crime as `` aider or abettor and/or co-conspirator . ''
The warrant application was filed without the prior knowledge of Fox News . The government acknowledged it was an unusual situation , but felt it had no choice .

Investigation focused on State Department contractor who may have been in contact with reporter

The reporter has never been charged and as of late 2009, the government apparently had no interest going after him

Attorney General Eric Holder has come under fire for Justice Department handling of the case

When the government investigates the alleged unauthorized release of sensitive information, the focus is normally on the person doing the leaking

But the criminal case against a State Department contractor escalated dramatically, putting the spotlight on the person reportedly receiving those communications -- Fox News reporter James Rosen.

The complex layer of once-secret search warrants for e-mails and phone records involving Rosen have raised constitutional concerns about press freedoms, balanced against national security.

The investigation of that adviser, Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, and a separate probe involving clandestine searches of Associated Press records, has prompted President Barack Obama to order a review of the federal government's practices involving leaks of classified material.

""I am troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable,"" Obama said recently.

He has directed Attorney General Eric Holder to review the government's guidelines on such matters. Holder will convene a panel of media organizations scheduled to begin on Thursday as part of his review.

The details of the investigation

Here is what is known about the ongoing case:

In November 2009, the Justice Department secretly asked a federal court to grant a search warrant for a personal email account through Yahoo, Inc. servers.

Prosecutors suspected Kim, who joined the State Department in 2008, was giving information to Rosen, classified intelligence about North Korea.

Along with private e-mails and phone records, Justice Department officials tracked the reporter's movements in the State Department using his ID badge.

Kim, 45, was born in Seoul South Korea and moved to the U.S. when he was a boy. His family settled in the Bronxdale section of New York. He has a PhD from Yale in diplomatic and military history. One of his areas of specialty at the State Department was North Korea's nuclear program.

Recently unsealed documents show the government had in 2009 amassed an impressive amount of evidence against Kim, a contractor who no longer works at the State Department.

At the time, an FBI agent making the search warrant request, said, ""I conclude from the foregoing that Mr. Kim and Reporter A have communicated as recently as August 15, 2009 by email through both the [redacted]@yahoo.com accounts as well as what appears to be a clandestine e-mail account set up by Reporter A, [redacted]@gmail.com, to communicate with Mr. Kim and perhaps other sources of information.""

And what of reporter Rosen? As of late 2009, the government apparently had no interest going after him.

""The FBI is not at this time seeking a search warrant for [redacted]@gmail.com. Rather it is restricting its request for email search warrants associated with Mr. Kim."" The Gmail account is apparently Rosen's although he is not mentioned by name in any of the documents.

Six months later, things take a dramatic turn.

Another search warrant application is filed in Washington, this time for a personal Gmail account controlled by Google, Inc.

It is clear from the records it is Rosen's account and that he was at that time, in the government's eyes, possibly involved in a crime as ""aider or abettor and/or co-conspirator.""

The warrant application was filed without the prior knowledge of Fox News. The government acknowledged it was an unusual situation, but felt it had no choice.

""The FBI has exhausted all reasonable non-media alternatives for collecting the evidence it seeks,"" said the May 2010 affidavit about Rosen's communications. ""Because of the reporter's own potential criminal liability in this matter, we believe requesting the voluntary production of materials from reporter would be futile and would pose substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation and of the evidence we seek to obtain by the warrant.""

An attempt to seal the records

The Obama administration had fought for more than two years to keep the Kim and Rosen search warrant affidavits sealed.

In an unusual twist federal Judge Royce Lamberth last November ordered the records publicly released, but court clerks had for some reason failed to enter the documents in the court's online docket until last week.

The publicly available court records do not clearly indicate why the government felt it needed to expand its already strong evidence against Kim into a probe of Rosen's actions.

The reporter has not been charged with any crime, and while he was listed as a ""co-conspirator,"" that often does not mean he would be considered a target.

Fox News officials have subsequently offered differing versions about when and if they were notified by the Justice Department after the fact about the searches.

A law enforcement official insisted Tuesday the government notified Fox's parent company News Corp. it was issuing a request for two days of phone records in 2009.

Justice Department policy requires those types of notifications to be delivered via certified mail, fax, and e-mail.

The official said on August 27, 2010, two separate notifications were sent to Lawrence Jacobs , then the general counsel for News Corp. An e-mail also was sent to Rosen on the same day notifying him of the subpoena, the official said.

The official request, according to this official, was for toll records -- lists of what numbers were dialed from five phone lines associated with Rosen -- and also the phone numbers of the calls received. The records would not reveal any content from conversations.

But Jacobs, speaking to CNN Tuesday, said he doesn't remember receiving any notification from the Justice Department about a subpoena.

""I have no recollection of receiving anything from the Department of Justice,"" Jacobs said. ""It's the kind of thing I would remember.""

Search warrants and subpoenas can be different.

Subpoenas in this legal context are orders to a particular party to produce certain records or information. Search warrants are court orders allowing law enforcement to gather information or collect evidence, often without the prior knowledge of the person being investigated.

Attorney General sign-off

Justice Department policy requires Justice Department policy requires the attorney general to personally sign off on any search warrants involving the media . A Justice official tells CNN Holder in fact did just that. The actual warrant was approved by a federal magistrate.

Many legal scholars say the only justification for such a search warrant involving the press -- and the high-level approval necessary from Holder -- would be if prosecutors firmly believe that reporter is criminally involved in an illegal leak of information, and are prepared to take legal action.

The government suggested as much when it requested Rosen's private phone and e-mail records. But in the three years since, no indictment has come against Rosen.

Administration officials have yet to explain -- either in court records or in a press conference -- whether Rosen was a serious target of prosecution, or whether Kim was the only person they were planning to prosecute and needed to make the claim about the Fox reporter in order to get emails to help the Kim prosecution.

For example, the government was curious about how Kim (reportedly using the alias ""Leo"") responded to Rosen's alleged May 22, 2009, e-mail: ""Thanks Leo. What I am interested in, as you might expect, is breaking news ahead of my competitors.""

Holder under fire

Holder faces questions from Republicans on Capitol Hill, who are looking into whether he lied under oath earlier this month when he said he was not involved in the ""potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material.""

""That is not something I've ever been involved in, heard of, would think would be wise policy,"" Holder said at the May 15 hearing.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday that no prosecution ever took place in the Fox case, and therefore it was ""self-evident"" that any charge Holder lied to the House panel was ""inaccurate.""

The attorney general said Tuesday he is ""not satisfied"" with some of the guidelines on how prosecutors conduct leak investigations involving reporters.

""We're going to have a real frank, good conversation about this,"" Holder told reporters following a naturalization ceremony for new U.S. citizens. ""And I think, we're going to make some changes because I'm not satisfied with where we are.""

Focus on State Dept. contractor

While much of the political debate centers around Rosen and search warrants for members of the press -- from a legal perspective, the criminal case is clearly focused on Kim. In the search warrant affidavit for Rosen, it is Kim's alleged acts that drive the legal narrative.

The government alleges call records of Kim's desk phone at the State Department between May and July of 2009 show 36 calls were exchanged between the government contractor and the reporter, including seven on the date Rosen published a story about North Korea.

Kim himself was interviewed by FBI agents three months later in September of 2009 where he denied leaking classified information.

He allegedly told investigators, according to the redacted affidavit, ""I wouldn't pick up a phone and call [the reporter] or [the news organization that the reporter works for].""

Eleven months after that interview -- and three months after the Rosen search warrant was issued -- Kim was indicted for unauthorized disclosure of ""National Defense Information"" and for making false statements to investigators. His case has not gone to trial and he denies the charges.

Hood Gunman: 'Dead Bodies Will Show War Is an Ugly Thing',2013-08-06,Perry Chiaramonte,"The trial of the Fort Hood gunman , who is acting as his own attorney , took a surreal turn as the former Army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 in the November 2009 attack grilled witnesses -- including his former boss in the military and a fellow Muslim who spoke to him the day of the shooting .
After a short opening statement in which ex-Army Maj. Nidal Hasan called himself a `` mujahedeen , '' admitted to the rampage and said `` the dead bodies will show that war is an ugly thing , '' Hasan cross-examined prosecution witnesses , including retired Lt. Col Ben Kirk Phillips , his former boss . When pressed by the defendant , Phillips acknowledged that his officer evaluation report had graded Hasan as `` outstanding . ''
But he declined to cross-examine one of his shooting victims , Sgt . Alonzo Lunsford , who provided the day ’ s most damning testimony .
Lunsford – who was shot seven times during the incident – described what happened that day , saying he first saw Hasan sitting in a chair , with his arms on his knees while looking at the floor .
He said Hasan then jumped up and ordered the one civilian in the room to leave before shouting , “ Allahu akbar ” and opening fire . Panic set in among the soldiers , who crowded toward a rear door , which was jammed .
Lunsford said he sprinted for the door at one point while Hasan was shooting , then turned around to see the gunman ’ s laser sight pointing at him before being shot in the head . Lunsford testified he tried to appear dead , then later decided to flee because , `` dead men do n't sweat . ''
He then made another sprint for the door as he was shot six more times before being pulled to safety .
Earlier , Hasan cross-examined Pat Sonti , who met Hasan at the Killeen Islamic Center in Fort Hood the morning of the shooting . Sonti said Hasan took the microphone at the mosque and called for prayer .
“ After call to prayer , he bid goodbye and told the congregation he was going home , '' Sonti said . `` I found that odd . ”
Hasan asked Sonti to describe the difference between the call for prayer and actual prayer , then asked who is supposed to lead the call .
`` Whoever the imam looks at , '' replied Sonti . `` But you know that , sir . ''
It was not clear how the 42-year-old Hasan plans to fashion his stance into a defense . Hasan had wanted to argue that he shot U.S. troops to protect Taliban fighters in Afghanistan , but the judge forbade the American-born Muslim and former Army psychiatrist from using that defense . Three witnesses took the stand after opening arguments , including the manager of the store Guns Galore , where Hasan had purchased the FN 27 model 5.7 handgun used in the attack .
`` Almost every trip I can remember was always [ for ] ammunition and magazines , extensions and at one point an additional laser , ” David Cheadle testified .
Another store employee , Frederick Brannan , who sold the weapon to Hasan , said he saw the shooter in the store almost every week where he would buy up to 300 rounds of ammo each time .
`` The sheer quantity of ammo being shot was expensive , '' Brannan said on the stand adding that he purchased magazine extensions and and a green laser sight that cost $ 350 .
Henricks told the military jury Hasan picked the date of the attack for a specific reason , though he did not immediately reveal details .
The trial is expected to take weeks and possibly months . Taking the witness stand will be many of the more than 30 people who were wounded , plus dozens of others who were inside the post 's Soldier Readiness Processing Center , where some service members were preparing to deploy to Afghanistan .
Hasan has never denied carrying out the attack , and the facts of the case are mostly settled . But questions abound about how the trial will play out . How will Hasan question his victims ? How will victims respond ? How will his health hold up ?
The defendant , who was shot in the back by officers responding to the attack , is now paralyzed from the waist down and must use a wheelchair . He requires 15- to 20-minute stretching breaks about every four hours , and he has to lift himself off his wheelchair for about a minute every half hour to avoid developing sores .
The judge , Col. Tara Osborn , told jurors to prepare for a trial that could last several months .
On Tuesday , guards stood watch with long assault rifles outside the courthouse . A long row of shipping freight containers , stacked three high , created a fence around the building , which was almost entirely hidden by 15-foot-tall stacks of heavy , shock-absorbing barriers that extend to the roofline .
The government has said that Hasan , a U.S.-born Muslim , had sent more than a dozen emails starting in December 2008 to Anwar al-Awlaki , a radical U.S.-born Islamic cleric killed by a drone strike in Yemen in 2011 .
Authorities in the military justice system have also struggled to avoid reversed sentences on appeal . Eleven of the 16 death sentences handed down by military juries in the last 30 years have been overturned , according to an academic study and court records .
That 's one reason why prosecutors and the military judge have been careful leading up to trial , said Geoffrey Corn , a professor at the South Texas College of Law and a former military lawyer . `` The public looks and says , ` This is an obviously guilty defendant .

Driving the news : President Trump quickly echoed Barr 's statement on Twitter , saying that `` 'Crossing State lines to incite violence is a FEDERAL CRIME ! Liberal Governors and Mayors need to get tougher on protestors or the federal government will use `` the unlimited power of our Military and many arrests . ''
Minnesota Gov . Tim Walz said Saturday that the state believes 80 % of protestors came from out of state .
Mayor Melvin Carter of St. Paul , Minnesota , walked back his original statement on Saturday that everyone arrested during protests in the city was `` from out of state , '' according to multiple reports , saying that the arrest data he was shown was inaccurate .
Reality check : Neither the president nor Barr provided information about why they believe protesters are crossing state lines to incite violence . Mass protests broke out Friday night in multiple U.S. cities across multiple states , with some escalating into violence and property destruction .
Barr 's denouncement against allegedly organized demonstrations followed Trump 's earlier claim on Saturday that protestors outside of the White House were `` professionally organized . ''
What they 're saying : Barr said that `` outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda '' and that `` in many places , it appears the violence is planned , organized and driven by anarchic and left extremist groups , far-left extremist groups , using antifa-like tactics , many of whom travel from outside the state to promote the violence . ''
`` It is a federal crime to cross state lines or to use interstate facilities to incite or participate in violent rioting , and we will enforce those laws , '' Barr said .
`` 80 % of the RIOTERS in Minneapolis last night were from OUT OF STATE , '' Trump tweeted after Barr 's press conference . `` They are harming businesses ( especially African American small businesses ) , homes , and the community of good , hardworking Minneapolis residents who want peace , equality , and to provide for their families .

Trump : White House protestors would be met with `` vicious dogs '' if they breached fence","Without citing evidence, Attorney General Bill Barr denounced what he described as ""planned"" violence from ""far-left extremist groups"" on Saturday, in response to many U.S. cities erupting in protest through Friday evening over the killing of George Floyd.

Driving the news: President Trump quickly echoed Barr's statement on Twitter, saying that ""'Crossing State lines to incite violence is a FEDERAL CRIME! Liberal Governors and Mayors need to get tougher on protestors or the federal government will use ""the unlimited power of our Military and many arrests.""

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Saturday that the state believes 80% of protestors came from out of state.

Mayor Melvin Carter of St. Paul, Minnesota, walked back his original statement on Saturday that everyone arrested during protests in the city was ""from out of state,"" according to multiple reports, saying that the arrest data he was shown was inaccurate.

Reality check: Neither the president nor Barr provided information about why they believe protesters are crossing state lines to incite violence. Mass protests broke out Friday night in multiple U.S. cities across multiple states, with some escalating into violence and property destruction.

Barr's denouncement against allegedly organized demonstrations followed Trump's earlier claim on Saturday that protestors outside of the White House were ""professionally organized.""

What they're saying: Barr said that ""outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda"" and that ""in many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized and driven by anarchic and left extremist groups, far-left extremist groups, using antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from outside the state to promote the violence.""

""It is a federal crime to cross state lines or to use interstate facilities to incite or participate in violent rioting, and we will enforce those laws,"" Barr said.

""80% of the RIOTERS in Minneapolis last night were from OUT OF STATE,"" Trump tweeted after Barr's press conference. ""They are harming businesses (especially African American small businesses), homes, and the community of good, hardworking Minneapolis residents who want peace, equality, and to provide for their families.""

The Justice Department 's decision to water down a recommendation by its own prosecutors for Stone to serve up to nine years in prison that outraged the President sent shockwaves through Washington . It also appears to reflect Trump 's redoubled determination to escalate pressure on core institutions of the US government to pursue his personal and political priorities .
Wednesday morning , he brazenly offered congratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for `` taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought , '' even though multiple courts have upheld former special counsel Robert Mueller 's appointment , his authority , and the decisions he made .
The sudden storm over Stone , triggered by an early-hours tweet by the President , is part of an accelerating pattern of unmoderated behavior since Trump was found not guilty of impeachable offenses a week ago by Republican senators -- some of whom expressed the hope that the scar of impeachment would temper his wildest impulses .
Instead , the President appears to have drawn a lesson about impunity from his experience and seems committed to accelerating his bid to subvert constitutional and political norms . This may augur a period of expansive power plays by the President -- as he runs for reelection and that could become even more intense if he wins a second term .
In another sign of his defiance , Trump last week fired officials , including White House Ukraine specialist Lt.

‘NOT JOKING’

Trump’s naming of Whitaker as acting attorney general caused controversy in part because it meant that the president’s appointee oversees the probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into whether Moscow meddled in the election and colluded with Trump’s campaign.

Whitaker had publicly criticized the investigation before joining the Justice Department in 2017 but said on Friday he had not discussed it with Trump.

White House expands on IRS details

The White House’s explanation of what it knew about the investigation into the IRS’s scrutiny of conservative political groups and how it planned for the eventual release of that information shifted once again Tuesday.

Just a day after telling reporters that chief of staff Denis McDonough and other senior White House staff learned of the situation nearly a month ago, press secretary Jay Carney revealed Tuesday that White House officials had consulted with the Treasury Department on how to make the findings public.

The conversations “had to do with the timing of the release of the information and the findings of the actual audit,” Carney said, and were led on the White House side by Mark Childress, a deputy chief of staff.

Carney said there was “discussion about the possibility of a speech” by Lois Lerner, who oversaw the IRS’s work on tax-exempt groups, and conversation about testimony by the acting commissioner of the agency and “what he would say” if asked about the issue.

In addition to McDonough and Childress, Carney has named only one other senior White House staffer who knew of the IRS probe: White House counsel Kathy Ruemmler, who made the decision not to inform the president of the forthcoming inspector general report on the issue.

Carney said he hadn’t revealed more information about which officials were aware of the situation and when they were informed in previous briefings because he hadn’t been asked. “I gave you the information in response to the questions, and we have provided an enormous amount of information about the communication we’ve had — who learned what about this and when, the fact that the president was not informed,” he said.

But pressed for information on who else knew of the report’s existence before the first news stories about it emerged on May 10, and how they were informed, Carney wouldn’t say much. “She may have had conversations, but there was certainly an email, perhaps,” he said of Ruemmler.

“Perhaps or for certain?” Bloomberg reporter Hans Nichols asked. “Hans, can I ask — what is it that you’re trying to do?” Nichols responded that he was looking to get a clear story from the White House. “Here I am, asking precise questions and you’re acting like I’m petulant,” the often-aggressive reporter said, to laughs from some in the briefing room.

“I can’t believe anybody would ever call you petulant,” Carney shot back. Nichols quickly shot back: “Or you forthcoming.”

The briefing also grew testy when Carney was asked whether he was among the senior staff who were told of the IRS investigation before news reports emerged. He was not, he said — like the president, he learned about it from news reports.

As he did on Monday, Carney again defended the White House’s position of not looping in Obama about the inspector general’s report of the IRS before the news became public.

WASHINGTON – The Justice Department will not bring federal charges against a New York City police officer over the death of Eric Garner during a chaotic arrest that ignited nationwide protests five years ago.

The Associated Press is protesting what it calls a massive and unprecedented intrusion into its gathering of news. The target of that wrath is the U.S. Justice Department, which secretly collected phone records for several AP reporters last year. The AP says it's caught in the middle of a Justice Department leak investigation.

The scope of the Justice Department subpoenas is what gives David Schultz, a lawyer for AP, pause.

""It was a very large number of records that were obtained, including phone records from Hartford, New York, Washington, from the U.S. House of Representatives and elsewhere where AP has bureaus. It included home and cellphone numbers from a number of AP reporters,"" Schulz says.

It's not clear what the U.S. Attorney in Washington, D.C., is investigating. But the AP thinks it might be related to its story from May 2012 that described the CIA stopping a terrorist plot to plant a bomb on an airplane with a sophisticated new kind of device.

How that story came to be is the subject of a criminal leak investigation. But the AP says the Justice Department might now be flouting the First Amendment to try to build a case.

""This sort of activity really amounts to massive government monitoring of the actions of the press, and it really puts a dagger at the heart of AP's news-gathering activities,"" Schulz says.

Justice Department officials didn't want to talk on tape. But a spokesman for Ron Machen, the U.S. attorney in D.C., said he follows laws and Justice Department rules.

What are those rules?

For starters, the attorney general himself needs to sign off on a subpoena to a reporter. And prosecutors must demonstrate that they made every effort to get the information in other ways before even turning to the press.

But those rules also say prosecutors need to notify the media organization in advance unless that would pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation.

David Schulz, the lawyer for AP, says the guidelines for the Justice Department's dealings with reporters date back to a dark time.

""They were put into place after Watergate, when everyone was very alarmed by the abuses and excesses of the Nixon Justice Department in subpoenaing reporters and trying to get information about their sources and activities,"" he says.

“ That ’ s where the policy is made , ” he adds . “ The people appointed have been young , extremely conservative ideologically , and mostly recommended by Leonard Leo . ”

A number of appointees have also been criticized for being inexperienced , particularly those nominees rated “ not qualified ” by the American Bar Association ( ABA ) .
Conservatives have long been critical of the ABA – a private legal organization that has issued advisory ratings of federal judicial nominees since 1956 – claiming that its ratings are biased against Republican nominees . Some academic analyses have backed up this claim , and President George W. Bush refused to allow the ABA early review of his nominees throughout his eight-year presidency . His successor , Barack Obama , brought the ABA back into the fold . He never nominated a candidate rated “ not qualified ” by the organization .
Four of President Trump ’ s nominees have been rated unanimously not qualified by the ABA ’ s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary , with at least a portion of the committee rating 24 other nominees not qualified . ( Almost half of his nominees have been rated “ well qualified . ” )
In rating a nominee , the ABA examines their personal background and legal writings , as well as interviewing the nominee and , confidentially , some of their colleagues . A recurring feature of the “ not qualified ” ratings for Trump nominees has been a lack of experience .
Sarah Pitlyk , a former clerk for Justice Brett Kavanaugh confirmed to a Missouri district court this month , received a unanimous “ not qualified ” rating because she has never tried a civil or criminal case , examined a witness , taken a deposition , picked a jury , or argued a motion in a state or federal trial court . ( The committee did not comment on Judge Pitlyk ’ s career advocating for anti-abortion clients and policies . )
Justin Walker , a law professor in his 30s , had similarly sparse courtroom experience – though he ’ d clerked for both Justice Kavanaugh and former Justice Anthony Kennedy – and a “ substantial majority ” of the ABA committee rated him unqualified . He was confirmed to a district court judgeship in October .
The ABA ’ s preference for 12 years ’ experience isn ’ t what most bothers Josh Blackman , a professor at South Texas College of Law Houston . What concerns him is how the committee evaluates the temperament and reputation of some nominees – notably Lawrence VanDyke , a former state solicitor general , confirmed to the Ninth Circuit last week , who the ABA reported to be arrogant , lazy , an ideologue , and unqualified .
“ When [ ratings ] move to subjective facts like temperament I have much stronger doubts , because often those are code words for , ‘ We don ’ t like their politics , ’ ” says Professor Blackman .
Senate Democrats haven ’ t been using code words to hide their dislike of the politics of Mr. Trump ’ s judicial picks . ( “ I ’ m concerned about her ability to fairly and impartially apply these important [ abortion ] precedents , given her strong personal views , ” Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said during the confirmation hearing of Neomi Rao , who was nominated to replace Justice Kavanaugh on the D.C . Circuit Court . ) But Senate Republicans have also , on occasion , questioned the ideology of nominees – accusing them of being insufficiently conservative .
Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri also voiced “ deep concerns ” over the judicial philosophy , and views on abortion , of Judge Rao – concerned that she might not be anti-abortion enough . The Senate eventually confirmed her , but Judge Halil “ Sul ” Ozerden , a nominee for the Fifth Circuit , has not been so fortunate . His nomination has been stalled by opposition from Senator Hawley and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , in part due to his 2012 dismissal of a challenge to the Affordable Care Act ’ s contraceptive mandate . Judge Ozerden said he dismissed the case on procedural grounds .
Republican senators “ are stress-testing these judges ’ ideology , ” says Jill Dash , vice president of strategic engagement at the progressive American Constitution Society . “ It ’ s not enough to be conservative . You have to be extremely conservative . ”
It ’ s still too early to know if Mr. Trump ’ s selections are having a significant effect on the law , according to Professor Tobias , but that could be arriving soon .
The D.C . Circuit ruled last month that the House of Representatives can subpoena Mr. Trump ’ s tax records . Judges Reo and Greg Katsas , both Trump appointees , dissented from a decision denying a rehearing “ en banc ” ( by the full court ) , calling the subpoena “ unprecedented ” and a “ threat to presidential autonomy and independence. ” The Supreme Court will review the case in March , and those dissents could form the legal basis for a majority of justices to rule in Mr. Trump ’ s favor .
But abortion is the issue where judges selected by Mr. Trump – who said as a candidate he would appoint “ pro-life judges ” – could make their mark soonest .
Four Trump appointees to the Fifth Circuit joined a 9-6 majority denying a rehearing en banc of a decision allowing a restrictive Louisiana abortion law , bearing striking similarity to a Texas law the Supreme Court struck down in 2016 , to go into effect . The high court will review that ruling in March . Last week the justices also declined to hear a challenge to an opinion authored by Judge John K. Bush , a Trump appointee to the Sixth Circuit , upholding a Kentucky law requiring doctors who perform abortions to perform an invasive transvaginal ultrasound – probing patients , displaying pictures , and describing the images to women .
Opinions like that are why Democrats should make judicial appointments more of a campaign issue in the 2020 election cycle , says Ms . Dash . Republicans certainly have .
“ Nobody ’ s done more to change the court system in the history of our country than Donald Trump , ” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told supporters at a Trump rally in November . “ And Mr. President , we ’ re gon na keep on doing it . My motto is , ‘ Leave no vacancy behind . ’ ”
And as much as anything else , the likelihood of an election cycle focused on judicial appointments is what concerns Professor Tobias .
“ It ’ s corrosive for the federal judiciary , it politicizes the courts , ” he says .
“ Trump ’ s view is the courts are like anything else . They can be manipulated and trained and bent to his will , ” he adds . “ That ’ s not what the founders anticipated . It ’ s very troubling . ”","In addition to being young – half of his appellate appointments were under 50 – and deeply conservative, Mr. Trump’s chosen judges are also overwhelmingly white and male.

“When [ratings] move to subjective facts like temperament I have much stronger doubts, because often those are code words for, ‘We don’t like their politics,’” says Professor Blackman.

Senate Democrats haven’t been using code words to hide their dislike of the politics of Mr. Trump’s judicial picks. (“I’m concerned about her ability to fairly and impartially apply these important [abortion] precedents, given her strong personal views,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said during the confirmation hearing of Neomi Rao, who was nominated to replace Justice Kavanaugh on the D.C. Circuit Court.) But Senate Republicans have also, on occasion, questioned the ideology of nominees – accusing them of being insufficiently conservative.

Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri also voiced “deep concerns” over the judicial philosophy, and views on abortion, of Judge Rao – concerned that she might not be anti-abortion enough. The Senate eventually confirmed her, but Judge Halil “Sul” Ozerden, a nominee for the Fifth Circuit, has not been so fortunate. His nomination has been stalled by opposition from Senator Hawley and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, in part due to his 2012 dismissal of a challenge to the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate. Judge Ozerden said he dismissed the case on procedural grounds.

Republican senators “are stress-testing these judges’ ideology,” says Jill Dash, vice president of strategic engagement at the progressive American Constitution Society. “It’s not enough to be conservative. You have to be extremely conservative.”

It’s still too early to know if Mr. Trump’s selections are having a significant effect on the law, according to Professor Tobias, but that could be arriving soon.

The D.C. Circuit ruled last month that the House of Representatives can subpoena Mr. Trump’s tax records. Judges Reo and Greg Katsas, both Trump appointees, dissented from a decision denying a rehearing “en banc” (by the full court), calling the subpoena “unprecedented” and a “threat to presidential autonomy and independence.” The Supreme Court will review the case in March, and those dissents could form the legal basis for a majority of justices to rule in Mr. Trump’s favor.

But abortion is the issue where judges selected by Mr. Trump – who said as a candidate he would appoint “pro-life judges” – could make their mark soonest.

Four Trump appointees to the Fifth Circuit joined a 9-6 majority denying a rehearing en banc of a decision allowing a restrictive Louisiana abortion law, bearing striking similarity to a Texas law the Supreme Court struck down in 2016, to go into effect. The high court will review that ruling in March. Last week the justices also declined to hear a challenge to an opinion authored by Judge John K. Bush, a Trump appointee to the Sixth Circuit, upholding a Kentucky law requiring doctors who perform abortions to perform an invasive transvaginal ultrasound – probing patients, displaying pictures, and describing the images to women.

Opinions like that are why Democrats should make judicial appointments more of a campaign issue in the 2020 election cycle, says Ms. Dash. Republicans certainly have.

“Nobody’s done more to change the court system in the history of our country than Donald Trump,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told supporters at a Trump rally in November. “And Mr. President, we’re gonna keep on doing it. My motto is, ‘Leave no vacancy behind.’”

And as much as anything else, the likelihood of an election cycle focused on judicial appointments is what concerns Professor Tobias.

“It’s corrosive for the federal judiciary, it politicizes the courts,” he says.

“Trump’s view is the courts are like anything else. They can be manipulated and trained and bent to his will,” he adds. “That’s not what the founders anticipated. It’s very troubling.”

The Justice Department is charging four men with destruction of federal property over an attempt to topple a statue of Andrew Jackson in Washington, D.C.

In a criminal complaint unsealed on Saturday, the DOJ alleges that Lee Michael Cantrell, 47, Connor Matthew Judd, 20, Ryan Lane, 37, and Graham Lloyd, 37, participated in a June 22 attempt to tear down the statue in Lafayette Park, just near the White House.

The Justice Department statement says that video evidence shows all four, along with other unidentified individuals, attempting to pull down and damage the statue of Jackson, who protesters apparently targeted over his treatment of Native Americans and ownership of enslaved people.

As of Saturday, Judd was the only one of the four who had been taken into custody.

The charges were filed the same day that President Trump signed an executive order promising a crackdown on the destruction of federal monuments and threatening prosecution to the fullest extent of the law.

""I just had the privilege of signing a very strong Executive Order protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues - and combatting recent Criminal Violence. Long prison terms for these lawless acts against our Great Country!"" Trump tweeted after signing the order Friday.

In five-plus years , Obama has only issued 61 clemency actions — 52 pardons and 9 commutations — while denying over 8,000 petitions . His one-per-month rate comes to half the pace of George W. Bush , and far below the scale of the two 20th-century Presidents who flexed their muscles the most on clemency actions , FDR ( 3,687 in eleven-plus years ) and LBJ ( 1,186 in sixty-two months , where Obama is at now ) .
Just last week , Reason ’ s Jacob Sullum noted that Obama still hadn ’ t reached Nixonian levels of mercy , at least on commutations :
Still , there is no reason why Obama should be so stingy with commutations , which he so far has issued at a slower rate than all but three other modern presidents : George W. Bush ( 11 commutations in 96 months ) , George H.W . Bush ( three in 48 months ) , and Ronald Reagan ( 13 in 96 months ) . Obama has now issued 10 commutations in 64 months , which by that measure makes him about 26 percent more merciful than Bush II , 46 percent more merciful than Bush I , and 14 percent more merciful than Reagan . ( Obama still lags all three on pardons , which clear people ’ s records , typically after they have completed their sentences . ) But surely a man who has repeatedly criticized excessively long prison sentences should aspire to do more than surpass these truly awfulcommutation records . Obama is still a long way from Nixonian levels of mercy , since Tricky Dick shortened 60 sentences in 67 years—a rate 83 percent higher than Obama ’ s . A few months ago , Deputy Attorney General James Cole indicated that Obama planned to pick up the pace , which was encouraging . Not so encouraging : Cole , whose department had at that point received about 9,000 commutation petitions since Obama took office , asked for help in finding worthy applicants , which suggested the government ’ s lawyers are either lazy or extremely picky . Cantu ’ s case seems to fit the latter theory . The New York Times reports that “ a Justice Department official said the case was so clearly unjust , it moved through the process at unusual speed and was sent less than a month ago to the White House , where Ms. Ruemmler recommended that Mr. Obama approve it. ” By the president ’ s own account , there are thousands of other clear injustices that he has the power to remedy . He could start with all of the crack offenders sentenced under pre-2010 rules that almost everyone now agrees were unreasonably harsh . The Smarter Sentencing Act would make the shorter crack sentences enacted in 2010 retroactive . But if Congress fails to approve that bill , Obama still has the authority to act on his own , which would be consistent with the statements he and his underlings have made regarding our excessively punitive criminal justice system .
Sullum may get his wish . Yahoo ’ s Liz Goodwin reported yesterday that the White House plans a major revamp of their clemency process , focusing on non-violent drug offenders with inordinately harsh federal sentences for either pardons or commutations . She focuses on the case of Barbara Scrivner , serving a 30-year sentence for participating in a meth ring run by her then-husband , as an example :
Thousands and thousands of people like Scrivner are serving punishingly long sentences in federal prison based on draconian policies that were a relic of the “ tough on crime ” antidrug laws of the ’ 80s and ’ 90s . Thirty years after skyrocketing urban violence and drug use sparked politicians to impose longer and longer sentences for drug crimes , America now incarcerates a higher rate of its population than any other country in the world . This dubious record has finally provoked a bipartisan backlash against such stiff penalties . The old laws are slowly being repealed . Now , in his final years in office , Obama has trained his sights on prisoners like Scrivner , and wants to use his previously dormant pardon power as part of a larger strategy to restore fairness to the criminal-justice system . A senior administration official tells Yahoo News the president could grant clemency to “ hundreds , perhaps thousands ” of people locked up for nonviolent drug crimes by the time he leaves office … The scope of the new clemency initiative is so large that administration officials are preparing a series of personnel and process changes to help them manage the influx of petitions they expect Obama to approve . Among the changes is reforming the recently censured office within the Justice Department responsible for processing pardon petitions . Yahoo News has learned that the pardon attorney , Ronald Rodgers , who was criticized in a 2012 Internal watchdog report for mishandling a high-profile clemency petition , is likely to step down as part of that overhaul . Additional procedures for handling large numbers of clemency petitions could be announced as soon as this week , a senior administration official said , though it could take longer .
In my column for The Week , I argue that this is long overdue , and that politics have interfered with a necessary mechanism for correcting injustices in sentencing and excessive prosecution :
This is long overdue . Congress passed mandatory-minimum sentencing over justified dissatisfaction with the judiciary for being too lenient . The problem , though , is that even the good intentions of these laws lead to obvious cases of injustice . Goodwin highlights one such case , that of Barbara Scrivner , who got 30 years without parole for taking part in a meth ring . Despite playing a minor role — her husband masterminded the ring — the judge had no choice but to hand down the 30-year sentence . That specific mandatory-minimum requirement has since been repealed , and prosecutors tell Goodwin that Scrivner probably wouldn ’ t have gotten a 20-year sentence today — which is how long she ’ s already served . The near-absolute power of the pardon was meant for cases like Scrivner , and others trapped by excessive prosecution or sentencing . People who commit serious crimes should expect serious consequences , but justice requires that the punishment fit the crime . No system of justice is perfect , of course . When the judicial process fails to deliver a just outcome , governors and presidents should exercise their authority to correct the excesses , while employing a competent screening process to assure that cases of true injustice receive clemency , rather than those that are mere favors for those with political connections .
Not everyone agrees , however . Our friend Andy McCarthy , a former federal prosecutor , believes that the reported scope of the effort amounts to an end run around Congress :
The pardon power exists so that the president can act in individual cases to correct excesses and injustices . It is not supposed to be a vehicle by which presidents rewrite congressional statutes that they disagree with philosophically ( just as “ prosecutorial discretion , ” another doctrine the Obama administration has abused , is not supposed to be a vehicle by which the president substitutes his policies for duly enacted federal law ) . The Obama administration is philosophically opposed to mandatory minimums in the federal penal law , especially in the narcotics area . The Justice Department is filled with racialist ideologues and pro-criminal rights ideologues ( they tend to be the same people ) who have long contended that the drug laws are racist . This is another of those absurd arguments that finds racism based on unintended consequences rather than racist designs . … Moreover , we should be under no illusion : this is not an exercise in mitigating injustice in individual cases . This is an abuse of political power to rewrite the federal drug laws because , as a matter of ideology , Obama does not agree with stern sentences for drug offenders .
Obviously , I disagree , although McCarthy makes good points too . The power of pardons or commutations also exist to correct oversentencing in cases where sentencing requirements were irrationally applied . Scrivner got 30 years despite not being convicted of a violent crime , which she must serve in full before release . Violent criminals get far less , and in Scrivner ’ s case the judge not only lamented the mandatory sentence , prosecutors today wouldn ’ t be able to get it — because Congress did repeal the mandatory sentence for the crime for which she got convicted . Did that punishment fit the crime ?
For those of us concerned about excessive government power , especially in terms of oversentencing and overprosecution , the executive power of clemency provides a check on those abuses — and one that carries substantial political accountability to boot . As Doug Mataconis also notes , that accountability is why the practice has declined dramatically since LBJ :
There is , of course , nothing that limits the Presidential power to grant pardons and clemency to individual cases as McCarthy suggests . Indeed , this is one of the few areas in which the President ’ s power is unchecked by any branch of government . Once a President issues a pardon or grants clemency , there is absolutely nothing that the Courts or Congress can do about the matter . Granted , there have been plenty of situations in which individual pardon decisions have carried a political cost , which is one of the reasons why the number of pardons that Presidents have issued has dropped steadily since the Nixon Administration . However , that is an entirely different issue from the question of whether or not the President has acted within his authority when granting pardon or clemency requests . In the end , that is an irrelevant question largely because there are no limits on the power at all . As for the rest of McCarthy ’ s argument , you can expect that this will be the standard conservative response to this announcement . Rather than recognizing the fact that the President is right about the terrible impact that things like disparate sentencing for crack cocaine and mandatory minimums have had on the lives of real people , they will make the false argument that President is “ making an end run ” around Congress . In reality , what ’ s happening here is that the President is authorizing the power that the Constitution has granted him to right a terrible wrong and to bring this issue to the forefront of public attention . Maybe when that happens , the Republicans in Congress will finally act on this issue rather than using it as another weapon in the never ending partisan attacks on the President .
The power of Congress mainly relates to checks on power going forward . To rectify injustices of the past — to the extent they exist — the executive branch not only has the authority to act but the duty to do so as well .","For all of the justified concern over abuse of executive authority by Barack Obama, especially as it relates to ObamaCare, this administration has proven as reluctant as its closest predecessors in using one truly unilateral power: clemency.

The report is said to focus on senior FBI leadership at the time , like Comey and Attorney General Loretta Lynch , rather than on Clinton .
One source told ABC News the draft report about Comey described his conduct as `` insubordinate . '' Another source reportedly agreed with that characterization but could not confirm that the exact term had been used .
ABC News ' sources also said the draft report chastised Lynch for the way she handled the Clinton email investigation .
Comey has accused Lynch , who was appointed by President Barack Obama , of having a `` tortured half-out , half-in '' approach to the Clinton investigation . He also expressed disapproval with her decision not to recuse herself from the investigation and added that he considered calling for a special prosecutor to be appointed to oversee the investigation because he considered Lynch to have bias in favor of the Clintons .
Comey said it was Lynch 's apparent ambivalence toward the investigation that prompted him to call a press conference in July 2016 announcing that the FBI would not recommend charges be filed against Clinton . He noted during the presser that he had not consulted with the Department of Justice about the statement he was about to make . Comey later said he specified that to assure the public of the FBI 's independence .
Nevertheless , his move was considered highly unusual , given that the attorney general — in this case Lynch — was meant to announce whether Clinton would be charged .
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said as much last year , writing in a memo recommending Comey 's firing that it `` was wrong '' for Comey to `` usurp the Attorney General 's authority '' when he held the press conference .
Horowitz 's draft report also reportedly criticized Comey for sending a letter to Congress in October 2016 announcing that the FBI had reopened its investigation into Clinton , who has repeatedly said the letter — sent days before the election — was the final nail in the coffin for her 2016 presidential bid .
While Comey has said he would have refrained from sending the letter if Lynch had told him not to , he drew sharp criticism for his role in sending it at all .
In particular , ABC News reported that before Comey sent the October letter to Congress , at least one senior DOJ official told the FBI that publicizing such a detail so close to the election would violate department policy and federal guidelines restricting the disclosure of information pertaining to ongoing investigations .
Comey , whom President Donald Trump fired last year , has said it makes him `` nauseous '' to think he may have swayed the election , but he maintained that he did what he thought was right .
The final report is pending release while Comey and other parties involved have the chance to go over a draft and recommend changes and offer responses to allegations contained in the report , as is normal practice with such investigations .
Trump and his allies are gearing up to use the report to vindicate the president 's claims that he fired Comey as FBI director over what the administration characterizes as gross misconduct .

In a hearing that escalated into a boisterous public shaming of one of the country 's most-feared government agencies , lawmakers took turns Friday calling outgoing IRS Commissioner Steven Miller on the carpet for his department 's scandalous practice of targeting conservative groups .
Miller rebuffed attempts to extract the names of those responsible , saying he did not know . But lawmakers vowed that the tense hearing would mark only the start of a series of investigations , in which criminal activity could be probed .
Rep. Mike Kelly , R-Pa. , seemed to capture the angst against the agency toward the end of the hours-long hearing , as he described the ways its agents are capable of ruining lives .
`` You can put anybody out of business that you want . ... When the IRS comes in there , you 're not allowed to be shoddy , '' he said , suggesting the agency 's leadership was being held to a different standard now that it is coming under scrutiny .
`` This is absolutely an overreach , and this is an outrage for all Americans , '' he said .
When he finished , the committee room erupted in cheers and applause that lasted several seconds .
While Democrats voiced concern that the latest scandal would be used to score `` political points , '' lawmakers on both sides of the aisle scolded the agency . And they made clear they 'd be pressuring the IRS in the weeks to come on several points -- namely , who was responsible and whether lawmakers were overtly lied to last year .
On the first question , they got few answers from Miller during Friday 's testimony .
But they repeatedly confronted the acting commissioner -- who was ousted from him job earlier this week -- about his and other officials ' failure to disclose the program last year despite being aware of it .
`` In fact , we were repeatedly told no such targeting was happening . That is n't being misled , that 's lying , '' said Rep. Dave Camp , R-Mich. , the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee .
Miller seemed to frustrate lawmakers ' attempts to dig deeper . He claimed , a week after the scandal broke and a year after he first learned of the practice , that he still did not know who was responsible .
`` I do n't have that name , '' he testified , after Rep. Dave Reichert , R-Wash. , asked who was behind the program .
Miller also claimed -- over and over -- he was being honest with Congress during a hearing last year .
`` You did not share the information you knew , '' Reichert charged .
This claim was met with deep skepticism Friday . Miller acknowledged he learned of the practice during a May 3 , 2012 , briefing . Yet when he was asked about it at a July 25 hearing that year , he said only that some applications fell into a particular category -- and that those organizations were grouped for `` consistency '' and `` quality . ''
A letter he wrote to a Republican lawmaker the month before also gave a general description of the process without acknowledging that some groups were being singled out based on words like `` Tea Party '' and `` Patriot . ''
`` How can we not conclude that you misled this committee ? '' Rep. Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , former GOP vice presidential nominee , asked Miller .
Miller said he `` did not mislead the committee '' and stands by his answer .
Asked whether his answer was `` incomplete , '' he said again he answered `` truthfully . ''
Miller objected to the term `` targeting , '' and claimed political motivations were not at play in the program , which began in 2010 . But he apologized for the program and said `` foolish mistakes were made by people trying to be more efficient . ''
`` As acting commissioner , I want to apologize on the behalf of the Internal Revenue Service for the mistakes that we made and the poor service provided , '' Miller said . `` The affected organizations and the American public deserve better . ''
The hearing is the first to examine the scandal , and will likely kick off a string of subsequent hearings and investigations . Republicans made clear that the two retirements or resignations to date would not satisfy their concerns .
Camp ripped the tax-collecting agency over the practice at the start of the hearing . `` Now we know the truth -- or at least some of it , '' he said . `` We also know that these revelations are just the tip of the iceberg . It would be a mistake to treat this as just one scandal . ''
He questioned how high the scandal went , and also suggested there was other targeting of conservatives that has not yet been acknowledged by the agency . He called it part of a `` culture of cover-ups . ''
`` This systemic abuse can not be fixed with just one resignation , or two , '' he said . He said the problem is not just personnel , but the size and scope of the IRS .
The inspector general who released a scathing report on the agency also testified Friday . J. Russell George -- the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration -- said his findings raised `` troubling questions '' about the agency , while claiming some of the wrongdoing was apparently done with no-to-little supervision .
But he said all three allegations against the agency turned out to be true -- that it was using `` inappropriate criteria '' to screen conservative groups , it was delaying applications and it was asking unnecessary questions .
Rep. Sander Levin , D-Mich. , the top Democrat on the committee , said the agency 's management `` completely failed the American people . '' At the same time , he urged Republicans not to use the hearing to `` score political points . ''
Republicans , though , expressed more concern after they learned Thursday that the IRS official who led the tax-exempt organizations unit when the targeting took place -- Sarah Hall Ingram -- has since moved over to the IRS office responsible for ObamaCare .
Miller said Friday he was the one who promoted her and called her a `` superb civil servant . ''
The acknowledgement comes after the administration announced that Ingram 's successor Joseph Grant -- who had only been on the job a few days -- would be retiring .

The Wild West just got wilder.

The Internal Revenue Service is reeling from a scandal that will surely leave the agency even more impotent against the rise of anonymous political cash, campaign finance watchdogs say — and there’s plenty of groups from both sides waiting to take advantage.

Story Continued Below

Congressional Democrats and reform groups have been begging the IRS to investigate the nonprofits — a role the agency never asked for and isn’t very good at — but they fear the new scandal means those calls may go unanswered.

In fact, there could be less oversight than ever before.

“Even though the targeting appears to be a local problem of a career employee, it may cause the IRS to be even more timid enforcing the laws on election spending,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).

Targeting groups because of their politics is wrong, Whitehouse added, “but so is lying to the government to achieve phony tax status and hide the donors behind political attack ads.”

Super PACs have a catchy name and get most of the attention, but 501(c)(4) control real — and more importantly, anonymous — money. According to OpenSecrets, they spent at least $250 million of dollars on political activities last cycle — and the real figure is likely much higher since they don’t have to disclose all their spending until years after the election.

The nonprofits include groups that on their face certainly look like political operations, such as the Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity, the Karl Rove-linked Crossroads GPS and the pro-Barack Obama Priorities USA. Organizing for Action, the successor to Obama’s campaign, is a 501(c)(4), as is the new FWD.us group from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.

For critics of the campaign finance system, especially after the 2010 Citizens United decision, the problem is those groups spending millions of untraceable dollars are allowed to act with impunity.

“I think the IRS caving too quickly on this,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “Any time the IRS tries to enforce any laws regarding the abuse or misuse of C4 status, the Republicans scream,” Sloan said.

An irony of the IRS subjecting various new tea party groups to extra scrutiny is that they aren’t exactly been big spenders.

Several regional tea party nonprofits raised only a few thousand dollars – if they raised any money at all, according to their 2011 tax reports, the latest available to the public. For example, the Georgia Tea Party raised nearly $15,000; Richmond Tea Party Patriots, $43,000; and Tea Party Patriots of Southern New Jersey, $9,500.

During an address at the Gerald R Ford Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids , Michigan , Barr took aim at Hollywood companies , including Walt Disney Co , as well as Apple , Alphabet 's Google and Microsoft Corp over their corporate dealings with China .
He also said the US had become overly dependent on Chinese imports of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) to fight the coronavirus outbreak , including face masks , medical gowns and other protective equipment designed to curb the spread of COVID-19 , the disease caused by the novel coronavirus .
During his speech , Barr further accused hackers linked to the Chinese government of targeting American universities and businesses to steal research related to vaccine development , levelling the allegation against Beijing hours after Western agencies made similar claims against Russia .

''","The Trump administration on Thursday continued its full-throttle effort to portray China as a threat to United States interests, as Attorney General William Barr lambasted the US's reliance on Chinese goods and services, and accused US media and technology giants of collaborating with China.

During an address at the Gerald R Ford Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Barr took aim at Hollywood companies, including Walt Disney Co, as well as Apple, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft Corp over their corporate dealings with China.

He also said the US had become overly dependent on Chinese imports of personal protective equipment (PPE) to fight the coronavirus outbreak, including face masks, medical gowns and other protective equipment designed to curb the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

During his speech, Barr further accused hackers linked to the Chinese government of targeting American universities and businesses to steal research related to vaccine development, levelling the allegation against Beijing hours after Western agencies made similar claims against Russia.

""The People's Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg - an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's pre-eminent superpower,"" Barr said on Thursday.

'All too willing to collaborate'

On Thursday, US media giants were swept up in the Trump administration's anti-China campaign.

""Corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the (Chinese Communist Party),"" Barr said, adding that Hollywood has routinely caved in to pressure and censored their films ""to appease the Chinese Communist Party"".

""I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day.""

The companies and the Chinese embassy in Washington, DC did not immediately comment. Apple declined a Reuters news agency request for comment.

Barr accused US media and technology first of being too willing to take steps to ease access to the large and lucrative Chinese market.

Barr suggested Apple iPhones ""wouldn't be sold [in China] if they were impervious to penetration by Chinese authorities"". He suggested American tech companies were imposing a ""double standard.""

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they ’ re published .
Even as the Justice Department announced that federal prisons would release vulnerable , nonviolent inmates to home confinement to avoid the spread of COVID-19 , the agency was quietly adopting a policy that makes it harder for inmates to qualify for release , not easier . The result has been that more than 98 % of inmates remain in federal custody , while a handful of celebrity inmates , like former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort , have been released to home detention .
In two memos , one in late March and a second in early April , Attorney General William Barr directed the Federal Bureau of Prisons , which is part of the Justice Department , to begin identifying inmates who could safely be released to home confinement — essentially house arrest . They instructed prison officials to grant “ priority treatment ” to inmates deemed to present minimal risk to the public .
Separately , however , the Bureau of Prisons had drafted a 20-page policy document this year that altered a standard adopted only a year ago and made it harder for an inmate to qualify as minimum risk .
███ obtained a copy of the document , which does not appear to have been finalized , and its existence surprised and baffled lawyers , prison reform advocates and inmates interviewed for this article . “ It really tanks the whole enterprise if , once an instrument is selected , it can be strategically altered to make sure low-risk people don ’ t get released , ” said Brandon Garrett , a law professor at Duke University who studies risk-assessment tools . “ If you change the cut points , you ’ ve effectively changed the instrument . ”
The original assessment tool emerged from the First Step Act , a major criminal justice overhaul passed in 2018 . Known as PATTERN , for Prisoner Assessment Tool Targeting Estimated Risk and Needs , it assigns a pair of numbers — based on factors like age , prison courses completed and history of violence — that purport to predict the likelihood an inmate will commit a violent crime , or any crime , upon release . Inmates are assigned to one of four categories for risk of recidivism : minimum , low , medium or high . In a July 2019 report , the Justice Department published a chart delineating the range of scores that fall into each category . The law requires that the methodology be released “ publicly on the Department of Justice website . ”
Get Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter .
Justin Long , a spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons , confirmed that the bureau had revised the risk categories without informing the public . The 2019 report was an “ interim report , ” Long wrote in an email . “ The interim report mentioned that DOJ would seek feedback and update the tool accordingly , which was done. ” That was news to people , like Garrett , who had provided feedback to the government on the rules .
The Justice Department , Long wrote , posted an update to its 2019 report in January “ to reflect changes to the PATTERN tool. ” But that update says nothing about categorizing inmates more restrictively . To the contrary , the changes it describes largely respond to the comments of experts who raised concerns about racial bias and who sought greater transparency . As for the draft policy document , Long wrote , it “ was not authorized for release . ”
The Bureau of Prisons ’ reliance on the unpublished policy document has exacerbated widespread puzzlement about how the agency is implementing Barr ’ s home-confinement order . “ There ’ s been nothing but confusion , ” David Patton , the chief federal public defender for the New York City area , said . “ We ’ ve received a steady stream of questions from clients about their scores , and we have no answers , because BOP doesn ’ t give us any . ”
Fewer prisoners have been released than was expected when the attorney general made his announcement , lawyers say . About 3,050 inmates have been moved to home confinement as of May 21 , Bureau of Prisons records show . That ’ s around 1.8 % of the people under the bureau ’ s supervision . That figure is significantly smaller than the roughly 20 % of inmates who fall into the minimum risk category ( though it ’ s not automatic that all of them would qualify for release ) under the 2019 rules .
The slow pace of prisoner releases has begun to attract attention . On May 19 , a federal judge accused officials at the Elkton Federal Correctional Institution in Ohio — the site of a deadly coronavirus outbreak cited by Barr in his order — of moving too slowly to release inmates and “ thumbing their noses ” at Barr ’ s directive . He instructed them to expand the class of inmates eligible for home confinement by including inmates not only with minimum-risk scores , but also those said to have a low risk . The Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to halt the order .
At the urging of Sens . Dick Durbin , D-Illinois , and Chuck Grassley , R-Iowa , who co-authored the First Step Act , the Justice Department ’ s inspector general has agreed to examine the scope of Barr ’ s directive as well as the Bureau of Prisons ’ compliance with it and the agency ’ s overall response to the pandemic .
The process has been shrouded in mystery , as one inmate ’ s experience shows . Blayne Davis , 38 , who pleaded guilty to fraud for an investment scam , is an inmate at the Pollock Federal Correctional Complex ’ s minimum-security prison camp , in central Louisiana . When he received his PATTERN scores in late April , they qualified him as minimum risk under the old scoring system . Davis expected to be eligible for home detention . Like many , he worried about exposure to the virus . At another federal prison just an hour to the south , several inmates had already died of COVID-19 . The prison sometimes borrowed staff from Pollock .
Davis waited , in the beige-hued prison dorm where he lives , as officials called the names of inmates who had qualified for home confinement . The names kept coming , and Davis kept waiting , expecting to hear his name .
Then the names stopped . Perplexed , Davis asked prison staff why they hadn ’ t called his name . His score , they told him , put him in the low category , not the minimum .

Even as the Justice Department announced that federal prisons would release vulnerable, nonviolent inmates to home confinement to avoid the spread of COVID-19, the agency was quietly adopting a policy that makes it harder for inmates to qualify for release, not easier. The result has been that more than 98% of inmates remain in federal custody, while a handful of celebrity inmates, like former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort, have been released to home detention.

In two memos, one in late March and a second in early April, Attorney General William Barr directed the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which is part of the Justice Department, to begin identifying inmates who could safely be released to home confinement — essentially house arrest. They instructed prison officials to grant “priority treatment” to inmates deemed to present minimal risk to the public.

Separately, however, the Bureau of Prisons had drafted a 20-page policy document this year that altered a standard adopted only a year ago and made it harder for an inmate to qualify as minimum risk.

Help Us Report on Coronavirus Are you a public health worker, medical provider, elected official, patient or other COVID-19 expert? Help make sure our journalism is responsible and focused on the right issues. Note: If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips, get medical attention immediately. The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick.

ProPublica obtained a copy of the document, which does not appear to have been finalized, and its existence surprised and baffled lawyers, prison reform advocates and inmates interviewed for this article. “It really tanks the whole enterprise if, once an instrument is selected, it can be strategically altered to make sure low-risk people don’t get released,” said Brandon Garrett, a law professor at Duke University who studies risk-assessment tools. “If you change the cut points, you’ve effectively changed the instrument.”

The original assessment tool emerged from the First Step Act, a major criminal justice overhaul passed in 2018. Known as PATTERN, for Prisoner Assessment Tool Targeting Estimated Risk and Needs, it assigns a pair of numbers — based on factors like age, prison courses completed and history of violence — that purport to predict the likelihood an inmate will commit a violent crime, or any crime, upon release. Inmates are assigned to one of four categories for risk of recidivism: minimum, low, medium or high. In a July 2019 report, the Justice Department published a chart delineating the range of scores that fall into each category. The law requires that the methodology be released “publicly on the Department of Justice website.”

Justin Long, a spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons, confirmed that the bureau had revised the risk categories without informing the public. The 2019 report was an “interim report,” Long wrote in an email. “The interim report mentioned that DOJ would seek feedback and update the tool accordingly, which was done.” That was news to people, like Garrett, who had provided feedback to the government on the rules.

The Justice Department, Long wrote, posted an update to its 2019 report in January “to reflect changes to the PATTERN tool.” But that update says nothing about categorizing inmates more restrictively. To the contrary, the changes it describes largely respond to the comments of experts who raised concerns about racial bias and who sought greater transparency. As for the draft policy document, Long wrote, it “was not authorized for release.”

The Bureau of Prisons’ reliance on the unpublished policy document has exacerbated widespread puzzlement about how the agency is implementing Barr’s home-confinement order. “There’s been nothing but confusion,” David Patton, the chief federal public defender for the New York City area, said. “We’ve received a steady stream of questions from clients about their scores, and we have no answers, because BOP doesn’t give us any.”

Fewer prisoners have been released than was expected when the attorney general made his announcement, lawyers say. About 3,050 inmates have been moved to home confinement as of May 21, Bureau of Prisons records show. That’s around 1.8% of the people under the bureau’s supervision. That figure is significantly smaller than the roughly 20% of inmates who fall into the minimum risk category (though it’s not automatic that all of them would qualify for release) under the 2019 rules.

The slow pace of prisoner releases has begun to attract attention. On May 19, a federal judge accused officials at the Elkton Federal Correctional Institution in Ohio — the site of a deadly coronavirus outbreak cited by Barr in his order — of moving too slowly to release inmates and “thumbing their noses” at Barr’s directive. He instructed them to expand the class of inmates eligible for home confinement by including inmates not only with minimum-risk scores, but also those said to have a low risk. The Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to halt the order.

At the urging of Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who co-authored the First Step Act, the Justice Department’s inspector general has agreed to examine the scope of Barr’s directive as well as the Bureau of Prisons’ compliance with it and the agency’s overall response to the pandemic.

The process has been shrouded in mystery, as one inmate’s experience shows. Blayne Davis, 38, who pleaded guilty to fraud for an investment scam, is an inmate at the Pollock Federal Correctional Complex’s minimum-security prison camp, in central Louisiana. When he received his PATTERN scores in late April, they qualified him as minimum risk under the old scoring system. Davis expected to be eligible for home detention. Like many, he worried about exposure to the virus. At another federal prison just an hour to the south, several inmates had already died of COVID-19. The prison sometimes borrowed staff from Pollock.

Davis waited, in the beige-hued prison dorm where he lives, as officials called the names of inmates who had qualified for home confinement. The names kept coming, and Davis kept waiting, expecting to hear his name.

Then the names stopped. Perplexed, Davis asked prison staff why they hadn’t called his name. His score, they told him, put him in the low category, not the minimum.

Davis persisted, pointing to the chart in the 2019 Justice Department report. Ultimately, a prison staffer handed him a piece of paper. It contained a chart that, like the one in the 2019 report, assigned a range of PATTERN scores to each category. But this one was far more restrictive. According to the 2019 report, a male inmate with a violent-recidivism score of 21 or lower fell into the minimum-risk category. Davis’ score — a seven — put him firmly in that category. He wasn’t violent or a troublemaker. He’d completed over 30 classes while incarcerated.

Now, he was informed, the standard had gotten tougher. For a male inmate to be deemed at minimum risk of committing a violent crime upon release from prison, he needed a score of not 21 or less, but six or less. Davis had missed the mark by a single point.

The new chart looked suspect to Davis, as if somebody had typed it up hastily. It wasn’t on official letterhead, and there were a couple of glaring typos. The prison staff bristled when Davis pointed this out, according to his representatives, who later relayed his story and shared relevant documents. It was authentic, the staffers assured him. They had printed it off SallyPort, the Bureau of Prisons’ intranet. Davis didn’t know it at the time, but this new chart was drawn from the bureau’s unpublished draft policy document.

The IRS was in the hot seat Friday, with its outgoing acting commissioner testifying before a House committee. A Senate panel is scheduled for Tuesday. Congress is prodding to find out why the agency singled out conservative groups for special scrutiny.

Attention has focused on the IRS' flagging of these groups starting in 2010. But some liberal groups and journalism organizations say their applications for tax-exempt status also faced long delays and were closely scrutinized during the same period.

The year 2010 began a busy period for the IRS office in Cincinnati, the home of the tax-exempt determinations unit. That January, the Supreme Court handed down its Citizens United decision, which loosened the rules governing contributions to political causes and candidates. Applications flooded in to the office from groups seeking tax-exempt status, many with a political agenda.

The IRS has admitted it flagged applications from groups with ""Tea Party"" or ""Patriot"" in their names. But applications from other groups were closely scrutinized as well.

An Austin, Texas-based progressive group, Progress Texas, was one of them. Its executive director, Ed Espinoza, says it took almost a year and a half for the IRS to review the application from his organization. The process included answering a detailed questionnaire.

""It was nine pages and 21 questions, and inside those 21 questions, there were additional questions,"" Espinoza says. ""So it was fairly extensive, and it was fairly thorough.""

In 2010, some 1,700 applications for 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status came into the Cincinnati office. That number nearly doubled by 2012. Yet according to the IRS Inspector General's report, just one person was originally given the task of sifting through the applications deemed politically sensitive. Marcus Owens, a former IRS official, says that's a lot of work for one staffer.

""These were applications that were identified because they were likely to have issues that were complex, which means that they were going to take more time,"" Owens says. ""So it seems like that would be more than one person could easily handle.""

Another application that seemingly got caught up in the backlog came from a group of journalists in Chicago. The Chicago News Cooperative provided news for the Midwest edition of The New York Times. The co-op also sought tax-exempt status. Veteran journalist James O'Shea, a former managing editor of The Chicago Tribune, was in charge.

""There were political organizations trying to get these exemptions, and I think the IRS was concerned — and probably appropriately so — that some of these news organizations were really political organizations,"" he says, ""and so they were examining that, and we just got caught up in that.""

For more than two years, the Chicago News Cooperative waited for an IRS ruling. But without tax-exempt status, foundation support dried up, and the cooperative went out of business.

Progress Texas did eventually get its tax-exempt status. Espinoza says he has no trouble with the scrutiny his organization underwent.

""Look, if you want a tax exemption, you've got to jump through some hoops,"" he says. ""You need to be able to demonstrate that what you're doing is legitimately a tax-exempt activity, and that's what we saw it as.""

The inspector general who reported Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups said Thursday that he did n't have information until last week that the word `` progressive '' also was on a list of criteria for extra scrutiny of tax-exempt applications .
At a hearing of the House Oversight Committee , Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George said the information that liberal groups also were probably targeted only came to him July 9 .
His audit , released in May , cited criteria including `` tea party '' and other conservative-themed words or labels that were used to decide whether applicants for tax-exempt status should come under further review . Since then , an investigation by the panel turned up documents that showed IRS workers also were told to look for the liberal-themed label .
`` They were not provided during our audit , even though similar documents that list quote 'tea party ' unquote but not 'progressive ' were , '' George said . `` I am very disturbed that these documents were not provided to our auditors at the outset , and we are currently reviewing this issue . ''
The IRS targeting revealed by George 's audit in May led to accusations by Republicans that the Obama administration could be using the tax agency 's powers against political enemies . Democrats have rejected such allegations and insisted that liberal groups also were targeted .
Last week , the top Democrat on the House committee questioned why George 's audit had not included information on liberal groups being targeted . Thursday 's hearing was the first time George issued a public response to the criticism by Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland .

`` We just learned recently that name was being used by the Internal Revenue Service , '' George said of the term `` progressive . ''
George 's audit indicated that lax oversight at the IRS allowed for the singling out of some conservative groups starting in 2010 and continuing until last year .
In particular , the report said IRS workers in the tax-exempt unit used `` Be on the Lookout '' or BOLO lists of words such as `` tea party '' to assess what applicants came under extra scrutiny that delayed decisions for months and even years . However , it also said no evidence existed that the targeting was politically motivated .
George subsequently testified at previous hearings that he could not specifically identify whether any liberal groups were similarly targeted . However , Cummings said information made public last week showed that George , who was appointed in 2004 by GOP President George W. Bush , was aware that liberal groups also were targeted .
On Thursday , George and other officials in the inspector general 's office said the audit focused on the BOLO list that included conservtive labels . George expressed frustration over how the issue has unfolded , at one point saying : `` This is not a clean-cut matter . There 's a lot going on here . ''
Earlier at Thursday 's hearing , two career IRS employees shot down the central premise of committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa 's argument that the agency 's targeting scandal was politically motivated .
Asked repeatedly whether they knew of anyone at the IRS with political motives to obstruct applications for tax-exempt status by conservative groups , the pair told the panel `` no . ''
Issa himself asked the question early on in the committee 's third hearing on the issue , as did others from both parties amid bitter exchanges that focused attention on the political squabbling instead of the targeting cited by George 's report .
Cummings challenged Issa on past comments suggesting that White House involvement in the targeting showed it was a weapon against political enemies of President Barack Obama .
`` This is unsubstantiated nonsense , '' Cummings said , adding that it undermined the integrity of the committee .
For his part , Issa insisted that the testimony from IRS veterans Elizabeth Hofacre and Carter Hull established that IRS officials in Washington played a major role in the targeting . The problem was broader than the earlier claim by Democrats that it was limited to the agency 's Cincinnati office that handles tax-exempt applications , Issa said .
`` We can today debunk the accusation that Cincinnati was , in fact , the story and that it never went to Washington , which it clearly did , '' the California Republican said .
However , his case was deflated by the unwavering insistence by Hofacre and Hull that they were unaware of any political motivation in the targeting or any influence from outside the IRS on extra scrutiny that delayed responses to applications .
The hearing followed a series of accusatory memos and news releases by both sides as the IRS targeting issue descended further into a purely partisan spitting match .
Issa sent the IRS a letter Wednesday that made new demands for all communications on the matter between the tax agency , the Treasury Department and Obama 's office since February 2010 .
The letter , signed by Issa and other House Republicans , quoted excerpts of an interview with Hull that said the office of the IRS chief counsel -- who was appointed by Obama in 2009 -- played a role in scrutiny that delayed processing tax-exempt applications from some conservative groups .
`` Its involvement and demands for information about political activity during the 2010 election cycle appears to have caused systematic delays in the processing of tea party applications , '' the GOP letter said .
In response , Cummings issued his own letter that accused Issa of dishonest intentions .
`` Rather than describing the whole truth , your letter appears yet again to create a skewed account based on partial , incomplete , and cherry-picked information while disregarding key evidence that contradicts your political narrative , '' Cummings wrote .
A day earlier , Cummings released a memo that cited excerpts from committee interviews with 15 IRS workers that found no evidence of political bias or White House manipulation alleged by Republicans .
`` Despite an extremely aggressive investigation involving thousands of documents and more than a dozen interviews of IRS employees , the overwhelming evidence before the committee reveals no political motivation or White House involvement in this process , '' said the memo written by the committee 's Democratic staff .
Issa conceded in an opinion piece published Wednesday on the USA Today website that the two-month investigation has yet to find hard evidence of involvement in the targeting by anyone outside the IRS . He argued that the lack of proof does not mean the investigation should end .
`` We candidly still do n't have clear answers to many important questions and have yet to begin interviewing senior IRS officials , '' Issa wrote , saying `` judgment should be withheld until all relevant witnesses are interviewed and all documents reviewed . ''
In an editorial Thursday , USA Today questioned the value of the ongoing investigation .
`` No political operatives from the Obama campaign or the White House have been linked to any of the IRS ' activities , '' the editorial said . `` What 's more , it has become increasingly clear that confusion on the part of IRS employees , rather than a starkly political motive , was the primary cause of the delays . ''
At times during Thursday 's hearing , Issa took a conciliatory stance , saying that any evidence of targeting -- whether of liberal or conservative groups -- should be investigated .
`` If the facts are that people got abused for myriad reasons , we ought to know it , '' Issa said .
Both Issa and Cummings asked George to provide more information on groups targeted by the IRS , and the inspector general pledged to do so .
Cummings and other Democrats took aim Thursday at past statements by Issa and other Republicans , calling them blatantly political accusations with no basis in fact that went against the spirit of Issa 's call at the start of Thursday 's hearing to `` reject , categorically , assumptions for which there is not evidence . ''
Rep. Gerald Connolly , a Virginia Democrat , called for Issa to retract his earlier comments that the targeting involved only conservative groups and was an effort to target Obama 's political enemies .
Issa responded that tea party groups that came under extra scrutiny could be considered political enemies of the president and that he had yet to see hard evidence that liberal groups were targeted .
Republicans made a point Thursday of singling out White House spokesman Jay Carney for criticism , noting he previously said that the targeting involved rogue IRS employees in Cincinnati . Hofacre described herself as offended by the characterization of the issue as misdeeds at her level .
She and Hull said the delays in rendering final decisions on applications by conservative groups was because of a lack of guidance from superiors in Washington .
Under tax law and IRS regulations , groups that primarily engage in political activity are ineligible for tax-exempt status . The targeting occurred after the 2010 ruling by the Supreme Court that opened the political process to more private contributions from business and labor , leading to increased applications for tax-exempt status from groups involved in political activity .
In the memo Cummings made public Tuesday , IRS employees who identified themselves as Republicans , Democrats and independents said there was no political motivation or outside influence involved in the agency 's handling of tax-exempt requests from groups with possible or likely political affiliations .
According to the memo , an IRS tax law specialist based in Washington who described herself as Republican said `` no , not at all '' when asked whether there was any evidence that the agency targeted Obama 's political enemies .
`` That 's kind of laughable that people think that , '' the memo quoted the woman as saying .
Cummings and other Democrats complained Thursday that the other IRS employees who had been interviewed were not called as witnesses to the latest hearing .","Story highlights The IRS inspector general says liberal groups also were on target list

In the first case , the Justice Department last year obtained two months of phone records for reporters and editors at The Associated Press as part of a probe that the news service said was focused on its account of a foiled plot to bomb a U.S. airliner in May 2012 .
The second case involves subpoenas and search warrants in 2010 to obtain phone records , e-mails and security badge tracking of a Fox News correspondent who reported on classified intelligence about North Korea in 2009 .

Members of the press and critics led by Republican foes of Holder complained the covert surveillance amounted to targeting journalists as potential criminals , which would chill investigative reporting and potentially violate First Amendment rights of a free press .
In the investigation of leaks to the AP , employees of the news service were never singled out as potential criminals .
However , the affidavit for a search warrant in the Fox case included an FBI agent 's statement that a network reporter -- later identified as James Rosen -- could potentially be an `` aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator '' to the crime of disclosing secret information .
In addition , Justice Department officials confirmed that Holder took part in `` discussions '' about seeking the search warrant .
The Justice Department did not prosecute Rosen , nor did it file charges against him . While he was listed as a `` co-conspirator , '' that often does not mean he would be considered a target .
Last week , President Barack Obama ordered Holder to review government practices in investigating leaks of secret information .
His administration has been more aggressive in probing classified leaks than those of his predecessors , but Obama said he was `` troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable . ''
Some Republicans complained that Holder 's involvement meant he would be reviewing himself , due to the affidavit that said he took part in discussions on a search warrant of Rosen 's phone records and emails .

On Wednesday , the GOP leaders of the House Judiciary Committee sent Holder a letter asking for further information about whether he lied to Congress when he said at a May 15 hearing that he never took part in any `` potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material . ''
`` ... That is not something that I have ever been involved in , heard or , or would think would be wise policy , '' Holder said in response to questioning by Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia on possible use of the Espionage Act to prosecute members of the news media for publishing classified information .
The letter to Holder from committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia and Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin noted that the affidavit for the search warrant for Rosen 's phone , e-mail and security badge information only became public after the May 15 hearing .
They questioned whether Holder 's response to Johnson 's question amounted to lying under oath because of subsequent media reports that the Justice Department confirmed Holder took part in discussions on seeking a search warrant .
`` How can you claim to have never even heard of ' the potential prosecution of the press but were , at a minimum , involved in discussions regarding Mr . Rosen ? '' asked the letter by Goodlatte and Sensenbrenner .
While Holder was asked about the AP case at the May 15 committee hearing , the issue of the Fox reporter never came up .
White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday that no prosecution ever took place in the Fox case , and therefore it was `` self-evident '' that any charge Holder lied to the House panel was `` inaccurate . ''
Implying that Republicans were playing politics , Carney said reporters should `` be careful not to conflate facts with statements by members of Congress about what they want to be true . '' Pressed further , he added that reporters were `` conflating a subpoena with prosecution . ''
Asked if Obama still had full confidence in the attorney general , Carney replied : `` He absolutely does , yes . ''
On Tuesday , Rep. John Conyers of Michigan , the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee , said Holder `` was forthright and did not mislead the committee '' on May 15 .
`` Certainly , there are policy disagreements as to how the First Amendment should apply to these series of leak investigations being conducted by the Justice Department and that is and should be an area for the committee to consider , '' Conyers said in a statement . `` However , there is no need to turn a policy disagreement into allegations of misconduct . ''
Meanwhile , a Justice Department official said Wednesday that Holder will meet with officials from media organizations this week as part of his review of how the federal government handles leak investigations .
The meetings with chiefs of Washington bureaus will begin Thursday and include representatives from newspapers , wire services , radio and television broadcasters , and online organizations , the official said .
With an eye toward the 2014 congressional elections and the 2016 presidential campaign , Republicans are trying to depict the Obama administration as rife with scandals .
These include the two cases involving Holder as well as IRS targeting of conservative groups and erroneous talking points about the Benghazi , Libya , terrorist attack .
Like many attorneys general , Holder has been a focus of political attacks throughout Obama 's White House tenure .
In particular , conservative Republicans have taken aim at Holder over efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , detention facility , a decision to stop enforcing the Defense of Marriage Act , and the handling of the botched `` Fast and Furious '' gun-walking program .
At the same time , Holder has been praised by Obama and liberals for taking a lead role on socially progressive issues such as gay marriage and immigration .
Last year , House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa of California led a GOP effort to cite Holder for contempt of Congress in a dispute over documents the panel sought in the `` Fast and Furious '' investigation .
Issa and other Republicans said Holder refused to turn over requested documents necessary for a full inquiry of the program in which federal agents allowed illegal weapons sales across the border with Mexico , then lost track of the firearms .
Holder maintained the House contempt vote boycotted by most Democrats amounted to political theater , and he recently criticized Issa for what he called a pattern of incomplete or misleading statements .
`` It is inappropriate and it is too consistent with the way in which you conduct yourself as a member of Congress , '' Holder said at the May 15 hearing of the judiciary panel that includes Issa . `` It is unacceptable and it is shameful . ''
At the May 15 hearing , Holder testified under oath that he had recused himself from the AP case because he had previously been questioned regarding who knew what about the classified leak . Therefore , he said , he had no role in last year 's decision by Deputy Attorney General James Cole to seek the secret subpoena of AP phone records .
Holder has yet to comment specifically on Rosen 's case . On Tuesday , he told reporters he was `` not satisfied '' with some federal guidelines on how prosecutors conduct leak investigations involving reporters .
`` We 're going to have a real frank , good conversation about this , '' Holder said . `` And I think , we 're going to make some changes because I 'm not satisfied with where we are . ''
There will be more congressional hearings and investigations , more political rancor and the possibility of some fallout if further disclosures reveal Holder knowingly misled Congress or inappropriately concealed information .
His defiance in the face of the House contempt citation indicates Holder wo n't voluntarily step down unless pressured to do so by Obama , who has steadfastly maintained confidence in him .
The question will be whether Holder becomes a liability for the president .
If the multiple controversies ( IRS targeting , Benghazi , reporters phone records ) continue to dominate the political discussion , Obama could decide a drastic gesture is needed to try to move past a climate of crises . However , nothing at this point suggests that is imminent or under consideration .","Attorney General Eric Holder, a political lightning rod for Republican critics of the Obama administration, is under fire for two cases involving secret subpoenas or searches for phone records and other information of journalists involved in reports about leaked classified information.

3. What's the background?

With an eye toward the 2014 congressional elections and the 2016 presidential campaign, Republicans are trying to depict the Obama administration as rife with scandals.

These include the two cases involving Holder as well as IRS targeting of conservative groups and erroneous talking points about the Benghazi, Libya, terrorist attack.

Like many attorneys general, Holder has been a focus of political attacks throughout Obama's White House tenure.

In particular, conservative Republicans have taken aim at Holder over efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility, a decision to stop enforcing the Defense of Marriage Act, and the handling of the botched ""Fast and Furious"" gun-walking program.

""It is inappropriate and it is too consistent with the way in which you conduct yourself as a member of Congress,"" Holder said at the May 15 hearing of the judiciary panel that includes Issa. ""It is unacceptable and it is shameful.""

4. What does Holder have to say?

At the May 15 hearing, Holder testified under oath that he had recused himself from the AP case because he had previously been questioned regarding who knew what about the classified leak. Therefore, he said, he had no role in last year's decision by Deputy Attorney General James Cole to seek the secret subpoena of AP phone records.

Holder has yet to comment specifically on Rosen's case. On Tuesday, he told reporters he was ""not satisfied"" with some federal guidelines on how prosecutors conduct leak investigations involving reporters.

""We're going to have a real frank, good conversation about this,"" Holder said. ""And I think, we're going to make some changes because I'm not satisfied with where we are.""

5. What happens now?

There will be more congressional hearings and investigations, more political rancor and the possibility of some fallout if further disclosures reveal Holder knowingly misled Congress or inappropriately concealed information.

His defiance in the face of the House contempt citation indicates Holder won't voluntarily step down unless pressured to do so by Obama, who has steadfastly maintained confidence in him.

The question will be whether Holder becomes a liability for the president.

''
A male Army sergeant , a friend told her , had just been charged with secretly photographing and videotaping at least a dozen female cadets at McAleer 's alma mater .
Many of the women were naked ; some images were taken in a bathroom at the U.S. Military Academy in New York . The revelations followed a rash of recent incidents , among them stunning reports that at least three ranking male officers overseeing military sexual assault prevention programs have themselves been charged in the past month with crimes ranging from sexual battery to stalking .
`` How many of these stories are we going to hear ? '' asks McAleer , a field admissions officer for the academy . `` I want to be able to , with confidence , encourage people — daughters and sons — to serve their country . ''
As the nation prepares to honor the war dead this Memorial Day weekend , a seeming epidemic of sexual assault and abuse reports has severely shaken that confidence .
A new Pentagon study estimates that 26,000 people in the Armed Forces were sexually assaulted last year .

West Point alum Donna McAleer was at her Utah home last week when she got a call asking if she'd ""seen the latest.""

A male Army sergeant, a friend told her, had just been charged with secretly photographing and videotaping at least a dozen female cadets at McAleer's alma mater.

Many of the women were naked; some images were taken in a bathroom at the U.S. Military Academy in New York. The revelations followed a rash of recent incidents, among them stunning reports that at least three ranking male officers overseeing military sexual assault prevention programs have themselves been charged in the past month with crimes ranging from sexual battery to stalking.

""How many of these stories are we going to hear?"" asks McAleer, a field admissions officer for the academy. ""I want to be able to, with confidence, encourage people — daughters and sons — to serve their country.""

As the nation prepares to honor the war dead this Memorial Day weekend, a seeming epidemic of sexual assault and abuse reports has severely shaken that confidence.

A new Pentagon study estimates that 26,000 people in the Armed Forces were sexually assaulted last year. It's not entirely clear top brass understands the scope of the crisis: Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh suggested in recent Senate testimony that the spike in reports of sexual assaults in the military could be blamed on the ""hook up mentality"" of the country's young people.

Welsh has since apologized, but not before fanning outrage that's been building on Capitol Hill and beyond over the military's long failure to repair a system that has placed service members, especially women, in more danger of sexual assault than battlefield injury.

Obama's View From President Obama's commencement address Friday at the U.S. Naval Academy: Every day, our civil servants do their jobs with professionalism — protecting our national security and delivering the services that so many Americans expect. But as we've seen again in recent days, it only takes the misconduct of a few to further erode the people's trust in their government. That's unacceptable to me, and I know it's unacceptable to you.

In our digital age, a single image from the battlefield of troops falling short of their standards can go viral and endanger our forces and undermine our efforts to achieve security and peace. Likewise, those who commit sexual assault are not only committing a crime, they threaten the trust and discipline that make our military strong. That's why we have to be determined to stop these crimes, because they've got no place in the greatest military on Earth.

""We have relied on the chain of command to deal with this issue, and the chain of command has failed for decades,"" says retired U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Dennis Laich. ""America gives us their sons and daughters, and we've failed to discharge the responsibility to take care of them.""

An Action Imperative

It's been more than two decades since the sexual-assault-and-hallway-grope-a-thon at the Navy's ""Tailhook"" aviators' convention in Las Vegas, which led to the resignation of the Navy secretary.

It's been a decade since the lid was blown off a rape and sexual assault scandal at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, where the school's top four officials were removed.

It's been a year since investigators at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio found evidence that a dozen instructors had engaged in ""sexual misconduct,"" including rape, leading to the conviction of at least nine of them.

So it should come as no surprise that parents, with more and more frequency, are asking recruiters if their daughters, and sons, will be safe in the military — a question prompted not by roadside bombs, but assault statistics.

McAleer, the West Point recruiter and author of Porcelain on Steel, a collection of profiles of accomplished female academy graduates, says the answer is no, as long as the military continues to rely on its chain-of-command system to hear, investigate and prosecute assault claims from the ranks.

""It's delusional to think we can do this over and over and get a different result,"" she says, referring to statistics that show those in the chain of command are the perpetrators in a quarter of cases of alleged assault.

She, and others, including New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a member of the Senate's Armed Services Committee, argue that the military should create a separate legal process to deal with sexual assault claims.

Gillibrand, a Democrat, has sponsored legislation to do just that. A separate bill proposed by Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat and a member of the Armed Services Committee, would not require the new legal structure, which she argues the Pentagon would work to block.

Her legislation focuses on measures that would remove commanders' ability to overturn military sexual assault convictions, and require dismissal or a dishonorable discharge for service members found guilty of rape or sexual assault.

Similar legislation has also been proposed in the House, and, as in the Senate, is backed by members of both parties in efforts led by women.

Commanders' authority to overturn convictions came under fire earlier this year when it was revealed that Air Force Lt. Gen. Craig Franklin reversed the aggravated sexual assault conviction of Lt. Col. James Wilkerson and then reassigned him as safety chief at a base in Tucson, Ariz.

Wilkerson had been convicted of assaulting a civilian contractor while at Aviano Air Force Base in Italy.

McCaskill has held up the nomination of another top Air Force commander and former astronaut, Lt. Gen. Susan Helms, to a NASA post because she overturned the aggravated sexual assault jury conviction of an Air Force captain whose victim was a female lieutenant.

Turning Point?

The military, like any organization, has long focused on protecting the institution. And it has relied on the traditional chain of command to deal with the sexual assault issue.

""No one wants to take bad news to their boss,"" said Laich, the retired major general who now works in a program at Ohio Dominican University to encourage veterans to use their college benefits.

""You have an institution that consciously or unconsciously has given the message that they don't want to hear that bad news,"" he says.

Advocates for change say that the bad news can no longer be easily hidden, however. Information networks, the 2012 Academy Award-nominated documentary The Invisible War about sexual abuse in the military, and the record number of women serving on congressional armed services committees, they argue, have put the issue before the public in a way never before seen.

""Supreme Court jurisprudence is very protective of the military,"" she says. ""The judiciary is reluctant to hear cases brought by service members.""

Military Takes Action

In response to the crisis, the military has begun programs to reduce sexual assault crimes and provide victim support, and has taken steps to strengthen sexual assault investigations and prosecutions.

Last year, then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, after seeing The Invisible War, required that sexual assaults be reported to a higher level commander; he also established special victims units in each branch of the military.

And the Obama administration recently held a bipartisan meeting of congressional women serving on the House and Senate armed services committees.

White House officials say they 're confident whoever is chosen will have bipartisan support
While Attorney General Eric Holder had made clear that he wanted to leave the post before the end of Obama 's second term , the announcement of his departure just before midterm elections took many by surprise and the timing could complicate the effort to replace him .
Choosing a new attorney general and getting approval in a Senate confirmation hearing will be difficult for the White House . While the list of strong candidates who could assume the role is long , congressional politics will make it difficult to get Senate approval for just about anyone .
Plus , while he has endured his share of controversies , Holder is also President Barack Obama 's very close friend and confidant , someone for whom the President consistently communicated his full support .
`` We have been great colleagues , but the bonds between us are much deeper than that , '' Holder said Thursday in a joint statement with Obama , announcing his departure . `` I 'm proud to call you my friend . ''
When a replacement might be announced is unknown . Obama thanked Holder for his service Thursday but offered no timeline for announcing a nominee to replace him . Holder pledged to stay on the job until a nominee is selected and confirmed by the Senate , and in doing that , he might have agreed to stay on for a while longer .
The Senate is the biggest obstacle . Holder 's announcement comes just weeks before the midterm elections , in which Republicans have a solid chance of reclaiming the majority . Congress , currently on recess while members campaign for re-election , will have a lame duck session in November and December in which a confirmation hearing could be pushed through . But Congress will have a lot on its plate during that session , most notably a possible vote to expand Obama 's authority to execute his military offensive against ISIS . It 's possible that a confirmation hearing will take place in the next Congress , in 2015 , when Republicans could be in control .
White House officials insisted they were n't concerned about this possibility .
`` I do anticipate that Democrats will hold the Senate , '' White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Thursday . `` That said , I also anticipate that whoever the nominee is will earn and ultimately receive bipartisan support . ''
But in the current political climate , bipartisan support is far from certain for any administration appointee , particularly one as high profile as Holder 's replacement .
The other issue is less tactical -- it 's the personal factor . Obama and Holder are good friends , and Holder is a part of the Obama inner circle that includes key adviser Valerie Jarrett , whom Holder thanked Thursday as someone who he had `` been fortunate to work with since the beginning of what started as an improbable , idealistic effort by a young senator from Illinois . ''
Furthermore , the issues that Holder has championed -- voting rights , LGBT rights and reducing prison sentences for low-level drug offenders -- are important aspects of Obama 's legacy , so this pick will , in all likelihood , be an incredibly important one for him .
Obama gave no hints about possible replacements in his goodbye remarks to Holder , offering only a tidbit of what he 's looking for in an attorney general : `` I chose him to serve as attorney general because he believes , as I do , that justice is not just an abstract theory -- it 's a living and breathing principle . ''","Story highlights Attorney General Eric Holder announced his resignation Thursday

The Senate is the biggest obstacle. Holder's announcement comes just weeks before the midterm elections, in which Republicans have a solid chance of reclaiming the majority. Congress, currently on recess while members campaign for re-election, will have a lame duck session in November and December in which a confirmation hearing could be pushed through. But Congress will have a lot on its plate during that session, most notably a possible vote to expand Obama's authority to execute his military offensive against ISIS. It's possible that a confirmation hearing will take place in the next Congress, in 2015, when Republicans could be in control.

White House officials insisted they weren't concerned about this possibility.

""I do anticipate that Democrats will hold the Senate,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Thursday. ""That said, I also anticipate that whoever the nominee is will earn and ultimately receive bipartisan support.""

But in the current political climate, bipartisan support is far from certain for any administration appointee, particularly one as high profile as Holder's replacement.

The other issue is less tactical -- it's the personal factor. Obama and Holder are good friends, and Holder is a part of the Obama inner circle that includes key adviser Valerie Jarrett, whom Holder thanked Thursday as someone who he had ""been fortunate to work with since the beginning of what started as an improbable, idealistic effort by a young senator from Illinois.""

Furthermore, the issues that Holder has championed -- voting rights, LGBT rights and reducing prison sentences for low-level drug offenders -- are important aspects of Obama's legacy, so this pick will, in all likelihood, be an incredibly important one for him.

Obama gave no hints about possible replacements in his goodbye remarks to Holder, offering only a tidbit of what he's looking for in an attorney general: ""I chose him to serve as attorney general because he believes, as I do, that justice is not just an abstract theory -- it's a living and breathing principle.""",www.cnn.com,left,Oup4UpGqvn6rS2k3

He then switched lawyers to pursue a new scorched-earth tactic that accused the FBI of entrapping him, and asked the judge to dismiss the charge.

WILKINS DISSENTS

Judge Robert Wilkins, an Obama administration appointee, dissented.

He said the Justice Department’s flip-flop on the case raised questions that merited further scrutiny by the District Court.

“In 2017, the then-Acting Attorney General told the Vice President that Flynn’s false statements ‘posed a potential compromise situation for Flynn’ with the Russians,” Wilkins wrote. “Now, in a complete reversal, the government says none of this is true.”

“This is no mere about-face; it is more akin to turning around an aircraft carrier.”

After the Justice Department took the highly unusual step of seeking to abandon the case against Flynn, Sullivan appointed Gleeson to argue against the Justice Department’s request.

He also asked Gleeson to weigh in on whether Sullivan should hold Flynn in contempt for lying when pleading guilty.

Sullivan has said he cannot serve as a “rubber stamp” and must carefully review the facts in this “unprecedented” request.

In the majority opinion on Wednesday, the appeals court called Sullivan’s appointment of Gleeson “troubling,” and said it was granting Flynn’s petition to get the case dismissed to “prevent the judicial usurpation of executive power.”

justice_department,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2013/0717/Sexual-assault-in-the-military-Can-special-counsels-for-victims-help,Sexual assault in the military: Can special counsels for victims help?,2013-07-17,Anna Mulrine,"They have a job title that sounds as if it were lifted from a television crime drama – special victims ' counsels , or SVCs – and they could be one of the Pentagon 's brightest hopes in combating the epidemic of sexual assault in its ranks .
The program , which officially launched last month , is part of a series of ventures that top Pentagon officials hope will transform the way the armed forces treat victims of sexual assault . Staffed by Air Force judge advocates general ( JAGs ) charged with standing up for victims ' rights , the program is perhaps the Pentagon 's most cutting-edge endeavor so far to combat sexual assault .
Its underlying philosophy is that one of the most important steps to creating a culture that discourages sexual assaults is to more effectively prosecute sexual predators within the ranks .
The quest for solutions is becoming urgent as the scope of the problem has become more apparent this year .
In early 2013 , the Department of Defense released an alarming report that showed that although claims of sexual assault were rising , only a tiny fraction were reported – pointing to victims ' distrust of the military justice system 's ability to handle their cases fairly .
Then came a series of sexual-assault allegations that underscored the pervasiveness of the problem . This led some members of Congress to suggest at a particularly contentious June hearing that the chain of command in sexual-assault cases needed to be altered – a move the Pentagon strongly opposes .
As a result , the rest of the services are watching the Air Force 's SVC program , aware that if they do n't show that they are taking the problem seriously – and showing results in short order – Congress 's patience could run out .
The SVC program is just one of several new initiatives to try to tackle the scourge of sexual assault . There are , for instance , `` bystander intervention '' programs in all the services that stress the role that friends can play in protecting fellow troops from assault by stepping in and discouraging aggressive or coercive behavior .
There is also extensive training for new recruits that increasingly emphasizes no tolerance for the crime .
At the same time , the Pentagon is taking new steps to survey the `` command climate '' of units to gauge the extent to which abusive behavior – or tolerance for it – may be lurking in the ranks . To this end , the Marine Corps recently created a new `` command climate survey '' with 34 questions .
`` At least five of those deal with sexual assault , sexual harassment , confidence in the leadership to be able to protect and take care of the interests of the young marine , '' Gen. James Amos , the top officer in the Marine Corps , told lawmakers last month .
`` There is an expectation for each of our commanding officers to set the conditions , the climate , in his or her organization that not only does all the combat stuff ... but also sets the environment such that the young marines that are in that unit are comfortable . ''
But lawmakers – and senior military officials – increasingly stress the primary need to hold perpetrators accountable as a crucial part of the solution .
A Pentagon report released in May showed that instances of US troops who said they were sexually assaulted rose from some 19,000 in 2010 to more than 26,000 in 2012 . But in the most recent year for which statistics are available , only 3,200 people reported the crime , resulting in 191 convictions .
This news came in the midst of a disturbing series of debacles for the US military . In May alone , the Air Force officer in charge of the service 's sexual-assault prevention program was himself arrested for attempting to sexually assault a woman in a parking lot in Arlington , Va. , and an Army sergeant stationed at Fort Hood , Texas , was charged with forcing a lower-ranking soldier to take part in a prostitution ring and sexually assaulting at least two other subordinates .
At the congressional hearings that followed , much of the discussion surrounded the case of Lt. Col. James Wilkerson , a former Air Force inspector general , who was convicted by a jury of aggravated sexual assault before a three-star general overturned the conviction .
Wilkerson 's colleagues cited his `` excellent '' job performance as an F-16 pilot . Lt. Gen. Craig Franklin , who overturned the case , wrote a memo to the secretary of the Air Force explaining his decision : `` Based on all the letters submitted in clemency , in strong support of him , by people who knew him , such behavior appeared highly incongruent . ''
This move drew the ire of a number of lawmakers , who suggested that sexual-assault perpetrators can also be charming people who are good at their jobs . It was this incident that helped spur senators to propose legislation this month to remove commanders from the process of deciding whether and how to proceed with a case – a measure that appears to be gaining broad bipartisan support in the Senate .
`` This is not a Democratic idea . It is not a Republican idea . It is a good idea that meets the needs of the victims , creates transparency and accountability , and creates the needed objectivity that this issue deserves , '' Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D ) of New York said in a Capitol Hill press conference Tuesday , while pointing out that Germany , Britain , and Israel already have adopted similar measures .
This prospect troubles military officials – and raises the stakes for the Air Force 's newly minted SVCs .
The program is the baby of the Air Force 's top lawyer , Lt. Gen. Richard Harding , who has handpicked each of the SVCs . In 2011 , he notes , nearly one-third of victims who filed sexual-assault charges against a fellow servicemember ended up deciding to withdraw them .
`` Many of those folks did so because they became exhausted and frustrated by the process , '' Harding says .
At the Air Force 's judge advocate general school in Montgomery , Ala. , Harding emphasizes this point to the 24 Air Force lawyers who will work at bases across the country as part of the inaugural class of full-time SVCs . `` Accountability ca n't take hold until we start getting more people reporting , '' he says .
Until the service can bring up levels of prosecution for sexual assault , he says , predators may be encouraged to carry on with little fear of reprisal .
Harding chose the SVCs here with a particular eye toward those who are dogged and highly skilled litigators , and who are also empathetic , he says .
In the six months since the pilot program began in January , senior military officials say they are seeing some positive trends : Instead of dropping cases , half of the sexual-assault victims who begin the process not planning to prosecute instead decide to move forward with a prosecution .
In all , more than 300 airmen have put in a request for an SVC to represent them as they file sexual-assault charges .
`` That 's a lot of people , '' Harding says . `` A huge demand signal , certainly . ''
In a survey of the hundreds of airmen who have had an SVC , 100 percent reported being `` extremely satisfied with the advice and support '' that the SVC provided . One respondent wrote that the SVC provided `` comfort and confidence when you have had so much taken away . ''
The SVCs are not prosecutors – their job is not to argue the case on behalf of the victim . Rather , their job is solely to represent the victim 's interests during the legal process .
It is a vital function in today 's military , says Meg Garvin , executive director of the National Crime Victim Law Institute .
The concept of victims ' rights has not been a priority in the past , which is what makes the Air Force 's SVC program `` really groundbreaking , '' she says . `` Victims ' rights has been treated like a rhetorical pat on the head , not the law . ''
This meant `` that even though the law says that the victim has a right to be heard , it was n't treated legally like a right , '' she adds . `` It was more like a legal nicety – as in , 'We 'll give it to you if we think it 's right for the case , ' as opposed to , 'You have ownership over this right and how would you like to use it ? ' ``
This is particularly important when the aims of the prosecutor diverge from those of the victim , which can happen frequently in sexual-assault cases .
For example , the SVC might work to protect the privacy of the victim , even if that means that the prosecution can not have access to information that could help win a conviction .
Indeed , even if a conviction does not seem likely , more victims may be willing to pursue charges if they do not feel revictimized by the judicial process , senior military officials say .
One active-duty Air Force sergeant , who said he was sexually assaulted by a fellow airman , was hesitant to report an assault and had decided not to prosecute . After being put in touch with an SVC , however , his feelings changed .
Having a lawyer meant there was someone `` to actually represent me and to take my feelings and thoughts into consideration , '' says the sergeant , who asked to remain anonymous .
Even though the trial did not result in a conviction , the sergeant says he is at peace with the outcome and plans to pursue his military career .
Many of the SVCs in Montgomery have been prosecutors in sexual-assault cases before . They say the move to SVC has been liberating .
`` It 's a very freeing experience to be their attorney and to be able to speak to them in a way that says , 'Here 's what you should be doing . Here 's how we can make things better for you , ' `` says Capt . Aaron Kirk , a new SVC in San Antonio .
One Air Force lawyer recalls a case in which a sexual-assault victim wanted to know whether she had to meet with a defendant 's attorney , who had just asked to interview her for the fourth time .
`` You want to say , 'Heck , no , you do n't have to talk with them . They 're on a fishing expedition , ' `` he says . But the Uniform Code of Military Justice rules prevent him from providing any advice to the victim that might be seen as interfering with the defense 's collection of evidence .
At the beginning of the case , `` You explain your role : ' I 'm not your lawyer . I 'm not here as your counselor . ' That can sound very harsh , '' says an Air Force prosecutor who spoke on condition of anonymity . `` You try to have a positive relationship , but you 're not their lawyer . ''
As an SVC in Colorado Springs , Colo. , former prosecutor Capt . Lorraine Sult says that she has found her clients ' needs are different from what she previously recognized . Some would rather have their attackers go to counseling than get jail time , for example .
`` As prosecutors , we think they just want the conviction , '' she says .
`` It has been very enlightening to understand the frustration that they feel with the system , '' Kirk adds .
He recalls being struck by `` how little information '' sexual-assault victims get during the course of their cases – and `` how much work it takes '' to get it . As an SVC , `` We can help pipeline some of that information to them , '' he says .
In his new job , Kirk says he continues to be particularly drawn to the `` rewarding aspects of the SVC program . ''
`` It 's very gratifying to help someone who 's going through ostensibly the worst time of their life , '' he says . `` You can make a huge change in terms of a person 's outlook in some cases . ''
While he is no longer taking part in the prosecution of cases , `` you make their experience better , and you give them a voice in the process . ''
For some of his clients , `` convictions are very important . '' For others , `` They just want to be able to say , ' I got up and said what happened to me , ' and that 's enough . ''
For his part , Kirk says he welcomes the chance to help more people come forward to share their stories and perhaps experience some catharsis .
`` Rape is a crime of silence . It thrives in an environment where people are afraid to come forward , '' he says . The more people feel comfortable coming forward , he adds , the greater the chances that the military can begin to put an end to it .
Still , the SVCs have encountered resistance , sometimes among Air Force judges who do not believe they should be in the courtroom .
That 's because some legal experts worry that special victims ' attorneys `` will upset the balance of the justice system , '' says Ms. Garvin of the National Crime Victim Law Institute .
The argument is that `` If the victim has his or her own lawyer , does n't that make it two versus one ? Does n't that make it unfair ? ''
The difference is that the SVC `` is n't a second prosecutor , '' Garvin says .

''","They have a job title that sounds as if it were lifted from a television crime drama – special victims' counsels, or SVCs – and they could be one of the Pentagon's brightest hopes in combating the epidemic of sexual assault in its ranks.

The program, which officially launched last month, is part of a series of ventures that top Pentagon officials hope will transform the way the armed forces treat victims of sexual assault. Staffed by Air Force judge advocates general (JAGs) charged with standing up for victims' rights, the program is perhaps the Pentagon's most cutting-edge endeavor so far to combat sexual assault.

Its underlying philosophy is that one of the most important steps to creating a culture that discourages sexual assaults is to more effectively prosecute sexual predators within the ranks.

The quest for solutions is becoming urgent as the scope of the problem has become more apparent this year.

In early 2013, the Department of Defense released an alarming report that showed that although claims of sexual assault were rising, only a tiny fraction were reported – pointing to victims' distrust of the military justice system's ability to handle their cases fairly.

Then came a series of sexual-assault allegations that underscored the pervasiveness of the problem. This led some members of Congress to suggest at a particularly contentious June hearing that the chain of command in sexual-assault cases needed to be altered – a move the Pentagon strongly opposes.

As a result, the rest of the services are watching the Air Force's SVC program, aware that if they don't show that they are taking the problem seriously – and showing results in short order – Congress's patience could run out.

The SVC program is just one of several new initiatives to try to tackle the scourge of sexual assault. There are, for instance, ""bystander intervention"" programs in all the services that stress the role that friends can play in protecting fellow troops from assault by stepping in and discouraging aggressive or coercive behavior.

There is also extensive training for new recruits that increasingly emphasizes no tolerance for the crime.

At the same time, the Pentagon is taking new steps to survey the ""command climate"" of units to gauge the extent to which abusive behavior – or tolerance for it – may be lurking in the ranks. To this end, the Marine Corps recently created a new ""command climate survey"" with 34 questions.

""At least five of those deal with sexual assault, sexual harassment, confidence in the leadership to be able to protect and take care of the interests of the young marine,"" Gen. James Amos, the top officer in the Marine Corps, told lawmakers last month.

""There is an expectation for each of our commanding officers to set the conditions, the climate, in his or her organization that not only does all the combat stuff ... but also sets the environment such that the young marines that are in that unit are comfortable.""

But lawmakers – and senior military officials – increasingly stress the primary need to hold perpetrators accountable as a crucial part of the solution.

A Pentagon report released in May showed that instances of US troops who said they were sexually assaulted rose from some 19,000 in 2010 to more than 26,000 in 2012. But in the most recent year for which statistics are available, only 3,200 people reported the crime, resulting in 191 convictions.

This news came in the midst of a disturbing series of debacles for the US military. In May alone, the Air Force officer in charge of the service's sexual-assault prevention program was himself arrested for attempting to sexually assault a woman in a parking lot in Arlington, Va., and an Army sergeant stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, was charged with forcing a lower-ranking soldier to take part in a prostitution ring and sexually assaulting at least two other subordinates.

At the congressional hearings that followed, much of the discussion surrounded the case of Lt. Col. James Wilkerson, a former Air Force inspector general, who was convicted by a jury of aggravated sexual assault before a three-star general overturned the conviction.

Wilkerson's colleagues cited his ""excellent"" job performance as an F-16 pilot. Lt. Gen. Craig Franklin, who overturned the case, wrote a memo to the secretary of the Air Force explaining his decision: ""Based on all the letters submitted in clemency, in strong support of him, by people who knew him, such behavior appeared highly incongruent.""

This move drew the ire of a number of lawmakers, who suggested that sexual-assault perpetrators can also be charming people who are good at their jobs. It was this incident that helped spur senators to propose legislation this month to remove commanders from the process of deciding whether and how to proceed with a case – a measure that appears to be gaining broad bipartisan support in the Senate.

""This is not a Democratic idea. It is not a Republican idea. It is a good idea that meets the needs of the victims, creates transparency and accountability, and creates the needed objectivity that this issue deserves,"" Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D) of New York said in a Capitol Hill press conference Tuesday, while pointing out that Germany, Britain, and Israel already have adopted similar measures.

This prospect troubles military officials – and raises the stakes for the Air Force's newly minted SVCs.

The program is the baby of the Air Force's top lawyer, Lt. Gen. Richard Harding, who has handpicked each of the SVCs. In 2011, he notes, nearly one-third of victims who filed sexual-assault charges against a fellow servicemember ended up deciding to withdraw them.

""Many of those folks did so because they became exhausted and frustrated by the process,"" Harding says.

At the Air Force's judge advocate general school in Montgomery, Ala., Harding emphasizes this point to the 24 Air Force lawyers who will work at bases across the country as part of the inaugural class of full-time SVCs. ""Accountability can't take hold until we start getting more people reporting,"" he says.

Until the service can bring up levels of prosecution for sexual assault, he says, predators may be encouraged to carry on with little fear of reprisal.

Harding chose the SVCs here with a particular eye toward those who are dogged and highly skilled litigators, and who are also empathetic, he says.

In the six months since the pilot program began in January, senior military officials say they are seeing some positive trends: Instead of dropping cases, half of the sexual-assault victims who begin the process not planning to prosecute instead decide to move forward with a prosecution.

In all, more than 300 airmen have put in a request for an SVC to represent them as they file sexual-assault charges.

""That's a lot of people,"" Harding says. ""A huge demand signal, certainly.""

In a survey of the hundreds of airmen who have had an SVC, 100 percent reported being ""extremely satisfied with the advice and support"" that the SVC provided. One respondent wrote that the SVC provided ""comfort and confidence when you have had so much taken away.""

The SVCs are not prosecutors – their job is not to argue the case on behalf of the victim. Rather, their job is solely to represent the victim's interests during the legal process.

It is a vital function in today's military, says Meg Garvin, executive director of the National Crime Victim Law Institute.

The concept of victims' rights has not been a priority in the past, which is what makes the Air Force's SVC program ""really groundbreaking,"" she says. ""Victims' rights has been treated like a rhetorical pat on the head, not the law.""

This meant ""that even though the law says that the victim has a right to be heard, it wasn't treated legally like a right,"" she adds. ""It was more like a legal nicety – as in, 'We'll give it to you if we think it's right for the case,' as opposed to, 'You have ownership over this right and how would you like to use it?' ""

This is particularly important when the aims of the prosecutor diverge from those of the victim, which can happen frequently in sexual-assault cases.

For example, the SVC might work to protect the privacy of the victim, even if that means that the prosecution cannot have access to information that could help win a conviction.

Indeed, even if a conviction does not seem likely, more victims may be willing to pursue charges if they do not feel revictimized by the judicial process, senior military officials say.

One active-duty Air Force sergeant, who said he was sexually assaulted by a fellow airman, was hesitant to report an assault and had decided not to prosecute. After being put in touch with an SVC, however, his feelings changed.

Having a lawyer meant there was someone ""to actually represent me and to take my feelings and thoughts into consideration,"" says the sergeant, who asked to remain anonymous.

Even though the trial did not result in a conviction, the sergeant says he is at peace with the outcome and plans to pursue his military career.

Many of the SVCs in Montgomery have been prosecutors in sexual-assault cases before. They say the move to SVC has been liberating.

""It's a very freeing experience to be their attorney and to be able to speak to them in a way that says, 'Here's what you should be doing. Here's how we can make things better for you,' "" says Capt. Aaron Kirk, a new SVC in San Antonio.

One Air Force lawyer recalls a case in which a sexual-assault victim wanted to know whether she had to meet with a defendant's attorney, who had just asked to interview her for the fourth time.

""You want to say, 'Heck, no, you don't have to talk with them. They're on a fishing expedition,' "" he says. But the Uniform Code of Military Justice rules prevent him from providing any advice to the victim that might be seen as interfering with the defense's collection of evidence.

At the beginning of the case, ""You explain your role: 'I'm not your lawyer. I'm not here as your counselor.' That can sound very harsh,"" says an Air Force prosecutor who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""You try to have a positive relationship, but you're not their lawyer.""

As an SVC in Colorado Springs, Colo., former prosecutor Capt. Lorraine Sult says that she has found her clients' needs are different from what she previously recognized. Some would rather have their attackers go to counseling than get jail time, for example.

""As prosecutors, we think they just want the conviction,"" she says.

""It has been very enlightening to understand the frustration that they feel with the system,"" Kirk adds.

He recalls being struck by ""how little information"" sexual-assault victims get during the course of their cases – and ""how much work it takes"" to get it. As an SVC, ""We can help pipeline some of that information to them,"" he says.

In his new job, Kirk says he continues to be particularly drawn to the ""rewarding aspects of the SVC program.""

""It's very gratifying to help someone who's going through ostensibly the worst time of their life,"" he says. ""You can make a huge change in terms of a person's outlook in some cases.""

While he is no longer taking part in the prosecution of cases, ""you make their experience better, and you give them a voice in the process.""

For some of his clients, ""convictions are very important."" For others, ""They just want to be able to say, 'I got up and said what happened to me,' and that's enough.""

For his part, Kirk says he welcomes the chance to help more people come forward to share their stories and perhaps experience some catharsis.

""Rape is a crime of silence. It thrives in an environment where people are afraid to come forward,"" he says. The more people feel comfortable coming forward, he adds, the greater the chances that the military can begin to put an end to it.

Still, the SVCs have encountered resistance, sometimes among Air Force judges who do not believe they should be in the courtroom.

That's because some legal experts worry that special victims' attorneys ""will upset the balance of the justice system,"" says Ms. Garvin of the National Crime Victim Law Institute.

The argument is that ""If the victim has his or her own lawyer, doesn't that make it two versus one? Doesn't that make it unfair?""

The difference is that the SVC ""isn't a second prosecutor,"" Garvin says.

As the SVC program develops, its architect hopes that it will become a prototype for the rest of the armed services.

""I have no reason to believe that the Army, Navy, and the Marines would not see the very same positive responses from this program that we have seen,"" Harding says.

WASHINGTON — A Justice Department review has found that Missouri's troubled Ferguson Police Department engaged in a broad pattern of racially biased enforcement that permeated the city's justice system, including the use of unreasonable force against African American suspects, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the findings.

In 88% of cases in which Ferguson police documented the use of force, for example, that force was used against African Americans, according to the official who is not authorized to comment publicly. In addition, in all 14 canine bite incidents in which the suspect's race is known, the person bitten was African American.

African Americans account for 67% of the population in Ferguson, but they accounted for 85% of the drivers stopped by police, 90% of the people issued tickets and 93% of the people arrested, a three-year examination of suspect stops found. When those cases reached the Municipal Court, authorities collected more fines for suspects' failure to appear than any other charge, mostly from the city's poorest and most vulnerable residents.

African Americans were more than twice as likely than white drivers to be searched during vehicle stops, but 26% less likely to have contraband, the review found.

The Ferguson Police Department often charged its black residents with petty crimes. African Americans accounted for 95% of the people charged with walking in the street and 92% of people charged with disturbing the peace.

Investigators also recovered racially charged e-mails sent among employees of the police department and the Ferguson Municipal Court, which authorities said contributed to the alleged bias.

Among the e-mails was a missive apparently sent soon after President Obama's 2008 election. It suggested that he would not remain long in the job because ""what black man holds a steady job for four years.''

Another May 2011 e-mail referred to an African-American woman receiving a ""Crime-stoppers'' reward for terminating a pregnancy.

The Justice findings, while not unexpected, come six months after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, a black teenager by then-Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, who is white. The incident prompted waves of protest across the country and a re-examination of law enforcement's relationships with minority communities.

A separate inquiry into that incident is underway. That inquiry, Officials have said it is unlikely to result in charges against Wilson, who has left the department. A St. Louis County grand jury elected late last year not to indict Wilson in the shooting.

Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III and Police Chief Thomas Jackson were among a contingent of city officials who met with Justice representatives Tuesday in St. Louis to receive the government's findings.

""At this time, the city is currently reviewing the report and its findings,'' said a statement issued by the city; it added that a fuller response would come Wednesday, when the complete report is expected to be disclosed..

""This confirms what we have previously stated, that the actions of the killer of Michael Brown had to do with a systemic problem within the Ferguson Police Department,"" Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Brown's family, said of the Justice findings. ""The report shows that there were others treated inappropriately like we feel Mike Brown was treated inappropriately.""

Similar cases in other cities indicate such problems are widespread, Crump said.

""We have to work on a remedy to address this multi-city, multi-state epidemic all across America that has such adverse effects on communities of color and that is taking the lives of citizens,"" he said.

Ferguson resident Iyanla Doyle, 24, said the findings confirm what she's already witnessed from living in the city.

""It's beyond sad because Michael Brown wasn't the first black male who was killed by a police officer and he's not going to be the last,"" Doyle said. ""They should look at all these police departments because everyone might be doing the same thing.""

She hopes the government will disband the Ferguson Police Department and bring in an outside agency.

""We need officers who really care about people instead of making money and locking people up,"" she said.

DeRay McKesson, 29, a Minneapolis schools human relations executive who joined the Ferguson protests, agrees.

""The Ferguson Police Department shouldn't exist,""McKesson said. ""They have proven themselves incompetent and racist.""

The report shows Wilson ""was not an exception, but he was the rule,"" McKesson said.""Systems and structures influence the way people act. And, the systems and structures in Ferguson empowered and protected Darren Wilson.""​

Lynch,"WASHINGTON ( ███ ) - Newly installed U.S. Attorney General William Barr must walk a political and legal tightrope in deciding how much of Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s report on Russia ’ s role in the 2016 election to disclose , balancing competing demands from President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats , legal experts said .
The decision presents Barr , a veteran Washington insider , with his first major test since becoming the top U.S. law enforcement official last month , a position fraught with peril . Trump fired Barr ’ s predecessor Jeff Sessions in November after complaining for months over the decision by Sessions to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation .
“ I think Barr is in a terrible position from the standpoint of having two masters to please , each of which has a very different desire , ” said Michael Zeldin , a former federal prosecutor . “ He has a political nightmare on his hands . ”
Mueller , who has headed the investigation since May 2017 , is due to submit to Barr his confidential report on whether Trump ’ s campaign conspired with Russia and whether the Republican president has unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe .
Democrats , who have expressed concern Barr will try to shield Trump and bury parts of the report , already have threatened to subpoena it and go to court if necessary to force its release . Trump may pressure Barr to conceal damaging parts of Mueller ’ s report and release any findings that may exonerate him .
The Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in January and now wield subpoena power , with multiple committees investigating Trump ’ s actions . Republicans control the Senate . Mueller ’ s findings could be instrumental in any move in Congress to try to impeach Trump and remove him from office .
If the report includes “ evidence of misconduct by the sitting president of the United States , ” then “ I think you have to believe the public interest is so extreme that there will be a mechanism for release , and I think Barr ’ s easy way out is to say , ‘ It ’ s up to Congress , ’ ” said Matthew Jacobs , a former federal prosecutor now with the law firm Vinson & Elkins .
Barr , 68 , served as attorney general once before , from 1991 to 1993 under Republican President George H.W . Bush . He has embraced an expansive view of presidential powers . Last year , while Sessions was still attorney general , Barr sent an unsolicited memo to the Justice Department disputing Mueller ’ s authority to investigate Trump for obstruction of justice .
From a legal standpoint , Barr has a road map in the form of the Justice Department ’ s regulations on the appointment of special counsels . Those rules require him to notify the top Democrats and Republicans on the House and Senate judiciary committees after Mueller completes his probe .
The rules do not require release of the entire report , but they do not explicitly prevent Barr from giving it to Congress . The rules also give Barr latitude to disclose parts of the report if it is in the public interest .
In deciding what to release , Barr may face thorny legal issues involving secrecy of grand jury testimony , protecting classified information , communications with the White House possibly subject to the principle of executive privilege shielding certain information from disclosure , and safeguarding confidential reasons for why some individuals were not charged .
Several Trump campaign figures already have pleaded guilty or been convicted in Mueller ’ s investigation , while others have not been charged . If the report provides evidence that Trump committed obstruction of justice or other crimes , Barr must decide how much should be revealed .

The decision presents Barr, a veteran Washington insider, with his first major test since becoming the top U.S. law enforcement official last month, a position fraught with peril. Trump fired Barr’s predecessor Jeff Sessions in November after complaining for months over the decision by Sessions to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation.

Last year, while Sessions was still attorney general, Barr sent an unsolicited memo to the Justice Department disputing Mueller’s authority to investigate Trump for obstruction of justice.

A ROAD MAP

From a legal standpoint, Barr has a road map in the form of the Justice Department’s regulations on the appointment of special counsels. Those rules require him to notify the top Democrats and Republicans on the House and Senate judiciary committees after Mueller completes his probe.

The rules do not require release of the entire report, but they do not explicitly prevent Barr from giving it to Congress. The rules also give Barr latitude to disclose parts of the report if it is in the public interest.

In deciding what to release, Barr may face thorny legal issues involving secrecy of grand jury testimony, protecting classified information, communications with the White House possibly subject to the principle of executive privilege shielding certain information from disclosure, and safeguarding confidential reasons for why some individuals were not charged.

Several Trump campaign figures already have pleaded guilty or been convicted in Mueller’s investigation, while others have not been charged. If the report provides evidence that Trump committed obstruction of justice or other crimes, Barr must decide how much should be revealed.

The Justice Department has a decades-old policy that a sitting president cannot face criminal charges, though some lawyers take issue with that conclusion. As a matter of policy, the Justice Department also does not give a public explanation for why any individual has not been charged.

“I don’t know that the department has ever encountered this situation where the reason a person isn’t being charged with a crime is that the person is immune by virtue of his office and is subject to impeachment as a result,” said Robert Litt, a former general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence who is now with the firm Morrison & Foerster.

“The more damaging the report is to the president, the greater the pressure is on Barr to release it, and paradoxically of course, if the report completely exonerates the president, then the president should want it released,” Litt added.

Barr appears to have support among rank-and-file Justice Department employees relieved to have an attorney general who understands the institution, after serving under former senator Sessions and then an acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, who was a Trump political loyalist. At a recent reception for employees, Barr bought the food and drinks and was greeted by people who told him they were happy he was there.

Barr “is an experienced lawyer and manager, and he has served in the position of attorney general, so he has great respect for that office,” said Mark Tuohey, a lawyer with the firm Baker & Hostetler who once served as deputy to former independent counsel Ken Starr on the Whitewater investigation involving Democratic President Bill Clinton’s business dealings.

Not all of Holder's crusades have worked out well.

Loretta Lynch , currently the top federal prosecutor in Brooklyn , N.Y. , said that she was not personally involved in the decision that led to the president ’ s unilateral immigration action in November .
But , she told the Senate Judiciary Committee , the underlying legal justification for the president ’ s granting deferred action for 5 million individuals was based on an identifiable legal framework that she found compelling .
“ I did find the analysis to be reasonable . It did seem to find a reasonable basis , ” she said in answer to pointed questions from Sen. Ted Cruz ( R ) of Texas .
Many Republican senators maintain that Obama exceeded his authority under the Constitution and usurped legislative power reserved exclusively for Congress . The issue is being litigated in a federal court in Texas .
Democrats disagree with this view and tried to play down attempts by Republicans to pin Ms. Lynch down on the issue .
“ I have to have a clear answer to this question , ” Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R ) of Alabama asked . “ Do you believe the executive action announced by President Obama is legal and constitutional ? ”
Lynch responded : “ As I read the opinion , I believe it is . ”
The legal memo , Lynch added , had also recommended that the president not take certain contemplated actions . She said the administration followed that advice as well .
The comments came during a day-long hearing in which she nimbly fielded barbed questions mostly from Republican senators still smarting over their contentious confrontations with outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder .
Lynch sought to reassure combative Republicans that she would not be a clone of her predecessor . Mr. Holder maintained a prickly posture toward Republicans in Congress and became the first attorney general in US history to be held in contempt of Congress for failing to cooperate on oversight issues .
“ How do we know you are not going to perform your duties as attorney general the way Eric Holder performed his duties ? ” Sen. John Cornyn ( R ) of Texas asked .
“ I will be myself , ” Lynch said . “ I will be Loretta Lynch . ”
She added : “ I do pledge to this committee that I want to hear your concerns . I want to listen to your concerns and will discuss them going forward . ”
The confirmation hearing seemed at times more like a forum for Republican complaints about the Obama administration than an examination of Lynch ’ s qualifications to become America ’ s top federal law enforcement official .
Through it all , Lynch maintained a professional and businesslike demeanor that she probably honed while prosecuting terrorists , mob figures , corrupt cops , and white-collar criminals in the Eastern District of New York .
If confirmed for the job , as expected , she will become the first African-American woman to serve as attorney general .
If the Republicans were particularly tough on her , the Democrats were more than supportive .
“ She is smart , she is tough , she is hard-working and independent . Her qualifications are beyond reproach , ” Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D ) of Vermont said .
Sen. Charles Schumer ( D ) of New York noted that Lynch ’ s father is a fourth-generation Baptist minister and that her mother “ picked cotton in the segregated South so her daughter would never have to . ”
Lynch is graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School .
Though most of her career has been as a prosecutor in the United States , she spent two years as a volunteer advising prosecutors at the International Criminal Tribunal for the genocide in Rwanda .
In response to questions , Lynch revealed that she is opposed to the legalization of marijuana , believes waterboarding is a form of torture and is thus illegal , and is open to prosecuting suspected terrorists in either federal court or in a military tribunal .
She supports beefed-up protection of US trade secrets and an aggressive approach to counter cybercrime and human trafficking .

Wednesday ’ s hearing was set aside to question Lynch . On Thursday , the senators will hear testimony from various experts and colleagues concerning her nomination .","President Obama’s executive action granting deferred deportation status and work permits for up to 5 million undocumented immigrants was based on a “reasonable” legal opinion by Justice Department lawyers, Mr. Obama’s choice to become the next attorney general told senators at her confirmation hearing on Wednesday.

Loretta Lynch, currently the top federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, N.Y., said that she was not personally involved in the decision that led to the president’s unilateral immigration action in November.

But, she told the Senate Judiciary Committee, the underlying legal justification for the president’s granting deferred action for 5 million individuals was based on an identifiable legal framework that she found compelling.

“I did find the analysis to be reasonable. It did seem to find a reasonable basis,” she said in answer to pointed questions from Sen. Ted Cruz (R) of Texas.

Many Republican senators maintain that Obama exceeded his authority under the Constitution and usurped legislative power reserved exclusively for Congress. The issue is being litigated in a federal court in Texas.

Democrats disagree with this view and tried to play down attempts by Republicans to pin Ms. Lynch down on the issue.

“I have to have a clear answer to this question,” Sen. Jeff Sessions (R) of Alabama asked. “Do you believe the executive action announced by President Obama is legal and constitutional?”

Lynch responded: “As I read the opinion, I believe it is.”

The legal memo, Lynch added, had also recommended that the president not take certain contemplated actions. She said the administration followed that advice as well.

The comments came during a day-long hearing in which she nimbly fielded barbed questions mostly from Republican senators still smarting over their contentious confrontations with outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder.

Lynch sought to reassure combative Republicans that she would not be a clone of her predecessor. Mr. Holder maintained a prickly posture toward Republicans in Congress and became the first attorney general in US history to be held in contempt of Congress for failing to cooperate on oversight issues.

“How do we know you are not going to perform your duties as attorney general the way Eric Holder performed his duties?” Sen. John Cornyn (R) of Texas asked.

“I will be myself,” Lynch said. “I will be Loretta Lynch.”

She added: “I do pledge to this committee that I want to hear your concerns. I want to listen to your concerns and will discuss them going forward.”

The confirmation hearing seemed at times more like a forum for Republican complaints about the Obama administration than an examination of Lynch’s qualifications to become America’s top federal law enforcement official.

Through it all, Lynch maintained a professional and businesslike demeanor that she probably honed while prosecuting terrorists, mob figures, corrupt cops, and white-collar criminals in the Eastern District of New York.

If confirmed for the job, as expected, she will become the first African-American woman to serve as attorney general.

If the Republicans were particularly tough on her, the Democrats were more than supportive.

“She is smart, she is tough, she is hard-working and independent. Her qualifications are beyond reproach,” Sen. Patrick Leahy (D) of Vermont said.

Sen. Charles Schumer (D) of New York noted that Lynch’s father is a fourth-generation Baptist minister and that her mother “picked cotton in the segregated South so her daughter would never have to.”

Lynch is graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School.

Though most of her career has been as a prosecutor in the United States, she spent two years as a volunteer advising prosecutors at the International Criminal Tribunal for the genocide in Rwanda.

In response to questions, Lynch revealed that she is opposed to the legalization of marijuana, believes waterboarding is a form of torture and is thus illegal, and is open to prosecuting suspected terrorists in either federal court or in a military tribunal.

She supports beefed-up protection of US trade secrets and an aggressive approach to counter cybercrime and human trafficking.

At one point, Lynch was asked if it was lawful for the president to unilaterally issue work permits for those who entered the country illegally.

“The right and the obligation to work is one that’s shared by all in the US, regardless of status,” she said. If they are here, it is preferable, she said, that they are in the workplace.

Later in the hearing, Senator Schumer sought to walk Lynch back from her statement. “What did you mean when you said you think everyone should work regardless of status?” he asked.

“I was making a personal observation,” she said. The comment was a personal reflection, not a legal position, she stressed.

“In my family, we are all expected to try to find employment to become a responsible adult and a responsible member of society,” she said.

“You are not suggesting it is a legal right,” Schumer asked.

“No,” she responded.

Senator Cruz, a former solicitor general of Texas who has argued at the US Supreme Court, was by far the most aggressive in his interrogation of Lynch.

He wanted to know her opinion on whether it is constitutional for the US government use a drone strike to kill an American on US soil if the individual does not pose an imminent threat.

Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. , once a rising Democratic star whose political fortunes imploded over the use of campaign finances to support lavish personal spending , was sentenced to 30 months in prison on Wednesday .

The ex-Illinois lawmaker 's wife , Sandi , received a 12-month sentence for her role in her husband 's misuse of roughly $ 750,000 in campaign funds over several years .
`` I do n't have to tell you this is a very sad day and a very difficult case , '' Judge Jackson said , calling it an example of organized and joint misconduct and a violation of the public trust .
As the judge read her sentence , Sandi Jackson wept . Her husband smiled slightly when he received his punishment , which was less than what the government sought .

The pair pleaded guilty in February to various charges -- Jackson to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud , and false statements ; and his wife to filing false tax returns .
After the hearing , Jackson acknowledged his failings and hoped for a renewal .
`` I still , believe in the power of forgiveness . I believe in the power of redemption . Today I manned up and tried to accept responsibility for the error of my ways , '' he said before climbing into a waiting vehicle .
A smooth politician and the son of a civil rights leader and one-time political heavyweight , the younger Jackson admitted to using campaign money to pay for things such as vacations , furs and Michael Jackson memorabilia .
In a statement read in court , Jackson said he wanted to be held accountable for his actions and he knew what he did was wrong .
He also asked the judge to not punish his wife for what he said `` was a subset of what I did . ''
`` I ask that my kids not suffer from my actions , '' Jackson said of his two children , 9 and 13 . `` If probation is not available to my wife , give me her time . ''
Jackson 's lawyers reiterated that sentiment and asked the court for an 18-month sentence for Jackson and probation for his wife .
`` This is not Madoff , '' Reid Weingarten , Jackson 's lawyer , said in court , referring to notorious Wall Street swindler Bernie Madoff . `` There was no Ponzi scheme . ''
Sandi Jackson sobbed through part of her courtroom statement and said she `` put her family unit in peril '' for filing false tax returns .
`` I stand before you today asking for mercy , '' she said . `` My heart breaks every day with the pain it 's caused my babies . I ask the court for mercy . ''
Prosecutors had sought a four-year sentence for Jackson and 18 months in jail and restitution of $ 168,550 for his wife .
`` This is a sad day that involves a waste of talent , '' prosecutor Matthew Graves said . `` They were in the top 10 percent of household earnings in the United States . There 's just no need for this kind of conduct . ''
Graves said that Jackson did not `` deserve credit '' for his job as a congressman .
Jackson 's lawyers pointed to his record in Washington -- one they said was good -- in arguing for a lighter sentence .
The judge said the sentencing guidelines were excessive and that apologies expressed appeared genuine . She also cited helpful cooperation .
`` The real remorse you 've shown is palpable in this courtroom , '' she said . `` There 's no question you 've suffered . Your remorse is real . ''
After sentencing , the judge gave the couple a few minutes to discuss who wanted to serve their sentence first .
Jackson will begin his sentence around November 1 at a prison camp in Montgomery , Alabama , the judge said .
`` I ask for Alabama so I can be as far away from everybody for a while as I can be , '' he said . `` I want to make it a little inconvenient for everybody to get to me . ''
In addition to jail time , Jackson must repay in full the money he misused , while his wife was ordered to make restitution of $ 22,000 .
Jackson and his wife also were ordered to perform community service .
According to court records , Jackson misused about $ 750,000 in campaign funds from August 2005 through July 2012 . Some of the eye-popping spending included $ 60,000 at Antiques of Nevada , where Jackson bought two hats belonging to the late singer Michael Jackson costing more than $ 8,000 ; a $ 5,000 football signed by U.S. presidents ; and memorabilia involving the Rev . Martin Luther King Jr. , Malcolm X and martial artist Bruce Lee .
The Jackson 's also use campaign funds to purchase Blu-Ray DVD players from Best Buy , dresses and jewelry from a small boutique and fur capes and parkas from a Beverly Hills , California , furrier .
In total , prosecutors said Jackson made more than 3,000 purchases .
He was succeeded by Democratic Rep. Robin L. Kelly , who won a special election this year to fill the vacancy in the Illinois 2nd Congressional District .
Early in his political career , Jackson was considered a politician on the rise .
In 1997 , Newsweek named him one of the 100 people to watch in the next century .
`` He 's a hit in Congress , '' read the Newsweek article . `` Will he be the first black president ? ''
Although Jackson never lived up to that hype , he was an extremely vocal supporter of then-candidate Barack Obama .
`` I 'm sure that Dr. King is looking down on us here in Denver noting this is the first political convention in history to take place within sight of a mountaintop , '' Jackson said in 2008 , referencing the Rev . Martin Luther King 's famous speech , `` I 've Been to the Mountaintop . ''
`` I know Barack Obama , '' Jackson said . `` I 've seen his leadership at work . I 've seen the difference he has made in the lives of people across Illinois . ''
Outside the courtroom , Jackson Sr. told reporters that his son was `` unbelievably sick '' a year ago , but is now doing better .
`` I do n't know how I missed so many signs , '' the elder Jackson said .","Story highlights Former congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. sentenced to 30 months in prison

The pair pleaded guilty in February to various charges -- Jackson to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, and false statements; and his wife to filing false tax returns.

After the hearing, Jackson acknowledged his failings and hoped for a renewal.

""I still, believe in the power of forgiveness. I believe in the power of redemption. Today I manned up and tried to accept responsibility for the error of my ways,"" he said before climbing into a waiting vehicle.

Vacations, furs and memorabilia

A smooth politician and the son of a civil rights leader and one-time political heavyweight, the younger Jackson admitted to using campaign money to pay for things such as vacations, furs and Michael Jackson memorabilia.

In a statement read in court, Jackson said he wanted to be held accountable for his actions and he knew what he did was wrong.

He also asked the judge to not punish his wife for what he said ""was a subset of what I did.""

""I ask that my kids not suffer from my actions,"" Jackson said of his two children, 9 and 13. ""If probation is not available to my wife, give me her time.""

Jackson's lawyers reiterated that sentiment and asked the court for an 18-month sentence for Jackson and probation for his wife.

""This is not Madoff,"" Reid Weingarten, Jackson's lawyer, said in court, referring to notorious Wall Street swindler Bernie Madoff. ""There was no Ponzi scheme.""

Sandi Jackson sobbed through part of her courtroom statement and said she ""put her family unit in peril"" for filing false tax returns.

""I stand before you today asking for mercy,"" she said. ""My heart breaks every day with the pain it's caused my babies. I ask the court for mercy.""

Prosecutors had sought a four-year sentence for Jackson and 18 months in jail and restitution of $168,550 for his wife.

""This is a sad day that involves a waste of talent,"" prosecutor Matthew Graves said. ""They were in the top 10 percent of household earnings in the United States. There's just no need for this kind of conduct.""

Graves said that Jackson did not ""deserve credit"" for his job as a congressman.

""That's what he was paid to do,"" he said.

Jackson's lawyers pointed to his record in Washington -- one they said was good -- in arguing for a lighter sentence.

The judge said the sentencing guidelines were excessive and that apologies expressed appeared genuine. She also cited helpful cooperation.

""The real remorse you've shown is palpable in this courtroom,"" she said. ""There's no question you've suffered. Your remorse is real.""

After sentencing, the judge gave the couple a few minutes to discuss who wanted to serve their sentence first.

Jackson will begin his sentence around November 1 at a prison camp in Montgomery, Alabama, the judge said.

Jackson requested the location.

""I ask for Alabama so I can be as far away from everybody for a while as I can be,"" he said. ""I want to make it a little inconvenient for everybody to get to me.""

In addition to jail time, Jackson must repay in full the money he misused, while his wife was ordered to make restitution of $22,000.

Jackson and his wife also were ordered to perform community service.

Jackson in Congress until 2012

According to court records, Jackson misused about $750,000 in campaign funds from August 2005 through July 2012. Some of the eye-popping spending included $60,000 at Antiques of Nevada, where Jackson bought two hats belonging to the late singer Michael Jackson costing more than $8,000; a $5,000 football signed by U.S. presidents; and memorabilia involving the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and martial artist Bruce Lee.

The Jackson's also use campaign funds to purchase Blu-Ray DVD players from Best Buy, dresses and jewelry from a small boutique and fur capes and parkas from a Beverly Hills, California, furrier.

In total, prosecutors said Jackson made more than 3,000 purchases.

He was succeeded by Democratic Rep. Robin L. Kelly, who won a special election this year to fill the vacancy in the Illinois 2nd Congressional District.

Jackson's lawyers later stated he suffers from bipolar disorder.

A rising star, knows Obama

Early in his political career, Jackson was considered a politician on the rise.

In 1997, Newsweek named him one of the 100 people to watch in the next century.

""He's a hit in Congress,"" read the Newsweek article. ""Will he be the first black president?""

Although Jackson never lived up to that hype, he was an extremely vocal supporter of then-candidate Barack Obama.

""I'm sure that Dr. King is looking down on us here in Denver noting this is the first political convention in history to take place within sight of a mountaintop,"" Jackson said in 2008, referencing the Rev. Martin Luther King's famous speech, ""I've Been to the Mountaintop.""

""I know Barack Obama,"" Jackson said. ""I've seen his leadership at work. I've seen the difference he has made in the lives of people across Illinois.""

Outside the courtroom, Jackson Sr. told reporters that his son was ""unbelievably sick"" a year ago, but is now doing better.

""I don't know how I missed so many signs,"" the elder Jackson said.",www.cnn.com,left,5520e7H0ccKhYMns

Barr , who previously held the position under President George H.W . Bush , will now become head of the US Department of Justice . He ’ ll replace Matthew Whitaker , who became acting attorney general after Jeff Sessions resigned from the job last year .
For now , a lot of the attention around Barr has focused on what his new role could mean for the Russia investigation .
But as head of the Justice Department , Barr will have a lot of control over the federal criminal justice system more broadly . And although criminal justice reform has gained momentum in recent years ( leading to the passage of the federal First Step Act , with Trump ’ s support ) , Barr ’ s views have historically been on the opposite end of the spectrum — supportive of mass incarceration and other “ tough on crime ” policies .
Ames Grawert , senior counsel at the Brennan Center , which supports criminal justice reform , tweeted in reaction to Barr ’ s nomination last year : “ Barr is one of the few people left in policy circles who could reasonably be called as bad as , or worse than , Jeff Sessions on criminal justice reform. ” And make no mistake : Sessions had a very bad record on criminal justice reform .
In fact , Barr praised Sessions ’ s record at the Justice Department , including some of his work dismantling criminal justice reform efforts by President Barack Obama ’ s administration .
In short : If you were hoping that Sessions ’ s replacement would be better on criminal justice reform , Barr ’ s nomination should be of great concern .
Barr doesn ’ t just have a record of supporting the war on drugs and mass incarceration . As attorney general for George H.W . Bush , he was one of the architects for federal policies that supported both .
Here are some examples , noted in part by Grawert and civil rights lawyer Sasha Samberg-Champion :
As deputy attorney general from 1990 to 1991 and attorney general from 1991 to 1993 , Barr pushed for and helped implement more punitive criminal justice policies , including a 1990 crime law that , among other things , escalated the war on drugs .
In 1992 , Barr signed off on a report by the Department of Justice titled The Case for More Incarceration . In a letter of support , he argued that “ there is no better way to reduce crime than to identify , target , and incapacitate those hardened criminals who commit staggering numbers of violent crimes whenever they are on the streets. ” He also called on the country to build more jails and prisons . ( Although he specified violent criminals , the federal system , unlike the much larger state systems , locks up mostly drug offenders . )
In 1992 , asked about racial disparities in prisons by Los Angeles Times reporter Ronald Ostrow , Barr argued that “ our system is fair and does not treat people differently. ” He went on to defend laws that made prison sentences for crack cocaine much harsher than prison sentences for powder cocaine . The disparity between the two was reduced by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 , in part because there ’ s little justification for it based on the drugs ’ effects , but the higher sentence for crack has a disproportionate racial impact since crack was more commonly used in black communities and powder cocaine was more commonly used in white communities .
In 1994 , Barr co-chaired a commission for Virginia ’ s governor that released a plan to abolish parole ( which allows certain inmates to go free before the completion of their sentences ) in the state , increase prison sentences , and build more prisons .
Barr also once said that it was “ simply a myth ” that there were “ sympathetic people ” and “ hapless victims of the criminal justice system ” in prisons , according to David Krajicek at Salon .
It ’ s possible that Barr ’ s views have evolved over the years , just as many people ’ s views have toward the drug war and mass incarceration , especially as crime has plummeted in the past two decades . This may even apply to Trump , who ran on a “ tough on crime ” platform in 2016 but went on to sign the biggest federal criminal justice reform bill in decades , the First Step Act , after the urging of his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner .
But Barr has continued advocating for “ tough on crime ” views , at least until recently . In 2015 , he signed a letter with other former law enforcement officials to oppose a federal sentencing reform bill , according to Michael Balsamo at the Associated Press .
In November , Barr and two other former attorneys general wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post in which they defended Sessions ’ s “ tough on crime ” record . They criticized the Obama administration for investigating police abuses and discouraging more aggressive policing practices . They also praised Sessions for his memo encouraging federal prosecutors to pursue harsher prison sentences against drug offenders .
In his opening remarks at the Senate confirmation hearings , Barr vowed to “ diligently implement ” the First Step Act but also affirmed his commitment to “ keep up the pressure on chronic , violent criminals. ” And he later argued at the hearings that the 1980s and ’ 90s were a different time , when crime was much higher and prison sentences much shorter , so his call for more punitive punishments was warranted .
Barr ’ s support for more punitive criminal justice policies goes against the research , which has found that more incarceration and longer prison sentences do little to combat crime .
A 2015 review of the research by the Brennan Center for Justice estimated that more incarceration — and its abilities to incapacitate or deter criminals — explained about 0 to 7 percent of the crime drop since the 1990s , though other researchers estimate it drove 10 to 25 percent of the crime drop since the ’ 90s .
Another huge review of the research , released last year by David Roodman of the Open Philanthropy Project , found that releasing people from prison earlier doesn ’ t lead to more crime , and that holding people in prison longer may actually increase crime .
That conclusion matches what other researchers have found in this area . As the National Institute of Justice concluded in 2016 , “ Research has found evidence that prison can exacerbate , not reduce , recidivism . Prisons themselves may be schools for learning to commit crimes . ”
This is the kind of research that has driven support for criminal justice reform over the years , including the First Step Act . But it also suggests that much of Barr ’ s initial work on criminal justice issues , particularly his support for mass incarceration , was misguided . It remains unclear if and how that has changed Barr ’ s mind .
The silver lining : the federal criminal justice system isn ’ t that big
If there is any sign of optimism for criminal justice reformers here , it ’ s that the federal criminal justice system is a relatively small part of the national criminal justice system .
Consider the numbers : According to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics , 87 percent of US prison inmates are held in state facilities ( and most state inmates are in for violent , not drug , crimes ) . That doesn ’ t even account for local jails , where hundreds of thousands of people are held on a typical day in America . Just look at this chart from the Prison Policy Initiative , which shows both local jails and state prisons far outpacing the number of people incarcerated in federal prisons :
One way to think about this is what would happen if Trump used his pardon powers to their maximum potential — meaning he pardoned every single person in federal prison right now . That would push down America ’ s overall incarcerated population from about 2.1 million to about 1.9 million .
That would be a hefty reduction . But it also wouldn ’ t undo mass incarceration , as the US would still lead all but one country in incarceration : With an incarceration rate of around 590 per 100,000 people , only the small nation of El Salvador would come out ahead — and America would still dwarf the incarceration rates of other developed nations like Canada ( 114 per 100,000 ) , Germany ( 76 per 100,000 ) , and Japan ( 41 per 100,000 ) .
Similarly , almost all police work is done at the local and state level . There are about 18,000 law enforcement agencies in America , only a dozen or so of which are federal agencies .
While the federal government can incentivize states to adopt specific criminal justice policies , studies show that previous efforts , such as the 1994 federal crime law , had little to no impact . By and large , it seems local municipalities and states will only embrace federal incentives on criminal justice issues if they actually want to adopt the policies being encouraged .
Criminal justice reform , then , is going to fall largely to municipalities and states .

William Barr’s punitive record on criminal justice issues

In fact , she was so impressive that even the right-wing bloggers at Powerline called her the Ernie Banks of nominees , which , judging from their eulogy for the real Ernie Banks , is very good indeed . But then they also said the committee was throwing softballs , so the metaphors got a little confusing . It was a very good day for Loretta Lynch , much to their chagrin . She was appropriately confident , dignified and boring and thus made for a dull affair that was unlikely to derail her nomination .
The second day of hearings , in which both Republicans and Democrats on the committee invited both people to testify , was a little bit more lively . We knew it would be when the committee announced their guests . The Democrats offered a group of former colleagues and law professors . The Republicans offered a couple of conservative law professors to denounce President Obama 's usurpation of democracy -- - and some far-right-wing activists to complain about being victimized .
The first person to testify was someone who had never met or had any knowledge of Loretta Lynch . This was former reporter and current right-wing icon Sharyl Attkisson who told a harrowing story of harassment , including her questionable allegation that the government bugged her computer , obviously shocking the likes of Chuck Grassley and Orrin Hatch to the depth of their souls . It 's one thing for the government to relentlessly pursue reporters like James Risen who report serious and important stories . They wholeheartedly support the Justice Department in such cases . Attkisson , however , resigned from CBS News because she felt the entire network was biased in favor of the Obama administration and refused to allow her to pursue the scandals she just knew were there . ( These were scandals like Benghazi and Fast and Furious -- scandals that have been investigated approximately 756 times under every committee in the Congress and have turned up zilch . ) Somehow they 've managed to morph this professional dispute into a story of Attkisson being victimized by the authoritarian police state .
It would have been interesting to hear testimony about the government 's pursuit of leaks and reporters over the past few years , which really is a scandal and which should form the basis of questioning for the new attorney general . But since both parties are generally in favor of this practice , that was n't to be . Instead the Republicans called one of their celebrity martyrs to testify about how hard it is for a conservative to live in this world .
The next activist they called to testify about Loretta Lynch was a man who admittedly has absolutely no knowledge of her but had something to say about how Eric Holder was very mean to police officers around the country . He is an African-American sheriff from Wisconsin named David Clarke who up to this point is best known for his appearances on `` Fox and Friends '' in which he says things like , `` the NAACP is nothing more than a propaganda entity for the left '' and that the behavior of black people is the reason they are getting shot so often . He suggested that the federal government is waging a war on police and should butt out of local business .
The final activist of the day was a citizen who has been working her heart out trying to protect our electoral system from the scourge of nonexistent voter fraud . That would be a woman named Catherine Englebrecht , who runs a far-right-wing group called True the Vote , which sends out groups of `` observers '' to African-American and Hispanic polling places to make sure they 're not stealing the votes of decent Americans . Upon Eric Holder 's resignation , her group put out a press release stating that Holder had carried out a `` radical , racialist assault on voting rights . '' She was there to complain about the Department of Justice failing to immediately interview her over the alleged IRS scandal and to excoriate them over the `` nightmare of citizen targeting . '' She then testified that Loretta Lynch was wrong in saying that laws had been passed throughout the South to prevent some people from voting . Sen. Jeff Sessions pointed out that an Alabama Tea Party leader had been victimized by the IRS and nobody at the IRS cares . Sen. Orrin Hatch expressed his deepest sympathy for what she 's been through and assured her that they were going to get to bottom of it . Her voice cracked with emotion as she said , `` Thank you , sir . ''
This was the first committee hearing of the new Senate Judiciary Committee under GOP rule , a hearing to determine the fitness of a presidential nominee to the most powerful law enforcement office in the land , and they called a group of partisan crackpots and grass-roots loons to relitigate moldy pseudo-scandals and complain about nonexistent government persecution . And it 's not as if they could n't have found some real scandals to talk about . The Obama Justice Department is hardly perfect . But they are married to their Foxified version of reality and simply ca n't see the forest for the trees .
The whole spectacle was a nostalgic trip back in time to the days of Clinton madness when the judiciary committees were able to leverage any public hearing into a scandal fest . The press seems less inclined to go along these days , a fact that Sharyl Attkisson would surely attribute to its political bias . But the truth is that these `` scandals '' are just sad echoes of the scandal-mongering of the 1990s . The energy is gone , the issues seem pale and lifeless . Not that there was ever any `` there '' there , but they are now just going through the motions .
But I hope Democrats do n't get too complacent . President Obama has never been able to get their scandal mojo rising . But there 's every reason to suspect that this is just an off-season workout for what they see as a return to the big leagues . If Hillary Clinton wins the presidency you can be sure there will be a return to the fiery investigations whenever the Republicans hold either house of Congress . And if history serves , the press will likely be eager to join the team .
But this sad little show reveals just how much they are in need of some spring training . Loretta Lynch may be a genial public servant in the mold of Ernie Banks , but when it comes to scandal management , Clinton is Babe Ruth . They are going to need to up their game significantly .","By all accounts Loretta Lynch, president Obama's choice to replace Eric Holder as attorney general, was very impressive in the first day of hearings.

It's one thing for the government to relentlessly pursue reporters like James Risen who report serious and important stories. They wholeheartedly support the Justice Department in such cases. Attkisson, however, resigned from CBS News because she felt the entire network was biased in favor of the Obama administration and refused to allow her to pursue the scandals she just knew were there. (These were scandals like Benghazi and Fast and Furious -- scandals that have been investigated approximately 756 times under every committee in the Congress and have turned up zilch.) Somehow they've managed to morph this professional dispute into a story of Attkisson being victimized by the authoritarian police state.

It would have been interesting to hear testimony about the government's pursuit of leaks and reporters over the past few years, which really is a scandal and which should form the basis of questioning for the new attorney general. But since both parties are generally in favor of this practice, that wasn't to be. Instead the Republicans called one of their celebrity martyrs to testify about how hard it is for a conservative to live in this world.

The next activist they called to testify about Loretta Lynch was a man who admittedly has absolutely no knowledge of her but had something to say about how Eric Holder was very mean to police officers around the country. He is an African-American sheriff from Wisconsin named David Clarke who up to this point is best known for his appearances on ""Fox and Friends"" in which he says things like, ""the NAACP is nothing more than a propaganda entity for the left"" and that the behavior of black people is the reason they are getting shot so often. He suggested that the federal government is waging a war on police and should butt out of local business.

The final activist of the day was a citizen who has been working her heart out trying to protect our electoral system from the scourge of nonexistent voter fraud. That would be a woman named Catherine Englebrecht, who runs a far-right-wing group called True the Vote, which sends out groups of ""observers"" to African-American and Hispanic polling places to make sure they're not stealing the votes of decent Americans. Upon Eric Holder's resignation, her group put out a press release stating that Holder had carried out a ""radical, racialist assault on voting rights."" She was there to complain about the Department of Justice failing to immediately interview her over the alleged IRS scandal and to excoriate them over the ""nightmare of citizen targeting."" She then testified that Loretta Lynch was wrong in saying that laws had been passed throughout the South to prevent some people from voting. Sen. Jeff Sessions pointed out that an Alabama Tea Party leader had been victimized by the IRS and nobody at the IRS cares. Sen. Orrin Hatch expressed his deepest sympathy for what she's been through and assured her that they were going to get to bottom of it. Her voice cracked with emotion as she said, ""Thank you, sir.""

This was the first committee hearing of the new Senate Judiciary Committee under GOP rule, a hearing to determine the fitness of a presidential nominee to the most powerful law enforcement office in the land, and they called a group of partisan crackpots and grass-roots loons to relitigate moldy pseudo-scandals and complain about nonexistent government persecution. And it's not as if they couldn't have found some real scandals to talk about. The Obama Justice Department is hardly perfect. But they are married to their Foxified version of reality and simply can't see the forest for the trees.

The whole spectacle was a nostalgic trip back in time to the days of Clinton madness when the judiciary committees were able to leverage any public hearing into a scandal fest. The press seems less inclined to go along these days, a fact that Sharyl Attkisson would surely attribute to its political bias. But the truth is that these ""scandals"" are just sad echoes of the scandal-mongering of the 1990s. The energy is gone, the issues seem pale and lifeless. Not that there was ever any ""there"" there, but they are now just going through the motions.

But I hope Democrats don't get too complacent. President Obama has never been able to get their scandal mojo rising. But there's every reason to suspect that this is just an off-season workout for what they see as a return to the big leagues. If Hillary Clinton wins the presidency you can be sure there will be a return to the fiery investigations whenever the Republicans hold either house of Congress. And if history serves, the press will likely be eager to join the team.

But this sad little show reveals just how much they are in need of some spring training. Loretta Lynch may be a genial public servant in the mold of Ernie Banks, but when it comes to scandal management, Clinton is Babe Ruth. They are going to need to up their game significantly.",www.salon.com,left,qLcl0FfTohfa1us3

A day after she refused to answer questions at a congressional hearing , Lois Lerner was placed on administrative leave , according to congressional sources .
Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa , a senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee , said Lerner was asked to resign but refused , so she was placed on leave . An IRS spokeswoman said the agency could not comment on Lerner 's status because it was a private personnel matter .
Danny Werfel , the agency 's new acting commissioner , told IRS employees in an email that he had selected a new acting head of the division , staying within the IRS to find new leadership .
Ken Corbin , a 27-year IRS veteran , will be the new acting director of the agency 's exempt organizations division . Corbin currently is a deputy director in the wage and investment division , where he oversees 17,000 workers responsible for processing 172 million individual and business tax returns , Werfel said .
Werfel 's email Thursday made no mention of Lerner . But congressional aides who were briefed on the matter confirmed that Lerner was placed on paid administrative leave . The aides spoke on condition of anonymity because a personnel matter was involved .
`` From all accounts so far , the IRS acting commissioner was on solid ground to ask for her resignation , '' Grassley said in a statement . `` The IRS owes it to taxpayers to resolve her situation quickly . The agency needs to move on to fix the conditions that led to the targeting debacle . She should n't be in limbo indefinitely on the taxpayers ' dime . ''
Lerner 's lawyer , William W. Taylor III , did not immediately respond to requests for comment .
Lerner is the IRS official who first publicly disclosed on May 10 that IRS agents had been targeting tea party and other conservative groups for additional scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status . At the time she apologized on behalf of the IRS , but it was n't enough to stop a firestorm of criticism from the White House and Congress .
If Lerner , a career civil servant , is dismissed she would become the third IRS official to lose their job in the scandal . Last week , President Barack Obama forced acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller to resign , replacing him with Werfel , a former White House budget official who started at the IRS on Wednesday .
Also last week , Joseph Grant , one of Miller 's top deputies , announced plans to retire June 3 , according to an internal IRS memo . Grant had just been named commissioner of the agency 's tax exempt and government entities division , which includes the agents that targeted tea party groups . Grant had been the acting head of the division since 2010 .
Lerner provided one of the most electric moments since the controversy erupted when she unwaveringly — but briefly — defended herself before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday .
`` I have not done anything wrong , '' she told the committee , reading from a written statement . `` I have not broken any laws , I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations , and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee . ''
Then , she refused to answer lawmakers ' questions , invoking her constitutional right against self-incrimination . A few minutes later , she was excused . As she boarded an elevator , several of the men who escorted her briefly jostled with TV camera operators who were trying to film her .
Lerner learned in June 2011 that agents were singling out groups with `` Tea Party '' and `` Patriots '' in their applications for tax-exempt status , according to a report by the agency 's inspector general . Lerner ordered agents to scrap the criteria immediately , but later they evolved to include groups that promoted the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
It finally stopped in May 2012 , when top agency officials say they found out and ordered agents to adopt appropriate criteria for determining whether tax-exempt groups were overly political .
Former IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman told two congressional committees this week that he first learned in the spring of 2012 that conservative groups had been improperly singled out for additional scrutiny . However , after learning that the practice had stopped and that the inspector general was investigating , Shulman said he did n't tell anyone in the Treasury Department or the White House about it . The IRS is part of the Treasury Department .
Shulman , who was appointed by President George W. Bush , left office in November , when his five-year term expired .
On Thursday , the two leaders of the Senate Investigations subcommittee accused Lerner of misleading committee staff just a few days before it she made the controversy public .
Subcommittee Chairman Carl Levin , D-Mich. , and the top Republican member , Arizona Sen. John McCain , called on the IRS to immediately suspend Lois Lerner from her job as director of the IRS division that handles applications for tax-exempt status .
On April 30 , committee staff interviewed Lerner and seven of her colleagues for six hours , the senators said in a letter to Werfel .
`` That interview covered , among other topics , how the IRS determines which groups to review , what actions are taken in connection with the IRS reviews , and how the laws and regulations are used to examine those groups , '' the senators wrote . `` Ms. Lerner failed to disclose the internal controversy . ''
Lerner , 62 , is an attorney who joined the IRS in 2001 . In her brief appearance Wednesday , she expressed pride in her 34-year career in federal government , which has included work at the Justice Department and Federal Election Commission . AT the IRS , she oversaw 900 workers and a budget approaching $ 100 million .
Corbin , the new acting director of exempt organizations , began his IRS career in Atlanta in 1986 , Werfel said .
`` Ken is a proven leader during challenging times . He has strong management experience inside the IRShandling a wide range of processing issues and compliance topics as well as taxpayer service areas , '' Werfel said . `` Combined with his track record of leading large work groups , these skills make him an ideal choice to help lead the Exempt Organizations area through this difficult period .

It also recalls one of the largest failures of President Obama 's presidency : His unfulfilled promise as a candidate in 2008 to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay .
As Osama bin Laden 's son-in-law , Sulaiman Abu Ghaith , pleaded not guilty to conspiring to kill Americans in New York Federal Court today , Republicans in Congress were criticizing the Obama administration for prosecuting a suspected al Qaeda terrorist in a civilian court just about a mile from the 9/11 memorial built over Ground Zero .
`` Abu Ghaith has sworn to kill Americans and he likely possesses information that could prevent harm to America and its allies , '' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , wrote in a statement . `` He is an enemy combatant and should be held in military custody . ''
The White House claimed there was a `` broad consensus '' across the federal government , from the Department of Defense , the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security , to prosecute OBL 's son-in-law in civilian court .
`` The intelligence community agrees that the best way to protect our national security interests is to prosecute Abu Ghaith in an Article III court , '' Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters today .
`` We 're able to question him as a part of the regular process in detaining individuals like this , but we 're also able to put him through Article III courts to ensure that he 's held accountable for his crimes , '' Earnest added . `` This is somebody who 's going to be held accountable for his crimes and … that will be done in accordance with the laws and values of this country , and it will be done so in a pretty efficient way . ''
Still , McConnell said that the administration 's justification `` makes little sense '' and the intelligence community `` deserve [ s ] the same access to intelligence and methods of defeating the enemy available to the team that found Bin Laden . ''
`` At Guantanamo , [ Abu Ghaith ] could be held as a detainee and fulsomely and continuously interrogated without having to overcome the objections of his civilian lawyers , '' McConnell said .
Rep. Mike Rogers , R-Mich. , the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , said civilian court `` is not the appropriate venue '' and the administration `` should treat enemy combatants like the enemy . ''
`` Al Qaeda leaders captured on the battlefield should not be brought to the United States to stand trial , '' Rogers said . `` The president needs to send any captured al Qaeda members to Guantanamo . ''
A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner , who opposes closing Guantanamo and previously fought against efforts by the Obama administration to prosecute 9/11 suspects in New York City , said the speaker `` agrees '' with Rogers .
New York Republican Rep. Pete King , R-N.Y. , said he preferred that Abu Ghaith face trial in a military tribunal rather than civilian court , and he questioned what type of standard today 's hearing could set .
`` While a federal court trial of Abu Ghaith in lower Manhattan would not present the same security issues as a trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , I strongly believe as a matter of policy that military tribunals are the proper venue for enemy combatants , '' said King , a member of the House committees on Intelligence and Homeland Security . `` If the Abu Ghaith trial does go forward in federal court , it must not be used as a precedent for future enemy combatants who should be tried at Guantanamo . ''
But not all members of Congress oppose the administration 's actions .
New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler , who represents the congressional district where Ground Zero is located in lower Manhattan , said he is `` pleased Sulaiman Abu Ghaith will have to face justice in New York . ''
`` I have long urged that we try terrorists in our civilian courts under the laws of the United States . We have done so successfully in the past , and we must continue to do so , '' Nadler , D-N.Y. , said in a statement . `` We are a nation committed to the rule of law , and we will demonstrate our values to the world even in the face of the most despicable mass murder in our history .

""While a federal court trial of Abu Ghaith in lower Manhattan would not present the same security issues as a trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, I strongly believe as a matter of policy that military tribunals are the proper venue for enemy combatants,"" said King, a member of the House committees on Intelligence and Homeland Security. ""If the Abu Ghaith trial does go forward in federal court, it must not be used as a precedent for future enemy combatants who should be tried at Guantanamo.""

But not all members of Congress oppose the administration's actions.

New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler, who represents the congressional district where Ground Zero is located in lower Manhattan, said he is ""pleased Sulaiman Abu Ghaith will have to face justice in New York.""

""I have long urged that we try terrorists in our civilian courts under the laws of the United States. We have done so successfully in the past, and we must continue to do so,"" Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a statement. ""We are a nation committed to the rule of law, and we will demonstrate our values to the world even in the face of the most despicable mass murder in our history.""",www.abcnews.go.com,left,vuRsPPMRibA8tpJR

Trump's attorney general pick on key issues,,,"The US Senate has confirmed William Barr as attorney general , puttingthe longtime lawyer atop the Justice Department and putting him in charge of overseeing Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's long-running probe of whether President Donald Trump 's 2016 campaign colluded with Russia .
Trump announced he would nominate Barr , 68 , in December 2018 , after Jeff Sessions resigned at Trump 's request in November .
The Senate voted 54 to 45 , largely along party lines . A Justice Department spokeswoman said Barr will be sworn in on Thursday afternoon in the Oval Office of the White House by Chief Justice John Roberts .
Many Democrats opposed Barr out of concern he might not make Mueller 's findings fully public . But the Senate is controlled by Trump 's fellow Republicans , so Barr 's confirmation was virtually assured .
`` Today is a great day for the Department of Justice with the confirmation of William Barr to be the next Attorney General , '' said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham .
`` He is a steady hand at a time of turmoil and he will bring much-needed reform to the Department of Justice . ''
He previously held the position under George HW Bush between 1991 and 1993 .
Before that , he briefly served in the CIA in the early 1970s and served as domestic policy staff from 1982 to 1983 , while Republican Ronald Reagan was president .
So , where does Barr stand on some of the most important issues in the United States ?
During a Senate hearing on Tuesday , Democratic Senator Corey Booker questioned Barr about his past claims that there is `` no statistical evidence '' of racial disparity in the US criminal justice system .
Although Barr backtracked on those comments , Booker pointed out that Barr , as attorney general in 1992 , signed off on a report titled The Case for More Incarceration .
During a 1992 interview , Barr also said he did not believe the US justice system treats `` people differently '' based on their race .
`` That is , if a black and a white are charged with the same offence , generally they will get the same treatment in the system , and ultimately the same penalty , '' Barr said at the time .
Decades of studies , however , have generally agreed that African Americans are disproportionately imprisoned in the US .
At the end of Booker and Barr 's exchange this week , the nominee admitted that African Americans are jailed at inflated rates , but suggested that , `` I think the reduction in crime has [ benefit the black community ] since 1992 , but I think that the heavy drug penalties , especially on crack and other things , have harmed the black community , the incarceration rates . ''
Since coming to office , Trump has launched repeated attacks on the press at large and many journalists , describing media as `` the enemy of the people '' .
Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions appeared willing to put some of Trump 's views on the press into practice by suggesting that the Department of Justice would increase its efforts to track down leakers and whistleblowers .
Sessions had also talked of readjusting rules for issuing subpoenas to journalists .
While pressed on the issue of media freedom on Tuesday , Barr did not appear to present a radical break from Sessions or Trump .
`` If you 're confirmed , will the Justice Department jail reporters for doing their jobs ? '' Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar asked .
Barr replied by saying jailing journalists would be a `` last resort '' .
`` I know there are guidelines in place , and I can conceive of situations where , as a last resort , '' Barr replied , `` and where a news organisation has run through a red flag or something like that , knows that they 're putting out stuff that will hurt the country , there could be a situation where someone would be held in contempt . ''
Barr 's hardline record on immigration differs little from the Trump administration 's anti-immigration agenda .
On Tuesday , Barr defended Trump 's call for a wall on the US-Mexico border , an issue that led to a partial government shutdown , now in its 26th day .
Barr also condemned sanctuary cities , baselessly claiming that they encouraged migrants to travel to the US .
Arguing that most asylum seekers fail to obtain that status , Barr said it would be better to block them from entering the country at all .
During his tenure as attorney general under George HW Bush , Barr oversaw an effort to strictly enforce immigration restrictions .
If confirmed , Barr could become an important ally for Trump at a time when he seeks to radically decrease immigration and erect a wall on the US-Mexico border .
Barr also expressed his support for Trump 's attempts to ban travellers for several Muslim-majority countries .
If confirmed , Barr would be in charge of Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation into Russia 's interference in the 2016 election and any possible collusion between Moscow and Trump 's campaign .
Trump frequently criticises the Mueller probe as a `` witch-hunt '' and has denied any collusion with Russia or obstruction of justice . Russia has denied US intelligence agencies ' findings that it interfered in the 2016 election .
During his confirmation hearings , Barr said that on his watch , `` Bob will be allowed to complete his work . ''
Democrats worry that Trump 's administration may try to undercut the investigation .
Barr said he does n't believe Mueller `` would be involved in a witch-hunt '' , adding that it was `` unimaginable '' that the special counsel would do anything in the investigation that would justify reeling it in or shutting it down .
Barr said he agreed with Mueller 's charge that Russian entities interfered in the election , or at least tried to do so . He said he described Mueller , a longtime friend , as a `` straight shooter '' when Trump asked about him .
Mueller is due to submit a final report to the attorney general , prompting concern from some Democrats that the Trump administration will try to quash his findings . Barr said he would not let Trump modify the report and would make public as many of Mueller 's findings as possible .
Barr faced tough questions from Democrats about an unsolicited , 19-page memo he wrote last year that called Mueller 's probe `` fatally misconceived '' for examining whether Trump obstructed justice by firing FBI Director James Comey in 2017 .
`` It does raise questions about your willingness to reach conclusions before knowing the facts , and whether you prejudge the Mueller investigation , '' said Senator Dianne Feinstein , the Judiciary Committee 's top Democrat .
Barr said his memo did not question the legitimacy of the probe as a whole , but only expressed concerns that the special counsel might be improperly interpreting one aspect of the law .
`` I think it was entirely proper , '' he said of the memo , saying it was not unusual for former Justice Department officials to share their views of legal matters .
He said he had written a similar memo criticising the department 's corruption case against Democratic Senator Bob Menendez , which ended in a mistrial in 2017 .
Barr 's views of presidential power could be important as prosecutors and Democrats in the House of Representatives , where they hold the majority , intensify investigations of Trump 's personal business practices and his presidency .
The nominee said during his hearings that a president does have the power to pardon a family member , but that the power could not be abused .
`` Yes , he does have the power to pardon a family member , but he would then have to face the fact that he could be held accountable for abusing his power , '' he said . `` Or , if it was connected to some act that violates an obstruction statute , it could be an obstruction , '' Barr added .
According to Martha Kinsella , counsel in the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center , Barr `` has a history of involvement with controversial pardons '' .
`` For example , Barr advised President George HW Bush to pardon six Reagan officials who were involved in the Iran-Contra affair , without consulting the pardon attorney .

`` You know , for 40 years the position of the executive branch has been you ca n't indict a sitting president , '' Barr says . `` I see no reason to change them . ''
Barr also pledged to support and uphold the False Claims Act , a law that lets whistleblowers file lawsuits to help the federal government recover losses due to fraud .

So, where does Barr stand on some of the most important issues in the United States?

Racism in criminal justice

During a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Democratic Senator Corey Booker questioned Barr about his past claims that there is ""no statistical evidence"" of racial disparity in the US criminal justice system.

Although Barr backtracked on those comments, Booker pointed out that Barr, as attorney general in 1992, signed off on a report titled The Case for More Incarceration.

During a 1992 interview, Barr also said he did not believe the US justice system treats ""people differently"" based on their race.

""That is, if a black and a white are charged with the same offence, generally they will get the same treatment in the system, and ultimately the same penalty,"" Barr said at the time.

Decades of studies, however, have generally agreed that African Americans are disproportionately imprisoned in the US.

At the end of Booker and Barr's exchange this week, the nominee admitted that African Americans are jailed at inflated rates, but suggested that, ""I think the reduction in crime has [benefit the black community] since 1992, but I think that the heavy drug penalties, especially on crack and other things, have harmed the black community, the incarceration rates.""

Freedom of the press

Since coming to office, Trump has launched repeated attacks on the press at large and many journalists, describing media as ""the enemy of the people"".

Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions appeared willing to put some of Trump's views on the press into practice by suggesting that the Department of Justice would increase its efforts to track down leakers and whistleblowers.

Sessions had also talked of readjusting rules for issuing subpoenas to journalists.

While pressed on the issue of media freedom on Tuesday, Barr did not appear to present a radical break from Sessions or Trump.

""If you're confirmed, will the Justice Department jail reporters for doing their jobs?"" Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar asked.

Barr replied by saying jailing journalists would be a ""last resort"".

""I know there are guidelines in place, and I can conceive of situations where, as a last resort,"" Barr replied, ""and where a news organisation has run through a red flag or something like that, knows that they're putting out stuff that will hurt the country, there could be a situation where someone would be held in contempt.""

Immigration

Barr's hardline record on immigration differs little from the Trump administration's anti-immigration agenda.

On Tuesday, Barr defended Trump's call for a wall on the US-Mexico border, an issue that led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 26th day.

Barr also condemned sanctuary cities, baselessly claiming that they encouraged migrants to travel to the US.

Arguing that most asylum seekers fail to obtain that status, Barr said it would be better to block them from entering the country at all.

During his tenure as attorney general under George HW Bush, Barr oversaw an effort to strictly enforce immigration restrictions.

If confirmed, Barr could become an important ally for Trump at a time when he seeks to radically decrease immigration and erect a wall on the US-Mexico border.

Barr also expressed his support for Trump's attempts to ban travellers for several Muslim-majority countries.

Mueller probe

If confirmed, Barr would be in charge of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election and any possible collusion between Moscow and Trump's campaign.

Trump frequently criticises the Mueller probe as a ""witch-hunt"" and has denied any collusion with Russia or obstruction of justice. Russia has denied US intelligence agencies' findings that it interfered in the 2016 election.

During his confirmation hearings, Barr said that on his watch, ""Bob will be allowed to complete his work.""

He said he had written a similar memo criticising the department's corruption case against Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, which ended in a mistrial in 2017.

Presidential powers

Barr's views of presidential power could be important as prosecutors and Democrats in the House of Representatives, where they hold the majority, intensify investigations of Trump's personal business practices and his presidency.

The nominee said during his hearings that a president does have the power to pardon a family member, but that the power could not be abused.

""Yes, he does have the power to pardon a family member, but he would then have to face the fact that he could be held accountable for abusing his power,"" he said. ""Or, if it was connected to some act that violates an obstruction statute, it could be an obstruction,"" Barr added.

(CNN) - The Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee is looking into whether Attorney General Eric Holder lied under oath earlier this month when he said he wasn't involved in the ""potential prosecution of the press,"" two Republican committee sources confirmed Tuesday.

Though he testified in a May 15 Congressional hearing that he's ""never heard of"" the press being potentially charged for obtaining leaked material, it has since been reported that he signed off on the Justice Department's decision to seek a search warrant in 2010 for Fox News reporter James Rosen's private e-mails as part of a leak probe.



Holder's testimony this month came amid criticism of the Justice Department's investigation of Associated Press phone records as part of alleged leaks by government officials.

Republicans are homing in on when the White House first knew the IRS was inappropriately singling out conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status for extra scrutiny. Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller was grilled at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing on Friday about whether he told the White House or the Treasury about the program.

Miller said he hadn’t and announced earlier this week that he plans to resign.

Lew also defended Sarah Hall Ingram, a commissioner who has been targeted by Republicans for formerly overseeing the tax exempt division before heading to her current post helping the agency implement the health care law.

Ingram, Lew said, was not involved in the targeting program.

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — President Donald Trump ’ s former lawyer and longtime fixer Michael Cohen will be released from federal prison to serve the remainder of his sentence in home confinement because of the coronavirus pandemic .
Cohen is currently locked up at FCI Otisville in New York after pleading guilty to numerous charges , including campaign finance fraud and lying to Congress . He will remain under quarantine for 14 days before he is released . Federal statistics show 14 inmates and seven staff members at the prison have tested positive for the coronavirus .
After he is released , Cohen will serve the remainder of his sentence at home , according to a Justice Department official and another person familiar with the matter . They could not discuss Cohen ’ s release publicly and spoke to The ███ on condition of anonymity .
Prison advocates and congressional leaders have been pressing the Justice Department for weeks to release at-risk inmates ahead of a potential outbreak , arguing that the public health guidance to stay 6 feet ( 1.8 meters ) away from other people is nearly impossible behind bars .
Attorney General William Barr ordered the Bureau of Prisons earlier this month to increase the use of home confinement and expedite the release of eligible high-risk inmates , beginning at three prisons identified as coronavirus hot spots . Otisville is not one of those facilities .
As of Thursday , 473 federal inmates and 279 Bureau of Prisons staff members had tested positive for the coronavirus at facilities across the U.S. Eighteen inmates have died since late March .
Many federal inmates have been seeking home confinement as the number of coronavirus cases grows in the federal prison system , but advocates have accused the Bureau of Prisons of moving too slowly to release inmates . The Bureau of Prisons said it had moved more than 1,000 inmates to home confinement since March 26 , when Barr first issued a directive to increase its use in late March . The agency said it is a “ tremendous logistical lift that was accomplished through the marshaling of all of BOP ’ s resources . ”
The Justice Department official said Barr had told senior officials at the Bureau of Prisons when he first issued his directives that they must scrupulously apply the same criteria to all inmates and not give anyone special treatment .
A federal judge had denied Cohen ’ s attempt for an early release to home confinement after serving 10 months in prison and said in a ruling earlier this month that it “ appears to be just another effort to inject himself into the news cycle. ” But the Bureau of Prisons can take action to move him to home confinement without a judicial order .
Cohen , 53 , began serving his sentence last May and was scheduled to be released from prison in November 2021 .
Other high-profile inmates have also been released as the number of coronavirus cases soars . Last week , a judge ordered Michael Avenatti — the attorney who rose to fame representing porn star Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against Trump — to be temporarily freed from a federal jail in New York City and stay at a friend ’ s house in Los Angeles . Avenatti had said he was at high risk of getting the coronavirus because he had a recent bout with pneumonia and his cellmate at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan was removed due to flu-like symptoms .
Former New York state Senate leader Dean Skelos , 72 , who was also serving a sentence at Otisville , is also expected to be released soon from prison to home confinement after testing positive for the coronavirus , prosecutors told a judge Wednesday .
CNN first reported Cohen was being released to home confinement .
A spokesman for the U.S. attorney ’ s office in Manhattan declined to comment .","FILE - In this May 6, 2019, file photo, Michael Cohen, former attorney to President Donald Trump, leaves his apartment building before beginning his prison term in New York.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s former lawyer and longtime fixer Michael Cohen will be released from federal prison to serve the remainder of his sentence in home confinement because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Cohen is currently locked up at FCI Otisville in New York after pleading guilty to numerous charges, including campaign finance fraud and lying to Congress. He will remain under quarantine for 14 days before he is released. Federal statistics show 14 inmates and seven staff members at the prison have tested positive for the coronavirus.

After he is released, Cohen will serve the remainder of his sentence at home, according to a Justice Department official and another person familiar with the matter. They could not discuss Cohen’s release publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

Prison advocates and congressional leaders have been pressing the Justice Department for weeks to release at-risk inmates ahead of a potential outbreak, arguing that the public health guidance to stay 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from other people is nearly impossible behind bars.

Attorney General William Barr ordered the Bureau of Prisons earlier this month to increase the use of home confinement and expedite the release of eligible high-risk inmates, beginning at three prisons identified as coronavirus hot spots. Otisville is not one of those facilities.

As of Thursday, 473 federal inmates and 279 Bureau of Prisons staff members had tested positive for the coronavirus at facilities across the U.S. Eighteen inmates have died since late March.

Many federal inmates have been seeking home confinement as the number of coronavirus cases grows in the federal prison system, but advocates have accused the Bureau of Prisons of moving too slowly to release inmates. The Bureau of Prisons said it had moved more than 1,000 inmates to home confinement since March 26, when Barr first issued a directive to increase its use in late March. The agency said it is a “tremendous logistical lift that was accomplished through the marshaling of all of BOP’s resources.”

The Justice Department official said Barr had told senior officials at the Bureau of Prisons when he first issued his directives that they must scrupulously apply the same criteria to all inmates and not give anyone special treatment.

A federal judge had denied Cohen’s attempt for an early release to home confinement after serving 10 months in prison and said in a ruling earlier this month that it “appears to be just another effort to inject himself into the news cycle.” But the Bureau of Prisons can take action to move him to home confinement without a judicial order.

Cohen, 53, began serving his sentence last May and was scheduled to be released from prison in November 2021.

Other high-profile inmates have also been released as the number of coronavirus cases soars. Last week, a judge ordered Michael Avenatti — the attorney who rose to fame representing porn star Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against Trump — to be temporarily freed from a federal jail in New York City and stay at a friend’s house in Los Angeles. Avenatti had said he was at high risk of getting the coronavirus because he had a recent bout with pneumonia and his cellmate at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan was removed due to flu-like symptoms.

Former New York state Senate leader Dean Skelos, 72, who was also serving a sentence at Otisville, is also expected to be released soon from prison to home confinement after testing positive for the coronavirus, prosecutors told a judge Wednesday.

CNN first reported Cohen was being released to home confinement.

A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan declined to comment.

Sulaiman Abu Ghaith was hit with the charges in an indictment unsealed by the Justice Department late Thursday . The terror suspect 's capture and prosecution in federal court -- all of which was first revealed to the public Thursday -- caught lawmakers by surprise .
Republican Sens . Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte , said Thursday the Obama administration 's decision to bring Abu Ghaith to court in New York City is wrong , `` sneaky '' and against the will of Congress . While foes of using Guantanamo to hold suspects say detainees there are afforded fewer legal rights , supporters say they can yield more information while held in the military facility .
Graham says Abu Ghaith is clearly an enemy combatant and should have been sent straight to the Guantanamo Bay detainee facility for extended questioning .
`` The Obama administration ’ s lack of a war-time detention policy for foreign members of al Qaeda , as well as its refusal to detain and interrogate these individuals at Guantanamo , makes our nation less safe , '' Graham and Ayotte said in a joint written statement . “ We are at war with Al Qaeda and its affiliated groups , and America ’ s detention policy must reflect that reality . ''
On Friday , Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell also questioned whether the U.S. was losing valuable intelligence by going through the civilian court system .
`` From public reports it is clear that Abu Ghaith possesses valuable knowledge of al Qaeda 's activities within Iran . Abu Ghaith has sworn to kill Americans , and he likely possesses information that could prevent harm to America and its allies . He is an enemy combatant and should be held in military custody , '' he said .
But the White House argues that the civilian courts are a more effective avenue for justice .
`` Article 3 courts have shown that they are , in many ways , a more efficient way for us to deliver justice to those who seek to harm the United States of America and that is the consensus view of the president 's national security team and of agencies all across the federal government -- that this is the best way to handle bringing Abu Ghaith to justice , '' Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Friday .
Fox News has learned that the suspect was arrested Feb. 28 overseas and arrived March 1 . His next court appearance is set for April 8 . He has at least three court-appointed lawyers ; he does not have the resources to pay for them .
The case reflects the Obama administration priority of prosecuting terror suspects in U.S. federal courts instead of holding them at Guantanamo Bay , which the administration has so far been unable to close .
The capture of Abu Ghaith drew praise from Republican Rep. Peter King of New York , the former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee , who called it a `` very significant victory '' in U.S. efforts against Al Qaeda .
The Justice Department touted the capture of Abu Ghaith as significant .
`` It has been 13 years since Abu Ghaith allegedly worked alongside Usama Bin Laden in his campaign of terror , and 13 years since he allegedly took to the public airwaves , exhorting others to embrace Al Qaeda 's cause and warning of more terrorist attacks like the mass murder of 9/11 , '' U.S. Attorney Bharara said in a news release announcing Abu Ghaith 's arrest . `` The memory of those attacks is indelibly etched on the American psyche , and today 's action is the latest example of our commitment to capturing and punishing enemies of the United States , no matter how long it takes . ''
Attorney General Eric Holder added , `` No amount of distance or time will weaken our resolve to bring America 's enemies to justice . ''
Abu Ghaith became an international name in late 2001 when he appeared on pan-Arab satellite television urging Muslims everywhere to fight the United States and warning of more attacks similar to those of Sept. 11 .
In one video , he was sitting with bin Laden in front of a rock face in Afghanistan . A teacher and mosque preacher in Kuwait , he was stripped of his Kuwaiti citizenship after 9/11 .
He is identified as a major Al Qaeda core official by the New America Foundation think tank in Washington . King said Abu Ghaith was involved in the planning in the 9/11 attacks against the World Trade Center and Pentagon .
`` Definitely , one by one , we are getting the top echelons of Al Qaeda , '' King said . `` I give the ( Obama ) administration credit for this : It 's steady and it 's unrelenting and it 's very successful . ''
Attorney Michael Rosensaft , who was a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney 's office in Manhattan until last fall and is now in private practice , predicted the trial will last months , if not years , and that some of the evidence against Abu Ghaith will be a challenge for prosecutors to bring to court if it is classified .
Abu Ghaith 's trial will make one of the few prosecutions of senior Al Qaeda leaders on U.S. soil . Charging foreign terror suspects in American federal courts was a top pledge by President Obama shortly after he took office in 2009 -- aimed , in part , to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
`` The propaganda statements in which Abu Ghaith and his late father-in-law , Usama bin Laden , praised the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 are alone enough to merit the most serious punishment , '' King said
The Obama administration 's attempts to move many of the detainees held at Guantanamo into facilities in the United States to stand trial domestically were halted during Obama 's first term after Congress passed a measure with bipartisan majorities opposing such transfers .","A top Al Qaeda spokesman, who is the son-in-law of Usama bin Laden, pleaded not guilty Friday in federal court to charges of conspiracy to kill Americans, touching off what could be lengthy legal proceedings as Republicans complained that such terror suspects don't belong in the civilian judicial system.

""The memory of those attacks is indelibly etched on the American psyche, and today's action is the latest example of our commitment to capturing and punishing enemies of the United States, no matter how long it takes.""

Attorney General Eric Holder added, ""No amount of distance or time will weaken our resolve to bring America's enemies to justice.""

Abu Ghaith became an international name in late 2001 when he appeared on pan-Arab satellite television urging Muslims everywhere to fight the United States and warning of more attacks similar to those of Sept. 11.

In one video, he was sitting with bin Laden in front of a rock face in Afghanistan. A teacher and mosque preacher in Kuwait, he was stripped of his Kuwaiti citizenship after 9/11.

He is identified as a major Al Qaeda core official by the New America Foundation think tank in Washington. King said Abu Ghaith was involved in the planning in the 9/11 attacks against the World Trade Center and Pentagon.

""Definitely, one by one, we are getting the top echelons of Al Qaeda,"" King said. ""I give the (Obama) administration credit for this: It's steady and it's unrelenting and it's very successful.""

Attorney Michael Rosensaft, who was a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan until last fall and is now in private practice, predicted the trial will last months, if not years, and that some of the evidence against Abu Ghaith will be a challenge for prosecutors to bring to court if it is classified.

Abu Ghaith's trial will make one of the few prosecutions of senior Al Qaeda leaders on U.S. soil. Charging foreign terror suspects in American federal courts was a top pledge by President Obama shortly after he took office in 2009 -- aimed, in part, to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

""The propaganda statements in which Abu Ghaith and his late father-in-law, Usama bin Laden, praised the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 are alone enough to merit the most serious punishment,"" King said

The Obama administration's attempts to move many of the detainees held at Guantanamo into facilities in the United States to stand trial domestically were halted during Obama's first term after Congress passed a measure with bipartisan majorities opposing such transfers.

Mccarthy, John Mccormack, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Mairead Mcardle, Robert Verbruggen, Carrie Severino, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry, John Fund","From his interview in the Wall Street Journal , you would never know that his tenure at the Justice Department has been fraught with controversy .
Well , did you think Rod Rosenstein was going to say , “ You got me . The Mueller probe was inappropriate and politicized ? ”
No , you didn ’ t . And the deputy attorney general did not disappoint . In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday , Rosenstein defended the investigation as “ appropriate and independent . ”
The Journal ’ s Sadie Gurman observes that this assessment contrasts sharply with President Trump ’ s description of the investigation as “ rigged ” and a “ witch hunt. ” In an obvious sense , this is not much of a point . Not only did Rosenstein appoint Robert Mueller in May 2017 ; the special counsel answers to Rosenstein in the Justice Department ’ s chain of command . If the probe is a rigged witch hunt , then Rosenstein is the ultimate culprit . Who would expect him to cop to such a thing even if it were true ?
Still , there is also a sense in which Rosenstein ’ s defense of the investigation resonates . For all of the president ’ s Twitter tantrums about how the investigation is supposedly “ rigged , ” Mueller has never alleged that the Trump campaign was complicit in Russia ’ s election meddling .
This is not for lack of thoroughness on the prosecutor ’ s part . Mueller has brought two sweeping indictments against Russian operatives . Rosenstein made these charges a point of emphasis in the interview . It is noteworthy , then , that these narrative “ speaking indictments ” appear to preclude the possibility of a conspiratorial relationship between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign . They indicate that Russia was conducting influence operations before Trump entered the campaign , that it orchestrated some against Trump , and that it wanted deniability .
Clearly , Rosenstein has been fixed on something often ignored by the president : Trump would benefit from being exonerated after a searching investigation by Mueller .
Of course , the fact that things may turn out that way does not mean that was the game plan all along .

From his interview in the Wall Street Journal, you would never know that his tenure at the Justice Department has been fraught with controversy.

Well, did you think Rod Rosenstein was going to say, “You got me. The Mueller probe was inappropriate and politicized?”

No, you didn’t. And the deputy attorney general did not disappoint. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, Rosenstein defended the investigation as “appropriate and independent.”

The Journal’s Sadie Gurman observes that this assessment contrasts sharply with President Trump’s description of the investigation as “rigged” and a “witch hunt.” In an obvious sense, this is not much of a point. Not only did Rosenstein appoint Robert Mueller in May 2017; the special counsel answers to Rosenstein in the Justice Department’s chain of command. If the probe is a rigged witch hunt, then Rosenstein is the ultimate culprit. Who would expect him to cop to such a thing even if it were true?

Still, there is also a sense in which Rosenstein’s defense of the investigation resonates. For all of the president’s Twitter tantrums about how the investigation is supposedly “rigged,” Mueller has never alleged that the Trump campaign was complicit in Russia’s election meddling.

This is not for lack of thoroughness on the prosecutor’s part. Mueller has brought two sweeping indictments against Russian operatives. Rosenstein made these charges a point of emphasis in the interview. It is noteworthy, then, that these narrative “speaking indictments” appear to preclude the possibility of a conspiratorial relationship between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign. They indicate that Russia was conducting influence operations before Trump entered the campaign, that it orchestrated some against Trump, and that it wanted deniability.

Clearly, Rosenstein has been fixed on something often ignored by the president: Trump would benefit from being exonerated after a searching investigation by Mueller.

Of course, the fact that things may turn out that way does not mean that was the game plan all along.

Rosenstein brought Mueller in to help Rosenstein, not Trump. The deputy attorney general was under withering attack by Democrats after the firing of FBI director James Comey and the administration’s multiple, conflicting explanations for it. He appointed Mueller at the end of a frenetic week in which, reportedly distraught, he discussed the possibility of covertly recording Trump at meetings to demonstrate the latter’s instability.

The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Thursday that the administration ’ s threat to withhold public safety grants based on federal immigration policy was an overstep in its authority .
Chicago , a city that refuses to cooperate with federal immigration agents , sued the administration in 2017 when it first tried to make the funds contingent on adhering to immigration policy .
The Trump administration can not withhold grant money from cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities , an appeals court ruled Thursday .
President Donald Trump ’ s threat to withhold public safety grants from jurisdictions that don ’ t cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) , otherwise known as “ sanctuary cities , ” violates the Constitution ’ s separation-of-powers provisions , the 7th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals ruled . The decision was the latest in the ongoing court battle between the Trump administration and the city of Chicago .
The executive branch ’ s authority on immigration policy does not include withholding funds from cities that were allocated from the legislative branch , the appeals court found .
“ Such a concentration of power would allow tyranny to flourish , and our system of government is wisely set up by the Founders to foreclose such a danger , ” wrote Judge Ilana Rovner , writing on behalf of the three-judge panel , in a 95-page ruling .
“ The separation of powers is a foundation of our government , not a formality to be swept aside on the path to achieving goals that the executive branch deems worthy , ” Rovner continued . “ Rather than an exercise of authority granted to it by the legislature , the conditions imposed here are an executive usurpation of the power of the purse . ”
The court battle dates back to 2017 , when the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) moved to withhold Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants from Chicago — a city that for years has refused to honor ICE detainer requests , share information , or otherwise cooperate with immigration agents . Then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel sued the DOJ in response . ( RELATED : ‘ Worst Sanctuary City In America ’ : Trump Rips Chicago For Refusing To Cooperate With ICE )

Robert Bork, who was at the center of Senate hearings that ""marked the modern battle lines over judicial nominations,"" as NPR's Nina Totenberg has said, is dead, according to The New York Times, Fox News and The Associated Press.

Bork, a hero to conservatives, was 85. His family has told those news outlets of his death. The Washington Post adds that Bork died ""of complications from heart disease"" at Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington, Va. It confirmed Bork's death with a daughter-in-law, Diana Culp Bork.

As the Post says, ""for decades, decades, Judge Bork was a major architect of the conservative rebuttal to what he considered liberal judicial activism.""

Federal prosecutors warned they were diverting resources from drug-smuggling cases in southern California to handle the flood of immigration charges brought on by the Trump administration’s border crackdown, records obtained by USA TODAY show.

Days after Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed prosecutors to bring charges against anyone who enters the United States illegally, a Justice Department supervisor in San Diego sent an email to border authorities warning that immigration cases “will occupy substantially more of our resources.” He wrote that the U.S. Attorney’s Office there was “diverting staff, both support and attorneys, accordingly.”

The email, sent by the lawyer who runs the office’s major crimes unit, said prosecutors needed to streamline their work on smuggling cases. He said that would mean tight deadlines – sometimes just a few hours to produce reports and recordings – for those that would land in federal court. Going forward, the lawyer, Fred Sheppard, warned, if agents can’t meet that high bar, “the case will be declined.”

Sessions last month ordered federal prosecutors along the southwest border to bring criminal charges against every adult caught entering the United States illegally, a “zero tolerance” push meant to deter migrants. Those cases typically are seldom more than symbolic — most of the people who are charged are sentenced to no additional jail time and a $10 fee — but they have served as the legal basis for separating thousands of children from their parents at the border.

The border crackdown has produced a high-speed assembly line of minor cases in federal courts from California to Texas, more than doubling the caseloads there. This month alone, USA TODAY identified more than 4,100 migrants who were charged with minor crimes after crossing into the United States from Mexico.

He wrote that the change was meant to “streamline” smuggling cases so that prosecutors could resolve immigration cases more quickly.

The policy applies only to southern California.

Donald Trump Jr. slammed Biden's gaffe on Twitter claiming that somebody needed to tell him when 'enough is 'enough' and that 'it's not right anymore'.

'In all fairness Biden has no idea what he's saying or where he is most of the time. When will someone close to him finally say enough is enough? It's not right anymore,' he wrote.

During Thursday's town hall event, Biden was asked a question by a member of the audience on 'How will you restore the barriers between the Department of Justice and the Oval Office?'

'Never direct the Justice Department as to who they should or should not indict and under what circumstances they should or should not,' Biden began.

'That is an independent judgment to be made.

'My son, the one who, my deceased son, was the Attorney General of the United States,' he continued, without realizing his mistake, 'and before that, he was a federal prosecutor in one of the largest offices in the country in Philadelphia.

'And I'll tell you what, he wouldn't even talk to me about anything he was doing, his father, and he shouldn't have, and I didn't have any control over either one of those things.'

One of the recently unsealed documents , a Dec. 1 opinion by Judge Allegra , finally explains why in October the judge voided his original decision , made in August , to award Dobyns $ 173,000 . ( He later reversed his decision to void the judgment , which still stands . ) The reason : The judge believed that Justice Department attorneys had “ committed fraud on the court . ”
One area in which Allegra decided deception had occurred was in the treatment of Thomas Atteberry , the special agent in charge of ATF ’ s Phoenix office , and Carlos Canino , then the assistant special agent in charge of the agency ’ s Tucson office . In 2012 , a Justice Department attorney , Valerie Bacon , asked both Atteberry and Canino not to reopen the investigation into the arson at Dobyns ’ Tucson home because it could hurt the Justice Department ’ s defense in this case .
Atteberry and Canino were listed as witnesses in the case , but the judge didn ’ t hear about the DOJ effort to squelch the investigation until the trial , which he considered a concealment by the Justice Department . They went ahead and reopened the case , which remains unsolved , anyway .
More alarming was the other “ fraud on the court ” that Allegra cited : “ An ATF agent who testified in this case may have been threatened by another witness during the trial. ” Justice Department attorneys ordered the agent not to report the threat to the court or he would face repercussions , Allegra said .
As a refresher , Dobyns is the first law enforcement agent to ever successfully infiltrate multiple layers of the notoriously dangerous and violent Hells Angels motorcycle gang through `` Operation Black Biscuit . '' After doing so and after his identity was exposed , he received death threats against himself and his family . ATF did nothing to protect him . When his house was burned to the ground at 3 a.m. , ATF supervisors tried to frame him for the arson after Dobyns blew the whistle and exposed supervisors had done nothing to address serious and credible threats against his family . ( You can read a detailed account of the situation here ) . As a result , Dobyns sued the Bureau .
In August 2014 that lawsuit and trial came to an end with Federal Judge Francis Allegra ruling in Dobyns ' favor and awarding him $ 173,000 in damages .
After a long six year court battle with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms , Special Agent and whistleblower Jay Dobyns says he as been vindicated after Federal Judge Francis Allegra ruled in his favor late Tuesday . Dobyns , who infiltrated the dangerous and deadly Hells Angels gang as an undercover agent years ago , brought a lawsuit against the Bureau after supervisors ignored death threats to his family , which included plans to murder him either with a bullet or by injecting him with the AIDS virus , kidnapping and torturing his then 15-year-old daughter and kidnapping his wife in order to videotape a gang rape of her . Contracts were solicited between the Hells Angels , the Aryan Brotherhood and the MS-13 gang to carry out these threats , which were laid out in prison letters and confirmed through FBI and ATF interviews of confidential informants inside numerous detention centers . In 2008 , his Tucson home was burned to the ground . When the fire was started , his wife and children were inside . Luckily , they escaped . Instead of investigating , ATF supervisors accused Dobyns of being the arsonist .
`` I have been vindicated . First , I must thank God who provided me with strength and faith during these events . I thank those who have supported me ; family , friends , peers and strangers but mostly my wife and kids – they have been the true victims here and been forced to suffer too needlessly , '' Dobyns wrote about the ruling on his website , where he released the news . `` An agency I spilled my own blood for and enthusiastically accepted every dirty assignment on behalf of for twenty-seven years , knowingly and intentionally accused me of a crime I did not commit ; being a person who would murder his own wife and children by fire . ''
In his opinion , Allegra said ATF exhibited `` organizational weaknesses , '' in handling the threats against Dobyns and described ATF officials as demonstrating misfeasance in the case `` rooted in the sorry failure of some ATF officials . ''
“ The violations occurred because of the way officials like ASAC Gillett and RAC Higman functioned – and were allowed to function – after the arson , especially in terms of how Agent Dobyns was treated ” ; “ In the courts view , the evidence showed that ASAC Gillett and Agent Higman knew that Agent Dobyns was not responsible for the fire , and still allowed him to be treated as a suspect as a form of payback . Moreover , ATF officials knew , or should have known , that individuals like ASAC Gillett and Agent Higman should not have been allowed to participate in the investigation – as it turned out their conduct was not only reprehensible , but predictably so . In donning blinders in this regard , ATF officials compounded potential harm that might have befallen the Dobyns family , ” the opinion states .
It seems that this apparent misconduct by the DOJ attorneys is what led Allegra to make a dramatic ruling on Oct. 24 . That day , he barred seven Justice Department attorneys who had led the case until then from making any further filings in the case . The DOJ is fighting that ruling .
Shortly after the ruling , Allegra withdrew his opinion without explanation , now we know why . Court documents show DOJ attorneys allegedly intimidated a key witness in Dobyns ' case against the government , threatening that if he testified , his career at would be over .
“ On October 29 , 2014 , the court , invoking RCFC 60 ( b ) and other provisions , issued an order voiding the prior judgment based upon indications that defendant , through its counsel , had committed fraud on the court , '' Allegra wrote in an unsealed opinion from December 2014 . `` The Sixth Circuit has indicated that fraud on the court consists of conduct : 1 . On the part of an officer of the court ; 2 . That is directed to the ‘ judicial machinery ’ itself ; 3 . That is intentionally false , willfully blind to the truth , or is in reckless disregard for the truth ; 4 . That is a positive averment or is concealment when one is under a duty to disclose ; 5 . That deceives the court . ''
After the opinion was issued , ATF 's lead internal affairs investigator Christopher Trainor , a key witness in the Dobyns ' case who testified at the Tucson and Washington D.C. portions of the trial , told Judge Allegra he had been threatened by a DOJ attorney and witness for the government , Charles Higman , in 2013 for his work in compiling evidence against ATF in the case . An internal criminal investigation was opened against Higman in 2013 after Trainor 's allegations and Higman was accused of perjury in Allegra 's August 2014 opinion , which was withdrawn after new revelations .
According to a letter to Judge Allegra from the DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility , OPR has `` received multiple inquiries regarding whether the Federal Circuit 's December 18 , 2014 Order remanding the case of Jay A. Dobyns v. United States , No . 08-700C ( FMA ) , to the Court of Federal Claims for further proceedings will affect the inquiry recently initiated by OPR into allegations that Department of Justice attorneys committed misconduct in the Dobyns case , '' and `` the court will order depositions of at least some of the attorneys and other witnesses in this case , as well as the receipt of other relevant evidence . ''
Further , DOJ has allegedly been intimidating and conducting harassing surveillance of Dobyns ' attorney Jim Reed . More from Steller :
Perhaps the most bizarre and worrisome allegations emerged in Reed ’ s Jan. 11 filing , which was originally filed under seal but unsealed by the judge except for a few redacted words . Reed , who is based in Phoenix , wrote that he “ has felt himself under extreme surveillance for the last sixty days , both fixed and moving , and under lesser levels of surveillance for many months before that . ”
“ In the last 30 days , ” Reed wrote , “ counsel ’ s automobile has been broken into but with nothing stolen , as apparently has been his home , for which counsel has filed Phoenix Police Department complaints . ”
DOJ is standing by it 's attorneys as `` outstanding civil servants . '' Attorney General Eric Holder has been informed by Allegra of the alleged defrauding of the court by DOJ attorneys .
`` I said all along they were cheating . Everyone was like , `` sour grapes , disgruntled agent , whiny narcissist , etc . '' Just a fraction of the dirty games ATF and DOJ played on me are coming out . Reporters are finding it all on their own with no prompting from me ( below ) . This is only the portion of what Judge Allegra has unsealed and allowed to be exposed . More and better dirt on these people is coming . The evidence of abuse from the trial ? That 's old news and minor compared to DOJ / ATF attorneys and witnesses defrauding federal courtrooms and judges . Jones and Brandon knew/know about this and did NOTHING , yet they call themselves `` leaders '' . They are executive bagboys . DOJ is defending the reputations and careers of corrupt attorneys - the very same attorneys who tried to frame me and lied , cheated and stole to do it . They are all paid to cover for Holder and his `` team '' and do so shamelessly . Justice and truth are not their missions . Coverup and self protection is . To them `` Justice '' and `` Truth '' are meaningless words carved in the facades of their buildings . This is the tip of the iceberg of what is yet to come , '' Dobyns wrote on his website about the revelations . `` I can only make one guarantee . Its not of victory . Its that I will not quit and will not be broken . ''
The House Oversight Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committees both have new chairmen , Rep. Jason Chaffetz and Sen. Chuck Grassley , who should both be looking into this is and demanding answers , especially with confirmation hearings for attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch later this week .

Mccarthy, John Mccormack, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Mairead Mcardle, Robert Verbruggen, Carrie Severino, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry, John Fund","Two former top Obama-appointed prosecutors co-author a diatribe against Trump attorney general Jeff Sessions for returning the Justice Department to purportedly outdated , too “ tough on crime ” charging practices . Yawn . After eight years of Justice Department stewardship by Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch , and after Obama ’ s record 1,715 commutations that systematically undermined federal sentencing laws , we know the skewed storyline .
The surprise is to find such an argument in the pages of National Review Online . But there it was on Tuesday : “ On Criminal Justice , Sessions Is Returning DOJ to the Failed Policies of the Past , ” by Joyce Vance and Carter Stewart , formerly the United States attorneys for , respectively , the Northern District of Alabama and the Southern District of Ohio . Ms. Vance is now lecturing on criminal-justice reform at the University of Alabama School of Law and doing legal commentary at MSNBC . Mr. Stewart has moved on to the Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation , fresh from what it describes as his “ leadership role at DOJ in addressing inequities in the criminal justice system , ” focusing on “ alternatives to incarceration , ” and “ reducing racial disparities in the federal system . ”
The authors lament that Sessions has reinstituted guidelines requiring prosecutors “ to charge the most serious offenses and ask for the lengthiest prison sentences. ” This , the authors insist , is a “ one-size-fits-all policy ” that “ doesn ’ t work. ” It marks a return to the supposedly “ ineffective and damaging criminal-justice policies that were imposed in 2003 , ” upsetting the “ bipartisan consensus ” for “ criminal-justice reform ” that has supposedly seized “ today ’ s America . ”
This is so wrongheaded , it ’ s tough to decide where to begin .
In reality , what Sessions has done is return the Justice Department to the traditional guidance articulated nearly four decades ago by President Carter ’ s highly regarded attorney general , Benjamin Civiletti ( and memorialized in the U.S. Attorney ’ s Manual ) . It instructs prosecutors to charge the most serious , readily provable offense under the circumstances . Doesn ’ t work ? This directive , in effect with little variation until the Obama years , is one of several factors that contributed to historic decreases in crime . When bad guys are prosecuted and incarcerated , they are not preying on our communities .
The thrust of the policy Sessions has revived is respect for the Constitution ’ s bedrock separation-of-powers principle . It requires faithful execution of laws enacted by Congress .
A concrete example makes the point . Congress has prescribed a minimum ten-year sentence for the offense of distributing at least five kilograms of cocaine ( see section 841 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ( ii ) of the federal narcotics laws ) . Let ’ s say a prosecutor is presented with solid evidence that a defendant sold seven kilograms of cocaine . The crime is readily provable . Nevertheless , the prosecutor follows the Obama deviation from traditional Justice Department policy , charging a much less serious offense : a distribution that does not specify an amount of cocaine — as if we were talking about a one-vial street sale . The purpose of this sleight of hand is to evade the controlling statute ’ s ten-year sentence , inviting the judge to impose little or no jail time .
Bending statutes to the executive ’ s policy preferences was the Obama approach to governance . We should not be surprised that his appointed prosecutors see it as a model for criminal enforcement , too .
That is not prosecutorial discretion . It is the prosecutor substituting his own judgment for Congress ’ s regarding the gravity of the offense . In effect , the prosecutor is decreeing law , not enforcing what is on the books — notwithstanding the wont of prosecutors to admonish that courts must honor Congress ’ s laws as written .
Absent this Justice Department directive that prosecutors must charge the most serious , readily provable offense , the executive branch becomes a law unto itself . Bending congressional statutes to the executive ’ s policy preferences was the Obama approach to governance , so we should not be surprised that a pair of his appointed prosecutors see it as a model for criminal enforcement , too . But it is not enforcement of the law . It is executive imperialism . It is DACA all over again : “ Congress refuses to codify my policy preferences ; but I have raw executive power so I shall impose them by will . . . and call it ‘ prosecutorial discretion. ’ ” ( In truth , it is a distortion of prosecutorial discretion . )
It should not be necessary to point out to accomplished lawyers that , in our system , “ bipartisan consensus ” is not a comparative handful of Democrats and Republicans clucking their tongues in unison . Yes , between leftist hostility to incarceration and libertarian skepticism about prosecutorial power , there is common ground among some factions of lawmakers when it comes to opposing our allegedly draconian penal code . But these factions are not much of a consensus . The only consensus that matters is one that drums up support sufficient to enact legislation into law . “ Criminal-justice reform ” is of a piece with “ comprehensive immigration reform ” and the Obama agenda : If it actually enjoyed broad popularity , resort to executive fiat would be unnecessary — Congress would codify it .
The criminal-justice “ reformers ” want mandatory-minimum-sentencing provisions eliminated and other sentencing provisions mitigated . Yet , despite the sympathetic airing they get from the “ progressive ” mainstream media , they are unable to get their “ reforms ” passed by Congress . How come ? Because strong majorities of lawmakers understand themselves to be accountable to commonsense citizens — people who aren ’ t “ evolved ” enough to grasp how reducing the number of criminals in prisons will somehow decrease the amount of crime . Most of us benighted types proceed under the quaint assumption that , even in “ today ’ s America , ” the streets are safer when the criminals are not on them .
In light of the caterwauling about mandatory-minimum sentencing by people either unfamiliar with or in a state of amnesia about what the federal system was like before it was instituted , it is worth repeating : Such provisions mean that the public , rather than the judge , decides the minimum appropriate term for serious crimes . As a class , judges are elite products of American universities and tend to be more left-leaning than the general public . That is particularly the case with respect to President Obama ’ s 335 judicial appointees , many of them — like Obama himself , as well as Vance and Stewart — philosophically resistant to incarceration as a response to crime . We can certainly repeal mandatory minimums , but if we do , it will vest those judges with unfettered discretion to mete out punishment . Rest assured , such sentences will not resemble the ones most of us would impose . Note also what the “ reformers ” do not tell you about mandatory minimums : ( a ) Congress has enacted a “ safety valve ” that allows a judge to waive them in cases involving first offenders whose crimes do not involve guns ; and ( b ) they can also be waived if a defendant cooperates with government investigations . By and large , mandatory minimums are applied to hardcore criminals — as one would expect , since they are mainly triggered by very large amounts of illegal narcotics and the use of firearms during violent crimes .
It is always worth considering whether sentencing terms are too severe — or , for that matter , insufficiently severe . Criminal statutes can be modified by legislation , which reflects the judgment of the people ’ s representatives . The fact that they have not been , notwithstanding the purported “ consensus ” for “ reform , ” suggests that the public is not convinced of the need for such modification — or , perhaps , that our representatives grasp the need for a check on the judges .
Unable to change the law , the “ reformers ” are reduced to arguing that justice happens only when prosecutors ignore the law . If you ’ re Jeff Sessions and you say , “ No , you know , I think we ’ ll have them follow the law , ” you ’ re a Neanderthal .
Vance and Stewart persist in the mythology of federal penitentiaries overflowing with “ nonviolent drug offenders. ” They must use this deceptive term because what they ’ d like to be able to claim — namely , that the prisons teem with sad sacks rotting away on misdemeanor drug-possession crimes — is patently false . Federal prosecutorial resources are targeted at narcotics felonies , often involving significant distribution organizations and importation networks .
These schemes are inherently violent . Cocaine , heroin , and the like are illegal commodities that generate major cash transactions . Traffickers can ’ t go to the police when they need to protect a shipment , or sue in court when they get cheated . They therefore protect themselves by cultivating a reputation for violence — which requires liberal resort to violence . Even if an individual drug dealer happens to be unarmed when apprehended , it was the omnipresent specter of violence that enabled his enterprise to thrive . That is why , for decades , evidence of guns , ammunition , and other weaponry has been admissible to prove the existence of narcotics conspiracies — guns , federal jurisprudence teaches , are “ tools of the drug trade . ”
If you ’ re Jeff Sessions and you say , ‘ No , you know , I think we ’ ll have them follow the law , ’ you ’ re a Neanderthal .
Vance and Stewart advance the now familiar prattle that what they describe as “ excessive reliance on arrests and extended incarceration ” — translation : enforcing the criminal laws against narcotics trafficking and violent crime — has “ disparately impacted racial minorities and the poor ” and is responsible for “ the broken relationship between police departments and the communities they are sworn to serve and protect . ”
This is unmitigated nonsense . As Heather Mac Donald has repeatedly demonstrated , based on hard evidence , the disparate impact that the enforcement of law has on racial minorities is a function of offense behavior . The brute fact is that black people , taken as a group , commit more crimes than other racial and ethnic groups . Of course , in the day-to-day work of police and prosecutors , racialized bean-counting is irrelevant . We don ’ t treat people as groups — it ’ s the Left ’ s agitators who want us to view people not as individuals but as members of oppressed classes . In our system , however , guilt is personal . That is real justice , not “ social justice . ”
Regardless of the root causes , it is a remorseless fact that if you are going to enforce the laws , you necessarily will most often encounter the people who most often violate them . And you most often encounter them because they are violating the law , not because of some “ institutionalized ” bias .

A response to Joyce Vance and Carter Stewart

Two former top Obama-appointed prosecutors co-author a diatribe against Trump attorney general Jeff Sessions for returning the Justice Department to purportedly outdated, too “tough on crime” charging practices. Yawn. After eight years of Justice Department stewardship by Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, and after Obama’s record 1,715 commutations that systematically undermined federal sentencing laws, we know the skewed storyline.

The surprise is to find such an argument in the pages of National Review Online. But there it was on Tuesday: “On Criminal Justice, Sessions Is Returning DOJ to the Failed Policies of the Past,” by Joyce Vance and Carter Stewart, formerly the United States attorneys for, respectively, the Northern District of Alabama and the Southern District of Ohio. Ms. Vance is now lecturing on criminal-justice reform at the University of Alabama School of Law and doing legal commentary at MSNBC. Mr. Stewart has moved on to the Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation, fresh from what it describes as his “leadership role at DOJ in addressing inequities in the criminal justice system,” focusing on “alternatives to incarceration,” and “reducing racial disparities in the federal system.”

The authors lament that Sessions has reinstituted guidelines requiring prosecutors “to charge the most serious offenses and ask for the lengthiest prison sentences.” This, the authors insist, is a “one-size-fits-all policy” that “doesn’t work.” It marks a return to the supposedly “ineffective and damaging criminal-justice policies that were imposed in 2003,” upsetting the “bipartisan consensus” for “criminal-justice reform” that has supposedly seized “today’s America.”

This is so wrongheaded, it’s tough to decide where to begin.

In reality, what Sessions has done is return the Justice Department to the traditional guidance articulated nearly four decades ago by President Carter’s highly regarded attorney general, Benjamin Civiletti (and memorialized in the U.S. Attorney’s Manual). It instructs prosecutors to charge the most serious, readily provable offense under the circumstances. Doesn’t work? This directive, in effect with little variation until the Obama years, is one of several factors that contributed to historic decreases in crime. When bad guys are prosecuted and incarcerated, they are not preying on our communities.

The thrust of the policy Sessions has revived is respect for the Constitution’s bedrock separation-of-powers principle. It requires faithful execution of laws enacted by Congress.

A concrete example makes the point. Congress has prescribed a minimum ten-year sentence for the offense of distributing at least five kilograms of cocaine (see section 841(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the federal narcotics laws). Let’s say a prosecutor is presented with solid evidence that a defendant sold seven kilograms of cocaine. The crime is readily provable. Nevertheless, the prosecutor follows the Obama deviation from traditional Justice Department policy, charging a much less serious offense: a distribution that does not specify an amount of cocaine — as if we were talking about a one-vial street sale. The purpose of this sleight of hand is to evade the controlling statute’s ten-year sentence, inviting the judge to impose little or no jail time.

Bending statutes to the executive’s policy preferences was the Obama approach to governance. We should not be surprised that his appointed prosecutors see it as a model for criminal enforcement, too.

That is not prosecutorial discretion. It is the prosecutor substituting his own judgment for Congress’s regarding the gravity of the offense. In effect, the prosecutor is decreeing law, not enforcing what is on the books — notwithstanding the wont of prosecutors to admonish that courts must honor Congress’s laws as written.

Absent this Justice Department directive that prosecutors must charge the most serious, readily provable offense, the executive branch becomes a law unto itself. Bending congressional statutes to the executive’s policy preferences was the Obama approach to governance, so we should not be surprised that a pair of his appointed prosecutors see it as a model for criminal enforcement, too. But it is not enforcement of the law. It is executive imperialism. It is DACA all over again: “Congress refuses to codify my policy preferences; but I have raw executive power so I shall impose them by will . . . and call it ‘prosecutorial discretion.’” (In truth, it is a distortion of prosecutorial discretion.)

It should not be necessary to point out to accomplished lawyers that, in our system, “bipartisan consensus” is not a comparative handful of Democrats and Republicans clucking their tongues in unison. Yes, between leftist hostility to incarceration and libertarian skepticism about prosecutorial power, there is common ground among some factions of lawmakers when it comes to opposing our allegedly draconian penal code. But these factions are not much of a consensus. The only consensus that matters is one that drums up support sufficient to enact legislation into law. “Criminal-justice reform” is of a piece with “comprehensive immigration reform” and the Obama agenda: If it actually enjoyed broad popularity, resort to executive fiat would be unnecessary — Congress would codify it.

The criminal-justice “reformers” want mandatory-minimum-sentencing provisions eliminated and other sentencing provisions mitigated. Yet, despite the sympathetic airing they get from the “progressive” mainstream media, they are unable to get their “reforms” passed by Congress. How come? Because strong majorities of lawmakers understand themselves to be accountable to commonsense citizens — people who aren’t “evolved” enough to grasp how reducing the number of criminals in prisons will somehow decrease the amount of crime. Most of us benighted types proceed under the quaint assumption that, even in “today’s America,” the streets are safer when the criminals are not on them.

Advertisement

In light of the caterwauling about mandatory-minimum sentencing by people either unfamiliar with or in a state of amnesia about what the federal system was like before it was instituted, it is worth repeating: Such provisions mean that the public, rather than the judge, decides the minimum appropriate term for serious crimes. As a class, judges are elite products of American universities and tend to be more left-leaning than the general public. That is particularly the case with respect to President Obama’s 335 judicial appointees, many of them — like Obama himself, as well as Vance and Stewart — philosophically resistant to incarceration as a response to crime. We can certainly repeal mandatory minimums, but if we do, it will vest those judges with unfettered discretion to mete out punishment. Rest assured, such sentences will not resemble the ones most of us would impose. Note also what the “reformers” do not tell you about mandatory minimums: (a) Congress has enacted a “safety valve” that allows a judge to waive them in cases involving first offenders whose crimes do not involve guns; and (b) they can also be waived if a defendant cooperates with government investigations. By and large, mandatory minimums are applied to hardcore criminals — as one would expect, since they are mainly triggered by very large amounts of illegal narcotics and the use of firearms during violent crimes.

Advertisement

It is always worth considering whether sentencing terms are too severe — or, for that matter, insufficiently severe. Criminal statutes can be modified by legislation, which reflects the judgment of the people’s representatives. The fact that they have not been, notwithstanding the purported “consensus” for “reform,” suggests that the public is not convinced of the need for such modification — or, perhaps, that our representatives grasp the need for a check on the judges.

Advertisement

Unable to change the law, the “reformers” are reduced to arguing that justice happens only when prosecutors ignore the law. If you’re Jeff Sessions and you say, “No, you know, I think we’ll have them follow the law,” you’re a Neanderthal.

Vance and Stewart persist in the mythology of federal penitentiaries overflowing with “nonviolent drug offenders.” They must use this deceptive term because what they’d like to be able to claim — namely, that the prisons teem with sad sacks rotting away on misdemeanor drug-possession crimes — is patently false. Federal prosecutorial resources are targeted at narcotics felonies, often involving significant distribution organizations and importation networks.

These schemes are inherently violent. Cocaine, heroin, and the like are illegal commodities that generate major cash transactions. Traffickers can’t go to the police when they need to protect a shipment, or sue in court when they get cheated. They therefore protect themselves by cultivating a reputation for violence — which requires liberal resort to violence. Even if an individual drug dealer happens to be unarmed when apprehended, it was the omnipresent specter of violence that enabled his enterprise to thrive. That is why, for decades, evidence of guns, ammunition, and other weaponry has been admissible to prove the existence of narcotics conspiracies — guns, federal jurisprudence teaches, are “tools of the drug trade.”

If you’re Jeff Sessions and you say, ‘No, you know, I think we’ll have them follow the law,’ you’re a Neanderthal.

Vance and Stewart advance the now familiar prattle that what they describe as “excessive reliance on arrests and extended incarceration” — translation: enforcing the criminal laws against narcotics trafficking and violent crime — has “disparately impacted racial minorities and the poor” and is responsible for “the broken relationship between police departments and the communities they are sworn to serve and protect.”

This is unmitigated nonsense. As Heather Mac Donald has repeatedly demonstrated, based on hard evidence, the disparate impact that the enforcement of law has on racial minorities is a function of offense behavior. The brute fact is that black people, taken as a group, commit more crimes than other racial and ethnic groups. Of course, in the day-to-day work of police and prosecutors, racialized bean-counting is irrelevant. We don’t treat people as groups — it’s the Left’s agitators who want us to view people not as individuals but as members of oppressed classes. In our system, however, guilt is personal. That is real justice, not “social justice.”

Regardless of the root causes, it is a remorseless fact that if you are going to enforce the laws, you necessarily will most often encounter the people who most often violate them. And you most often encounter them because they are violating the law, not because of some “institutionalized” bias. We know crimes are being committed not because of statisticians but because of victims. If you want to obsess over groups, maybe our sympathetic attention should shift to the prey rather than the predators — the racial minorities and poor people who by an outsize margin are victims of crime. That’s the disparate impact worth fretting over. And it is exacerbated when the laws are not enforced.

Moreover, the relationship between police departments and the communities they serve is not broken. That is a progressive narrative that seeks to blame the higher incidence of crime in minority communities on “institutional racism” in the justice system. Really? In “today’s America,” police departments are more integrated than at any time in history — often run by members of the minority communities that they serve. The court system is run by judges and lawyers educated in American law schools, proud (and often activist) members of the most politically progressive profession in our society — with the possible exception of university professors. The thought that these people would tolerate pervasive racism in their institution is laughable — or at least it should be. The reality of the system is that it bends over backward to avoid even the appearance of racism.

Of course there are bad cops, just as there are bad people in every occupation. But there are fewer of them in policing. Law enforcement tends to draw unusually valorous recruits who want to serve their communities, and who accept that their actions will be scrutinized with a zeal unknown to other professions. In a country of over 320 million people, it is unavoidable that there will be some violent encounters between police and civilians. We should marvel, though, at how relatively rare they are. The problem we have is not that the justice system is racist; it is that the slander that it is racist will cause police to shrink from enforcing the laws, a dereliction that would most harm minority communities.

Vance and Stewart have a point when they object to Attorney General Sessions’s unfortunate fondness for what they call “adoptive forfeiture policies.” As we at National Review have contended (as has Justice Clarence Thomas, Kevin Williamson reminds us), civil asset forfeitures are property seizures without due process of law. A federal spoils system incentivizes police to grab with both hands. Regardless of their effectiveness against drug lords, such forfeitures should be halted — the police should be required to proceed by criminal forfeiture and prosecution, with the due-process safeguards that entails. But that is because civil forfeitures offend the Constitution, not because they feed a left-wing narrative about fractured police–community relations.

Attorney General Sessions is enforcing the law, and doing so within a noble Justice Department tradition of giving force to Congress’s expression of the public will. He is not altering the law by executive fiat, the preference of President Obama, Attorneys General Holder and Lynch, Professor Vance, Mr. Stewart, and the bipartisan minority they portray as a “consensus.”

There is a great deal I don’t like about the legal system either. Statist government has enacted far too many laws, such that the federal government has criminalized too much of what used to be the province of state regulation — or unregulated private behavior. The drug laws do have severe penalties and may work injustice in some cases — although fewer than Vance and Stewart suggest: Though the hands of federal judges are tied by mandatory minimums, they are not bound to follow advisory sentencing guidelines or prosecutorial recommendations. I would certainly be open to mitigating penalties in exchange for thinning out the federal penal code and transferring areas of enforcement responsibility back to the states. The point, however, is that this has to be done by legislation, not by executive autocrats under a stealthy distortion of prosecutorial discretion.

If Professor Vance and Mr. Stewart are right that we are in a new era, if the public has truly been won over to the notion that incarcerating criminals is counterproductive, the next step is very simple: Pass laws that amend the penal code. In the meantime, the Justice Department’s job is to enforce the laws we have. As Attorney General Sessions recognizes, that means charging the most serious, readily provable offense.

The same IRS office that deliberately targeted conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status in the run-up to the 2012 election released nine pending confidential applications of conservative groups to ProPublica late last year.

The IRS did not respond to requests Monday following up about that release, and whether it had determined how the applications were sent to ProPublica.

In response to a request for the applications for 67 different nonprofits last November, the Cincinnati office of the IRS sent ProPublica applications or documentation for 31 groups. Nine of those applications had not yet been approved—meaning they were not supposed to be made public. (We made six of those public, after redacting their financial information, deeming that they were newsworthy.)

On Friday, Lois Lerner, the head of the division on tax-exempt organizations, apologized to Tea Party and other conservative groups because the IRS’ Cincinnati office had unfairly targeted them. Tea Party groups had complained in early 2012 that they were being sent overly intrusive questionnaires in response to their applications.

That scrutiny appears to have gone beyond Tea Party groups to applicants saying they wanted to educate the public to “make America a better place to live” or that criticized how the country was being run, according to a draft audit cited by many outlets. The full audit, by the Treasury Department’s inspector general for tax administration, will reportedly be released this week. (ProPublica was not contacted by the inspector general’s office.) (UPDATE May 14: The audit has been released.)

Before the 2012 election, ProPublica devoted months to showing how dozens of social-welfare nonprofits had misled the IRS about their political activity on their applications and tax returns. Social-welfare nonprofits are allowed to spend money to influence elections, as long as their primary purpose is improving social welfare. Unlike super PACs and regular political action committees, they do not have to identify their donors.

In 2012, nonprofits that didn’t have to report their donors poured an unprecedented $322 million into the election. Much of that money — 84 percent — came from conservative groups.

As part of its reporting, ProPublica regularly requested applications from the IRS’s Cincinnati office, which is responsible for reviewing applications from nonprofits.

Social welfare nonprofits are not required to apply to the IRS to operate. Many politically active new conservative groups apply anyway. Getting IRS approval can help with donations and help insulate groups from further scrutiny. Many politically active new liberal nonprofits have not applied.

Applications become public only after the IRS approves a group’s tax-exempt status.

On Nov. 15, 2012, ProPublica requested the applications of 67 nonprofits, all of which had spent money on the 2012 elections. (Because no social welfare groups with Tea Party in their names spent money on the election, ProPublica did not at that point request their applications.

Sometimes, amidst the avalanche of historic pettiness and cruelty, it’s easy to forget the historic incompetence of the Trump White House. Spelling mistakes, general know-nothingness, and sundry amateurishness radiates out from the most important office in the land. Much of it’s malign, even more of it is just dumb. The ineptitude, of course, starts at the top. But it doesn’t end there. The latest example of an entire administration being functionally in over its head comes from the Justice Department, which, BuzzFeed News reports, managed to send out a white nationalist blog post—from a hate group no less—in its daily immigration news roundup that is distributed to hundreds of immigration court employees, including immigration judges.

The post, which came from Vdare, a well-known repository for hate speech, targets immigration judges by name, using photos and anti-Semitic slurs. “The post features links and content that directly attacks sitting Immigration Judges with racial and ethnically tinged slurs and the label ‘Kritarch,’” Judge Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said in a letter to the head of the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review. “VDare’s use of the term in a pejorative manner casts Jewish history in a negative light as an Anti-Semitic trope of Jews seeking power and control.”

“Monday was far from the first time the office’s daily briefing has included questionable content, said immigration attorney Matthew Hoppock, who writes about the EOIR and has researched the office’s morning newsletter,” the Washington Post notes. “In April, Hoppock published every EOIR briefing since September 2018, which he received after submitting Freedom of Information Act requests. He said he was appalled at how many stories from right-wing websites the Daily Caller and Breitbart News were included.”

A DOJ spokesperson said the daily news briefing, which includes as many as two dozen pages of immigration-related news items, is provided by an outside contractor, the firm TechMIS.

One of Holder's biggest foes in Congress remains critical of the attorney general

Attorney General Eric Holder has been bruised and battered by Republicans who made him the first-ever sitting Cabinet member to be held in contempt of Congress.

He's been knocked around in behind-the-scenes White House battles with some of President Barack Obama's top advisers.

But more than 1,700 days after being the first black man sworn in as attorney general, Holder has defied expectations that he was on his way out. And he's planning on staying for a while longer.

Sources close to the attorney general say he plans to stay in office until well into 2014, at the President's behest.

He's changed his mind before. This past summer, he and the President spent time together during their vacation at Martha's Vineyard. Holder was considering leaving later this year, and the President asked him to stay as long as he could, sources said.

“ These can not be taken seriously , ” Mr. Stone told CNN , adding that there “ was no effort to intimidate or coerce Randy Credico to do anything other than the truth . ”
Mr. Stone , a 66-year-old longtime political strategist and lobbyist , has faced scrutiny as a result of making several comments during the 2016 race predicting the publication by WikiLeaks of documents damaging to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton , and investigators in the special counsel ’ s office probing allegations of Russian election meddling are reportedly considering whether he was involved in their release .

As The Washington Post reported, DOJ’s civil rights division has for decades conducted “pattern or practice’’ probes of troubled police departments to determine whether there are systemic problems that require a court-appointed monitor to correct. The COPS office had reportedly been expanding in recent years.

All starting to unravel with the ridiculous 9 year sentence recommendation ! https : //t.co/6baxv3Lvuk — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) February 12 , 2020
Jonathan Kravis , the deputy chief of the fraud and public corruption section in the U.S. Attorney ’ s Office in Washington , said in a court filing on Tuesday afternoon that he had resigned his government job . Two former prosecutors for Mueller , Aaron Zelinsky and Adam Jed , also notified the court that they were stepping off the case , as did a D.C.-based prosecutor , Michael Marando .
The extraordinary exit of every prosecutor who shepherded the Stone case came one day after they urged that he be sentenced to between about seven and nine years in prison on his conviction on charges of impeding congressional and FBI investigations into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia .
That prompted Trump to blast federal prosecutors on Twitter just before 2 a.m. Tuesday for urging such a long prison sentence for Stone , the veteran GOP political consultant and provocateur found guilty by a jury last year on seven felony counts brought by Mueller .
`` This is a horrible and very unfair situation , '' Trump wrote . `` The real crimes were on the other side , as nothing happens to them . Can not allow this miscarriage of justice ! ''
Trump expanded on his view while speaking to reporters late Tuesday afternoon , but he denied that he had asked the Justice Department to change the sentence recommendation .
“ I thought the recommendation was ridiculous . I thought the whole prosecution was ridiculous , “ the president said . “ I thought it was an insult to our country and it shouldn ‘ t happen. “
He also indicated that he viewed the case against Stone as a vendetta that Mueller ‘ s prosecutors carried on even after his departure last May .
“ These were the same Mueller people that put everybody through hell and I think it 's a disgrace , “ the president said . “ They ought to be ashamed of themselves. “
Later , Trump used Twitter to take a swipe at the judge scheduled to sentence Stone , Amy Berman Jackson , an Obama appointee who has overseen several other Mueller-related cases .
“ Is this the Judge that put Paul Manafort in SOLITARY CONFINEMENT , something that not even mobster Al Capone had to endure ? How did she treat Crooked Hillary Clinton ? Just asking ! “ Trump wrote .
While Jackson revoked Manafort ‘ s bail over allegations of witness tampering , she did not order him put in solitary confinement . U.S . Marshals personnel made a decision to isolate the former Trump adviser from the general inmate population because of concerns about his safety , the judge has said .
And Trump on Tuesday afternoon escalated his vendetta against Vindman , one of the prime targets of the president 's still-emerging revenge tour .
Speaking to reporters at a veterans event , Trump said the military will likely look at disciplinary action against Vindman , just days after the National Security Council official was ousted from the White House after giving damaging testimony during the House impeachment hearings .
“ That ’ s going to be up to the military , we ’ ll have to see , but if you look at what happened , they ’ re going to certainly , I would imagine , take a look at that , ” Trump said in response to a follow-up question about what he meant when he said , “ the military can handle him . ”
Trump , without providing evidence or specific examples , accused Vindman of reporting “ very inaccurate things ” about the “ perfect ” call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky .
Around the same time Trump was speaking at the White House , the Justice Department submitted a revised sentencing filing that offered no specific recommendation for Stone ‘ s sentence , but said a term on the order of seven to nine years “ could be considered excessive and unwarranted. “
“ The government respectfully submits that a sentence of incarceration far less than 87 to 108 months ’ imprisonment would be reasonable under the circumstances , “ the prosecution ‘ s new submission said . “ Ultimately , the government defers to the Court as to what specific sentence is appropriate under the facts and circumstances of this case. “
“ Coupled with the president ’ s blatant retaliation against those who helped expose his wrongdoing , the Trump administration poses the gravest threat to the rule of law in America in a generation , ” said Rep. Adam Schiff ( D-Calif. ) , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee .
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sent a letter on Tuesday to the Justice Department inspector general , Michael Horowitz , requesting an investigation into the reversal .
A senior Justice Department official said on Tuesday afternoon that department leaders were taken by surprise by the initial recommendation contained in the prosecution ‘ s Monday evening filing . The official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the decision to revise the submission was unrelated to Trump 's tweet and took place prior to the president ’ s sending the message .
“ The department was shocked to see the sentencing recommendation in the Stone case last night , “ said the official . “ That recommendation was not the recommendation that had been briefed to the department . The department found the recommendation to be extreme and excessive and grossly disproportionate to Stone ’ s offenses and the department will clarify its position in court later today. “
The official declined to elaborate on who in the Justice Department hierarchy was aware of the actual contents of the recommendation submitted to Jackson , who is set to sentence Stone on Feb. 20 . However , the official insisted that the White House played no role in the reversal and that there was no contact between department leaders and Trump about Stone 's potential sentence prior to the decision .
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney 's Office declined to address questions about whether the prosecution team was dismissed or quit in protest .
Former Attorney General Eric Holder praised two of the prosecutors who withdrew from the Stone case .
“ AUSA ‘ s Kravis and Zelinsky have shown more guts — and an adherence to the rule of law — than too many now serving in Washington , ” he wrote on Twitter . “ What Main DOJ is trying to do — and at whose behest ? — is unprecedented , wrong and ultimately dangerous . DOJ independence is critical . ”
Grant Smith , an attorney for Stone , said in a statement : “ We have read with interest the new reporting on Roger Stone ’ s case . Our sentencing memo outlined our position on the recommendation made yesterday by the government . We look forward to reviewing the government ’ s supplemental filing. “
`` Isn ’ t it lovely when the swamp drains itself ? '' Stone backer and GOP communications adviser Michael Caputo tweeted .
Isn ’ t it lovely when the swamp drains itself ? Zelinsky is Beelzebub . 👿 https : //t.co/1doCgFWo6N — Michael R. Caputo 🇺🇸🇺🇦 ( @ MichaelRCaputo ) February 11 , 2020
After the closure of Mueller ‘ s office last May , Stone ‘ s prosecution was taken over by lawyers in the U.S. Attorney ‘ s Office in Washington , who handled the weeklong jury trial last November in which Stone was convicted on five counts of making false statements to investigators , one count of obstructing Congress and one count of witness tampering .
At the time of the trial , the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia was Jessie Liu , but she was replaced in that post last month on an interim basis by a former top aide to Attorney General Bill Barr , Tim Shea . Shea ‘ s name appeared on Monday 's filing , although such filings are typically prepared by the line prosecutors on the case .
Liu also appeared to become a casualty of the latest developments in the Stone case , as the White House abruptly withdrew her nomination as the Treasury Department ‘ s undersecretary for terrorism and financial crimes , according to a former Trump administration official and another person familiar with the situation .
It was not immediately clear why Trump pulled her nomination , but her confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee had been scheduled for Thursday morning . A White House spokesman declined to comment on the move .
A former Trump administration official said on Tuesday night : “ It was unusual to ask her to step down ahead of her confirmation. “
Even before the new and extraordinary events in the Stone case , Liu was virtually certain to face questions at the hearing about her office ‘ s handling of various politically sensitive cases and investigations , including those of Stone , former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former the former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe .
The prosecution ‘ s initial proposal for a lengthy prison term for Stone was driven by the witness tampering charge and by allegations that Stone threatened violence in order to discourage an associate , Randy Credico , from cooperating with Congress and the FBI . Stone insisted that the messages — including such colorful missives as “ Prepare to die cocksucker “ — were part of outlandish banter between the two .
Credico said in a letter to the judge last month that he didn ‘ t think Stone posed a physical threat , but acknowledged during the trial that he was concerned that Stone ‘ s language could prompt other people to act out .
Stone ‘ s statements alleged to threaten or encourage violence upped the prosecution ‘ s calculation of the sentencing guidelines in Stone ‘ s case by about four or five years , according to the government ‘ s filing Monday . Stone ‘ s defense calculates the guidelines to call for a 15- to 21-month sentence .
Trump has the power to see that Stone serves no prison time by issuing a pardon , as many of Stone ‘ s supporters are urging . The president rebuffed a question about a pardon on Tuesday .
Jed and Kravis offered no hint of the mushrooming controversy during the more than two hours they spent in court on Tuesday handling another case that emerged from the Mueller probe : the prosecution of a Russian company accused of using social media activity and advertising to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential contest . That case is set for trial in April .

Zelinsky 's filing with the court said he was giving up his temporary post as a special assistant U.S. attorney in Maryland is apparently returning to his job in the state . Jed and Marando included no information about their status beyond that they were withdrawing from the Stone case .

“I thought the recommendation was ridiculous. I thought the whole prosecution was ridiculous,“ the president said. “I thought it was an insult to our country and it shouldn‘t happen.“

He also indicated that he viewed the case against Stone as a vendetta that Mueller‘s prosecutors carried on even after his departure last May.

“These were the same Mueller people that put everybody through hell and I think it's a disgrace,“ the president said. “They ought to be ashamed of themselves.“

Later, Trump used Twitter to take a swipe at the judge scheduled to sentence Stone, Amy Berman Jackson, an Obama appointee who has overseen several other Mueller-related cases.

“Is this the Judge that put Paul Manafort in SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, something that not even mobster Al Capone had to endure? How did she treat Crooked Hillary Clinton? Just asking!“ Trump wrote.

While Jackson revoked Manafort‘s bail over allegations of witness tampering, she did not order him put in solitary confinement. U.S. Marshals personnel made a decision to isolate the former Trump adviser from the general inmate population because of concerns about his safety, the judge has said.

And Trump on Tuesday afternoon escalated his vendetta against Vindman, one of the prime targets of the president's still-emerging revenge tour.

Speaking to reporters at a veterans event, Trump said the military will likely look at disciplinary action against Vindman, just days after the National Security Council official was ousted from the White House after giving damaging testimony during the House impeachment hearings.

“That’s going to be up to the military, we’ll have to see, but if you look at what happened, they’re going to certainly, I would imagine, take a look at that,” Trump said in response to a follow-up question about what he meant when he said, “the military can handle him.”

Trump, without providing evidence or specific examples, accused Vindman of reporting “very inaccurate things” about the “perfect” call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Around the same time Trump was speaking at the White House, the Justice Department submitted a revised sentencing filing that offered no specific recommendation for Stone‘s sentence, but said a term on the order of seven to nine years “could be considered excessive and unwarranted.“

“The government respectfully submits that a sentence of incarceration far less than 87 to 108 months’ imprisonment would be reasonable under the circumstances,“ the prosecution‘s new submission said. “Ultimately, the government defers to the Court as to what specific sentence is appropriate under the facts and circumstances of this case.“

Congressional Democrats erupted in outrage over the Stone episode.

“Coupled with the president’s blatant retaliation against those who helped expose his wrongdoing, the Trump administration poses the gravest threat to the rule of law in America in a generation,” said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sent a letter on Tuesday to the Justice Department inspector general, Michael Horowitz, requesting an investigation into the reversal.

A senior Justice Department official said on Tuesday afternoon that department leaders were taken by surprise by the initial recommendation contained in the prosecution‘s Monday evening filing. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the decision to revise the submission was unrelated to Trump's tweet and took place prior to the president’s sending the message.

“The department was shocked to see the sentencing recommendation in the Stone case last night,“ said the official. “That recommendation was not the recommendation that had been briefed to the department. The department found the recommendation to be extreme and excessive and grossly disproportionate to Stone’s offenses and the department will clarify its position in court later today.“

The official declined to elaborate on who in the Justice Department hierarchy was aware of the actual contents of the recommendation submitted to Jackson, who is set to sentence Stone on Feb. 20. However, the official insisted that the White House played no role in the reversal and that there was no contact between department leaders and Trump about Stone's potential sentence prior to the decision.

A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office declined to address questions about whether the prosecution team was dismissed or quit in protest.

Former Attorney General Eric Holder praised two of the prosecutors who withdrew from the Stone case.

“AUSA‘s Kravis and Zelinsky have shown more guts — and an adherence to the rule of law — than too many now serving in Washington,” he wrote on Twitter. “What Main DOJ is trying to do — and at whose behest? — is unprecedented, wrong and ultimately dangerous. DOJ independence is critical.”

Grant Smith, an attorney for Stone, said in a statement: “We have read with interest the new reporting on Roger Stone’s case. Our sentencing memo outlined our position on the recommendation made yesterday by the government. We look forward to reviewing the government’s supplemental filing.“

Other Stone allies hailed Tuesday's developments.

""Isn’t it lovely when the swamp drains itself?"" Stone backer and GOP communications adviser Michael Caputo tweeted.

Isn’t it lovely when the swamp drains itself? Zelinsky is Beelzebub. 👿 https://t.co/1doCgFWo6N — Michael R. Caputo 🇺🇸🇺🇦 (@MichaelRCaputo) February 11, 2020

After the closure of Mueller‘s office last May, Stone‘s prosecution was taken over by lawyers in the U.S. Attorney‘s Office in Washington, who handled the weeklong jury trial last November in which Stone was convicted on five counts of making false statements to investigators, one count of obstructing Congress and one count of witness tampering.

At the time of the trial, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia was Jessie Liu, but she was replaced in that post last month on an interim basis by a former top aide to Attorney General Bill Barr, Tim Shea. Shea‘s name appeared on Monday's filing, although such filings are typically prepared by the line prosecutors on the case.

Liu also appeared to become a casualty of the latest developments in the Stone case, as the White House abruptly withdrew her nomination as the Treasury Department‘s undersecretary for terrorism and financial crimes, according to a former Trump administration official and another person familiar with the situation.

It was not immediately clear why Trump pulled her nomination, but her confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee had been scheduled for Thursday morning. A White House spokesman declined to comment on the move.

A former Trump administration official said on Tuesday night: “It was unusual to ask her to step down ahead of her confirmation.“

Even before the new and extraordinary events in the Stone case, Liu was virtually certain to face questions at the hearing about her office‘s handling of various politically sensitive cases and investigations, including those of Stone, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former the former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe.

The prosecution‘s initial proposal for a lengthy prison term for Stone was driven by the witness tampering charge and by allegations that Stone threatened violence in order to discourage an associate, Randy Credico, from cooperating with Congress and the FBI. Stone insisted that the messages — including such colorful missives as “Prepare to die cocksucker“ — were part of outlandish banter between the two.

Credico said in a letter to the judge last month that he didn‘t think Stone posed a physical threat, but acknowledged during the trial that he was concerned that Stone‘s language could prompt other people to act out.

Stone‘s statements alleged to threaten or encourage violence upped the prosecution‘s calculation of the sentencing guidelines in Stone‘s case by about four or five years, according to the government‘s filing Monday. Stone‘s defense calculates the guidelines to call for a 15- to 21-month sentence.

Trump has the power to see that Stone serves no prison time by issuing a pardon, as many of Stone‘s supporters are urging. The president rebuffed a question about a pardon on Tuesday.

Jed and Kravis offered no hint of the mushrooming controversy during the more than two hours they spent in court on Tuesday handling another case that emerged from the Mueller probe: the prosecution of a Russian company accused of using social media activity and advertising to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential contest. That case is set for trial in April.

Zelinsky's filing with the court said he was giving up his temporary post as a special assistant U.S. attorney in Maryland is apparently returning to his job in the state. Jed and Marando included no information about their status beyond that they were withdrawing from the Stone case.

Late Friday afternoon, the acting chief of the criminal division in the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office, John Crabb, formally notified the court that he was entering the case. His and Shea‘s names are the only ones in the signature block of the revised sentencing recommendation.

The Obama administration announced Thursday that it will attempt an aggressive end-run around the Supreme Court ’ s recent ruling striking down a key part of the Voting Rights Act .
In a speech to a National Urban League conference in Philadelphia , Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Justice Department will urge a federal judge to subject the State of Texas to the pre-clearance procedure the court largely wiped out last month .
The federal government ’ s request is expected to be made in a lawsuit Latino state lawmakers filed challenging Texas ’ s redistricting plan based on the 2010 census .
“ Based on the evidence of intentional racial discrimination….as well as the history of pervasive voting-related discrimination against racial minorities that the Supreme Court itself has recognized , we believe that the state of Texas should be required to go through a preclearance process whenever it changes its voting laws and practices , ” Holder said .
The new request would require Texas to continue to preclear those changes for the next decade .
Gov . Rick Perry slammed the move . “ Once again , the Obama Administration is demonstrating utter contempt for our country ’ s system of checks and balances , not to mention the U.S. Constitution , ” he said in a statement . “ This end-run around the Supreme Court undermines the will of the people of Texas , and casts unfair aspersions on our state ’ s common-sense efforts to preserve the integrity of our elections process . ”

In its ruling last month , the Supreme Court invalidated a legislative formula that had resulted in parts or all of 15 states having to clear all voting changes in advance with the Justice Department or federal court . However , the justices left intact a rarely-used mechanism that allows judges to impose the same pre-clearance requirements on states and localities found to have intentionally discriminated illegally in voting practices .

They see this as a political move intended to build a case for closing the US military prison in Guantanamo , Cuba . President Barack Obama has said that he wants more foreign terror suspects charged in American federal courts , not in military tribunals at Guantanamo .
Abu Ghaith pleaded 'not guilty ' in an arraignment in New York City Friday morning . His trial will be a high-profile case , a rare prosecution of a senior Al Qaeda leader in under US civil law .
But Republicans do n't want foreign terrorists tried on US soil . They say the legal precedent has been set for `` enemy combatants '' to be tried at Guantanamo Bay . They are concerned that giving Abu Ghaith a civilian trial will result in lost intelligence .
Sen. Kelly Ayotte ( R of N.H. ) told reporters that by bringing Ghaith to New York , he would be entitled to the same rights as a citizen , including a speedy trial and Miranda rights , according to Politico . “ We do n't want him to come to America before he has been fully interrogated – before he comes to America and hears the words , ‘ You have the right to remain silent . ’ ”
`` We believe the administration 's decision here to bring this person to New York City , if that 's what 's happened , without letting Congress know is a very bad precedent to set , '' said Sen. Lindsey Graham , ( R of S.C. ) in a press conference Thursday .
Senator Ayotte also told reporters that `` When we find somebody like this , this close to bin Laden and the senior Al Qaeda leadership , the last thing in the world we want to do , in my opinion , is put them in civilian court . This man should be in Guantanamo Bay . ''
`` So we 're putting the administration on notice , '' Senator Graham said . `` We think that sneaking this guy into the country , clearly going around the intent of Congress when it comes to enemy combatants , will be challenged . ''

In a statement on the website of the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York , FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge George Venizelos described Sulaiman Abu Ghayth as holding `` a key position in al Qaeda , comparable to the consigliere in a mob family or propaganda minister in a totalitarian regime . He used his position to persuade others to swear loyalty to al Qaeda ’ s murderous cause . He used his position to threaten the United States and incite its enemies .

On the morning of September 12 , 2001 , Abu Ghayth , appeared with Bin Laden and Zawahiri , and spoke on behalf of al Qaeda , warning the United States and its allies that “ [ a ] great army is gathering against you ” and called upon “ the nation of Islam ” to do battle against “ the Jews , the Christians and the Americans. ” Also , after the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , Abu Ghayth delivered a speech in which he addressed the then-US Secretary of State and warned that “ the storms shall not stop , especially the Airplanes Storm , ” and advised Muslims , children , and opponents of the United States “ not to board any aircraft and not to live in high rises . ”
The indictment charges Abu Ghayth with participating in a conspiracy to kill United States nationals , in violation of Title 18 , United States Code , Section 2332 ( b ) . The offense carries a maximum term of imprisonment for life .","UPDATED: 11:15 a.m.

Some Republicans are livid that Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, the son-in-law of Osama bin Laden, is facing a civilian trial – instead of a military trial.

They see this as a political move intended to build a case for closing the US military prison in Guantanamo, Cuba. President Barack Obama has said that he wants more foreign terror suspects charged in American federal courts, not in military tribunals at Guantanamo.

Abu Ghaith pleaded 'not guilty' in an arraignment in New York City Friday morning. His trial will be a high-profile case, a rare prosecution of a senior Al Qaeda leader in under US civil law.

But Republicans don't want foreign terrorists tried on US soil. They say the legal precedent has been set for ""enemy combatants"" to be tried at Guantanamo Bay. They are concerned that giving Abu Ghaith a civilian trial will result in lost intelligence.

Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R of N.H.) told reporters that by bringing Ghaith to New York, he would be entitled to the same rights as a citizen, including a speedy trial and Miranda rights, according to Politico. “We don't want him to come to America before he has been fully interrogated – before he comes to America and hears the words, ‘You have the right to remain silent.’”

""We believe the administration's decision here to bring this person to New York City, if that's what's happened, without letting Congress know is a very bad precedent to set,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, (R of S.C.) in a press conference Thursday.

Senator Ayotte also told reporters that ""When we find somebody like this, this close to bin Laden and the senior Al Qaeda leadership, the last thing in the world we want to do, in my opinion, is put them in civilian court. This man should be in Guantanamo Bay.""

""So we're putting the administration on notice,"" Senator Graham said. ""We think that sneaking this guy into the country, clearly going around the intent of Congress when it comes to enemy combatants, will be challenged.""

In a statement on the website of the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge George Venizelos described Sulaiman Abu Ghayth as holding ""a key position in al Qaeda, comparable to the consigliere in a mob family or propaganda minister in a totalitarian regime. He used his position to persuade others to swear loyalty to al Qaeda’s murderous cause. He used his position to threaten the United States and incite its enemies. His apprehension is another important step in the campaign to limit the reach of al Qaeda and enhance our national and international security.”

On the morning of September 12, 2001, Abu Ghayth, appeared with Bin Laden and Zawahiri, and spoke on behalf of al Qaeda, warning the United States and its allies that “[a] great army is gathering against you” and called upon “the nation of Islam” to do battle against “the Jews, the Christians and the Americans.” Also, after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Abu Ghayth delivered a speech in which he addressed the then-US Secretary of State and warned that “the storms shall not stop, especially the Airplanes Storm,” and advised Muslims, children, and opponents of the United States “not to board any aircraft and not to live in high rises.”

The initiative is part of a broader Obama administration effort to ease sentences for nonviolent drug offenders .
Deputy Attorney General James Cole outlined the changes , which include six separate criteria inmates must meet to be eligible , on Wednesday morning . Among the requirements is that inmates must have served at least 10 years of their federal sentence and not have a `` significant criminal history . '' They must be `` non-violent , low-level offenders '' with no significant ties to major gangs , have a record of good conduct in prison and have no history of violence .
Finally , the process will be open to those who likely would have gotten a lesser sentence if convicted of the same offense today .
`` Older , stringent punishments that are out of line with sentences imposed under today 's laws erode people 's confidence in our criminal justice system . I am confident that this initiative will go far to promote the most fundamental of American ideals -- equal justice under the law , '' Cole said .
He said the department plans to launch the initiative `` quickly and effectively . ''
Cole suggested attorneys in the Justice Department are on board , though separate efforts to curb mandatory minimum sentencing have drawn complaints from the rank and file .
The National Association of Assistant Untied States Attorneys wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder in January arguing that the current sentencing system is `` worth preserving '' -- and that mandatory minimums give prosecutors `` leverage to secure cooperation from defendants . ''
DOJ leaders , though , argue that the new clemency changes are meant to address inconsistencies in sentences over time . The announcement is aimed primarily at drug prisoners , especially those sentenced under old guidelines that resulted in significantly harsher penalties for people caught with crack cocaine than for those who possessed the powder form of the drug . But it also applies to federal inmates imprisoned for other crimes , provided they meet the same criteria for clemency .
Cole outlined a detailed process that apparently will kick into gear starting next week . He said the Bureau of Prisons will circulate the new criteria to inmates across the country , and allow those who think they meet the standards to fill out an electronic form .
DOJ lawyers will screen those forms and forward select cases to pro bono attorneys to help in preparing clemency applications . Cole said lawyers from the Justice Department and elsewhere are being assigned to the pardon office to help in reviewing the `` numerous petitions '' expected to be submitted .
Cole also announced that current Pardon Attorney Ron Rodgers will be resigning ; he will be replaced by Deborah Leff , acting senior counselor for access to justice .
One source told The Associated Press the Justice Department has identified more than 23,000 people who are serving sentences of at least 10 years . But it was not clear how many of those people would be viable clemency candidates .
The Obama administration says it 's working to correct the legacy of an old sentencing structure that , historically , subjected black convicts to long prison terms for crack cocaine convictions while giving far more lenient sentences to those caught with powder , who were more likely to be white . The Fair Sentencing Act reduced that disparity and eliminated a five-year mandatory minimum for first-time possession of crack , and officials are now turning their attention to identifying inmates who received sentences under the old guidelines that now appear unduly harsh .
President Obama , who granted only one commutation in his first term , cut short in December the sentences of eight prisoners he said had been locked up too long for drug crimes . The White House has said it 's seeking additional good candidates to consider for clemency , though spokesman Jay Carney said Monday that the number of commutations `` will depend entirely on the number of worthy candidates .

At the same time, the Judiciary Committee was preparing to raise the pressure on Donald F. McGahn II, a former White House counsel and chief witness in the special counsel investigation, if he misses a Tuesday deadline to hand over key documents that the White House says are subject to executive privilege.

Mr. Barr, who refused to testify last week before the Judiciary Committee because of a dispute over format, has earned special ire, serving as a kind of surrogate punching bag for Democrats frustrated with Mr. Trump but leery of impeachment. If the full House follows suit and votes to hold Mr. Barr in contempt, it would be only the second time that the nation’s top law enforcement officer has been penalized by lawmakers in that way.

The Judiciary Committee’s chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, said the Wednesday vote could still be avoided if the Justice Department changes course. Hours after Democrats announced their plan, a deputy to Mr. Barr wrote to hold out that possibility, kicking off a new round of exchanges with an uncertain outcome.

Following prior reports indicating that Holder had likely signed off on the search warrant , the Justice Department acknowledged Holder 's involvement and defended the decision . It insisted the call to seek these files -- in the course of an investigation into a leak allegedly made by State Department contractor Stephen Jin-Woo Kim -- was legal .
`` The Department takes seriously the First Amendment right to freedom of the press , '' the department said in a written statement , provided late Friday at the start of the holiday weekend . `` In recognition of this , the Department took great care in deciding that a search warrant was necessary in the Kim matter , vetting the decision at the highest levels of the Department , including discussions with the Attorney General .

And a federal magistrate judge made an independent finding that probable cause existed to approve the search warrant , '' the statement said .
The `` tailored '' search warrant , though , was obtained only after federal officials accused Fox News correspondent James Rosen in an affidavit of being a likely criminal `` co-conspirator '' under a wartime law known as the Espionage Act .

The acknowledgement , however , that Holder was involved in the search warrant decision raised additional questions about whether the attorney general 's review of his own actions would be impartial .
Attorney Jesselyn Radack , who works with the Government Accountability Project and has represented accused leakers , told FoxNews.com she 's not convinced by the administration 's latest effort .
`` I do n't think there needs to be a review of the internal guidelines . ... There needs to be a review of why they were n't followed , '' she said , adding Holder appears to have a `` conflict of interest '' in the review .
But Gregg Leslie , legal defense director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press , said his group was `` encouraged to hear '' the review was initiated .
He told FoxNews.com on Friday that the country still needs a national media shield law -- something the DOJ agreed with in its statement Friday .
The statement said Holder `` understands the concerns that have been raised by the media and has initiated a reevaluation of existing Department policies and procedures . ''
A law enforcement official earlier confirmed to NBC News that Holder did approve the search . The source told NBC News that the Fox News document was approved `` at the highest levels -- and I mean the highest . ''
Holder 's involvement would distinguish this case from one in which the phone records of AP journalists were seized . In that case , Holder had already recused himself by the time the records were obtained .
More details about the Fox News case continued to trickle out Friday . The New Yorker reported that U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen fought to keep the seizure of the emails secret , voicing concern that disclosing the warrant could prevent the government from monitoring the messages .

justice_department,Wall Street Journal - News,1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/doj-report-on-clinton-email-probe-1528935441?mod=article_inline,"DOJ Clinton Report Blasts Comey, Agents, but Finds No Bias in Conclusion",,"Del Quentin Wilber, Aruna Viswanatha, Sadie Gurman, Del.Wilber Wsj.Com, Aruna.Viswanatha Wsj.Com, Sadie.Gurman Wsj.Com","A long-awaited watchdog report provided a sweeping and detailed rebuke of actions taken by former FBI Director James Comey to publicize details about the politically charged investigation into Hillary Clinton ’ s use of a private email server , but found no evidence that the probe was affected by bias or other political considerations .
The 500-page report also faulted Obama-era Justice Department leaders for not taking a firmer hand with Mr. Comey , and slammed multiple FBI employees involved in the investigation for sending politically charged text messages , saying the texts “ cast a cloud ” over the investigation and its credibility .
While providing the most definitive account of the probe , the report , released Thursday , didn ’ t settle long-simmering dissatisfaction among both Democrats and Republicans over the bureau ’ s handling of the investigation .
The report ’ s sharpest criticism was leveled at Mr. Comey , who was fired by President Donald Trump last May .
The inspector general ’ s office said it found “ unpersuasive ” Mr. Comey ’ s argument for why he ignored Justice Department policy on the Clinton email probe while hewing to it on the separate Russia and Clinton Foundation investigations .
But the report said investigative and prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton investigation were “ not unreasonable ” and could be justified on policy and legal grounds .
Mrs. Clinton ’ s allies have blamed Mr. Comey ’ s handling of the probe for putting Mr. Trump over the top in the November 2016 presidential election . At the same time , Mr. Trump and some Republicans maintain that actions by Mr. Comey and FBI agents during the Clinton probe showed bias against the president , which has also infected the special counsel ’ s probe into Russian interference in the election .
The report gave an unusually detailed accounting of one of the FBI ’ s highest profile investigations , its probe into whether Mrs. Clinton intended to transmit classified information on an unclassified , private email server while Secretary of State .
The sprawling inquiry examined the genesis of the probe , which was code-named Midyear Exam , investigative measures taken by prosecutors and FBI agents and Mr. Comey ’ s controversial public comments on the matter .
The inspector general ’ s office said it found the Justice Department ’ s conclusion not to prosecute Mrs. Clinton or her senior aides—based on a lack of evidence that her team intended to send classified information on unclassified systems— “ consistent with ” how the department had approached previous similar cases .
The report determined that Mr. Comey deviated from long-established policies in speaking publicly about the investigation at a news conference in July 2016 and sending a letter to Congress in the days before the election that disclosed the bureau had reopened the probe .
In his July 5 news conference , which was criticized at the time by former top Justice Department officials in both parties , Mr. Comey said the FBI was recommending no charges be filed against Mrs. Clinton . He also chastised the Democratic presidential candidate and her aides for being “ extremely careless ” in how they handled classified information .
“ We found that it was extraordinary and insubordinate for Comey to do so , and we found none of his reasons to be a persuasive basis for deviating from well-established Department policies , ” the report said .
Mr. Comey didn ’ t tell Justice Department leaders he would be speaking about the case until just before he publicly announced his conclusions on national television . Mr. Comey ’ s secrecy was intended to make it “ impractical for Department leadership to prevent him ” from delivering his public assessment , the inspector general said .
Mr. Comey said he was still weighing whether to speak publicly when then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch on June 27 held an impromptu meeting with former President Bill Clinton on her Justice Department jet on an Arizona tarmac .
The inspector general found Ms. Lynch ’ s failure to immediately recognize the problem created by the meeting was “ an error in judgment ” and also determined that her public responses to the controversy only created confusion . Mr. Comey said the meeting “ tipped ” the scales for him and he went forward with his press briefing on July 5 , the report said .
When Mr. Comey and Ms. Lynch spoke that morning , the attorney general didn ’ t assert her authority as Mr. Comey ’ s boss , the inspector general concluded . “ We believe she should have instructed Comey to tell her what he intended to say beforehand , and should have discussed it with Comey , ” the report says .
“ We conclude that Comey ’ s unilateral announcement was inconsistent with Department practice and protocol , ” especially in criticizing “ uncharged conduct ” by Mrs. Clinton , the watchdog found . “ We also found that Comey usurped the authority of the Attorney General . ”
Ms. Lynch said the report “ affirms that my actions had no political motivation or bias and complied with DOJ policies . ”
Mr. Comey was also criticized for engaging in “ ad hoc ” decision making when sending a letter to Congress just days before the 2016 election saying that the FBI had reopened the matter , after discovering Clinton-related emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner , a disgraced former congressman who was married to a Clinton aide .
Mr. Comey defended his actions to the inspector general by saying he had encountered unusual circumstances and did what he thought was best for the bureau and Justice Department . On Twitter , he wrote : “ The conclusions are reasonable , even though I disagree with some . People of good faith can see an unprecedented situation differently . I pray no Director faces it again . ”
In the course of its 18-month investigation , Inspector General Michael Horowitz ’ s staff also unearthed thousands of controversial text messages exchanged between Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel that disparaged Mr. Trump . The inspector general said his office was “ deeply troubled ” by the messages , which “ potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations . ”
“ Departing so clearly and dramatically from FBI and Department norms , the decisions negatively impacted the perception of the FBI and the Department as fair administrators of justice , ” the report concluded .
Of special focus in the report were FBI Agent Peter Strzok and now-former FBI lawyer Lisa Page , who exchanged thousands of text messages over the course of 2015 through 2017 . Mr. Strzok , who was romantically involved with Ms . Page , had led the Clinton probe and later was the top agent on Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s team investigating Russia ’ s interference in the 2016 election .
The texts “ sowed doubt ” about the FBI ’ s work , the report said , and “ created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. ” Still , the inspector general discovered no evidence that “ improper considerations , including political bias , directly affected the specific investigative decisions ” in the case .
The watchdog also examined how agents handled the discovery of Clinton-related emails on the laptop belonging to Mr. Weiner , and faulted the FBI for a monthlong delay between the discovery of the emails and investigative action by agents .
The inspector general said the texts raised questions about whether Mr. Strzok permitted political bias to cloud his judgment during one critical juncture in the investigation .
In September , an FBI agent working an unrelated case came across thousands of Clinton-related emails on Mr. Weiner ’ s laptop . Mr. Strzok and FBI officials learned about the emails in late September 2016 but took no official action for nearly a month , the inspector general concluded . The inspector general said it found no evidence that the laptop was “ deliberately placed on the back-burner . ”
In one previously unreported text , Mr. Strzok sent a text in August 2016 in response to a message from Ms . Page , who was worried that Mr. Trump might win the election . In his reply , Mr. Strzok wrote : “ No . No he ’ s not . We ’ ll stop it . ”
According to the report , Mr. Strzok stated that he believed his message was intended to reassure Ms . Page , and not suggest that he would somehow stop Mr. Trump .
A lawyer for Mr. Strzok , Aitan Goelman , said in a statement that the inspector general correctly concluded “ that there is no evidence that the political views of Special Agent Strzok and others in the FBI impacted the handling of the Clinton email investigation . ”
However , he said the report was flawed “ in its bizarre conclusion ” that the inspector general could n't rule out that bias may have affected his handling of the emails on the Weiner laptop . He noted that “ Special Agent Strzok openly admitted that he believed that the Russia investigation was far more important to American national security than the Clinton email investigation , this conclusion is evidence of Special Agent Strzok ’ s lucidity , not his bias . ”
Aside from Mr. Strzok and Ms . Page , the report also found that three other FBI employees , all on the Clinton investigation , swapped politically charged messages that were hostile toward Mr. Trump and supportive of Mrs. Clinton .
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the report “ reaffirmed the president ’ s suspicions about Comey ’ s conduct and about the political bias of some members of the FBI . ”
Democrats complained that Mr. Comey used a different standard in handling major cases involving the 2016 candidates . “ The FBI ’ s actions helped Donald Trump become president , ” Reps. Elijah Cummings ( D. , Md . ) and Jerrold Nadler ( D. , N.Y. ) said in a statement . “ Comey had a double-standard : He spoke publicly about the Clinton investigation while keeping secret from the American people the investigation of Donald Trump and Russia . ”
In the report , the inspector general also identified instances in which Mr. Comey used a personal Gmail email account to work on nonclassified documents , including drafts of all-staff messages he was working on , as well as a proposed opening statement for March 2017 testimony to the House Intelligence Committee .
Mr. Comey told the inspector general that he didn ’ t have an unclassified FBI connection at home that worked , and that “ for unclassified work , I would use my personal laptop for word processing and then send it into the FBI. ” Because the messages were forwarded to work accounts and weren ’ t classified , Mr. Comey said he thought his practice complied with FBI regulations but wasn ’ t sure , according to the report .
The report found that Mr. Comey ’ s use of the personal account was inconsistent with Justice Department policy , which says personal email accounts should be used for work only in “ exigent circumstances . ”
The report also referred to Mr. Comey ’ s deputy , Andrew McCabe , a longtime agent who was fired by the Justice Department in March , a day shy of retiring with full benefits over allegations he misled investigators with the FBI and Inspector General over his role in an article in The Wall Street Journal .
The report didn ’ t examine those interactions , but it agreed with FBI ethics officials that Mr. McCabe hadn ’ t been required to recuse himself from overseeing the Clinton probe because his wife had run as a Democrat for a Virginia statehouse seat and had accepted campaign donations from a close Clinton ally ’ s political-action committee . “ McCabe did what he was supposed to do , ” the report said .","A long-awaited watchdog report provided a sweeping and detailed rebuke of actions taken by former FBI Director James Comey to publicize details about the politically charged investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, but found no evidence that the probe was affected by bias or other political considerations.

The 500-page report also faulted Obama-era Justice Department leaders for not taking a firmer hand with Mr. Comey, and slammed multiple FBI employees involved in the investigation for sending politically charged text messages, saying the texts “cast a cloud” over the investigation and its credibility.

While providing the most definitive account of the probe, the report, released Thursday, didn’t settle long-simmering dissatisfaction among both Democrats and Republicans over the bureau’s handling of the investigation.

The report’s sharpest criticism was leveled at Mr. Comey, who was fired by President Donald Trump last May.

The inspector general’s office said it found “unpersuasive” Mr. Comey’s argument for why he ignored Justice Department policy on the Clinton email probe while hewing to it on the separate Russia and Clinton Foundation investigations.

But the report said investigative and prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton investigation were “not unreasonable” and could be justified on policy and legal grounds.

Mrs. Clinton’s allies have blamed Mr. Comey’s handling of the probe for putting Mr. Trump over the top in the November 2016 presidential election. At the same time, Mr. Trump and some Republicans maintain that actions by Mr. Comey and FBI agents during the Clinton probe showed bias against the president, which has also infected the special counsel’s probe into Russian interference in the election.

The report gave an unusually detailed accounting of one of the FBI’s highest profile investigations, its probe into whether Mrs. Clinton intended to transmit classified information on an unclassified, private email server while Secretary of State.

The sprawling inquiry examined the genesis of the probe, which was code-named Midyear Exam, investigative measures taken by prosecutors and FBI agents and Mr. Comey’s controversial public comments on the matter.

The inspector general’s office said it found the Justice Department’s conclusion not to prosecute Mrs. Clinton or her senior aides—based on a lack of evidence that her team intended to send classified information on unclassified systems—“consistent with” how the department had approached previous similar cases.

The report determined that Mr. Comey deviated from long-established policies in speaking publicly about the investigation at a news conference in July 2016 and sending a letter to Congress in the days before the election that disclosed the bureau had reopened the probe.

In his July 5 news conference, which was criticized at the time by former top Justice Department officials in both parties, Mr. Comey said the FBI was recommending no charges be filed against Mrs. Clinton. He also chastised the Democratic presidential candidate and her aides for being “extremely careless” in how they handled classified information.

“We found that it was extraordinary and insubordinate for Comey to do so, and we found none of his reasons to be a persuasive basis for deviating from well-established Department policies,” the report said.

Mr. Comey didn’t tell Justice Department leaders he would be speaking about the case until just before he publicly announced his conclusions on national television. Mr. Comey’s secrecy was intended to make it “impractical for Department leadership to prevent him” from delivering his public assessment, the inspector general said.

Mr. Comey said he was still weighing whether to speak publicly when then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch on June 27 held an impromptu meeting with former President Bill Clinton on her Justice Department jet on an Arizona tarmac.

The inspector general found Ms. Lynch’s failure to immediately recognize the problem created by the meeting was “an error in judgment” and also determined that her public responses to the controversy only created confusion. Mr. Comey said the meeting “tipped” the scales for him and he went forward with his press briefing on July 5, the report said.

When Mr. Comey and Ms. Lynch spoke that morning, the attorney general didn’t assert her authority as Mr. Comey’s boss, the inspector general concluded. “We believe she should have instructed Comey to tell her what he intended to say beforehand, and should have discussed it with Comey,” the report says.

“We conclude that Comey’s unilateral announcement was inconsistent with Department practice and protocol,” especially in criticizing “uncharged conduct” by Mrs. Clinton, the watchdog found. “We also found that Comey usurped the authority of the Attorney General.”

Ms. Lynch said the report “affirms that my actions had no political motivation or bias and complied with DOJ policies.”

Mr. Comey was also criticized for engaging in “ad hoc” decision making when sending a letter to Congress just days before the 2016 election saying that the FBI had reopened the matter, after discovering Clinton-related emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, a disgraced former congressman who was married to a Clinton aide.

Mr. Comey defended his actions to the inspector general by saying he had encountered unusual circumstances and did what he thought was best for the bureau and Justice Department. On Twitter, he wrote: “The conclusions are reasonable, even though I disagree with some. People of good faith can see an unprecedented situation differently. I pray no Director faces it again.”

In the course of its 18-month investigation, Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s staff also unearthed thousands of controversial text messages exchanged between Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel that disparaged Mr. Trump. The inspector general said his office was “deeply troubled” by the messages, which “potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations.”

“Departing so clearly and dramatically from FBI and Department norms, the decisions negatively impacted the perception of the FBI and the Department as fair administrators of justice,” the report concluded.

Of special focus in the report were FBI Agent Peter Strzok and now-former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who exchanged thousands of text messages over the course of 2015 through 2017. Mr. Strzok, who was romantically involved with Ms. Page, had led the Clinton probe and later was the top agent on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.

The texts “sowed doubt” about the FBI’s work, the report said, and “created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations.” Still, the inspector general discovered no evidence that “improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions” in the case.

The watchdog also examined how agents handled the discovery of Clinton-related emails on the laptop belonging to Mr. Weiner, and faulted the FBI for a monthlong delay between the discovery of the emails and investigative action by agents.

The inspector general said the texts raised questions about whether Mr. Strzok permitted political bias to cloud his judgment during one critical juncture in the investigation.

Mr. Strzok and FBI officials learned about the emails in late September 2016 but took no official action for nearly a month, the inspector general concluded.

According to the report, Mr. Strzok stated that he believed his message was intended to reassure Ms. Page, and not suggest that he would somehow stop Mr. Trump.

A lawyer for Mr. Strzok, Aitan Goelman, said in a statement that the inspector general correctly concluded “that there is no evidence that the political views of Special Agent Strzok and others in the FBI impacted the handling of the Clinton email investigation.”

justice_department,NPR Online News,1,http://www.npr.org/2013/06/06/188967230/holder-on-the-hot-seat-over-leak-investigations,Holder On The Hot Seat Over Leak Investigations,2013-06-06,Carrie Johnson,"Attorney General Eric Holder has been a lightning rod for the president 's fiercest critics during his four years in office . Lately , he 's been back on the hot seat with a crisis of his own making : the Justice Department 's aggressive stance toward reporters in national security leak cases .
Holder heads to the Senate on Thursday , where lawmakers are sure to demand an explanation .
Being in the center of the storm is nothing new for Holder . Even before he was confirmed by the Senate in 2009 , Republicans in Congress singled him out for criticism , says former spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler .
`` I think with some members of Congress — particularly some Republicans — the attorney general has been a favorite target of theirs , partly because he is the perfect proxy for the president , '' Schmaler says .
Schmaler says Holder has drawn all that attention because he 's one of the more left-leaning members of the Cabinet , and he 's personally close to President Obama and the first lady .
Meanwhile , over the past couple of decades , the job of attorney general has become more politicized . That 's something that makes Holder uncomfortable every time he goes to Capitol Hill , says onetime prosecutor and Senate lawyer Stephen Ryan .
`` The question is , '' says Ryan , `` Is the attorney general ready for people who punch wildly and below the belt on occasion , and land some blows that are quite honest and above the belt ? And so I think he 's got some problems that in the second term are hard to deal with . ''
One of those problems : Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee say they are investigating whether Holder gave false testimony when he told them last month that he had never been involved in charging a reporter with a crime . Later , word came that Holder approved court papers that called a Fox News reporter a possible co-conspirator in a national security leak case .
`` I do n't think there 's any issue about perjury , and I think that 's pure politics , '' says Republican lawyer Andrew McBride , who served in the Justice Department under Attorneys General Dick Thornburgh and William Barr . `` The president 's right about that . ''
But McBride says Republicans in Congress do have a legitimate beef about Holder 's treatment of reporters — especially a recently disclosed subpoena for the phone records of Associated Press reporters in another leak case . McBride says the Justice Department approved that subpoena through an internal process , without involving a judge or any neutral arbiter .
`` I think the larger question for the American people and our First Amendment freedoms really [ is ] : Is it time to give up the idea that the department can police itself on the issue of media subpoenas ? '' McBride says .
Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona told CBS ' Face the Nation that the attorney general needs to answer another question : `` Is he really able to effectively serve the president of the United States and the American people under the present circumstances ? That 's a decision he 'd have to make . ''

Attorney General Eric Holder has been a lightning rod for the president's fiercest critics during his four years in office. Lately, he's been back on the hot seat with a crisis of his own making: the Justice Department's aggressive stance toward reporters in national security leak cases.

Holder heads to the Senate on Thursday, where lawmakers are sure to demand an explanation.

Being in the center of the storm is nothing new for Holder. Even before he was confirmed by the Senate in 2009, Republicans in Congress singled him out for criticism, says former spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler.

""I think with some members of Congress — particularly some Republicans — the attorney general has been a favorite target of theirs, partly because he is the perfect proxy for the president,"" Schmaler says.

Schmaler says Holder has drawn all that attention because he's one of the more left-leaning members of the Cabinet, and he's personally close to President Obama and the first lady.

Meanwhile, over the past couple of decades, the job of attorney general has become more politicized. That's something that makes Holder uncomfortable every time he goes to Capitol Hill, says onetime prosecutor and Senate lawyer Stephen Ryan.

""The question is,"" says Ryan, ""Is the attorney general ready for people who punch wildly and below the belt on occasion, and land some blows that are quite honest and above the belt? And so I think he's got some problems that in the second term are hard to deal with.""

One of those problems: Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee say they are investigating whether Holder gave false testimony when he told them last month that he had never been involved in charging a reporter with a crime. Later, word came that Holder approved court papers that called a Fox News reporter a possible co-conspirator in a national security leak case.

""I don't think there's any issue about perjury, and I think that's pure politics,"" says Republican lawyer Andrew McBride, who served in the Justice Department under Attorneys General Dick Thornburgh and William Barr. ""The president's right about that.""

But McBride says Republicans in Congress do have a legitimate beef about Holder's treatment of reporters — especially a recently disclosed subpoena for the phone records of Associated Press reporters in another leak case. McBride says the Justice Department approved that subpoena through an internal process, without involving a judge or any neutral arbiter.

""I think the larger question for the American people and our First Amendment freedoms really [is]: Is it time to give up the idea that the department can police itself on the issue of media subpoenas?"" McBride says.

Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona told CBS' Face the Nation that the attorney general needs to answer another question: ""Is he really able to effectively serve the president of the United States and the American people under the present circumstances? That's a decision he'd have to make.""

Holder has survived close calls before, including uproar over his now-reversed decision to try the Sept. 11 attack plotters in New York City; controversy over civil rights cases; and the law enforcement gun-trafficking scandal known as Fast and Furious.

The difference this time is that the tactics against reporters have alienated the president's political base and prompted even liberal outlets like The Huffington Post to demand the attorney general's resignation.

Schmaler, Holder's former spokeswoman, says: Don't hold your breath.

""I don't see him leaving anytime other than when he plans to leave,"" Schmaler says.

Ryan, the veteran Washington lawyer, says he's not ready to offer a prediction on Holder's tenure. But he says the self-inflicted wounds at the Justice Department give Republicans another item on their laundry list of second-term scandals.

""It does give the Republican House the ability to paint in a pointillist way that the picture is of an administration in disarray or out of tune, and I think that that's damaging to the president, and it's damaging at the wrong time in his administration,"" Ryan says.

[pullquote]

And why not? After all, President Obama won reelection, his base hates the Tea Party anyway (and believes conservatives deserve any punishment they get), and the media had moved on to covering national catastrophes – like lane closures in New Jersey.

So it was time to end the pretense.

Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that the FBI did not expect to file any criminal charges in connection with the IRS’s admitted, systemic, multi-year targeting of conservative nonprofits for improper scrutiny.

To be clear, the FBI made this decision without interviewing even a single one of the American Center for Law and Justics’s 41 targeted clients. And we’re not alone. Other Tea Party attorneys report their clients weren’t interviewed either.

Put simply, the FBI leaked its conclusions in a criminal investigation without even interviewing the victims of the potential crime.

Inexcusable.

It’s inexcusable, but hardly surprising. After all, just days before the FBI leaked its determinations, the news broke that the Department of Justice attorney in charge of the investigation was a longtime, significant donor to President Obama.

She began her cycle of donations on January 30, 2008 – early in the primary season and just days after then-Senator Obama defeated Hillary Clinton in the South Carolina primary. Her donations totaled nearly $7,000 over the years – putting her in the top tier of financial contributors to President Obama’s campaigns.

Moreover, this partisan attorney came from the DOJ’s civil rights division, its most partisan division.

Reviewing the timeline, it’s easy to see how quickly the Obama Administration reversed course from public contrition and damage control to aggressive anti-conservative spin – and now to burying this scandal.

On May 10, 2013, the IRS’s Lois Lerner admitted to systematic targeting, blamed lower-level employees, and apologized on behalf of the IRS.

On May 14, with the media in full cry (for the first time in the Obama Administration), Attorney General Holder announced a criminal investigation, and the next day President Obama condemned IRS misconduct.

How quickly things changed.

In June, FBI Director Mueller was unable to even identify the lead investigator of the investigation. By July – only two months later – the IRS scandal transformed from a source of outrage to a “phony scandal,” with the President openly dismissing its significance in public statements.

In the months since, the message from the White House has been the same: Move along. Nothing to see here.

And throughout, our clients waited – patiently – for the phone to ring. And it didn’t ring until late December, more than seven months after Lois Lerner’s apology.

Then, before the first interview could be arranged, the news broke of the partisan investigator followed quickly by the news that the results were predetermined.

Representatives Darrell Issa and Jim Jordan are correct. It’s time to investigate the investigators. The Department of Justice’s Inspector General should launch his own investigation, and that investigation should answer a few, key questions:

Why didn’t the FBI interview the victims of the potential crime before making its determinations?

Why did the lead attorney’s record of partisan giving create an appearance of a conflict of interest within the meaning applicable federal regulations and local bar association rules?

How was the investigation conducted?

Did its conduct mirror that of other investigations, or was it cursory and conclusory – with a predetermined outcome?

Regardless of what ultimately happens in the criminal investigation, the Obama Administration is mistaken if it thinks it can use its considerable resources and executive discretion to insulate itself from accountability.

It may be able to appoint partisan investigators within the DOJ, stonewall congressional investigators (for now), and intensify efforts to publicly sweep this unlawful targeting scheme under the rug, but it still faces civil litigation and accountability before a federal judge.

Democrats are now increasingly slamming Republicans ’ handling of President Barack Obama ’ s nominee for attorney general , accusing them of slow-walking the veteran federal prosecutor ’ s confirmation . Their newest evidence : the Senate Judiciary Committee ’ s decision Thursday to postpone voting on Lynch until after next week ’ s recess — which means she won ’ t get a final floor vote until March , at least five weeks after her confirmation hearing .
The confirmation pace stands in especially stark contrast to how quickly the GOP-led Senate has taken up Ash Carter ’ s nomination for defense secretary . He first appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee Feb. 4 , was swiftly reported out of that panel earlier this week and is headed to a Thursday confirmation vote .
“ There ’ s so many similarities between the Lynch nomination and the Carter nomination , ” said Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) , one of Lynch ’ s biggest boosters . “ And to move Carter so quickly and to slow down Lynch is very troublesome , and I think they ought to move her ASAP . ”
One reason for the lag on Lynch is that after Obama nominated her in November , Senate Democrats agreed to postpone her confirmation into the new Republican-led chamber at the GOP ’ s request . Democrats meant it as a gesture of goodwill , and they also believed Lynch would be confirmed in either a Democratic- or GOP-controlled Senate .
But now the Democratic anger is beginning to flare up .
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) noted that Lynch has waited longer for a vote than any attorney general nominee in three decades . He urged Republicans to confirm Lynch , currently the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York , before next week ’ s congressional recess — a request that will go unheeded .
And Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy , who chaired Judiciary when Democrats were in power , said that despite his personal objections to former Attorney General Michael Mukasey under the George W. Bush administration , he moved the process along in just under eight weeks .
Republicans have said generally they have no beef with Lynch ’ s qualifications and résumé . But Republicans are using her nomination as one way to fight Obama over his executive actions on immigration , and they have also repeatedly pressed Lynch over issues involving current Attorney General Eric Holder — who has had a deeply contentious relationship with GOP lawmakers .
In an interview Wednesday , Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley ( R-Iowa ) , a frequent Holder critic , said he was still undecided on whether he would support Lynch but sent a strong signal that he was not pleased with the federal prosecutor ’ s responses so far .
“ She needs to show me and a lot of other members that she ’ s going to be a different attorney general than Holder , ” Grassley said in an interview . “ I haven ’ t come to that conclusion that she has , and that ’ s what I ’ m looking for . ”
Grassley , who sent Lynch a list of 81 questions — many of them multipart — said he plans to send some follow-up queries to her . On Monday , Lynch returned answers to hundreds of inquiries submitted by committee members , known formally as questions for the record — together , they form a 221-page document .
The partisan griping over process comes even though Lynch is expected to win support from both parties . Within Judiciary , Republican Sens . Orrin Hatch of Utah and Jeff Flake of Arizona have said they will support her . On Wednesday , Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) reiterated that he was inclined to back Lynch .
“ I think she ’ s a good nominee , ” Graham said . When asked if the committee vote on Lynch will be held over until later this month , he responded : “ I don ’ t know . I ’ m ready to vote . ”
Under the committee ’ s rules , any senator can ask for business , such as consideration of a nominee , to be held over for one week — a practice that doesn ’ t have to be deployed but has become routine . After Thursday ’ s delay , the next opportunity for a committee vote will be Feb. 26 .
Of the past five attorney general nominations taken up by the Judiciary Committee , only that of Alberto Gonzales was held over , according to Democrats .
Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R-Ala. ) , who sits on both Judiciary and Armed Services and has dealt directly with both the Carter and Lynch nominations , said the practice of holding over Judiciary Committee business for one week is “ reasonable and common. ” He also drew a contrast between the two candidates , noting that Carter has already served in senior Pentagon positions .
“ Mr . Carter has operated at the top levels of the Defense Department for a number of years at various different times and has earned the respect of people on both sides of the aisle , ” Sessions said . As for the attorney general position , Sessions added : “ I think there is growing unease of the politicizing of the office of the attorney general , and it ’ s very controversial . ”
Lynch has also contended that she has been treated fairly , at least during her hearing . In a response to Grassley in the written questions , she thanked the chairman for the “ respectful and courteous way that you chaired my confirmation hearing . ”
“ As she showed at her Senate hearing last month , U.S. Attorney Lynch has a distinguished record as a no-nonsense , career prosecutor , ” DOJ spokesman Brian Fallon said . “ Senators from both sides of the aisle have praised her as highly qualified and deserving of confirmation . We hope and expect the Senate will act on her nomination as quickly as possible . ”
At her hearing , Lynch impressed Democratic senators and picked up some support from Republicans , who have not protested her qualifications . But several GOP senators were frustrated with her defense of Obama ’ s controversial executive actions , which she testified are legal .
One of the committee ’ s newest Republicans , freshman Sen. David Perdue of Georgia , announced his opposition to Lynch in a statement Wednesday , adding that he “ strongly ” disagreed with Lynch ’ s support for Obama ’ s actions .
“ While Ms. Lynch may have an impressive résumé , she did not adequately answer the committee ’ s questions nor alleviate my concerns about the consistency with which she applies our nation ’ s laws , ” Perdue said . “ After thoroughly reviewing her record and testimony , I am not confident she will defend the Constitution , especially when the president seeks to abuse his power . ”
Senators put her through one more round of grilling through hundreds of written questions on issues spanning from immigration to war authorization , from enforcement of marijuana laws to guns , and other topics as esoteric as wildlife trafficking .
The attorney general nominee stayed on message — offering no new major revelations , repeatedly declining to weigh in on dicey policy matters and striking the same themes as her committee testimony last month .
More than once , Lynch promised that the Constitution will be her “ lodestar ” if she becomes the next attorney general — the prominent message of her opening remarks before the committee . And when Sen. John Cornyn ( R-Texas ) asked her to list three ways she would differ from Holder , Lynch stressed how she would bring her own approach in leading the Justice Department , such as “ fostering a new and improved relationship ” with Congress ; bolstering DOJ ’ s efforts on cybercrime ; and giving more attention to the “ scourge of human trafficking . ”
On the issue of oversight , Lynch also pledged to Flake that if she ’ s confirmed , she will work to improve DOJ ’ s response time for congressional inquiries . And she repeated multiple times that the department ’ s legal rationale for Obama ’ s sweeping executive actions on immigration is “ reasonable ” — a subject raised by numerous committee Republicans .
As she did before the committee , Lynch explained her answers through a legal lens , and she deferred answering questions about many hot-button issues — such as queries on voting rights laws and the immigration executive actions — since they are tied up in pending court cases .","The debate about confirming Loretta Lynch is suddenly getting partisan.

Democrats are now increasingly slamming Republicans’ handling of President Barack Obama’s nominee for attorney general, accusing them of slow-walking the veteran federal prosecutor’s confirmation. Their newest evidence: the Senate Judiciary Committee’s decision Thursday to postpone voting on Lynch until after next week’s recess — which means she won’t get a final floor vote until March, at least five weeks after her confirmation hearing.

The confirmation pace stands in especially stark contrast to how quickly the GOP-led Senate has taken up Ash Carter’s nomination for defense secretary. He first appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee Feb. 4, was swiftly reported out of that panel earlier this week and is headed to a Thursday confirmation vote.

But Republicans are using her nomination as one way to fight Obama over his executive actions on immigration, and they have also repeatedly pressed Lynch over issues involving current Attorney General Eric Holder — who has had a deeply contentious relationship with GOP lawmakers.

In an interview Wednesday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), a frequent Holder critic, said he was still undecided on whether he would support Lynch but sent a strong signal that he was not pleased with the federal prosecutor’s responses so far.

“She needs to show me and a lot of other members that she’s going to be a different attorney general than Holder,” Grassley said in an interview. “I haven’t come to that conclusion that she has, and that’s what I’m looking for.”

“I think she’s a good nominee,” Graham said. When asked if the committee vote on Lynch will be held over until later this month, he responded: “I don’t know. I’m ready to vote.”

Of the past five attorney general nominations taken up by the Judiciary Committee, only that of Alberto Gonzales was held over, according to Democrats.

Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who sits on both Judiciary and Armed Services and has dealt directly with both the Carter and Lynch nominations, said the practice of holding over Judiciary Committee business for one week is “reasonable and common.” He also drew a contrast between the two candidates, noting that Carter has already served in senior Pentagon positions.

“Mr. Carter has operated at the top levels of the Defense Department for a number of years at various different times and has earned the respect of people on both sides of the aisle,” Sessions said. As for the attorney general position, Sessions added: “I think there is growing unease of the politicizing of the office of the attorney general, and it’s very controversial.”

Lynch has also contended that she has been treated fairly, at least during her hearing. In a response to Grassley in the written questions, she thanked the chairman for the “respectful and courteous way that you chaired my confirmation hearing.”

The Justice Department on Wednesday urged a speedy confirmation.

“As she showed at her Senate hearing last month, U.S. Attorney Lynch has a distinguished record as a no-nonsense, career prosecutor,” DOJ spokesman Brian Fallon said. “Senators from both sides of the aisle have praised her as highly qualified and deserving of confirmation. We hope and expect the Senate will act on her nomination as quickly as possible.”

At her hearing, Lynch impressed Democratic senators and picked up some support from Republicans, who have not protested her qualifications. But several GOP senators were frustrated with her defense of Obama’s controversial executive actions, which she testified are legal.

One of the committee’s newest Republicans, freshman Sen. David Perdue of Georgia, announced his opposition to Lynch in a statement Wednesday, adding that he “strongly” disagreed with Lynch’s support for Obama’s actions.

“While Ms. Lynch may have an impressive résumé, she did not adequately answer the committee’s questions nor alleviate my concerns about the consistency with which she applies our nation’s laws,” Perdue said. “After thoroughly reviewing her record and testimony, I am not confident she will defend the Constitution, especially when the president seeks to abuse his power.”

Senators put her through one more round of grilling through hundreds of written questions on issues spanning from immigration to war authorization, from enforcement of marijuana laws to guns, and other topics as esoteric as wildlife trafficking.

The attorney general nominee stayed on message — offering no new major revelations, repeatedly declining to weigh in on dicey policy matters and striking the same themes as her committee testimony last month.

More than once, Lynch promised that the Constitution will be her “lodestar” if she becomes the next attorney general — the prominent message of her opening remarks before the committee. And when Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) asked her to list three ways she would differ from Holder, Lynch stressed how she would bring her own approach in leading the Justice Department, such as “fostering a new and improved relationship” with Congress; bolstering DOJ’s efforts on cybercrime; and giving more attention to the “scourge of human trafficking.”

On the issue of oversight, Lynch also pledged to Flake that if she’s confirmed, she will work to improve DOJ’s response time for congressional inquiries. And she repeated multiple times that the department’s legal rationale for Obama’s sweeping executive actions on immigration is “reasonable” — a subject raised by numerous committee Republicans.

As she did before the committee, Lynch explained her answers through a legal lens, and she deferred answering questions about many hot-button issues — such as queries on voting rights laws and the immigration executive actions — since they are tied up in pending court cases.

Certain public interest groups, like charities and nonprofit athletic organizations, do not have to pay federal income tax on their donations or dues. These tax-exempt groups include 501(c)(4) organizations (named for the relevant section of the code). To qualify, a group must be ""operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare."" The definition of ""social welfare"" is broad, and applies to all points of view. The ACLU's lobbying arm, for which we work, is a 501(c)(4). So is the National Right to Life Committee.

US President Donald Trump's top lawyer is under criminal investigation, the US justice department has announced.

Prosecutors say they are focusing on Michael Cohen's business dealings rather than his work as a lawyer.

Mr Cohen has been under investigation for months, the court filing says.

The filing was in response to efforts by Mr Cohen's own lawyer to stop prosecutors reviewing material seized from Mr Cohen's office on Monday.

Mr Cohen's team argues that the papers are covered by the attorney-client privilege.

President Trump has condemned the office raid, calling it ""disgraceful"" and ""an attack on our country"".

During a court hearing in New York on Friday, prosecutor Tom McKay accused Mr Cohen of trying to use attorney-client privilege ""as a sword to challenge the government's ability to review evidence"".

Government prosecutors also said they believed Mr Cohen had ""a low volume of potentially privileged communication"" because he seems to only have one client - President Trump.

""It is neither apparent that Cohen, in his capacity as an attorney, has many, or any, attorney-client relationships other than with President Donald Trump,"" the filing said.

It added that while Mr Cohen was an attorney, ""he also has several other business interests and sources of income"", and is ""being investigated for criminal conduct that largely centres on his personal business dealings"".

A new lawyer for President Trump, Joanna Hendon, said the president had an ""acute interest"" in the case. Ms Hendon, who was hired on Wednesday, asked the judge to adjourn the session so she had more time to prepare.

According to a New York Times report, the president phoned Mr Cohen to ""check in"" on him today.

Elliott Broidy, a Los Angeles investor, acknowledged ""a consensual relationship"" with the Playmate, who became pregnant.

Mr Broidy said it was ""unfortunate"" that the personal matter was ""the subject of national discussion"" because of the involvement of Mr Cohen.

A subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs released a scathing report on Thursday that effectively confirmed many of the ethical allegations that have trailed Charles Edwards ever since he resigned his post in December as acting DHS inspector general . The report determined that he `` jeopardized the independence '' of his office by socializing with senior DHS officials and had reports `` altered or delayed '' to accommodate the department he was supposed to oversee .
In the wake of the report , DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson announced that Edwards , who after leaving the acting IG post took a different job at DHS , would be placed on administrative leave .

Though the war in Afghanistan continues , the Obama administration has , in many ways , already begun to turn the Pentagon toward a new set of challenges . Mr. Obama 's address to the National Defense University Thursday spoke to the strategic parts of that shift – from stricter rules for drone strikes to new rules for the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay .
But the president 's speech the next day to graduates of the US Naval Academy in Annapolis , Md. , stressed that stamping out an epidemic of sexual assault within the military must also be a primary goal . Secretary Hagel made the same point Saturday in a speech to graduates at the US Military Academy in West Point , N.Y .
There is ample evidence to suggest that no solution will be easy or quick . A survey released earlier this month suggests that 26,000 people in the military were sexually assaulted in the previous year – a rate of 70 a day . Moreover , only 3,400 incidents were reported , suggesting a widespread lack of confidence in the military justice system on the issue .
Due to a lack of research , the trend line is unclear . The current number is up from the previous year ( 19,000 ) but down from 2006 ( 34,000 ) .
Meanwhile , recent weeks have brought a flood of troubling allegations . This month , two members of military sexual-assault prevention units – one for the Air Force and one at the Army 's Fort Hood in Texas – have been accused of sexual assault . And last week , a sergeant at West Point was charged with secretly videotaping female cadets in the shower .
Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D ) of Missouri has introduced a bill to ensure that “ never again will a victim have to salute an assaulter , '' according to NBC News . It would require a member of the military who has been found guilty of sexual assault to be dismissed or dishonorably discharged . While it would also prohibit a commander from nullifying or changing a sexual-assault conviction , it would not remove sexual-assault cases from the chain of command entirely .
That has been a point of contention for critics , who note that commanders often reduce or eliminate punishments resulting from sexual-assault investigations . To address this , a competing bill by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D ) of New York would create a separate procedure for dealing with sexual-assault cases .
But Pentagon officials strongly resist the idea of taking control out of the hands of commanders , saying such a move would undermine unit cohesiveness and discipline . Hagel , too , has said he is against removing sex-assault cases from the chain of command .
Yet experts say it is crucial to change the way the Pentagon looks at sexual assault . Currently , the military treats sexual assault as a women 's issue , retired Maj. Gen. Robert Shadley tells The Washington Post . Instead , it should treat the charges as a `` force protection issue . ''
“ This is not a women ’ s rights issue , it ’ s an abuse of power , '' says Shadley , who presided over the Army 's Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland during a sex-assault scandal in the 1990s . `` We should have the same person who ’ s worried about protecting soldiers from enemy attack in charge of protecting soldiers from sexual predators . Until you make prevention of sexual assault a part of everyday life of the organization , it ’ s going to be considered a secondary thing . ”
His proposed solution is to put sexual-assault prevention in the hands of each unit 's chief operations officer . At the moment , these efforts are handled by specialized units , which has the effect of marginalizing the issue , he says . `` This has got to be an operational issue . ”
Others suggest that the prohibition against women in combat also has a corrosive effect . For one , in an organization built on the premise of warfighting , those who are barred from serving in combat zones are seen as second-class citizens and lose a degree of respect .
`` That reinforced the traditional notion [ among men in uniform ] that there are differences between men and women : 'Women are not our equals , ' `` David Segal , a military sociologist at the University of Maryland in College Park , tells USA Today. `` 'They 're not allowed to be 100 percent soldiers . They 're not part of our culture . ' ``

But the ban on women in combat might also have another effect . Without being able to serve in combat , women in the military face a glass ceiling . Obama could appoint more women to Pentagon posts , but women 's ability to rise through the ranks in the military itself is affected by the ban .
“ Quite frankly , we need to have people like [ Obama adviser ] Valerie Jarrett and Michelle Obama in the room , ” Ana Cruz , a Democratic strategist , told Politico . “ You can ’ t have a bunch of men sitting around a table talking about this issue when it clearly goes to the heart of violating women ’ s rights . ”","On consecutive days, President Obama and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel have told the next generation of military leaders that sexual assault is threatening the dignity and effectiveness of the force.

Mccarthy, John Mccormack, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Mairead Mcardle, Robert Verbruggen, Carrie Severino, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry, John Fund","Trump wanted Comey to state publicly what he had insinuated to the president privately : that Trump was not a suspect .
Andrew McCabe is a good witness and he made a favorable impression , at least on me , in his 60 Minutes interview with Scott Pelley . Pelley and his editors did a great job highlighting McCabe ’ s down-to-earth likability . Unlike Jim Comey , a career prosecutor and corporate lawyer before he became FBI director , former deputy director McCabe is a career agent ; his relation of events smacks of the Bureau ’ s “ just the facts , ma ’ am ” ethos . And McCabe ’ s account of Trump telling him to ask his wife what it was like to be a “ loser ” ( after she lost a Virginia state senate race ) is devastating , precisely because it sounds just like something Trump would say .
First , Pelley failed to ask him the screamingly obvious questions : What about Russia did Trump want included in Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein ’ s memo supporting Comey ’ s dismissal ? McCabe obliquely said Trump wanted Rosenstein “ to put Russia in ” the memo about Comey ( I ’ m quoting from memory ) . But Pelley never asked what in particular about Russia Trump wanted included . What about Russia was Trump referring to when he spoke — in conversations with NBC News and Russian diplomats — of Russia ’ s part in Comey ’ s firing ? Pelley highlighted the word “ Russia , ” but he sidestepped what Trump was concerned about regarding Russia .
The viewer was thus left to conclude , from McCabe ’ s other comments , that Trump must have fired the FBI director because he was fearful of the Bureau ’ s investigation of Russia ’ s interference in the election ; because he was concerned that the FBI would find that Russia intended to benefit Trump and would therefore deduce that Trump was complicit .
But that is misleading . We know that what Trump wanted made public was something very specific about Russia , namely , that Comey repeatedly told the president he was not a suspect in the Russia investigation . Trump was frustrated — over time , ballistic — over the fact that Comey was privately telling him that he was not under investigation , yet making statements that would lead the public to believe Trump was suspected of conspiring in Russia ’ s hacking operations . Trump wanted Comey to state publicly that he was not a suspect ; Comey ’ s refusal to do so made no sense to the president , especially after Comey gratuitously implied , in his stunning March 2017 House testimony , that Trump was a suspect .
Pelley never asked McCabe about this . It might have been interesting . McCabe ’ s statements in the interview support the theory I have long posited here : Trump was always the main subject in the investigation . The real reason Comey did not want to repeat publicly the assurances he made to Trump privately is that these assurances were misleading . The FBI strung Trump along , telling him he was not a suspect while structuring the investigation in accordance with the reality that Trump was the main subject . This is why , as Comey conceded in Senate testimony , a member of his advisory team was very uncomfortable with the director ’ s decision to assure Trump he was not a suspect . ( See the last section of my column , here . ) Just because the president ’ s name was not put on the file , just because he was not named as the intended target of a surveillance warrant , did not mean that they were not investigating him . They were hoping to surveil him incidentally , and they were trying to make a case on him . I believe that a big part of the reason Comey did not inform the congressional Gang of Eight about the investigation ( even though such sensitive matters are what the Gang of Eight is for ) is that he would not have been able to explain the contradiction of claiming both that the FBI was investigating the Trump campaign for complicity with Russia to help Trump win and that Trump himself was not a suspect .
Obviously , what Trump wanted Rosenstein to put in his memo was not just anything about Russia but specifically that Comey had said Trump was not a suspect . We know that because Trump put on Rosenstein ’ s memo a cover letter pointing out that Comey had told him three times that he was not a suspect .
When Trump spoke to NBC , he explicitly said he was not shutting the Russia investigation down ; he simply did not trust Comey to do it right . Trump even acknowledged that the effect of firing Comey might be to “ expand ” and “ lengthen ” the investigation but that this was worth it because he lacked confidence in Comey . One can disagree with Trump ’ s assessment of Comey ’ s capabilities . ( I know from experience that Comey is highly capable . ) But Trump is president , he gets to make that judgment , and making it does not mean he is obstructing an investigation , especially when he took no steps to limit it . ( McCabe ’ s suggestion that the Russia investigation might have disappeared if he didn ’ t open an investigation of Trump after Comey ’ s firing is absurd . )
While Trump ’ s abomination of Comey in remarks to the Russian diplomats was disgraceful , his statement that removing Comey relieved pressure on him owing to Russia did not mean Comey ’ s removal ended the Russia investigation . Again , he never took any step to close or even restrict the investigation ; in his mind , the pressure was off him because he was finally able to inform the American people that their president was not suspected of a traitorous conspiracy with the Kremlin — information he was livid at Comey for withholding .
The second big problem with McCabe ’ s story involves his stated fear that Trump could be interfering in the FBI ’ s probe of Russia ’ s interference in the election . This brings us to my oft-rehearsed focus on salient differences between counterintelligence and criminal investigations .
Let ’ s put aside that Trump has never lifted a finger to prevent the FBI and other intelligence agencies from examining Russia ’ s meddling in the campaign . It is illogical to speak of a president obstructing a counterintelligence investigation . Unlike criminal investigations , which are designed to uphold the rule of law through court prosecution , counterintelligence investigations are done strictly for the president ’ s benefit . They gather intelligence in order to help the president carry out his mission to protect the nation against foreign threats . In our constitutional system , that mission is assigned to the president , not to the FBI — notwithstanding McCabe ’ s apparent belief to the contrary . If the president suddenly decided that quite enough investigation had been done to determine the nature and extent of Russia ’ s election interference , and that he wanted those intelligence resources to be targeted at other threats , that would be his call to make .
You could argue that it was a foolish call , even a reckless one . I thought it was reckless for President Obama to ignore intelligence that Iran was the world ’ s leading state sponsor of terrorism so that he could cut a naïve nuclear deal with Tehran ; but that was his call to make — the American people having elected him to be responsible for our security against foreign threats .
Significantly , it would be different if McCabe had said that the FBI had a factual basis in evidence to believe that Trump was complicit in a criminal conspiracy with the Kremlin . In that situation , if Trump tried to restrict or shut down the probe , he would be obstructing a criminal investigation into his own suspected crimes . But McCabe does not make that claim . He concedes , instead , that FBI agents were conducting a counterintelligence investigation in which they suspected that Russia favored Trump in the election but did not claim to have evidence that Trump was complicit in any violations of criminal law .
As to Trump , then , the FBI was not conducting a criminal investigation that the firing of Comey could conceivably have obstructed . The Bureau was conducting a counterintelligence investigation , which is done in support of the president ’ s constitutional duties .

Trump wanted Comey to state publicly what he had insinuated to the president privately: that Trump was not a suspect.

Andrew McCabe is a good witness and he made a favorable impression, at least on me, in his 60 Minutes interview with Scott Pelley. Pelley and his editors did a great job highlighting McCabe’s down-to-earth likability. Unlike Jim Comey, a career prosecutor and corporate lawyer before he became FBI director, former deputy director McCabe is a career agent; his relation of events smacks of the Bureau’s “just the facts, ma’am” ethos. And McCabe’s account of Trump telling him to ask his wife what it was like to be a “loser” (after she lost a Virginia state senate race) is devastating, precisely because it sounds just like something Trump would say.

That aside, there are problems with McCabe’s story.

First, Pelley failed to ask him the screamingly obvious questions: What about Russia did Trump want included in Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s memo supporting Comey’s dismissal? McCabe obliquely said Trump wanted Rosenstein “to put Russia in” the memo about Comey (I’m quoting from memory). But Pelley never asked what in particular about Russia Trump wanted included. What about Russia was Trump referring to when he spoke — in conversations with NBC News and Russian diplomats — of Russia’s part in Comey’s firing? Pelley highlighted the word “Russia,” but he sidestepped what Trump was concerned about regarding Russia.

The viewer was thus left to conclude, from McCabe’s other comments, that Trump must have fired the FBI director because he was fearful of the Bureau’s investigation of Russia’s interference in the election; because he was concerned that the FBI would find that Russia intended to benefit Trump and would therefore deduce that Trump was complicit.

But that is misleading. We know that what Trump wanted made public was something very specific about Russia, namely, that Comey repeatedly told the president he was not a suspect in the Russia investigation. Trump was frustrated — over time, ballistic — over the fact that Comey was privately telling him that he was not under investigation, yet making statements that would lead the public to believe Trump was suspected of conspiring in Russia’s hacking operations. Trump wanted Comey to state publicly that he was not a suspect; Comey’s refusal to do so made no sense to the president, especially after Comey gratuitously implied, in his stunning March 2017 House testimony, that Trump was a suspect.

Pelley never asked McCabe about this. It might have been interesting. McCabe’s statements in the interview support the theory I have long posited here: Trump was always the main subject in the investigation. The real reason Comey did not want to repeat publicly the assurances he made to Trump privately is that these assurances were misleading. The FBI strung Trump along, telling him he was not a suspect while structuring the investigation in accordance with the reality that Trump was the main subject. This is why, as Comey conceded in Senate testimony, a member of his advisory team was very uncomfortable with the director’s decision to assure Trump he was not a suspect. (See the last section of my column, here.) Just because the president’s name was not put on the file, just because he was not named as the intended target of a surveillance warrant, did not mean that they were not investigating him. They were hoping to surveil him incidentally, and they were trying to make a case on him. I believe that a big part of the reason Comey did not inform the congressional Gang of Eight about the investigation (even though such sensitive matters are what the Gang of Eight is for) is that he would not have been able to explain the contradiction of claiming both that the FBI was investigating the Trump campaign for complicity with Russia to help Trump win and that Trump himself was not a suspect.

Obviously, what Trump wanted Rosenstein to put in his memo was not just anything about Russia but specifically that Comey had said Trump was not a suspect. We know that because Trump put on Rosenstein’s memo a cover letter pointing out that Comey had told him three times that he was not a suspect.

When Trump spoke to NBC, he explicitly said he was not shutting the Russia investigation down; he simply did not trust Comey to do it right. Trump even acknowledged that the effect of firing Comey might be to “expand” and “lengthen” the investigation but that this was worth it because he lacked confidence in Comey. One can disagree with Trump’s assessment of Comey’s capabilities. (I know from experience that Comey is highly capable.) But Trump is president, he gets to make that judgment, and making it does not mean he is obstructing an investigation, especially when he took no steps to limit it. (McCabe’s suggestion that the Russia investigation might have disappeared if he didn’t open an investigation of Trump after Comey’s firing is absurd.)

While Trump’s abomination of Comey in remarks to the Russian diplomats was disgraceful, his statement that removing Comey relieved pressure on him owing to Russia did not mean Comey’s removal ended the Russia investigation. Again, he never took any step to close or even restrict the investigation; in his mind, the pressure was off him because he was finally able to inform the American people that their president was not suspected of a traitorous conspiracy with the Kremlin — information he was livid at Comey for withholding.

The second big problem with McCabe’s story involves his stated fear that Trump could be interfering in the FBI’s probe of Russia’s interference in the election. This brings us to my oft-rehearsed focus on salient differences between counterintelligence and criminal investigations.

Let’s put aside that Trump has never lifted a finger to prevent the FBI and other intelligence agencies from examining Russia’s meddling in the campaign. It is illogical to speak of a president obstructing a counterintelligence investigation. Unlike criminal investigations, which are designed to uphold the rule of law through court prosecution, counterintelligence investigations are done strictly for the president’s benefit. They gather intelligence in order to help the president carry out his mission to protect the nation against foreign threats. In our constitutional system, that mission is assigned to the president, not to the FBI — notwithstanding McCabe’s apparent belief to the contrary. If the president suddenly decided that quite enough investigation had been done to determine the nature and extent of Russia’s election interference, and that he wanted those intelligence resources to be targeted at other threats, that would be his call to make.

You could argue that it was a foolish call, even a reckless one. I thought it was reckless for President Obama to ignore intelligence that Iran was the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism so that he could cut a naïve nuclear deal with Tehran; but that was his call to make — the American people having elected him to be responsible for our security against foreign threats.

Significantly, it would be different if McCabe had said that the FBI had a factual basis in evidence to believe that Trump was complicit in a criminal conspiracy with the Kremlin. In that situation, if Trump tried to restrict or shut down the probe, he would be obstructing a criminal investigation into his own suspected crimes. But McCabe does not make that claim. He concedes, instead, that FBI agents were conducting a counterintelligence investigation in which they suspected that Russia favored Trump in the election but did not claim to have evidence that Trump was complicit in any violations of criminal law.

As to Trump, then, the FBI was not conducting a criminal investigation that the firing of Comey could conceivably have obstructed. The Bureau was conducting a counterintelligence investigation, which is done in support of the president’s constitutional duties. It is up to the president, not the FBI, to determine what the president’s intelligence needs are. (By McCabe’s lights, a mid-level FBI supervisor can shut down a counterintelligence investigation conducted for the purpose of informing the president, but the president himself may not interfere in any way.)

In any event, the president merely removed the FBI director, which he did not need any reason to do; which he is empowered to do at will, even for dumb reasons. Trump did not order the Russia investigation closed or restricted. And to the extent he said the Russia investigation played a role in Comey’s firing, he was clearly referring to Comey’s refusal to state publicly what he was assuring the president privately — that the president was not a suspect.",www.nationalreview.com,right,V71dq3fQs3ij80zG

Judge grants Pistorius bail; sentencing starts on October 13

Sentencing will come after more legal argument

A judge found Oscar Pistorius guilty Friday of culpable homicide, the South African term for unintentionally, but unlawfully, killing a person. It's akin to negligent killing.

A day before the verdict, Judge Thokozile Masipa cleared him of murder in the killing of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.

His sentencing starts on October 13, the judge said after granting him bail.

There is no minimum sentence for culpable homicide in South African law, so it will be up to the judge to decide.

The verdict also dealt with three other charges, all weapons-related.

""His conduct was negligent"" and not what a reasonable man would do in the circumstances -- not even a disabled one, she said.

Defense arguments that his upbringing ""in a crime-riddled environment and in a home where the mother was paranoid and always carried a firearm"" might explain his conduct that night, but ""it does not excuse the conduct,"" Masipa said.

""The accused had reasonable time to reflect, to think and to conduct himself reasonably,"" she said.

Not guilty of murder

Masipa on Thursday found Pistorius not guilty of murder, premeditated or otherwise.

She said the prosecution had failed to prove its case that Pistorius and Steenkamp argued on the night of the killing, and that the Olympic track star then shot her in a rage.

Masipa was not persuaded by the testimony of neighbors who said they heard shouting, screaming and shots.

The neighbors' stories do not match the timings on phone records the night of the killing, she concluded, saying: ""Technology is more reliable than human perception and human memory.""

She said she believed media coverage had contaminated testimonies, and that state witnesses were in and out of sleep the night of the killing.

She knocked down other key aspects of the state's case: the fact that Steenkamp took her phone and locked herself in the bathroom allegedly out of fear for her safety, phone messages between the couple that showed some rocky patches, and stomach contents that might suggest the victim ate later than Pistorius said.

What would you do if the IRS wanted to see your interactions on social media?

At least one Tea Party group in Ohio received just such a request.

Story Continued Below

Regardless of the outcome, legal experts anticipate that the 5th Circuit's ruling will be appealed to the Supreme Court. If the courts ultimately strike down Obamacare — over the objections of a group of Democrat-led states, which have spent more than a year defending the health law in court — the consequences could be substantial for patients, health care organizations and other groups that have adapted to the nine-year-old law.

More than 20 million Americans are covered through the ACA's Medicaid expansion and its insurance exchanges. The sweeping law — the object of repeated legal challenges since its 2010 passage — has transformed the nation's health system, creating new patient protections and reshaping payments for doctors and hospitals.

Some of the Trump administration's proposed drug price reforms depend on provisions contained in the ACA. Senior Trump health officials haven't detailed how they would respond if all of Obamacare is struck down.

The GOP-led states that initially brought the lawsuit, Texas v. United States, had called for the entire law to be invalidated because Congress eliminated its individual insurance mandate penalty — an argument that swayed U.S. District Court Judge Reed O’Connor, a George W. Bush appointee.

The Trump administration had previously argued that only elements of the ACA, like its protections for patients with pre-existing conditions, should be struck down but that other parts of the law could stand.

justice_department,Salon,0,http://www.salon.com/2013/05/22/who_is_company_doe_a_new_test_in_corporate_secrecy/,Corporations accused of wrongdoing win battle to keep identities secret,2013-05-22,Alex Seitz-Wald,"If you look at the redacted decision a federal judge in the District Court of Maryland handed down last October , you would think it involves a classified CIA program , burying all pertinent information -- sometimes almost entire pages -- under black boxes .
But the case isn ’ t about a secret weapons program -- it ’ s about baby strollers or kitchen appliances or action figures or some other consumer product . But we don ’ t actually know because everything , from the name of the company involved to the product it makes , is secret , thanks to a potentially unprecedented court ruling that consumer advocates fear could set a standard of allowing corporations to challenge actions they don ’ t like without even revealing their names . Welcome to the “ Company Doe ” case .
In 2008 , after a spate of high-profile recalls of lead-tainted toys from China and other products , Congress passed a law to beef up the Consumer Product Safety Commission , an independent federal agency that regulates everything from baby cribs to ATVs to swimming pools -- over 15,000 different products , altogether . The law also created a user-friendly online database aimed at making it easier for consumers to learn about potentially dangerous products by centralizing government reports and allowing any consumer to post his or her own complaints .
The whole point of the database is transparency . It can take months for the agency ’ s investigations to run their course , and companies have a great deal of control over any eventual recall or public action , so the idea of the database was to close the gap between what the agency knows and what the public knows -- “ letting the sun shine in , ” as CPSC chairwoman Inez Moore Tenenbaum said in a speech last year .
So it ’ s ironic that the very first lawsuit challenging the database could become a test case on corporate secrecy .
In October of 2011 , a company asked a federal court to stop the agency from including in its database a report filed by a local government agency of alleged harm to a consumer . It was the first such suit , but was generally expected , as manufacturers fought the creation of the database tooth and nail . But what ’ s unusual is that the plaintiff called itself “ Company Doe ” and asked the judge to litigate the entire case under seal and under pseudonym so as to protect it from the taint of perceived impropriety .
Balking at this secrecy , a coalition of consumer advocacy groups intervened in the case and filed a motion to unmask the company . They didn ’ t hear anything for nine months after their first filing . Then , in July of 2012 , they were told that not only had the court rejected their effort to unseal the records , but that the case had already been decided in favor of “ Company Doe ” -- all in total secret . A few months after that came a heavily redacted decision , blacking out the name of the company , the type of product , the local government agency that reported the problem , the potential harm and all other potentially identifying information .
“ As far as we can tell , it ’ s unprecedented , ” Scott Michelman , an attorney at Public Citizen who is leading the consumer groups ’ litigation , told ███ . “ We know of no case anywhere in the country in which companies have been allowed to proceed under a pseudonym , just to protect its reputation . ”
This kind of secrecy is common in grand jury proceedings , national security cases and criminal cases to protect the identify of sexual assault victims , legal experts say , but highly unusual beyond that .
“ We ’ re concerned that this decision has the potential to set a very dangerous precedent allowing companies to use the court system to attack government or private action that they don ’ t like , all under the cloak of secrecy , ” Michelman said .
During those nine months , behind closed doors , Company Doe and the government went back and forth through several rounds of litigation . The CPSC revised the report to reflect the company ’ s concerns , but Company Doe wasn ’ t satisfied . Both sides conducted scientific analyses , there were more revisions , and eventually the court ruled in favor of the company , granting its requested injunction to stop the publishing of the report in the database and upholding the right of Company Doe to remain anonymous .
Mysteriously , the government decided not to appeal the decision . Scott Wolfson , a spokesman for the agency , told ███ that because all the facts of the case are under seal , he couldn ’ t explain why the government had decided to forgo an appeal . Still , he said , “ We stand by the database . ”
“ The decision published by the judge concerning one incident reported to the saferproducts.gov consumer database does nothing to change the agency ’ s statutory mandate and enduring commitment to provide the public with a timely and searchable database containing reports of harm relating to the use of consumer products , ” he said .
But Public Citizen , along with the Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union , the publisher of Consumer Reports , stepped in to appeal , filing their final motion Monday in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals . Joining their cause are many of the largest media organizations in the country , including the New York Times and the Washington Post , along with the ACLU , all of whom worry about a dangerous precedent of corporate secrecy .
Rick Marcus , a professor at the University of California 's Hastings College of the Law who studies complex and unusual litigation , said in an email that it ’ s hard to think of a similar case to Company Doe , but cautioned that the secrecy may not be as nefarious as consumer advocates fear , pointing to cases that keep sexual assault victims anonymous , for instance . “ Sometimes what 's good for the goose is not good for the gander . I am doubtful that judges are often granting anonymity or sealing things without good reason , ” he said .
Still , everyone agrees that the secrecy is unusual . “ The ultimate irony with all of this is that the database is all about transparency , ” Rachel Weintraub , a lawyer at the Consumer Federation of America , told ███ . “ So much of this seems unprecedented and unfamiliar . ”
Leading Company Doe ’ s legal challenge is well-connected Washington attorney Baruch Fellner of the powerhouse law firm Gibson Dunn . Not surprisingly , he ’ s staying pretty mum . “ We are being very , very circumspect since we represent Company Doe in a sealed matter , ” Fellner told ███ , referring us to public court documents . “ Beyond that , I ’ m really not prepared to speak . ”
The case comes after manufacturers and their Republican allies in Congress put up an unusually strong fight against the database . Industry groups spent $ 16 million on lobbying in an effort to kill or weaken the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 , but it passed the House 407-0 and the Senate approved the bill 79-13 .
That all changed after the Tea Party wave of 2010 , however , when newly elected lawmakers saw the database as a classic example of government regulatory overreach into private business . California Republican Rep. Mary Bono Mack called it “ puzzling , head-scratching decisions , which create economic hardships for U.S. businesses , without appreciably improving the safety of certain products . ''
“ How quickly they forget ” the spate of recalls that led to the creation of the database , the New York Times chided in a 2011 editorial . “ The new Republican-led House seems determined to roll back those protections . As part of their slash-and-burn continuing resolution , they cut all the financing -- some $ 3 million this year -- for a core provision of the safety bill : a database where consumers could report product hazards and the public could check products before buying them . ”
Even the infamous Koch brothers got involved . As the Sunlight Foundation reported , the Kochs lobbied against the database and Kansas Republican Rep. Mike Pompeo , whose district includes Koch Industries ( which also happens to be his biggest donor ) , proposed the successful amendment to completely defund the database . Pompeo ’ s chief of staff , Mark Chenoweth , used to work for Koch Industries . After that , he was the chief legal counsel for Anne Northup , a Republican CPSC commissioner who has vocally opposed the database as a job-killing travesty .

But the case isn’t about a secret weapons program -- it’s about baby strollers or kitchen appliances or action figures or some other consumer product. But we don’t actually know because everything, from the name of the company involved to the product it makes, is secret, thanks to a potentially unprecedented court ruling that consumer advocates fear could set a standard of allowing corporations to challenge actions they don’t like without even revealing their names. Welcome to the “Company Doe” case.

In 2008, after a spate of high-profile recalls of lead-tainted toys from China and other products, Congress passed a law to beef up the Consumer Product Safety Commission, an independent federal agency that regulates everything from baby cribs to ATVs to swimming pools -- over 15,000 different products, altogether. The law also created a user-friendly online database aimed at making it easier for consumers to learn about potentially dangerous products by centralizing government reports and allowing any consumer to post his or her own complaints.

The whole point of the database is transparency. It can take months for the agency’s investigations to run their course, and companies have a great deal of control over any eventual recall or public action, so the idea of the database was to close the gap between what the agency knows and what the public knows -- “letting the sun shine in,” as CPSC chairwoman Inez Moore Tenenbaum said in a speech last year.

So it’s ironic that the very first lawsuit challenging the database could become a test case on corporate secrecy.

In October of 2011, a company asked a federal court to stop the agency from including in its database a report filed by a local government agency of alleged harm to a consumer. It was the first such suit, but was generally expected, as manufacturers fought the creation of the database tooth and nail. But what’s unusual is that the plaintiff called itself “Company Doe” and asked the judge to litigate the entire case under seal and under pseudonym so as to protect it from the taint of perceived impropriety.

Balking at this secrecy, a coalition of consumer advocacy groups intervened in the case and filed a motion to unmask the company. They didn’t hear anything for nine months after their first filing. Then, in July of 2012, they were told that not only had the court rejected their effort to unseal the records, but that the case had already been decided in favor of “Company Doe” -- all in total secret. A few months after that came a heavily redacted decision, blacking out the name of the company, the type of product, the local government agency that reported the problem, the potential harm and all other potentially identifying information.

“As far as we can tell, it’s unprecedented,” Scott Michelman, an attorney at Public Citizen who is leading the consumer groups’ litigation, told Salon. “We know of no case anywhere in the country in which companies have been allowed to proceed under a pseudonym, just to protect its reputation.”

This kind of secrecy is common in grand jury proceedings, national security cases and criminal cases to protect the identify of sexual assault victims, legal experts say, but highly unusual beyond that.

“We’re concerned that this decision has the potential to set a very dangerous precedent allowing companies to use the court system to attack government or private action that they don’t like, all under the cloak of secrecy,” Michelman said.

During those nine months, behind closed doors, Company Doe and the government went back and forth through several rounds of litigation. The CPSC revised the report to reflect the company’s concerns, but Company Doe wasn’t satisfied. Both sides conducted scientific analyses, there were more revisions, and eventually the court ruled in favor of the company, granting its requested injunction to stop the publishing of the report in the database and upholding the right of Company Doe to remain anonymous.

Mysteriously, the government decided not to appeal the decision. Scott Wolfson, a spokesman for the agency, told Salon that because all the facts of the case are under seal, he couldn’t explain why the government had decided to forgo an appeal. Still, he said, “We stand by the database.”

“The decision published by the judge concerning one incident reported to the saferproducts.gov consumer database does nothing to change the agency’s statutory mandate and enduring commitment to provide the public with a timely and searchable database containing reports of harm relating to the use of consumer products,” he said.

But Public Citizen, along with the Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, stepped in to appeal, filing their final motion Monday in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. Joining their cause are many of the largest media organizations in the country, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, along with the ACLU, all of whom worry about a dangerous precedent of corporate secrecy.

Rick Marcus, a professor at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law who studies complex and unusual litigation, said in an email that it’s hard to think of a similar case to Company Doe, but cautioned that the secrecy may not be as nefarious as consumer advocates fear, pointing to cases that keep sexual assault victims anonymous, for instance. “Sometimes what's good for the goose is not good for the gander. I am doubtful that judges are often granting anonymity or sealing things without good reason,” he said.

Still, everyone agrees that the secrecy is unusual. “The ultimate irony with all of this is that the database is all about transparency,” Rachel Weintraub, a lawyer at the Consumer Federation of America, told Salon. “So much of this seems unprecedented and unfamiliar.”

Leading Company Doe’s legal challenge is well-connected Washington attorney Baruch Fellner of the powerhouse law firm Gibson Dunn. Not surprisingly, he’s staying pretty mum. “We are being very, very circumspect since we represent Company Doe in a sealed matter,” Fellner told Salon, referring us to public court documents. “Beyond that, I’m really not prepared to speak.”

The case comes after manufacturers and their Republican allies in Congress put up an unusually strong fight against the database. Industry groups spent $16 million on lobbying in an effort to kill or weaken the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, but it passed the House 407-0 and the Senate approved the bill 79-13.

That all changed after the Tea Party wave of 2010, however, when newly elected lawmakers saw the database as a classic example of government regulatory overreach into private business. California Republican Rep. Mary Bono Mack called it “puzzling, head-scratching decisions, which create economic hardships for U.S. businesses, without appreciably improving the safety of certain products.""

“How quickly they forget” the spate of recalls that led to the creation of the database, the New York Times chided in a 2011 editorial. “The new Republican-led House seems determined to roll back those protections. As part of their slash-and-burn continuing resolution, they cut all the financing -- some $3 million this year -- for a core provision of the safety bill: a database where consumers could report product hazards and the public could check products before buying them.”

Even the infamous Koch brothers got involved. As the Sunlight Foundation reported, the Kochs lobbied against the database and Kansas Republican Rep. Mike Pompeo, whose district includes Koch Industries (which also happens to be his biggest donor), proposed the successful amendment to completely defund the database. Pompeo’s chief of staff, Mark Chenoweth, used to work for Koch Industries. After that, he was the chief legal counsel for Anne Northup, a Republican CPSC commissioner who has vocally opposed the database as a job-killing travesty. Shortly after Chenoweth left Northrup’s office and joined Pompeo’s, the congressman took up the fight against the database, getting the House to pass his amendment and include the defunding measure in the continuing resolution (it was never adopted by the Senate).

Whether Company Doe is connected to that fight or is an isolated case is unclear as we can’t ask them because we don’t know who they are. But the consumer advocates are eager to find out.

But first they’ll have to prove they have a right to intervene in the case, as Company Doe’s legal team is arguing that since the CPSC dropped out, the consumer groups are dead in the water as well. The 4th Circuit is expected to hear arguments this fall, and hand down a decision early next year.

Epstein, Josh Gerstein","Holder says , 'This is is among the most serious — top two or three — I ’ ve ever seen . ' Holder in the spotlight
Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday that he ’ d recused himself from the national security leak investigation in which prosecutors obtained the phone records of Associated Press journalists – but that he ’ s already started a fresh inquiry into the IRS scrutiny of conservative political groups .
The comments were the first from Holder or the Justice Department on the twin Obama administration scandals that have burst through in recent days . And they come as the Justice Department , and Holder himself , find themselves under increasing pressure .
That pressure is likely to grow Wednesday , when the attorney general arrives on Capitol Hill for previously scheduled hearings that have now been reoriented to address the recent inquiries . Holder got a preview of his likely Hill reception Tuesday , as both Republican and Democratic senators , including Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) were critical of the administration ’ s actions on both fronts .
Holder called the original AP story that sparked the probe “ a very , very serious leak , ” but revealed Tuesday that he had recused himself from the investigation because he had been interviewed by the FBI as part of initial inquiry .
Explaining his recusal from the leak case , Holder said he took the step “ out of an abundance of caution . ”
“ I was one of the people who had knowledge of this matter . I have frequent contact with the media , ” Holder said . He said he stepped aside “ to try to make sure this was independent and to avoid even the possibility of the appearance of a conflict . ”
“ I would have been the person leading the investigation , ” Holder added . “ It just seemed better to me to step out . ”
The decision to subpoena AP phone records was made by Deputy Attorney General James Cole , said a Justice Department official who asked not to be named .

Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday that he’d recused himself from the national security leak investigation in which prosecutors obtained the phone records of Associated Press journalists – but that he’s already started a fresh inquiry into the IRS scrutiny of conservative political groups.

The comments were the first from Holder or the Justice Department on the twin Obama administration scandals that have burst through in recent days. And they come as the Justice Department, and Holder himself, find themselves under increasing pressure.

That pressure is likely to grow Wednesday, when the attorney general arrives on Capitol Hill for previously scheduled hearings that have now been reoriented to address the recent inquiries. Holder got a preview of his likely Hill reception Tuesday, as both Republican and Democratic senators, including Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) were critical of the administration’s actions on both fronts.

Holder called the original AP story that sparked the probe “a very, very serious leak,” but revealed Tuesday that he had recused himself from the investigation because he had been interviewed by the FBI as part of initial inquiry.

Explaining his recusal from the leak case, Holder said he took the step “out of an abundance of caution.”

“I was one of the people who had knowledge of this matter. I have frequent contact with the media,” Holder said. He said he stepped aside “to try to make sure this was independent and to avoid even the possibility of the appearance of a conflict.”

“I would have been the person leading the investigation,” Holder added. “It just seemed better to me to step out.”

The decision to subpoena AP phone records was made by Deputy Attorney General James Cole, said a Justice Department official who asked not to be named.

The leak probe was launched following an AP story last May about a counter-terrorism investigation in Yemen that involved efforts to bomb an aircraft headed for the United States.

Holder said Tuesday that leak warranted an aggressive response from the federal government.

“I have to say this is among, if not the most serious, among the top two or three most serious leaks I have ever seen. It put the American people at risk. That is not hyperbole. It put the American people at risk. And trying to determine who was responsible for that I think required very aggressive action,” he said.

The attorney general said he was not aware of “all that went into the formulation of the subpoena,” but expressed confidence in the Justice Department officials who made the decisions. He also said the Obama administration remains supportive of a shield law to protect journalists.

Holder also disclosed that he’d launched the IRS investigation Friday, calling the agency’s actions targeting Tea Party-related groups “outrageous and unacceptable.” He said the FBI was coordinating with the Justice Department to see if any laws were broken. “Those (IRS actions) were, I think, as everyone can agree, if not criminal, outrageous and unacceptable and we are examining the facts to see if they are criminal violations,” he said.

Prosecutors said they were disappointed by the ruling but would decide on whether to appeal only after sentencing .
Judge Thokozile Masipa said there was not enough evidence to support the contention that Pistorius knew Steenkamp was behind a locked toilet door in his home when he shot through the door in the predawn hours of Valentine 's Day last year . Masipa said prosecutors had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Pistorius intended to kill Steenkamp .
The red-robed judge ordered Pistorius , 27 , to stand before she delivered the formal verdict on the multiple counts against him , and said it was a unanimous verdict , meaning she and her two legal assessors agreed on the findings . The conviction of culpable homicide , or negligent killing , can bring a maximum prison sentence of 15 years .

He said , however , that any decision to appeal the judge 's ruling would come after the case is `` concluded '' with sentencing .
The sentence for a culpable homicide conviction is at the judge 's discretion , and it can range from a suspended sentence and a fine to up to a maximum of 15 years in prison . Sentencing was expected to be announced at a later date .
After the verdict , Pistorius sat with his sister Aimee on the wooden bench where he has spent most of his six-month murder trial . She put an arm around his shoulders and spoke to him .
For the first time in the trial , Pistorius left by going down the stairs that led to the cells in the courthouse . That 's because Pistorius ' bail expired after his conviction and the judge was considering whether to re-grant him bail . Pistorius ' lawyer , Brian Webber , said Pistorius was taken to a `` holding position . ''
Defense lawyer Barry Roux told the judge that Pistorius should stay free on bail until sentencing because he had complied with bail conditions imposed on him after he killed Steenkamp .

`` Now he knows for a fact that , ` I 've been convicted of a serious offense and imprisonment is probable , '' ' Nel said .
Members of Steenkamp 's family , including her mother June and father Barry , were in court to hear the verdict in the 29-year-old model 's killing .
The judge ruled that the athlete was guilty of unlawfully firing a gun in a public place when a friend 's pistol he was handling discharged under a table in a restaurant in Johannesburg in early 2013 -- weeks before Steenkamp 's killing .

`` Fast and Furious '' became public after guns traced to the probe turned up at the scene of a Border Patrol agent 's December 2010 killing . The resulting investigations discovered similar tactics in a 2006-2007 operation dubbed `` Wide Receiver , '' also run out of Phoenix .
Revelations that ATF agents watched suspected gun traffickers cross into Mexico with weapons purchased at U.S. gun shops outraged lawmakers . Larry Alt , one of the ATF agents who blew the whistle on the operation , told CNN that it was `` egregious '' that agents were watching people transfer guns to people who were handing them over to the cartels , `` and we were not taking an enforcement action . ''
`` I would say that the persons responsible for this case ... at the field level , the division level , and the headquarters level and as far as it went into the Department of Justice , should be held accountable for any decision that they made that allowed these guns to go out on the street unmonitored , '' Alt said .
Making matters worse , the Justice Department initially denied guns were being allowed to `` walk '' across the border , only to have to formally retract that statement in December 2011 . The controversy forced Melson out at ATF , but he remained in another post at Justice until Wednesday .
Acting ATF Director B. Todd Jones , meanwhile , said his agency `` accepts full responsibility '' for failing to oversee the Arizona probes .
`` This hurts . This hurts people here , '' Jones told reporters . But he added that the ATF has been tightening up its procedures and wo n't shy away from tough operations .
`` All we can do is get off the mat again and keep swinging , '' he said .
The controversy fueled Republican accusations of a cover-up by the Obama administration and led to an unprecedented vote to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress .
The report found that Holder was not informed of the controversial ATF operation until 2011 , after Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was killed . In a written statement on the findings , Holder said the inspector-general 's report upholds `` what I , and other Justice Department officials , have said for many months now '' -- that the tactics used pre-dated the Obama administration and that Justice Department leaders did n't try to hide the facts from lawmakers .
`` It is unfortunate that some were so quick to make baseless accusations before they possessed the facts about these operations -- accusations that turned out to be without foundation and that have caused a great deal of unnecessary harm and confusion , '' Holder said . `` I hope today 's report acts as a reminder of the dangers of adopting as fact unsubstantiated conclusions before an investigation of the circumstances is completed . ''
But Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley , who brought ATF whistleblower complaints to the department 's attention in early 2011 , said the report `` reaffirms virtually everything '' that congressional investigators turned up .
`` It 's clear that both the ATF and the Justice Department failed to provide meaningful oversight of Operation Fast and Furious , '' Grassley said in a written statement . Those agencies `` ignored warnings from employees '' and refused to acknowledge how bad the problem was until after months of congressional pressure , he said .
And Grassley said the report inaccurately lets Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer `` off the hook '' regarding a February 2011 letter to Congress that denied guns were being allowed to cross the border . Along with the statement , Grassley released e-mails he said contradict the report .
Breuer acknowledged last November he had learned that guns were allowed to `` walk '' to Mexico , and apologized for not informing other senior Justice Department officials . The February 2011 letter to Grassley was later retracted by Justice officials .
Wednesday 's report criticized Breuer and another top official , Gary Grindler , who was acting deputy attorney general when the events took place , for failing to pass along information to the attorney general and other top officials . But they remain with the department .
A standoff over internal Justice documents erupted after the Obama administration said it was asserting executive privilege in the Fast and Furious case to shield documents that include internal deliberations traditionally protected from outside eyes .
That prompted the House of Representatives to vote a civil contempt charge against Holder -- the first time a Justice Department chief has been held in contempt by Congress . Democrats protested the vote vehemently as being purely political , and the citation passed along party lines .
The House took the issue to court , where it is expected to linger until well beyond November 's presidential election .
Some of the documents the White House withheld under the privilege claim were included in the report . Grassley said that inclusion `` proves that this subset of documents could have been released earlier , '' and the president `` was merely thumbing his nose at Congress '' before the contempt vote .
Rep. Darrell Issa , who pushed for the contempt vote against Holder as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee , the report shows `` widespread failures '' and `` a near-total disregard for public safety . ''

National Transportation Safety Board would like to see a nationwide 0.05 level
The board would also like to see swifter action on taking away offenders ' licenses
Restaurant , beer industries say focus should be on repeat offenders
A common benchmark in the United States for determining when a driver is legally drunk is not doing enough to prevent alcohol-related crashes that kill about 10,000 people each year and should be made more restrictive , transportation safety investigators say .
The National Transportation Safety Board recommended on Tuesday that all 50 states adopt a blood-alcohol content ( BAC ) cutoff of 0.05 compared to the 0.08 standard on the books today and used by law enforcement and the courts to prosecute drunk driving .
`` Most Americans think that we 've solved the problem of impaired driving , but in fact , it 's still a national epidemic , '' NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said .
The idea for a tighter standard is part of a safety board initiative outlined in a staff report and approved by the panel to eventually eliminate drunk driving , which accounts for about a third of all road deaths in the United States .
Hersman said progress has been made over the years to reduce drunk driving , including a range of federal and state policies , tougher law enforcement , and stronger advocacy . But she said too many people are still dying on America 's roads .

JUST WATCHED Alcohol and teens Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Alcohol and teens 01:08
The board acknowledged that there was `` no silver bullet , '' but that more action is needed at the federal and state levels .
`` In the last 30 years , more than 440,000 people have perished in this country due to alcohol-impaired driving . What will be our legacy 30 years from now ? '' Hersman asked . `` If we do n't tackle alcohol-impaired driving now , when will we find the will to do so ? ''
Lowering the rate to 0.05 would save about 500 to 800 lives annually , the safety board said .
Under current law , a 180-pound male typically will hit the 0.08 threshold after four drinks over an hour , according to an online blood alcohol calculator published by the University of Oklahoma . That same person could reach the 0.05 threshold after two to three drinks over the same period , according to the calculator .
Many factors besides gender and weight influence a person 's blood alcohol content , and many states outlaw lower levels of inebriation when behind the wheel .
The NTSB investigates transportation accidents and advocates on safety issues . It can not impose its will through regulation and can only recommend changes to federal and state agencies or legislatures , including Congress .
But the independent agency is influential on matters of public safety and its decisions can spur action from like-minded legislators and transportation agencies nationwide . States set their own BAC standards .
The board also recommended on Tuesday that states vastly expand laws allowing police to swiftly confiscate licenses from drivers who exceed the blood alcohol limits .
And it is pushing for laws requiring all first-time offenders to have ignition locking devices that prevent cars from starting until breath samples are analyzed .
In the early 1980s , when grass-roots safety groups brought attention to drunk driving , many states required a 0.15 BAC rate to demonstrated intoxication .
But over the next 24 years , Mothers Against Drunk Driving and other groups pushed states to adopt the 0.08 BAC standard , the last state falling in line in 2004 .
The number of alcohol-related highway fatalities , meanwhile , dropped from 20,000 in 1980 to 9,878 in 2011 , the NTSB said .
In recent years , about 31 percent of all fatal highway accidents were attributed to alcohol impairment , the NTSB said .
`` I think .05 is going to come . How long it takes to get there , we do n't know . But it will happen , '' said the NTSB 's Robert Molloy , who helped guide the staff report .
NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt noted that one of his relatives had been killed by a drunk driver and another is serving a 15-year sentence in a related death .
Many of the recommendations `` are going to be unpopular , '' Sumwalt said . `` But if we keep doing what we 're doing , we 're not going to make any difference . ''
The NTSB cited research that showed most drivers experience a decline in both cognitive and visual functions with a BAC of 0.05 .
Currently , more than 100 countries on six continents have BAC limits set at 0.05 or lower , the safety board said .
The NTSB has asked all 50 states to do the same .
A restaurant trade association , the American Beverage Institute , attacked the main recommendation , saying the average woman reaches 0.05 percent BAC after consuming one drink . The group said it based that conclusion on a chart it said was used by auto safety regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) .
But NHTSA told CNN on Tuesday it no longer uses that chart `` as there are many variables '' that contribute to an individual 's level of intoxication . A new NHTSA chart shows a person with a 0.05 BAC level experiences `` reduced coordination , reduced ability to track moving objects , difficulty steering , ( and ) reduced response to emergency driving situations . ''
A beer industry trade group said it would examine NTSB 's recommendation for lowering the blood-alcohol threshold .
`` However , we strongly encourage policymakers to direct their efforts where we know we can get results : by focusing on repeat offenders and increasing penalties on those with BAC of ( 0.15 ) or more , '' said Joe McClain , president of the Beer Institute .
The safety board also recommend that NHTSA provide financial incentives to states to carry out the changes .
NHTSA , which oversees highway safety as a federal regulator and analyzes traffic crash data , said it would work with any state that wants to pursue a lower BAC standard to `` gather further information on that approach . ''
At Tuesday 's meeting , the safety board also championed laws allowing police to confiscate a motorist 's license at the time of arrest if the driver exceeds a BAC limit , or refuses to take the BAC test .
Some 40 states already use the administrative tool , which the NTSB believes is effective because it is swift and immediate .
And the board recommended more widespread use of passive alcohol sensors , which police can use to `` sniff '' the air during a traffic stop to determine the presence of alcohol .
The sensor is capable of detecting alcohol even in cases where the driver has attempted to disguise his breathe with gum or mints . If the sensor alerts , it is grounds for more thorough testing .
The NTSB recommended last December that states require ignition interlocks for all DUI offenders and said states should improve interlock compliance .
Tuesday 's recommendations were timed to coincide with the deadliest alcohol-related crash in U.S. history . On May 14 , 1988 , a drunk driver drove his pickup the wrong way on Interstate 71 near Carrollton , Kentucky . The truck hit a school bus , killing 24 children and three adults . More than 30 others were hurt .","Story highlights For a decade, 0.08 has been the blood alcohol benchmark to consider a driver intoxicated

The number of alcohol-related highway fatalities, meanwhile, dropped from 20,000 in 1980 to 9,878 in 2011, the NTSB said.

In recent years, about 31 percent of all fatal highway accidents were attributed to alcohol impairment, the NTSB said.

""I think .05 is going to come. How long it takes to get there, we don't know. But it will happen,"" said the NTSB's Robert Molloy, who helped guide the staff report.

For some, the vote struck close to home.

NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt noted that one of his relatives had been killed by a drunk driver and another is serving a 15-year sentence in a related death.

Many of the recommendations ""are going to be unpopular,"" Sumwalt said. ""But if we keep doing what we're doing, we're not going to make any difference.""

The NTSB cited research that showed most drivers experience a decline in both cognitive and visual functions with a BAC of 0.05.

Currently, more than 100 countries on six continents have BAC limits set at 0.05 or lower, the safety board said.

The NTSB has asked all 50 states to do the same.

A restaurant trade association, the American Beverage Institute, attacked the main recommendation, saying the average woman reaches 0.05 percent BAC after consuming one drink. The group said it based that conclusion on a chart it said was used by auto safety regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

But NHTSA told CNN on Tuesday it no longer uses that chart ""as there are many variables"" that contribute to an individual's level of intoxication. A new NHTSA chart shows a person with a 0.05 BAC level experiences ""reduced coordination, reduced ability to track moving objects, difficulty steering, (and) reduced response to emergency driving situations.""

A beer industry trade group said it would examine NTSB's recommendation for lowering the blood-alcohol threshold.

""However, we strongly encourage policymakers to direct their efforts where we know we can get results: by focusing on repeat offenders and increasing penalties on those with BAC of (0.15) or more,"" said Joe McClain, president of the Beer Institute.

The safety board also recommend that NHTSA provide financial incentives to states to carry out the changes.

NHTSA, which oversees highway safety as a federal regulator and analyzes traffic crash data, said it would work with any state that wants to pursue a lower BAC standard to ""gather further information on that approach.""

At Tuesday's meeting, the safety board also championed laws allowing police to confiscate a motorist's license at the time of arrest if the driver exceeds a BAC limit, or refuses to take the BAC test.

Some 40 states already use the administrative tool, which the NTSB believes is effective because it is swift and immediate.

And the board recommended more widespread use of passive alcohol sensors, which police can use to ""sniff"" the air during a traffic stop to determine the presence of alcohol.

The sensor is capable of detecting alcohol even in cases where the driver has attempted to disguise his breathe with gum or mints. If the sensor alerts, it is grounds for more thorough testing.

The NTSB recommended last December that states require ignition interlocks for all DUI offenders and said states should improve interlock compliance.

Tuesday's recommendations were timed to coincide with the deadliest alcohol-related crash in U.S. history. On May 14, 1988, a drunk driver drove his pickup the wrong way on Interstate 71 near Carrollton, Kentucky. The truck hit a school bus, killing 24 children and three adults. More than 30 others were hurt.",www.cnn.com,left,bTxMzTgroD6h7Wsc

The Justice Department temporarily expanded the DEA ’ s power to collect information on protesters — and to share that intelligence with other law enforcement agencies and make arrests for non-drug-related crimes — last weekend . The measure , first reported by ███ , followed remarks by Attorney General Bill Barr that blamed , without evidence , “ anarchistic and far left extremist groups ” for the unrest .
In a letter sent to Barr and Timothy Shea , the acting administrator of the DEA , Democratic Reps.

Nadler chairs the House Judiciary Committee , of which Bass is also a member . The two lawmakers demanded Barr and Shea `` immediately rescind '' the sweeping new authority granted to the DEA and asked for “ a briefing detailing the timeline and rationale for the expansion of authority . ''
As unrest about racial injustice spread across America over the past two weeks , at times spilling over into property destruction and looting , the Trump administration has taken an increasingly adversarial posture .
In recent days , the Justice Department has deployed agents from the FBI , DEA , US Marshals , Bureau of Prisons , and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Explosives to back up local police . An email obtained by ███ this week showed that the DEA on Tuesday was seeking to send 25 agents to assist with “ security ” in Washington as well as members of the DEA 's Special Response Team , which among other activities conducts surveillance .
The Department of Homeland Security , meanwhile , sent officers to multiple cities and launched a Predator drone to circle above protesters in Minneapolis , where a police officer killed Floyd after kneeling on his neck for more than eight minutes on May 25 .
Because the DEA is normally restricted to enforcing drug-related federal crimes , the agency needed special permission to carry out operations against protesters . On Sunday , acting DEA administrator Shea , a former US attorney known to be close to Barr , received written approval to go beyond the normal mandate to perform functions that the attorney general may “ deem appropriate. ” This expanded authority is for two weeks .
News of the unusual expansion of powers raised concerns among critics , including the ACLU , that gathering intelligence on civilians could infringe on their First Amendment right to protest .
Nadler and Bass , in their letter , raised separate concerns about the DEA ’ s “ history and practice of disproportionately targeting people of color . ”
The lawmakers cited a 2009 government report that found Latinos made up 46 % of DEA ’ s arrestees but only 16 % of the US population , and pointed to statistics showing that more than a quarter of the DEA ’ s arrests of male suspects were for marijuana violations . Nadler and Bass called that track record “ out of touch ” with contemporary models of enforcing drug laws , and raised concerns that “ wider deployment of the DEA may only continue the disproportionate arrest trends that , in part , motivate the expressions of outrage that we are witnessing . ”
On Monday , Democratic Reps. Andy Levin , Jamie Raskin and Ilhan Omar , who represents Minnesota , sent their own letter to Barr demanding he rescind the expanded surveillance powers granted to the DEA and “ ensure that DEA activities do not exceed the scope of authority granted to the agency by Congress . ”

A spokesperson for the DEA said the agency will “ respond appropriately. ” The Justice Department did not immediately return a message seeking comment .
The unusual deployment of the DEA and other agencies has also rankled top Senate Democrats who demanded answers by Monday about the use of `` extraordinary authorities '' to crack down on the protests .
Citing ███ 's reporting , minority leader Chuck Schumer , along with four other Democratic senators , sent a letter Friday to Barr , Department of Homeland Security acting administrator Chad Wolf , Secretary of Defense Mark Esper , and Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt requesting detailed information about federal law enforcement personnel possibly being `` inappropriately mobilized in response to protests over the death of George Floyd . ''
Noting that a “ hybrid force ” drawing from the Secret Service , US Park Police , and DC National Guard had aided police efforts to forcibly remove protesters from Lafayette Park in Washington using tear gas and rubber bullets , the letter demanded information about what authorities those agencies were exercising and how the Constitutional rights of civilians were being protected in a time of social unrest .
“ We are deeply concerned that , in the wake of the horrific killing in Minnesota , there is a lack of transparency regarding the forces you have deployed and under what authorities you have deployed them , ” read the letter , which was also signed by Sen.

The alleged discussions have been a subject of fierce debate – and conflicting accounts – for months . But McCabe revived the issue during promotional interviews for his forthcoming book , telling CBS News ' `` 60 Minutes '' that Rosenstein was “ absolutely serious ” when he suggested recording Trump in the tumultuous days following James Comey 's firing as FBI director .
FORMER TOP FBI LAWYER : TWO TRUMP CABINET OFFICIALS WERE 'READY TO SUPPORT ' 25TH AMENDMENT EFFORT
Trump seethed on Twitter over the comments , calling McCabe a liar before lashing out at top DOJ and FBI officials , including ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions , for what he described as a “ deranged ” plan .
“ He and Rod Rosenstein , who was hired by Jeff Sessions ( another beauty ) , look like they were planning a very illegal act , and got caught … There is a lot of explaining to do to the millions of people who had just elected a president who they really like and who has done a great job for them with the Military , Vets , Economy and so much more . This was the illegal and treasonous ‘ insurance policy ’ in full action ! ” he tweeted .
“ Insurance policy ” is a reference to texts between former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page discussing such a policy , without elaborating – the text was widely suspected of referring to aspects of the Russia collusion probe .
While Trump fumed at McCabe , the former FBI deputy director claimed he `` never actually considered taking [ Rosenstein ] up on the offer . '' He said he did discuss the matter with the FBI 's then-general counsel , James A. Baker . Last fall , as reported by Fox News , Baker told lawmakers during a closed-door deposition that McCabe and Page came to Baker `` contemporaneously '' and told him details of the meeting where Rosenstein made the comments . Baker told congressional investigators he took the word of McCabe and Page `` seriously . ''
McCabe told CBS News that `` I think the general counsel had a heart attack '' when he told him of Rosenstein 's plan .
`` And when he got up off the floor , he said , ' I , I , that 's a bridge too far . We 're not there yet , ' '' McCabe added . Days later , Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel to oversee the bureau 's investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials .
Rosenstein repeatedly has denied he `` pursued or authorized recording the president '' and also has denied McCabe 's suggestion that the deputy attorney general had broached the idea of invoking the Constitution 's 25th Amendment , which allows Cabinet members to seek the removal of a president if they conclude that he or she is mentally unfit . The Justice Department echoed both denials in a statement released last week , saying Rosenstein `` was not in a position to consider invoking the 25th Amendment . ''
Yet McCabe said in the interview , `` Rod raised the [ 25th Amendment ] issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other Cabinet officials might support such an effort. ” He added that he believed Rosenstein was `` counting votes or possible votes '' to remove Trump from office .
Fox News reported Sunday that Baker , in his testimony to Congress , provided even more details about the alleged 25th Amendment discussions – saying two Cabinet officials were “ ready to support ” such an effort .
“ I was being told by some combination of Andy McCabe and Lisa Page , that , in a conversation with the Deputy Attorney General , he had stated that he -- this was what was related to me -- that he had at least two members of the president ’ s Cabinet who were ready to support , I guess you would call it , an action under the 25th Amendment , ” Baker testified .","President Trump on Monday accused Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe of pursuing an “illegal and treasonous” plot against him, after McCabe detailed private DOJ discussions about secretly recording and potentially ousting the president.

""And when he got up off the floor, he said, 'I, I, that's a bridge too far. We're not there yet,'"" McCabe added. Days later, Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel to oversee the bureau's investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.

MCCABE SAYS ROSENSTEIN SERIOUS ABOUT RECORDING TRUMP

Rosenstein repeatedly has denied he ""pursued or authorized recording the president"" and also has denied McCabe's suggestion that the deputy attorney general had broached the idea of invoking the Constitution's 25th Amendment, which allows Cabinet members to seek the removal of a president if they conclude that he or she is mentally unfit. The Justice Department echoed both denials in a statement released last week, saying Rosenstein ""was not in a position to consider invoking the 25th Amendment.""

Yet McCabe said in the interview, ""Rod raised the [25th Amendment] issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other Cabinet officials might support such an effort.” He added that he believed Rosenstein was ""counting votes or possible votes"" to remove Trump from office.

Fox News reported Sunday that Baker, in his testimony to Congress, provided even more details about the alleged 25th Amendment discussions – saying two Cabinet officials were “ready to support” such an effort.

“I was being told by some combination of Andy McCabe and Lisa Page, that, in a conversation with the Deputy Attorney General, he had stated that he -- this was what was related to me -- that he had at least two members of the president’s Cabinet who were ready to support, I guess you would call it, an action under the 25th Amendment,” Baker testified.

A day after President Barack Obama delivered a similar edict to U.S . Naval Academy graduates , Hagel 's message comes amid a series of widespread incidents of sexual misconduct across the armed services in recent months and a new report showing that the problem is growing . The challenge is particularly poignant for the West Point crowd , since earlier in the week an Army sergeant was charged with secretly photographing and videotaping at least a dozen women at the upper New York state academy , including in a bathroom .
`` Sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military are a profound betrayal — a profound betrayal — of sacred oaths and sacred trusts , '' Hagel told 1,007 graduating cadets during a cold , rainy outdoor ceremony . `` This scourge must be stamped out . We are all accountable and responsible for ensuring that this happens . We can not fail the Army or America . We can not fail each other and we can not fail the men and women that we lead . ''
Hagel , who served in the Army in Vietnam , took the opportunity to reflect on his own time in uniform and the lessons that he said must resonate as the soldiers take on the job of helping to transform the military . It was his first graduation address as defense chief .
The graduates , he said , must be the generation of leaders who will stop the debilitating and insidious threats of suicide , sexual assault and drug and alcohol abuse that are hurting the all-volunteer force .
Wounded twice during his roughly one year at war , Hagel has two Purple Hearts and is the first man to become secretary of defense after serving only in the enlisted corps . Reflecting on his military service , Hagel said his time in the Army shaped him forever .
`` In Vietnam , I learned that combat is a furnace that can consume you , or it can forge you into something better and stronger than you were before , '' said Hagel , who took over the job as Pentagon chief at the end of February .
He also told the graduates that they must begin to build the future Army as the service recovers from the strains of more than a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan . Future conflicts , he said , will take on new and unfamiliar forms , and the military must be ready to face them even as budget cuts force the service to curtail training and trim the number of soldiers from a wartime high of about 570,000 to 490,000 .
But he said that readiness will be strained by health and social problems .
Pentagon leaders have been struggling to deal with what they have come to call an epidemic of sexual assaults in the military . A Pentagon report released this month estimated that as many as 26,000 military service members may have been sexually assaulted last year and that thousands of victims are unwilling to come forward despite new oversight and assistance programs . The estimate was based largely on anonymous surveys .
According to the report , the number of sexual assaults actually reported by military service members rose 6 percent to 3,374 in 2012 . And nearly 800 of those simply sought help but declined to file complaints against their attackers .
Spurred on by furious Congress members , the Defense Department has ordered the services to come up with ways to curb the problem and better help the victims .
In the latest case , Sgt . 1st Class Michael McClendon is facing charges of dereliction of duty , mistreatment , entering a women 's bathroom without notice , and taking and possessing inappropriate photos and videos of at least a dozen women who were naked or in various states of undress .
The women have been notified by the Army about the matter .
He was charged May 14 with violating four articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice , but some of the allegations date back to 2009 . He has been transferred to Fort Drum , N.Y . It is n't immediately clear if McClendon has a lawyer .
Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey has called the problem a crisis and said the women who serve in the military are losing confidence that it can be solved .","Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point on Saturday that they must stamp out the “scourge” of sexual assault in the military.

Additional scrutiny of conservative organizations ’ activities by the IRS did not solely originate in the agency ’ s Cincinnati office , with requests for information coming from other offices and often bearing the signatures of higher-ups at the agency , according to attorneys representing some of the targeted groups . At least one letter requesting information about one of the groups bears the signature of Lois Lerner , the suspended director of the IRS Exempt Organizations department in Washington .
Jay Sekulow , an attorney representing 27 conservative political advocacy organizations that applied to the Internal Revenue Service for tax-exempt status , provided some of the letters to NBC News . He said the groups ’ contacts with the IRS prove that the practices went beyond a few “ front line ” employees in the Cincinnati office , as the IRS has maintained .
“ We 've dealt with 15 agents , including tax law specialists -- that 's lawyers -- from four different offices , including ( the ) Treasury ( Department ) in Washington , D.C. , ” Sekulow said . “ So the idea that this is a couple of rogue agents in Cincinnati is not correct . ”
Among the letters were several that bore return IRS addresses other than Cincinnati , including `` Department of the Treasury / Internal Revenue Service / Washington , D.C. , '' and the signatures of IRS officials higher up the chain . Two letters with `` Department of the Treasury / Internal Revenue Service / Washington , D.C. '' letterhead were signed by `` Tax Law Specialist ( s ) '' from Exempt Organizations Technical Group 1 and Technical Group 2 . Lerner ’ s signature , which appeared to be a stamp rather than an actual signature , appeared on a letter requesting additional information from the Ohio Liberty Council Corp .
Lerner has become one of the public faces of the controversy after refusing to testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee last Wednesday , citing her Constitutional Fifth Amendment rights after reading a brief statement : “ I have not done anything wrong . I have not broken any laws , violated IRS regulations or provided false information to this or any other committee . ”
She was put on administrative leave at the end of last week after reportedly refusing to resign at Obama administration ’ s request . She is continuing to collect federal paychecks on her almost $ 180,000 annual salary , though at least one Republican senator , Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa , a member of the Senate Finance Committee , is urging the agency to speed up the process and fire her .
In the two weeks since the IRS acknowledged it targeted conservative organizations seeking status as tax-exempt `` social welfare '' organizations for additional scrutiny , many Republicans have sought to link the agency ’ s actions to the White House . In an Op-Ed piece in the Washington Post on May 22 , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , wrote that “ the administration has been extremely creative in employing throughout the federal government the sorts of intimidation tactics that were used at the IRS . ”
The White House has dismissed suggestions it was aware of the targeting , saying President Barack Obama only learned of the issue when it broke in the news on May 10 . White House spokesman Jay Carney has since deflected most questions about the scandal , saying it would be inappropriate to comment until an FBI inquiry into the agency ’ s actions – one of five separate government investigations -- is concluded .
For its part , the IRS has declined additional comment beyond its congressional testimony -- including former IRS Commissioner Steven Miller 's testimony that IRS employees didn ’ t have partisan motives and only made `` foolish mistakes ... trying to be more efficient ” -- and other previously released public statements , including its response to a Treasury inspector general ( see pages 49-51 ) and a Q & A on 501 ( c ) groups it published on its website .

Sekulow , who worked with the office of the chief counsel of the IRS in the early 1980s as a trial lawyer representing the IRS on tax-exempt cases , said the number of groups he ’ s heard from , and the scope of the requests for information the IRS sent them , persuaded him “ that this was not something that was just created at an agent level , that this was certainly higher up . ”
After reviewing all the IRS communications his clients received , Sekulow said he believes the IRS was engaged in a coordinated and deliberate attempt to silence , or at least stifle conservative organizations , he told NBC News .
Sekulow also said the practices continued well after May 2012 , when the IRS has claimed they had stopped . Sekulow said 10 of the organizations he represents still have not received determinations from the IRS on their applications for tax-exempt status as 501 C ( 1 ) ( 4 ) organizations . He provided NBC News with a letter the IRS sent to one of his clients on May 6 requesting more information .
Cleta Mitchell , another attorney representing conservative groups that allege they were targeted , said an IRS agent in Cincinnati told her a “ task force ” IRS office in Washington , D.C. , was making the decisions about the processing of applications , and that she subsequently dealt with IRS representatives there .
“ ( The IRS agent in Cincinnati ) told me that in fact the case would be transferred to a special task force out of Washington , and that he was told – he was the originally assigned agent – that he was n't allowed to make decisions , the decisions were all going to be made in Washington , ” Mitchell said . “ I know that this process was going on in Washington because I 've dealt with those people . ”
One of Mitchell ’ s clients , Catherine Engelbrecht , founder of True the Vote , a conservative elections monitoring organization , applied for tax-exempt status for the group in July 2010 . She said that when she asked the IRS two years later why it was taking so long to get a decision , agents told her Washington was to blame .
“ We ’ ve dealt with four separate analysts and their explanation for the way our case has been handled runs the gamut from their not having another organization like True the Vote to compare to – so they had to develop new questions and new criteria -- all the way through to the fact that they were taking their orders from Washington and were waiting for Washington ’ s direction as to what steps to take next , ” she said . “ They were caught up in a process that seemed to be much bigger than Cincinnati and bigger than any single individual . ”
Mitchell , Engelbrecht ’ s attorney , said Engelbrecht ’ s case also raised questions about whether the IRS had subjected some applicants to other federal government scrutiny and action , beyond their IRS application .
Engelbrecht told NBC News that soon after she filed for tax-exempt status for True the Vote , the IRS audited her personal and business taxes for the first time , and her manufacturing business was visited by two other federal agencies , the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) and The Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) .
Her tax-exempt application still has n't been approved after three years . She 's now suing the IRS .
Sekulow said he also is preparing to sue the IRS in federal court this week , on behalf of the 16 groups he represents .
“ The only way to get this resolved is to go to federal court , ” Sekulow said , “ because that 's the only thing that 's going to compel the IRS to comply with the law . ”
Two IRS Cincinnati employees who have talked to NBC News dispute one part of the IRS ’ explanation , saying that application of inappropriate selection criteria and the extra scrutiny for Tea Party and other conservative political advocacy organizations was not the work of a few low-level “ rogue ” employees .
But they also have told NBC News that they believe there was no political or partisan motivation for the targeting or scrutiny .
`` We 're outstanding public servants , dedicated to our craft and to the public we serve , ” said one current IRS Cincinnati employee contacted at home over the weekend , who agreed to speak to NBC News on the condition of anonymity . “ To suggest that we 're 'rogue ' should be considered slander . ”
Asked about the motivations for the targeting , the employee said , “ I trust my management team . ''
Bonnie Esrig , a 38-year IRS veteran and a manager in the Cincinnati office until she retired from the IRS in January , also has told NBC News that decisions about how to handle cases came from management , and that all employees were subjected to considerable oversight .

Sekulow said he also is preparing to sue the IRS in federal court this week, on behalf of the 16 groups he represents.

“The only way to get this resolved is to go to federal court,” Sekulow said, “because that's the only thing that's going to compel the IRS to comply with the law.”

Two IRS Cincinnati employees who have talked to NBC News dispute one part of the IRS’ explanation, saying that application of inappropriate selection criteria and the extra scrutiny for Tea Party and other conservative political advocacy organizations was not the work of a few low-level “rogue” employees.

But they also have told NBC News that they believe there was no political or partisan motivation for the targeting or scrutiny.

""We're outstanding public servants, dedicated to our craft and to the public we serve,” said one current IRS Cincinnati employee contacted at home over the weekend, who agreed to speak to NBC News on the condition of anonymity. “To suggest that we're 'rogue' should be considered slander.”

Asked about the motivations for the targeting, the employee said, “I trust my management team.""

Bonnie Esrig, a 38-year IRS veteran and a manager in the Cincinnati office until she retired from the IRS in January, also has told NBC News that decisions about how to handle cases came from management, and that all employees were subjected to considerable oversight. She also said that she believes there was no political or partisan motivation for the added scrutiny.

Republicans are eager to claim a trophy firing amid the scandals that have flared up around the Obama administration. But after years of trying to get Holder, the attorney general doesn’t seem at all worried that it’ll be his.

He’s already been vilified by Republicans. He’s already been called on to resign.

Lynch , the country 's first African-American woman to serve in the role , had her nomination held up more than five months over politicking in the Senate .
`` Ladies and gentlemen , it 's about time , '' said Vice President Joe Biden at the swearing in ceremony .
The highly politicized five-month battle to choose Obama 's next attorney general came to a close Thursday when the Senate finally voted 56-43 to confirm Lynch
But the delay of her nomination neared record-breaking proportions . Republicans leading the Senate refused to bring her nomination up for a vote until Democrats cut a deal on abortion language in an unrelated bill . That legislation passed Wednesday , setting up Thursday 's vote and ending the latest partisan Washington standoff .
Ten Republicans , including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , joined Democrats . Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz was the only senator not to vote .

Obama tapped Lynch to replace Attorney General Eric Holder in November and her nomination cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee in February .

''","Washington (CNN) Loretta Lynch was sworn in as the new U.S. attorney general on Monday, replacing Eric Holder. Lynch, the country's first African-American woman to serve in the role, had her nomination held up more than five months over politicking in the Senate.

""Ladies and gentlemen, it's about time,"" said Vice President Joe Biden at the swearing in ceremony.

The highly politicized five-month battle to choose Obama's next attorney general came to a close Thursday when the Senate finally voted 56-43 to confirm Lynch

But the delay of her nomination neared record-breaking proportions. Republicans leading the Senate refused to bring her nomination up for a vote until Democrats cut a deal on abortion language in an unrelated bill. That legislation passed Wednesday, setting up Thursday's vote and ending the latest partisan Washington standoff.

Ten Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, joined Democrats. Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz was the only senator not to vote.

This won't be the first time that William Barr, President Trump's nominee to become attorney general, will be involved with what's been called a ""witch hunt.""

Barr, who is scheduled to go before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday for his confirmation hearings, ran the Justice Department once before, under President George H.W. Bush.

Back then, the all-consuming, years-long scandal was called Iran-Contra. On Dec. 24, 1992, it ended when Bush pardoned six people who had been caught up in it.

""The Constitution is quite clear on the powers of the president and sometimes the president has to make a very difficult call,"" Bush said then. ""That's what I've done.""

Then-Attorney General Barr supported the president's decision in the Iran-Contra case, which gave clemency to people who had been officials in the administration of President Ronald Reagan, including former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger. He had been set to go on trial to face charges about lying to Congress.

And there also has been talk about whether Trump might pardon some of those people — or even, potentially, himself.

Would Barr support pardons again?

Barr's track record raises questions about whether he'd support the president if he elected to use his pardon power down the line in the Russia investigation.

That doesn't address the question of pardons, however.

Trump's onetime personal lawyer Michael Cohen has been sentenced to three years in prison. His former national security adviser Michael Flynn is awaiting sentence after pleading guilty. And so is Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.

Trump has said pardons in the Russia case are not off the table, and people including former prosecutor Carrie Cordero have taken notice.

justice_department,American Spectator,2,https://spectator.org/attorney-general-sessions-now-needs-to-appoint-a-special-counsel/,Attorney General Sessions Now Needs to Appoint a Special Counsel,,"Fred Gedrich, R. Emmett Tyrrell, Brandon J. Weichert, John Jiang, Debra J. Saunders, George Neumayr","Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently announced that he has tasked the Department of Justice ’ s Inspector General ( DOJ IG ) to investigate alleged abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) by some DOJ and Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) officials . His action was prompted by allegations that Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) orders — which allowed U.S. intelligence agencies to surveil and/or served as the impetus for others to publicly unmask through leaks some American citizens associated with the Trump campaign , transition , and presidency — was obtained under false pretenses and may have served as a basis for Robert Mueller ’ s special counsel appointment . The probe of these allegations should be done by a special counsel , not the DOJ IG , and here is why .
If DOJ seeks to determine whether FISA may have been improperly and/or illegally used by U.S. government officials , it will need to expand the scope of the investigation far beyond the DOJ and FBI boundary established by the attorney general . For example , the person assigned to lead this investigation should be tasked with interviewing and obtaining and analyzing information from certain officials who worked or work at the White House , U.S. intelligence agencies , Clinton Campaign and Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) , Perkins-Coie law firm , British ex-spy Christopher Steele and his Russian sources and others believed to have played varying roles in paying for , developing , and disseminating questionable information used by DOJ and FBI to obtain FISC orders .
The IG Act of 1978 , as amended , does not give the DOJ IG the authority to perform such an expansive investigation . It mostly allows that office only to investigate matters concerning DOJ and FBI persons ( including contractors and grantees ) and programs . For example , the DOJ IG can ’ t : convene a grand jury to compel witness testimony from inside and outside government , prosecute crimes , interview people who have left DOJ and FBI , and independently investigate matters deemed by the attorney general or deputy attorney general as preserving national security interests or protecting ongoing criminal investigations .
This in no way impugns the incumbent DOJ IG , Michael Horowitz , or the organization he leads . He is highly-qualified and well-respected throughout the agency , inspector general community , and Congress . According to his organization ’ s 2017 budget request , his office funding totals nearly $ 100 million and includes a workforce totaling about 480 special agents , auditors , inspectors , attorneys and support staff . Its prime mission is to investigate allegations of fraud , waste , abuse , and misconduct by DOJ and FBI employees , contractors , and grantees . He became DOJ IG in 2012 after being nominated by President Barack Obama and confirmed by the U.S. Senate . And since 2015 , he has chaired the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency ( an organization of 73 inspectors general ) . His noteworthy projects include the investigation of the Fast and Furious Program and the ongoing review of allegations regarding certain actions by DOJ and FBI officials in advance of the 2016 presidential election .
The FISA of 1978 , as amended , prescribes procedures on how the Act should be used . In sum , it requires the government to obtain permission from a FISC judge to surveil communications on domestic soil for national security reasons . The FISC , also established in 1978 , along with judges appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , makes decisions as to whether to approve wiretaps , data collection , and government requests regarding monitoring suspected terrorists and spies . DOJ and the FBI must provide documentary evidence in an application to FISC judges to support court-authorized criminal or counterintelligence warrants . Any misuse of FISA , such as providing tainted evidence or excluding materially important information to FISC judges who issue these warrants , would cast serious doubt on the validity of any investigation , prosecution , and conviction emanating from the abuse .
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence memos , a Senate Judiciary Committee chairman criminal referral , and other revelations suggest that DOJ and the FBI may have indeed used tainted evidence and/or excluded materially significant information from the affidavits presented to FISC judges such as the payment source of the unverified Steele dossier and the author ’ s credibility . The question before Attorney General Sessions is what to do about apparent material deficiencies in the FISA applications . Here are three suggestions :
One , appoint a special counsel . 28 Code of Federal Regulations 600.1 specifies the three criteria for the DOJ appointment of a special counsel . They are when the attorney general or someone acting in his behalf determines that a criminal investigation of a person or matter is warranted ; when a DOJ conflict of interest is present ( i.e. , DOJ investigating itself ) ; and when it ’ s in the public interest . It seems , pending AG or DAG determination , the key elements for a special counsel appointment exist for this matter . Moreover , the chairmen of the House Oversight and Government Reform , House Judiciary , and Senate Judiciary committees ( Reps. Trey Gowdy , Bob Goodlatte , and Sen. Chuck Grassley ) and other members of Congress have formally requested the attorney general to do it .
Two , urge the special counsel to use the services of the DOJ IG and his staff in the probe . That office has a wealth of corporate knowledge about DOJ and the FISA process , and IG Act , a high degree of independence from DOJ . It also has some 135 agents and 39 attorneys on staff to assist . And its investigation regarding certain actions by DOJ and FBI officials in advance of the 2016 presidential election resulted in the firing of Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe and transfer of several other notable DOJ and FBI officials .
Three , develop a special counsel tasking which clearly defines the scope of work to be done during the probe . The tasking , among other things , should include a determination if anyone in the Obama administration , the Clinton campaign and DNC , DOJ and FBI , or elsewhere illegally used the FISA process to ( 1 ) weaponize U.S. intelligence agencies to spy on the Republican Party ’ s presidential candidate and his associates ; ( 2 ) use the Perkins-Coie law firm to disguise the use of campaign funds directed to Fusion GPS and Christopher Steele and others to do opposition research on Trump and his associates during and after the campaign , ( 3 ) intentionally leak the names of Trump associates caught up in FISA surveillance to the press ; and ( 4 ) approve and submit FISA applications to FISC judges under false pretenses by purposely withholding materially important information from the FISC judges ; and ( 5 ) fatally poison Special Counsel Mueller ’ s investigation .
The time for the attorney general to act is now . Those among us who have participated in Federal criminal investigations know that it ’ s crucial to immediately obtain relevant documentary and testimonial evidence before it is destroyed , altered , or coordinated . Most importantly , the American people have a right to know whether those entrusted with maintaining a high degree of integrity throughout the justice system , government , and presidential electoral process acted legally and have met their public responsibilities .
Fred Gedrich is a foreign policy and national security analyst . He served in the U.S. departments of State and Defense .","Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently announced that he has tasked the Department of Justice’s Inspector General (DOJ IG) to investigate alleged abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by some DOJ and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials. His action was prompted by allegations that Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) orders — which allowed U.S. intelligence agencies to surveil and/or served as the impetus for others to publicly unmask through leaks some American citizens associated with the Trump campaign, transition, and presidency — was obtained under false pretenses and may have served as a basis for Robert Mueller’s special counsel appointment.

For example, the DOJ IG can’t: convene a grand jury to compel witness testimony from inside and outside government, prosecute crimes, interview people who have left DOJ and FBI, and independently investigate matters deemed by the attorney general or deputy attorney general as preserving national security interests or protecting ongoing criminal investigations.

The tasking, among other things, should include a determination if anyone in the Obama administration, the Clinton campaign and DNC, DOJ and FBI, or elsewhere illegally used the FISA process to (1) weaponize U.S. intelligence agencies to spy on the Republican Party’s presidential candidate and his associates; (2) use the Perkins-Coie law firm to disguise the use of campaign funds directed to Fusion GPS and Christopher Steele and others to do opposition research on Trump and his associates during and after the campaign, (3) intentionally leak the names of Trump associates caught up in FISA surveillance to the press; and (4) approve and submit FISA applications to FISC judges under false pretenses by purposely withholding materially important information from the FISC judges; and (5) fatally poison Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation.

The time for the attorney general to act is now. Those among us who have participated in Federal criminal investigations know that it’s crucial to immediately obtain relevant documentary and testimonial evidence before it is destroyed, altered, or coordinated. Most importantly, the American people have a right to know whether those entrusted with maintaining a high degree of integrity throughout the justice system, government, and presidential electoral process acted legally and have met their public responsibilities.

I applaud President Obama’s recognition that mandatory minimum sentencing for nonviolent drug offenders needs to end. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.’s announcement Monday to change federal drug-sentencing policy hopefully signaled a significant shift toward justice in addressing one of the most unjust federal policies of our time.

Mr. Holder called our current system “broken,” and he couldn’t be more right. Congress needs to consider and pass my bipartisan legislation to provide flexibility for federal judges in sentencing nonviolent offenders, which I have introduced with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, Vermont Democrat.

The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Many of those people deserve to be in prison; however, some of them do not. They find themselves incarcerated owing to a misguided focus on draconian punishment that does nothing to enhance public safety. As Mr. Holder noted, incarceration rates have grown “at an astonishing rate — by almost 800 percent” since 1980.

Almost half of these inmates are serving time for drug-related crimes.

Many of them find themselves in prison sometimes for making one nonviolent mistake — for decades or more — because our federal government mandates it. Throughout the 1970s, ‘80s and ‘90s, federal mandatory minimum laws were implemented that forced judges to deliver sentences far lengthier than they would have if allowed to use their own discretion. The result has been decades of damage, particularly to young people.

We have all made mistakes in our youth, but we shouldn’t ruin people’s entire lives for making youthful mistakes. By today’s legal standards, the past two presidents could have been imprisoned for decades as punishment for alleged indiscretions in their youth.

These laws are so unrealistic that sometimes the young person convicted didn’t even knowingly make a mistake. The Associated Press reported this week: “Former federal appeals court Judge Timothy Lewis recalled that he once had to sentence a 19-year-old to 10 years in prison for conspiracy for being in a car where drugs were found.” The report continued: “Lewis, a former prosecutor, said the teen, who was [black], was on course to be the first person in his family to go to college. Instead, Lewis had to send him to prison as the teen turned and screamed for his mother.”

Judge Lewis’ hands were tied as he was forced to severely punish this young man. Said Judge Lewis after Mr. Holder’s announcement, “I am just glad that someone finally has the guts to stand up and do something about what is a pervasively racist policy.”

Mandatory minimum sentencing has disproportionately affected blacks, Hispanics and others who often don’t have the financial means to fight back. In so many of these cases, federal laws make it impossible for well-meaning judges, law enforcement and families to do anything to reverse these bad decisions.

Drug abuse is no doubt destructive to families and society, but mandatory minimum laws often do far more damage to families and society than the problems they were intended to fix.

Timothy Tyler is another victim of these laws. In 1994, Timothy was a “deadhead” with prior infractions that had resulted in probation. He was sentenced to life in prison for selling LSD to a police informant.

Tyler should have been punished for selling drugs, but he shouldn’t have to spend the rest of his life in prison for it. Today, Timothy is 45 and will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars, not because a judge thought it was a proper punishment, but because an arbitrary federal law demanded it.

The president and founder of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, Julie Stewart, told Business Insider: “He was a kid. He was following the Grateful Dead. I’m not condoning it, but it was a pretty harmless lifestyle Timothy was leading.” Ms. Stewart added, “It always seemed really absurd to me that for this nonviolent guy who was 24 years old, the government could write off his life. Bingo. You’re gone.” There are rapists and murderers who are given more lenient sentences than what Tyler received.

Nonviolent offenders don’t always return to society as normal and productive citizens after serving hard time alongside rapists and murderers. Those who are released after decades of imprisonment often have trouble finding employment and suffer from a host of other problems related to their history.

This is not proper justice — and it must end.

I look forward to working with the White House to advance my Justice Safety Valve Act (S. 619), which would permanently restore justice by preserving judicial discretion in federal cases. I introduced this legislation in March with Mr. Leahy as a bipartisan legislative fix to the very problem Mr. Holder now addresses.

We must work hard in a bipartisan fashion to change these laws. Mandatory minimum sentencing has already done enough damage to enough Americans. Judges can determine fair justice far better than any inane federal mandate.

It is now our responsibility to work together to protect the next generation from this madness.

In his opening statement , Major Hasan , who has long sought to declare his guilt , said that `` the evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter . ''
Hasan is accused opening fire at a training center , killing 13 and injuring scores of others . He was shot by a responding police officer , and is now partly paralyzed from that injury .

On its first day , the trial shed light on the motives for the attack . Although President Obama on May 23 said that Hasan ’ s act may have been “ inspired by larger notions of jihad , ” the Obama administration has defined the attack as an act of workplace violence .

Government officials say that starting in 2008 Hasan sent more than a dozen e-mails to Anwar al-Awlaki , a radical cleric whom the US killed with a drone strike in 2011 .

The Tea Party Patriots , a conservative activist group , put out an ad Friday that bluntly states : “ It ’ s time for Rod Rosenstein to do his job or resign . ”
It ’ s time for DAG Rod Rosenstein to do his job or resign ! Watch the new ad from Tea Party Patriots Action # TeaParty pic.twitter.com/KhwKCkm6hJ — Tea Party Patriots ( @ TPPatriots ) February 2 , 2018
The ad claims that Rosenstein ’ s “ incompetence and abuse of power ” have “ undermined congressional investigations ” and tarnished the reputation of the Justice Department .
It also calls him “ a weak careerist at the Justice Department , protecting liberal Obama holdovers and the deep state , instead of following the rule of law. ” ( Trump appointed Rosenstein to his position in the Justice Department ; he had previously served as the longtime US attorney in Maryland . He was appointed to that position by George W. Bush , in 2005 . )
The clamor for Rosenstein ’ s dismissal among Trump allies was all but expected with Friday ’ s release of the Nunes memo , whose advocates say reveals anti-Trump bias and abuse of power at the highest levels of the FBI and the Justice Department . Many observers believed Trump might use the declassified memo as justification to fire his deputy attorney general — who also happens to be Mueller ’ s boss .

Trump , when asked Friday if he was thinking about firing Rosenstein , cryptically told reporters : “ You figure that one out . ”","The Nunes memo has been released — and the conservative drumbeat demanding the firing of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is getting louder.

The Tea Party Patriots, a conservative activist group, put out an ad Friday that bluntly states: “It’s time for Rod Rosenstein to do his job or resign.”

It’s time for DAG Rod Rosenstein to do his job or resign! Watch the new ad from Tea Party Patriots Action #TeaParty pic.twitter.com/KhwKCkm6hJ — Tea Party Patriots (@TPPatriots) February 2, 2018

The ad claims that Rosenstein’s “incompetence and abuse of power” have “undermined congressional investigations” and tarnished the reputation of the Justice Department.

It also calls him “a weak careerist at the Justice Department, protecting liberal Obama holdovers and the deep state, instead of following the rule of law.” (Trump appointed Rosenstein to his position in the Justice Department; he had previously served as the longtime US attorney in Maryland. He was appointed to that position by George W. Bush, in 2005.)

The clamor for Rosenstein’s dismissal among Trump allies was all but expected with Friday’s release of the Nunes memo, whose advocates say reveals anti-Trump bias and abuse of power at the highest levels of the FBI and the Justice Department. Many observers believed Trump might use the declassified memo as justification to fire his deputy attorney general — who also happens to be Mueller’s boss.

Rosenstein has overseen the Trump-Russia investigation since Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself in March; he appointed special counsel Robert Mueller to lead the investigation. Trump has made no secret his disdain for the “Russia hoax,” and he has reportedly questioned Rosenstein’s loyalty to him.

The DOJ previously argued in court that the law's pre-existing condition protections should be struck down. Now, the administration argues the entire law should be invalidated.

The IRS scandal puts President Barack Obama in the worst possible position : all of the blame , none of the power to fix it .
The Republicans finally have a scandal with potential staying power : One of the most reviled federal agencies improperly targeted conservative groups . The House will hold hearings . Republican leaders are making the media rounds and expressing their disgust .
Obama called the story “ outrageous ” Monday and made vague promises to hold people accountable , but there ’ s not much he can do until the report comes out from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration .
Even his options are firing people are limited . There are only two political appointees in the 106,000-employee agency : the commissioner — formerly a President George W. Bush appointee who left in November when his five-year term expired — and the general counsel .
But Democratic operatives with crisis experience say there is a playbook for regaining a measure of control — if he does it quickly . Several said he should quickly move for an independent investigation .
“ He has to demand full accountability and then heads have to roll , ” said Hilary Rosen , a Democratic strategist close to the White House . “ Everybody has to condemn it , no one can be defending this , and the White House has to be at the top of the list in condemning it . ”
So far , that ’ s not the approach . Obama hedged his statements by saying “ if , ” and press secretary Jay Carney told reporters aboard Air Force One Monday afternoon that the White House must await the inspector general ’ s report before saying anything else .
“ If you ’ ve got the IRS operating in anything less than a neutral and non-partisan way , then that is outrageous , it is contrary to our traditions , ” Obama said . “ And people have to be held accountable , and it ’ s got to be fixed . So we ’ ll wait and see what exactly all the details and the facts are . But I ’ ve got no patience with it . I will not tolerate it . ”

White House stuck on IRS response

The IRS scandal puts President Barack Obama in the worst possible position: all of the blame, none of the power to fix it.

The Republicans finally have a scandal with potential staying power: One of the most reviled federal agencies improperly targeted conservative groups. The House will hold hearings. Republican leaders are making the media rounds and expressing their disgust.

And the White House is stuck waiting.

Obama called the story “outrageous” Monday and made vague promises to hold people accountable, but there’s not much he can do until the report comes out from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.

Even his options are firing people are limited. There are only two political appointees in the 106,000-employee agency: the commissioner — formerly a President George W. Bush appointee who left in November when his five-year term expired — and the general counsel.

But Democratic operatives with crisis experience say there is a playbook for regaining a measure of control — if he does it quickly. Several said he should quickly move for an independent investigation.

“He has to demand full accountability and then heads have to roll,”said Hilary Rosen, a Democratic strategist close to the White House. “Everybody has to condemn it, no one can be defending this, and the White House has to be at the top of the list in condemning it.”

So far, that’s not the approach. Obama hedged his statements by saying “if,” and press secretary Jay Carney told reporters aboard Air Force One Monday afternoon that the White House must await the inspector general’s report before saying anything else.

“If you’ve got the IRS operating in anything less than a neutral and non-partisan way, then that is outrageous, it is contrary to our traditions,” Obama said. “And people have to be held accountable, and it’s got to be fixed. So we’ll wait and see what exactly all the details and the facts are. But I’ve got no patience with it. I will not tolerate it.”

“The ‘if’ is very important, so we’re not going to start predicting outcomes if we don’t know what the conclusions of the IG report are,” Carney said.

That’s not much like the usual Obama White House response: hard pushback, eagerly knocking back reporters in pursuit. Instead, Friday, Carney offered a tepid response, then leaving it at that through the weekend except for a brief statement circulated to news outlets late Sunday.

justice_department,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/19/management-failures-cited-fast-and-furious-report/,Management failures cited in Ã¢â‚¬ËœFast and FuriousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ report,2012-09-19,"Chuck Neubauer, Jerry Seper","The Justice Department ’ s Office of Inspector General on Wednesday blamed the failure of Operation Fast and Furious on a series of “ misguided strategies , ” but found no evidence that Attorney General Eric . H. Holder Jr. knew of the misguided gunrunning investigation before its public unraveling in January 2011 .
The long-anticipated 471-page report cites “ errors in judgment and management failures ” on the part of officials at the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives headquarters in Washington and in the Phoenix field office , and says “ questionable judgments ” by Justice Department officials in Washington marred the department ’ s response to Capitol Hill inquiries .
The investigation came to light after two AK-47 semi-automatic assault rifles purchased as a part of Fast and Furious were found at the scene of the killing nearly two years ago of a U.S. Border Patrol agent . The report recommended that 14 department employees be reviewed for possible sanctions or other disciplinary actions .
The report also says Acting Deputy Attorney General Gary Grindler , Mr. Holder ’ s chief of staff , received a briefing about Fast and Furious in March 2010 , but that the briefing “ failed to alert Mr. Grindler to problems in the investigation. ” The report says Mr. Grindler learned three days after the Dec. 14 , 2010 , death of Border Patrol Agent Brian A. Terry of the link between weapons found at the scene of the killing and Fast and Furious , but did not tell Mr. Holder . It said he should have “ informed the attorney general as well as made an appropriate inquiry of ATF or the U.S. attorney ’ s office about the connection . ”
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein , who reviewed Fast and Furious wiretap applications , resigned Wednesday in the wake of the report , which says he should have asked more questions about Fast and Furious , given his knowledge of a similar 2006 program known as Operation Wide Receiver . Former Acting ATF Director Kenneth Melson , named in the report as failing to maintain “ appropriate oversight ” of Fast and Furious , announced his retirement Wednesday , effective immediately .
According to the report , both Fast and Furious and Wide Receiver were “ seriously flawed and supervised irresponsibly ” by ATF ’ s Phoenix field division and the U.S. attorney ’ s office in Arizona , “ most significantly in their failure to adequately consider the risk to the public safety in the United States and Mexico. ” It said both investigations sought to identify the higher reaches of firearms-trafficking networks by deferring any overt law enforcement action against the individual straw buyers — such as making arrests or seizing firearms — even when there was sufficient evidence to do so .
“ The risk to public safety was immediately evident in both investigations , ” the report says . “ Almost from the outset of each case , ATF agents learned that the purchases were financed by violent Mexican drug-trafficking organizations and that the firearms were destined for Mexico . ”
Rep. Darrell E. Issa , California Republican and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , which investigated Fast and Furious , said Wednesday the report confirmed findings by Congress of a “ near total disregard for public safety in Operation Fast and Furious , contrary to the denials of the attorney general and his political defenders. ” Mr. Issa said the report notes that information in wiretap applications approved by senior Justice Department officials in Washington “ did contain red flags showing reckless tactics ” and they fault Mr. Holder ’ s inner circle for their conduct .
Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz is scheduled to testify to the committee on Thursday on the findings of his investigation .
Mr. Holder said Wednesday the report ’ s key conclusions are “ consistent ” with what he and other Justice Department officials have said for many months : The inappropriate strategy and tactics employed were field-driven and date back to 2006 ; the leadership of the department did not know about or authorize the use of the flawed strategy and tactics ; and the department ’ s leadership did not attempt to cover up information or mislead Congress about it .
“ I want to assure the American people that I , and my colleagues at the department , will continue to focus on our mission of protecting their rights and their security and doing so in a manner that is consistent with the high standards of the Department of Justice , ” he said .
The report identifies persons ranging from field agents and prosecutors in Phoenix and Tucson , Ariz. , to senior ATF officials in Washington who “ bore a share of responsibility ” for ATF ’ s failures in both Fast and Furious and Wide Receiver to interdict firearms illegally bound for Mexico , and for pursuing “ this risky strategy without adequately taking into account the significant danger to public safety that it created . ”
“ We operated with complete and total independence in our search for the truth , and the decision about what to cover in this report and the conclusions we reached were made solely by me and my office , ” Mr. Horowitz said . “ I am pleased that we are able to put forward a full and complete recitation of the facts that we found , and the conclusions that we reached , with minimal redactions by the department to our report . ”
He also said the Obama administration made no redactions for executive privilege , even though the report evaluates in detail and reaches conclusions about the department ’ s actions in responding to Congress , adding that Justice has agreed to seek court authorization to unredact as much of the wiretap information as possible .
According to the report , investigators found that no one responsible for the operations at either the ATF Phoenix field division or the U.S. attorney ’ s office raised serious questions or concerns about the government not taking earlier measures to disrupt a trafficking operation that continued to purchase firearms with impunity for many months .
The report says that failure reflected a “ significant lack of oversight and urgency ” by both ATF and the U.S. attorney ’ s office and a “ disregard by both ” for the safety of persons in the United States and Mexico .
According to the report , Mr. Holder was notified immediately of Terry ’ s death but was not told about the connection between firearms found at the scene and Fast and Furious . It said he learned of the connection sometime in 2011 , after he received a letter from Sen. Chuck Grassley , Iowa Republican , asking about Terry ’ s death .
“ Had the department ’ s senior leadership taken immediate action after learning that weapons found at the scene of a federal law enforcement agent ’ s murder were linked to a straw purchaser in an ATF firearms-trafficking investigation , the department likely would have gathered information about Operation Fast and Furious well before it received the inquiry from Sen. Grassley about the very same issue in late January 2011 . The Department , however , did not do so , ” the report said .
The report said Mr. Grindler and former Deputy Chief of Staff Monty Wilkinson should have told Mr. Holder about the connection . It also singled out Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer , who heads the Justice Department ’ s Criminal Division , for possible disciplinary action for failing to alert Mr. Holder or his deputy when he learned in April 2010 that ATF had allowed guns to walk in Wide Receiver .
In addition , the report says Mr. Weinstein should have asked more questions about Fast and Furious , given his knowledge of Wide Receiver . Both Mr. Breuer and Mr. Weinstein were criticized for failing to draw a connection between the allegations in Mr. Grassley ’ s letters and their knowledge of gun-walking in Wide Receiver .
In his resignation letter posted on his attorney ’ s website , Mr. Weinstein said he found it “ personally painful ” to read the report ’ s “ completely false conclusion ” that he knew about and failed to act on Fast and Furious guns being allowed to walk to Mexico . He said he had been assured by the ATF and prosecutors in Arizona that guns were not being transported south of the border .
According to the report , a poorly executed information-gathering and drafting process , as well as questionable judgments by department officials , contributed to Justice ’ s inclusion of inaccurate information in its Feb. 4 response letter to Mr. Grassley . It said that in preparing the letter , department officials relied on information provided by senior officials that was not accurate , primarily from U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke , ATF Acting Director Kenneth Melson and his deputy , William Hoover . It says they failed to exercise “ appropriate oversight of the investigation , and to some extent were themselves receiving incorrect or incomplete information from their subordinates . ”
Mr. Holder said officials within ATF and the U.S. attorney ’ s office in Arizona identified in the report as having been responsible for designing , implementing or supervising Fast and Furious have been “ referred to the appropriate entities for review and consideration of potential personnel actions. ” He declined to elaborate .
Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland , the committee ’ s ranking Democrat , said the report “ debunks many of the extreme allegations made by Republicans , ” instead confirming conclusions reached in a minority report issued nearly a year ago that said neither Mr. Holder nor senior Justice Department officials authorized or approved of gun-walking in Fast and Furious , that gun-walking started under the President Bush ’ s administration in 2006 , and that ATF agents in Phoenix and the U.S. attorney ’ s office in Arizona shared responsibility for “ misguided operations spanning five years . ”
Mr. Grassley said the report confirmed that Fast and Furious was the “ height of irresponsibility on the part of a number of people from the ATF Phoenix field office all the way up to the Justice Department headquarters. ” He said he was “ glad ” Mr. Horowitz was joining with him and Mr. Issa in urging the Justice Department to unseal Fast and Furious wiretap applications “ so the American people can read them and make up their own minds . ”
ATF shut down Fast and Furious after two AK-47 semi-automatic assault rifles purchased by straw buyers from a gun shop in Glendale , Ariz. , were found near Terry ’ s body . The agent had been killed during a shootout with Mexican drug smugglers just north of the U.S.-Mexico border , south of Tucson . The killing led to public testimony by ATF agents opposed to the operation , who said more than 2,000 weapons had been walked to drug smugglers in Mexico , about 1,400 of which are still unaccounted for .","The Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General on Wednesday blamed the failure of Operation Fast and Furious on a series of “misguided strategies,” but found no evidence that Attorney General Eric.

Seriously flawed

According to the report, both Fast and Furious and Wide Receiver were “seriously flawed and supervised irresponsibly” by ATF’s Phoenix field division and the U.S. attorney’s office in Arizona, “most significantly in their failure to adequately consider the risk to the public safety in the United States and Mexico.” It said both investigations sought to identify the higher reaches of firearms-trafficking networks by deferring any overt law enforcement action against the individual straw buyers — such as making arrests or seizing firearms — even when there was sufficient evidence to do so.

He also said the Obama administration made no redactions for executive privilege, even though the report evaluates in detail and reaches conclusions about the department’s actions in responding to Congress, adding that Justice has agreed to seek court authorization to unredact as much of the wiretap information as possible.

Lack of oversight

According to the report, investigators found that no one responsible for the operations at either the ATF Phoenix field division or the U.S. attorney’s office raised serious questions or concerns about the government not taking earlier measures to disrupt a trafficking operation that continued to purchase firearms with impunity for many months.

The report says that failure reflected a “significant lack of oversight and urgency” by both ATF and the U.S. attorney’s office and a “disregard by both” for the safety of persons in the United States and Mexico.

According to the report, Mr. Holder was notified immediately of Terry’s death but was not told about the connection between firearms found at the scene and Fast and Furious. It said he learned of the connection sometime in 2011, after he received a letter from Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, asking about Terry’s death.

Political reaction split

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the committee’s ranking Democrat, said the report “debunks many of the extreme allegations made by Republicans,” instead confirming conclusions reached in a minority report issued nearly a year ago that said neither Mr. Holder nor senior Justice Department officials authorized or approved of gun-walking in Fast and Furious, that gun-walking started under the President Bush’s administration in 2006, and that ATF agents in Phoenix and the U.S. attorney’s office in Arizona shared responsibility for “misguided operations spanning five years.”

Sessions on Thursday notified key lawmakers on Capitol Hill that he has tapped Utah ’ s top prosecutor , John Huber , to coordinate with the department ’ s inspector general — but he stopped short of ceding to demands for a new special counsel , at least for now .
The announcement was a disappointment to some Trump allies in Congress who have clamored for the appointment .
“ I disagree with the attorney general , ” said Rep. Mark Meadows Mark Randall MeadowsHouse Republicans prepare for public impeachment proceedings with mock hearing Live updates on impeachment : Schiff fires warning at GOP over whistleblower Democrats sharpen their message on impeachment MORE ( R-N.C. ) , a lawmaker who frequently talks to Trump . “ The Justice Department is not complying with the subpoena and oversight responsibility we have in Congress , so for the attorney general to say there ’ s not enough there is extremely disappointing . ”
The White House itself did not comment on the Sessions decision , however , nor did Trump .
And key lawmakers on Capitol Hill who have formally requested a second special counsel — such as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte Robert ( Bob ) William GoodlatteUSCIS chief Cuccinelli blames Paul Ryan for immigration inaction Immigrant advocacy groups should n't be opposing Trump 's raids Top Republican releases full transcript of Bruce Ohr interview MORE ( R-Va. ) and House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy Harold ( Trey ) Watson GowdyFive landmark moments of testimony to Congress Conway spars with Wallace on whether White House will cooperate with impeachment inquiry after formal vote Gowdy : I '100 percent ' still believe public congressional hearings are ' a circus ' MORE ( R-S.C. ) — instead chose to focus on the appointment of Huber , calling the move “ encouraging . ”
Still , the news will do little to dim speculation that Trump may fire the attorney general , whom he has publicly mocked , criticized and pressured over his handling of the department .

Sessions on Thursday notified key lawmakers on Capitol Hill that he has tapped Utah’s top prosecutor, John Huber, to coordinate with the department’s inspector general — but he stopped short of ceding to demands for a new special counsel, at least for now.

The announcement was a disappointment to some Trump allies in Congress who have clamored for the appointment.

“I disagree with the attorney general,” said Rep. Mark Meadows Mark Randall MeadowsHouse Republicans prepare for public impeachment proceedings with mock hearing Live updates on impeachment: Schiff fires warning at GOP over whistleblower Democrats sharpen their message on impeachment MORE (R-N.C.), a lawmaker who frequently talks to Trump. “The Justice Department is not complying with the subpoena and oversight responsibility we have in Congress, so for the attorney general to say there’s not enough there is extremely disappointing.”

The White House itself did not comment on the Sessions decision, however, nor did Trump.

And key lawmakers on Capitol Hill who have formally requested a second special counsel — such as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte Robert (Bob) William GoodlatteUSCIS chief Cuccinelli blames Paul Ryan for immigration inaction Immigrant advocacy groups shouldn't be opposing Trump's raids Top Republican releases full transcript of Bruce Ohr interview MORE (R-Va.) and House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy Harold (Trey) Watson GowdyFive landmark moments of testimony to Congress Conway spars with Wallace on whether White House will cooperate with impeachment inquiry after formal vote Gowdy: I '100 percent' still believe public congressional hearings are 'a circus' MORE (R-S.C.) — instead chose to focus on the appointment of Huber, calling the move “encouraging.”

Still, the news will do little to dim speculation that Trump may fire the attorney general, whom he has publicly mocked, criticized and pressured over his handling of the department. Trump was enraged by Sessions’s decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation last spring, an act he saw as a betrayal, and Washington has been on watch for the attorney general’s dismissal for a year.

On Tuesday, House investigators sent a letter asking Barbara Bosserman, the lawyer involved in the investigation who is also an Obama donor, to testify at a hearing next week.

“With your history of extensive financial and personal support for the president and the Democratic Party, your involvement in the administration’s investigation raises the appearance of a substantial and material conflict of interest,” Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican who is heading a subcommittee conducting the investigation, said in the letter, which was seen by The Washington Times.

Mr. Jordan and full Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell E. Issa, California Republican, have identified Ms. Bosserman as the leader of the Justice Department’s investigation.

Department officials had never contradicted that claim, but Mr. Holder said Wednesday that was an inaccurate characterization of her role. He said Ms. Bosserman is from the department’s civil division, but elements of the FBI and the Justice Department’s public integrity and criminal divisions also are involved and the criminal division is taking the lead.

He defended all of those involved.

“I have confidence in the career people at the FBI and the other investigative agencies to conduct a thorough, comprehensive investigation, and that’s what I would expect of them. And that is why matters like this take as long as they do,” he said.

Mr. Holder refused to discuss the status of the investigation, but he denied a published report that the investigation concluded there were no criminal acts in the targeting.

“All the options that we have are on the table,” the attorney general said.

Ms. Bosserman didn’t reply directly to an email seeking comment from The Times but forwarded it to the press office, which said the department will respond directly to the committee’s request for her to testify.

Tuccille, Josh Blackman, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Eric Boehm, Charles Oliver, Stephanie Slade, Christian Britschgi","Let 's take a moment to spare some pity for Bill Barr . Being the U.S. Attorney General can be a tough gig . It 's a job held at the pleasure of the president , though also attached to a largely unrealistic expectation that the officeholder will act independently . Historically , it 's been a hatchet-man position , doing dirty work through the institutions of the ever-expanding Justice Department on behalf of White House paranoia and prejudices . It 's got ta be hard enough to maintain your self-respect in a position like that without your boss sending you instructions in front of the world via social media .
Only spare a little pity , though . Barr—a loyalist to the president , as anybody in that powerful cabinet position must be—stepped into this situation with his eyes open .
Now , however , Barr complains that President Donald Trump 's off-the-cuff pronouncements and tweets `` make it impossible for me to do my job . '' He told ABC News last week that `` it 's time [ for Trump ] to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases . ''
Barr 's latest complaint comes after the department went against federal prosecutors ' recommendation of a stiff 87 to 108 months in prison for Trump friend and adviser Roger Stone , who was convicted for obstructing a congressional investigation , lying to a congressional committee , and witness tampering .
In and of itself , the sentencing reduction was perfectly justifiable . `` A prison sentence of seven to nine years is disproportionate given the nature and consequences of Stone 's crimes , '' as ███ 's Jacob Sullum noted . `` I can see why people thought this was an excessive sentence , '' chimed in CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin .
Yet Trump 's very public bitching and moaning about the original recommendation complicates the plot .
`` This is a horrible and very unfair situation , '' the president tweeted , in what looks like a campaign of overt arm-twisting on behalf of a crony . `` The real crimes were on the other side , as nothing happens to them . Can not allow this miscarriage of justice ! ''
Just hours later , the Justice Department moved to recommend a lesser sentence for Stone , giving every impression of scurrying forth to do the president 's bidding . The four prosecutors on the case promptly quit , with one entirely leaving the Justice Department .
For the record , Barr said that President Trump `` has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case . ''
`` This does n't mean that I do not have , as President , the legal right to do so , I do , but I have so far chosen not to ! '' the president responded , in what looks like an effort to further bend his beleaguered top cop over a barrel .
Presidents have frequently deployed their attorneys general for sleazy effect ; Trump just does it more publicly .
Thomas Watt Gregory , President Woodrow Wilson 's first attorney general , oversaw oppressive attempts to suppress anti-war sentiment and political dissent . He approved the creation of the pro-Wilson American Protective League to spy on and brutalize Americans who disagreed with the Wilson administration . To make sure there was no doubt about who was behind the snooping and beating , Gregory authorized the group to advertise itself as `` Organized with the Approval and Operating under the Direction of the United States Department of Justice , Bureau of Investigation . ''
Homer Cummings , Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's first attorney general , authored a court-packing plan that would have allowed the president to stuff the Supreme Court with allies who would approve his blatantly unconstitutional economic legislation .
John Mitchell , who served as attorney general under President Richard Nixon , went to prison for his role in the burglary of the Democratic Party 's national headquarters at the Watergate Hotel—but not before he had his own wife kidnapped and drugged to keep the secret . That might have been a bit much even for some of the other creatures who aspire to high office ; Mitchell 's successors , Richard G. Kleindienst and Elliot Richardson , resigned rather than obey the increasingly erratic Nixon 's orders .
Barr finds his job rendered `` impossible '' by Trump 's tweets and has ( so we 're told ) been complaining about them for `` weeks . '' But just what did he think was going to happen when he took a hatchet-man job working for a guy who is completely incapable of handing off the hatchet without first publicly brandishing it and threatening to use it against passersby ?
Barr ca n't claim he was unaware of what to expect from the job—this is his second shot as America 's top prosecutor , after serving as attorney general under President George H. W. Bush from 1991-1993 . Before that , he put in years as an assistant attorney general , as a legal policy adviser for the Reagan White House and , while attending grad school and law school , at the CIA .
In 1992 , Barr was accused of helping to conceal evidence of illegal arms sales to Iran . `` Coverup-General '' was columnist William Safire 's nickname for Barr as a result .
Ironically , in light of the current controversy , one highlight of Barr 's first stint as attorney general was the release of a report calling for building and filling more prisons . The report argued that `` we are incarcerating too few criminals , and the public is suffering as a result . '' ( Stone must be grateful that Barr apparently mellowed with time . )

Barr took the job knowing that , like his predecessors , he would be a hatchet man . Apparently , his big complaint is that he 'd like the unfortunate nature of his role to be a little less overt .","Let's take a moment to spare some pity for Bill Barr. Being the U.S. Attorney General can be a tough gig. It's a job held at the pleasure of the president, though also attached to a largely unrealistic expectation that the officeholder will act independently. Historically, it's been a hatchet-man position, doing dirty work through the institutions of the ever-expanding Justice Department on behalf of White House paranoia and prejudices. It's gotta be hard enough to maintain your self-respect in a position like that without your boss sending you instructions in front of the world via social media.

Only spare a little pity, though. Barr—a loyalist to the president, as anybody in that powerful cabinet position must be—stepped into this situation with his eyes open.

Now, however, Barr complains that President Donald Trump's off-the-cuff pronouncements and tweets ""make it impossible for me to do my job."" He told ABC News last week that ""it's time [for Trump] to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases.""

Barr's latest complaint comes after the department went against federal prosecutors' recommendation of a stiff 87 to 108 months in prison for Trump friend and adviser Roger Stone, who was convicted for obstructing a congressional investigation, lying to a congressional committee, and witness tampering.

In and of itself, the sentencing reduction was perfectly justifiable. ""A prison sentence of seven to nine years is disproportionate given the nature and consequences of Stone's crimes,"" as Reason's Jacob Sullum noted. ""I can see why people thought this was an excessive sentence,"" chimed in CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin.

Yet Trump's very public bitching and moaning about the original recommendation complicates the plot.

""This is a horrible and very unfair situation,"" the president tweeted, in what looks like a campaign of overt arm-twisting on behalf of a crony. ""The real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them. Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!""

Just hours later, the Justice Department moved to recommend a lesser sentence for Stone, giving every impression of scurrying forth to do the president's bidding. The four prosecutors on the case promptly quit, with one entirely leaving the Justice Department.

For the record, Barr said that President Trump ""has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case.""

""This doesn't mean that I do not have, as President, the legal right to do so, I do, but I have so far chosen not to!"" the president responded, in what looks like an effort to further bend his beleaguered top cop over a barrel.

Presidents have frequently deployed their attorneys general for sleazy effect; Trump just does it more publicly.

Thomas Watt Gregory, President Woodrow Wilson's first attorney general, oversaw oppressive attempts to suppress anti-war sentiment and political dissent. He approved the creation of the pro-Wilson American Protective League to spy on and brutalize Americans who disagreed with the Wilson administration. To make sure there was no doubt about who was behind the snooping and beating, Gregory authorized the group to advertise itself as ""Organized with the Approval and Operating under the Direction of the United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Investigation.""

Homer Cummings, Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first attorney general, authored a court-packing plan that would have allowed the president to stuff the Supreme Court with allies who would approve his blatantly unconstitutional economic legislation.

John Mitchell, who served as attorney general under President Richard Nixon, went to prison for his role in the burglary of the Democratic Party's national headquarters at the Watergate Hotel—but not before he had his own wife kidnapped and drugged to keep the secret. That might have been a bit much even for some of the other creatures who aspire to high office; Mitchell's successors, Richard G. Kleindienst and Elliot Richardson, resigned rather than obey the increasingly erratic Nixon's orders.

Barr finds his job rendered ""impossible"" by Trump's tweets and has (so we're told) been complaining about them for ""weeks."" But just what did he think was going to happen when he took a hatchet-man job working for a guy who is completely incapable of handing off the hatchet without first publicly brandishing it and threatening to use it against passersby?

Barr can't claim he was unaware of what to expect from the job—this is his second shot as America's top prosecutor, after serving as attorney general under President George H. W. Bush from 1991-1993. Before that, he put in years as an assistant attorney general, as a legal policy adviser for the Reagan White House and, while attending grad school and law school, at the CIA.

In 1992, Barr was accused of helping to conceal evidence of illegal arms sales to Iran. ""Coverup-General"" was columnist William Safire's nickname for Barr as a result.

A babe in the government woods Barr is not.

Ironically, in light of the current controversy, one highlight of Barr's first stint as attorney general was the release of a report calling for building and filling more prisons. The report argued that ""we are incarcerating too few criminals, and the public is suffering as a result."" (Stone must be grateful that Barr apparently mellowed with time.)

Barr not only knew the ins and outs of the attorney general job, he knew what to expect of his boss. Long before Trump brought him onto the team, Barr defended the president's conduct in office, including a high-profile endorsement of the firing of Sally Yates and similar support given to the president's loud calls for investigating his defeated 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton.

""There is nothing inherently wrong about a president calling for an investigation,"" Barr said in 2017.

If Barr had no problem with a president fingering who he wants the Justice Department to roughly handle, he can't be surprised that the same president might publicly name those he wants gently treated.

A new prosecution system to enforce major crimes. Faster jury trials. A new rule that would ban all sexual contact between instructors and trainees, a recurring problem. All out.

What did the lawyers give in return? Steps the Pentagon says it’s already taking, such as barring commanders from overturning jury convictions.

That means if the negotiated package becomes law, it won’t amount to much of an overhaul since most of the toughest steps Congress will have asked the Pentagon to take in 25 years of promising to solve the problem aren’t even new.

One of the military’s best assets is unheard of for any other special interest or agency: office space right inside the building.

They also have offices a floor down from the Senate Armed Services Committee in the Russell Office Building.

The setup inspires close friendships between Hill staff and military staff. The Air Force Liaison Office holds a monthly happy hour in the Rayburn building. The aides and military lobbyists have even collaborated on a cookbook, titled “Savory Secrets of Congressional staffers … and their Dangerous Liaisons,” according to a recent email invite.

Lawyers for the prisoner , Abu Wa'el Dhiab , have challenged his treatment as abusive .
Numerous news media outlets , including The Associated Press , had asked the court on June 20 to unseal the videotapes , which are classified `` secret . ''
U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler granted the news media 's request , although Kessler said the tapes will remain sealed until some information on them is redacted . The material to be removed includes identifying information of everyone on the tapes except for the prisoner . She said faces other than Dhiab 's will be obscured , as will voices and names .
`` Protection of the identities of Guantanamo Bay staff is a legitimate goal , '' Kessler wrote . `` Adequate protection can be provided by appropriate audio and visual edits , for example , blurring faces and identifying portions of uniforms , and blacking-out written materials on walls . '' The government could appeal her ruling .
Dhiab 's lawyer , Jon Eisenberg , said that `` we are very gratified by this decision , which will enable the American people to see with their own eyes the sorts of abuses that are being heaped on these peacefully hunger-striking detainees . ''
`` Once the truth is fully brought to light , we believe these terrible practices will come to an end , '' Eisenberg said .
AP attorney David Schulz welcomed the decision , calling it `` a strong reaffirmation of the public 's right to know what their government is up to . ''
Dhiab was told in the spring he would be resettled in Uruguay , along with five other Guantanamo prisoners . But as the months have dragged on and the transfer put on hold , his standoff with military officials has only deteriorated , at times turning violent .
On Thursday , the judge rejected a request by the Obama administration to close a hearing into Dhiab 's case scheduled for Monday .
Dhiab , a Syrian prisoner , has been held at the Navy-run prison for terrorist suspects at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , since August 2002 .
The Obama administration has been in court for months seeking to limit the amount of information released in Dhiab 's case .
`` The court is well aware , as the government has emphasized , that in no case involving Guantanamo Bay detainees has any court ordered disclosure of classified information over the government 's opposition , '' Kessler wrote in a 29-page opinion ordering release of the tapes .
`` However -- to be clear -- that does not mean that in a given factual situation no court has the discretion to do so if warranted , '' the judge added .
Standard protocol at penal institutions nationwide is to videotape forcible cell extractions . What 's unusual about these videotapes is that many of them include footage of force-feedings in addition to forcible cell extractions .
AP attorney David Schulz called the decision `` a strong reaffirmation of the public 's right to know what their government is up to . ''
Hunger strikes at Guantanamo Bay have been taking place since the early days of the island facility 's use as a prison for terrorist suspects following the Sept. 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
In early 2013 , as many as 100 detainees began a hunger strike to protest their uncertain fate . The U.S. has long disclosed how many are refusing to eat and whether they meet military guidelines to be force fed . But late last year , the disclosure ended . A Navy spokesman said in December 2013 that peaceful protest was allowed but that reporting numbers to the public would no longer be done .
The former Navy commander at Guantanamo Bay , Rear Adm. Richard Butler , said in a court declaration filed in July that even though the forced cell extraction videos are lawful , humane and appropriate , they `` are particularly susceptible to use as propaganda and to incite a public reaction because of their depiction of forcible ... guard interaction with detainees . ''
The videos that also contain footage of forced-feedings could be used `` to foment anti-American sentiment and inflame Muslim sensitivities as it depicts ... personnel providing medical care to a detainee while he is restrained , '' Butler said in the declaration .
Making public a video showing a detainee receiving medical care while restrained `` would exacerbate the world 's perception of detainees in U.S. custody , '' Butler added . `` Public release , in whole or in part , of videos showing forced cell extractions '' or feedings would cause `` serious damage to national security . ''
After viewing the government videos and analyzing Butler 's arguments , she found that they were `` unacceptably vague , speculative , lack specificity or are just plain implausible , '' she wrote .
The government has already released substantial information relating to the feeding process , including the layout of and equipment in the feeding space .
`` It strains credulity to conclude that release of these videos has a substantial probability of causing the harm the government predicts , '' Kessler wrote .
The government argues that releasing the videos would allow adversaries to reconstruct portions of the camp infrastructure , threatening the security of the camps .

Now , they and other residents of their neighborhood worry that they will be living alongside child molesters , rapists and other ex-cons . The state has contracted with a private company to move severely ill prisoners -- who are being paroled or released from prison for medical or compassionate reasons -- into a former nursing home that sits right behind their house .
`` It 's prisoners living next door , and it 's not one or two of them . It 's 95 of them , '' said Josh Egan . `` We 're going to call it what it is . It 's not a nursing home , it 's a prison . They are prisoners , coming from prison . My grandmother is in a nursing home . This is definitely not where I 'd send my grandmother . ''
The facility has been vacant for about a year and a half . The state has contracted to funnel what it says are the most debilitated prisoners -- those at the end of life ; suffering from Alzheimer 's disease or dementia ; or otherwise incapable of caring for themselves -- to the nursing home . By doing so , they estimate they will save about $ 6 million of state taxpayer money in prisoner health costs . When inmates who require 24-hour skilled nursing care are incarcerated , the state picks up the whole tab . Yet if the prisoners are moved to a nursing facility , the federal Medicaid program pays 50 percent of the cost , though that still represents money provided by taxpayers .
But that is little comfort to the neighbors whose homes surround the property the nursing home sits on .
`` I 'm really mad , '' said Tony Fabi , whose backyard abuts the nursing home . `` My kid ca n't even play in the back yard , thinking that someone might escape , jump over a stockade fence that they are putting up . Are you kidding me ? ''
Nicole Crawford said she is `` horrified , to put it bluntly . ... I would not let my children play in the yard . I would n't feel safe letting them play in the one place they should feel safe , in their own yard . ''
`` It is something that is going on in every state , and we are just trying to have an efficient way to make referrals and place these inmates in a nursing home , '' insists Mike Lawlor , Connecticut 's under secretary of criminal justice policy and planning , who is the state 's point man on the issue .
Lawlor said that he understands `` that the neighbors are apprehensive , and they have every right to be apprehensive , '' but he insists that the prisoners will pose no threat to anyone , citing their severe medical conditions .
`` If there is a danger , they wo n't be placed here or in any other community-based residential program . ... These are very , very sick people . There are plenty of very , very sick people who continue to pose a danger that we would not consider for such a placement , but there are sick people who , by any medical or criminal justice analysis , no longer pose a threat to anybody and those are the ones who would be in the facility . ''
He said some of the patients are not mobile , and also notes that there is a locked unit for dementia patients , with security and two parole officers who will be on site .
`` We release people like this to nursing homes all the time , '' Lawlor noted , saying that last year 20 patients were sent to various homes across the state , while 16 prisoners died waiting for transfer .
With the nation 's aging prison population , `` the number in this category is getting bigger and it is a little easier to do it if you have set aside a dedicated nursing home . ''
However the state 's assurances are not enough for the town , and neighbors are not convinced the residents wo n't be a danger .
`` These are not people who belong in a convalescent home , they belong in a prison , '' said Rocky Hill 's Acting Mayor Timothy Moriarty . `` They say that they are at the end of life , but you know what ? They committed a crime and they should do the time . ''
The town has filed suit to challenge the state plan , claiming the facility owners did not get the proper approval from the town in order to operate .
`` This is something that just came out of nowhere , we were n't warned about it or even approached about it , we just found out about it in the 11th hour , '' Moriarty said of the state 's plan . `` It seems like there was something , you know , swept under the carpet here to try to make this thing happen without us being aware of it . ''
The owner of the home has filed a motion to dismiss the town 's lawsuit , and Lawlor insists the operator followed normal procedure to gain approval to open as a nursing home . He notes , though , the owner did not disclose plans to contract with the state to accept patients from prisons and the mental health hospital .
`` There is nothing about this nursing home that will be different than a regular nursing home , '' Lawlor said .
Meanwhile , the construction workers are busy preparing the facility for its new patients , who will receive similar nursing care as the former residents . There is a carpeted dining hall , fenced in outdoor space and the expected medical equipment of any nursing home .
The nursing home 's license could come from the state Department of Health at any time , and soon after the first patients could arrive .","Josh and Lauren Egan were newly married when they bought their first home in Rocky Hill, Conn., and were looking forward to raising a family in the Hartford suburb.

The owner of the home has filed a motion to dismiss the town's lawsuit, and Lawlor insists the operator followed normal procedure to gain approval to open as a nursing home. He notes, though, the owner did not disclose plans to contract with the state to accept patients from prisons and the mental health hospital.

""There is nothing about this nursing home that will be different than a regular nursing home,"" Lawlor said.

Meanwhile, the construction workers are busy preparing the facility for its new patients, who will receive similar nursing care as the former residents. There is a carpeted dining hall, fenced in outdoor space and the expected medical equipment of any nursing home.

The nursing home's license could come from the state Department of Health at any time, and soon after the first patients could arrive.

(CNN) - The Internal Revenue Service spent millions of taxpayer dollars on everything from event planners' commissions to speakers' fees to guest prizes to parody videos at a 2010 conference, an audit of the agency shows.

The beleaguered agency - already snared in controversy over its targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status - spent $4.1 million on a 2010 conference in Anaheim, California, with ""questionable expenses"" comprising much of the budget, according to the report released Tuesday by the Treasury Department's inspector general for tax administration.



The audit notes that a large chunk of that money - about $3.2 million - came from unused funds allocated for hiring. This was in the same year that the IRS began to single out conservative and tea party groups that sought tax-exempt office, in part because the agency said it did not have the personnel to handle the overwhelming amount of applications pouring in that year.

""Effective cost management is especially important given the current economic environment and focus on Government efficiency,"" Inspector General J. Russell George said in a statement. ""Certain of the IRS's expenses associated with the Anaheim conference do not appear to be a good use of taxpayer funds.""

Read the audit report

The August 2010 conference, held by the Small Business/Self-Employed division, had 2,600 attendees at three hotels in Anaheim. The audit states that none of the guests were required to document their attendance at the training sessions.

While the division made 1,516 hires that year, not all of them were on board the full year, so the division used the unused money for the three-day conference. Managers also indicated the used additional training funds for the event.

The audit notes that the IRS–a stickler for record keeping–could only provide documentation for $4.1 million. The division estimated it actually spent $4,297,285, but could not source that additional amount, according to the report.

The IRS used event planners instead of IRS employees or contractors to set up the conference, giving no incentive to get lower rates and leaving the government to pay $135 per night for all rooms. Instead of working for favorable room rates, both event planners got $66,500 in commission from the hotels, according to the audit.

Other expenses included more than $135,000 on outside speakers–including a $17,000 fee for a speaker who created paintings on stage to make his point that one must free ""the thought process to find creative solutions to challenges.""

""The speaker created six paintings at these two keynote sessions (three at each session). These paintings consisted of the following portraits: Albert Einstein (one); Michael Jordan (one); Abraham Lincoln (one); U2 singer Bono (one); and the Statute of Liberty (two),"" the audit states.

While two of the paintings were given away at the conference and three were donated, one was reported lost.

The IRS also paid $11,400 to a speaker who specializes in happiness and positive psychology. He led four 90-minute workshops.

Another speaker received $27,500 for two hour-long speeches. The speaker's fee included a $2,500 flight in first class.

The presentation was based on the speaker's published book and, according to the contract, the speaker was to ""share how seemingly random combinations of ideas can drive radical innovations.""

On a somewhat ironic note, one of the sessions in the programs lists a speech given by IRS speakers titled: ""Political Savvy: How Not to Shoot Yourself in the Foot.""

In other expenses, IRS employees doled out $35,800 on three planning trips before the conference.

Forty-five employees who lived in the local area got to stay in the hotels and received daily per diems, amounting to more than $30,000 total.

The SB/SE division spent more than $50,000 on videos for the conference. One of the videos, CNN has reported, had a Star-Trek theme, while the other was a parody on IRS employees learning how to do the Cupid Shuffle dance.

Because the IRS did not keep track of all expenses for the videos, the inspector general's office estimates that it took 62 staff hours to produce the piece at a minimum hourly rate of $50.

Stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison on Thursday for lying to congress and obstructing the FBI ’ s investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in 2016 to steal the election . Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded there was no evidence that anyone on the Trump campaign colluded with Russia , yet Stone was still charged with obstruction .
Judge Amy Berman Jackson , who had signaled previously that she may give Stone a harsh sentence , handed down the sentence on Thursday , saying “ The court should not just shrug its shoulders and say this is a case of ‘ Roger being Roger , ’ ” according to The New York Daily news .
Jackson , an Obama appointee , went on to say that Stone ’ s crimes hurt American democracy and that letting him off easy would damage the rule of law and let partisanship reign supreme .
“ The truth still exits . The truth still matters , ” Jackson said . “ For that reason , the dismay and disgust at the defendant ’ s belligerence should transcend party . ”
To reiterate , no one who was anti-Trump and lied to congress has been sentenced . Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper , former FBI Director James Comey , and former CIA Director John Brennan have yet to be brought up on lying charges despite evidence that they did . Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe just had the investigation into his own lying dropped .
Prosecutors had asked previously that Stone be sentenced up to nine years in prison for his non-violent crimes . The prosecutors wrote that Stone “ obstructed Congress ’ investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election , lied under oath , and tampered with a witness. ” Further , when he was indicted , “ he displayed contempt for this Court and the rule of law . ”
Stone displayed contempt likely because his house was raided early in the morning to make his arrest more dramatic . CNN was tipped off to the raid and had cameras set up outside so the nation could watch police forcefully arrest a 67-year-old man who had been charged with non-violent crimes .
The Department of Justice pushed back on the harsh recommendation , leading to the resignation of all four prosecutors on the case .
On Thursday Morning , Trump tweeted a segment from Tucker Carlson ’ s Fox News program that suggested the president would pardon Stone .
“ President Trump could end this travesty in an instant with a pardon , and there are indications tonight that he will do that , ” Carlson said in a segment on his show Wednesday night . Carlson also in that segment called Stone ’ s prosecution “ a shocking insult to the American tradition of equal justice . ”
Just before 2:00 a.m. , Trump tweeted out the segment , but said nothing one way or the other about him pardoning Stone .
Other right-leaning commentators have called for Stone to be pardoned , including Fox News senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano . Rep. Matt Gaetz ( R-FL ) has also called for Stone to be pardoned .","Former Trump associate Roger Stone has become the latest person in President Donald Trump’s orbit to be sentenced for lying to congress, something that has so far not happened to any anti-Trump people who have lied to congress.

Stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison on Thursday for lying to congress and obstructing the FBI’s investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in 2016 to steal the election. Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded there was no evidence that anyone on the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, yet Stone was still charged with obstruction.

Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who had signaled previously that she may give Stone a harsh sentence, handed down the sentence on Thursday, saying “The court should not just shrug its shoulders and say this is a case of ‘Roger being Roger,’” according to The New York Daily news.

Jackson, an Obama appointee, went on to say that Stone’s crimes hurt American democracy and that letting him off easy would damage the rule of law and let partisanship reign supreme.

“The truth still exits. The truth still matters,” Jackson said. “For that reason, the dismay and disgust at the defendant’s belligerence should transcend party.”

To reiterate, no one who was anti-Trump and lied to congress has been sentenced. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former FBI Director James Comey, and former CIA Director John Brennan have yet to be brought up on lying charges despite evidence that they did. Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe just had the investigation into his own lying dropped.

Prosecutors had asked previously that Stone be sentenced up to nine years in prison for his non-violent crimes. The prosecutors wrote that Stone “obstructed Congress’ investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, lied under oath, and tampered with a witness.” Further, when he was indicted, “he displayed contempt for this Court and the rule of law.”

Boehner spokesman Michael Steel also had pointed words for the administration .
“ The First Amendment is first for a reason . If the Obama administration is going after reporters ’ phone records , they better have a damned good explanation , ” he said .
The allegations come on the heels of a pair of major controversies for the Obama administration . Fresh testimony and newly released documents last week raised questions about whether top administration officials deliberately distorted the details of the Benghazi attack as they first began providing details to the public last September . Then the IRS acknowledged Friday that it singled out conservative groups like the Tea Party for additional scrutiny as it screened applications for tax-exempt status .

Rules published by the Justice Department require that subpoenas of records of news organizations must be personally approved by the attorney general , but it was not known if that happened in this case . The letter notifying AP that its phone records had been obtained through subpoenas was sent Friday by Ronald Machen , the U.S. attorney in Washington .
William Miller , a spokesman for Machen , said Monday that in general the U.S. attorney follows `` all applicable laws , federal regulations and Department of Justice policies when issuing subpoenas for phone records of media organizations .

According to the AP , it was not clear if the records obtained also included incoming calls or the duration of the calls .

In a letter of protest sent to Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday , AP President and Chief Executive Officer Gary Pruitt said the government sought and obtained information far beyond anything that could be justified by any specific investigation .

The government would not say why it sought the records . Officials have previously said in public testimony that the U.S. attorney in Washington is conducting a criminal investigation into who may have provided information contained in a May 7 , 2012 , AP story about a foiled terror plot . The story disclosed details of a CIA operation in Yemen that stopped an Al Qaeda plot in the spring of 2012 to detonate a bomb on an airplane bound for the United States .
In testimony in February , CIA Director John Brennan noted that the FBI had questioned him about whether he was AP 's source , which he denied . He called the release of the information to the media about the terror plot an `` unauthorized and dangerous disclosure of classified information . ''
Prosecutors have sought phone records from reporters before , but the seizure of records from such a wide array of AP offices , including general AP switchboards numbers and an office-wide shared fax line , is unusual .
In the letter notifying the AP , which was received Friday , the Justice Department offered no explanation for the seizure , according to Pruitt 's letter and attorneys for the AP . The records were presumably obtained from phone companies earlier this year although the government letter did not explain that . None of the information provided by the government to the AP suggested the actual phone conversations were monitored .
Among those whose phone numbers were obtained were five reporters and an editor who were involved in the May 7 , 2012 , story .
The Obama administration has aggressively investigated disclosures of classified information to the media and has brought six cases against people suspected of providing classified information , more than under all previous presidents combined .
The American Civil Liberties Union said the use of subpoenas for a broad swath of records has a chilling effect both on journalists and whistle-blowers who want to reveal government wrongdoing . `` The attorney general must explain the Justice Department 's actions to the public so that we can make sure this kind of press intimidation does not happen again , '' said Laura Murphy , the director of ACLU 's Washington legislative office .","Lawmakers from both parties sharply questioned the Justice Department over its reported effort to secretly obtain two months of phone records from Associated Press journalists, with House Speaker John Boehner’s office saying “they better have a damned good explanation.”

But Pruitt wrote that most of the records collected from the AP ""can have no plausible connection to any ongoing investigation,"" and the American Civil Liberties Union called on the Justice Department to explain its actions.

""Obtaining a broad range of telephone records in order to ferret out a government leaker is an unacceptable abuse of power,"" Ben Wizner, the head of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said in a written statement. ""Freedom of the press is a pillar of our democracy, and that freedom often depends on confidential communications between reporters and their sources.""

In a statement issued Monday night, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said, ""I am very troubled by these allegations and want to hear the government's explanation.""

""The burden is always on the government when they go after private information -- especially information regarding the press or its confidential sources,"" said Leahy, D-Vermont. ""I want to know more about this case, but on the face of it, I am concerned that the government may not have met that burden.""

And Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, told CNN that the Justice Department already has the ability ""to listen, very transparently, to all the government phones and government activities.""

""You can imagine if Congress wanted to know about leaks that obviously came out of the administration that ended up in the press, they would be outraged if we tried to get that information,"" said Issa, a member of the House Judiciary Committee and a leading critic of Holder. ""But that's exactly what they're doing. They're looking at what is considered to be confidential.""",www.cnn.com,left,5TOZ0ox9Sce1YbGI

One source told ███ that the draft report explicitly used the word `` insubordinate '' to describe Comey 's behavior . Another source agreed with that characterization but could not confirm the use of the term .
In the draft report , Inspector General Michael Horowitz also rebuked former Attorney General Loretta Lynch for her handling of the federal investigation into Hillary Clinton 's personal email server , the sources said .
On Tuesday morning , President Donald Trump complained of `` numerous delays '' in the release of Horowitz 's final report , which is expected to run several hundred pages long and be released in the coming days . The sources who spoke to ███ were willing or able to address only a portion of the draft report 's complete findings .
`` What is taking so long with the Inspector General 's Report on Crooked Hillary and Slippery James Comey , '' Trump said on Twitter . `` Hope report is not being changed and made weaker ! ''
There is no indication the president has seen – or will see – a draft of the report before its release . Horowitz , however , could revise the draft report now that current and former officials mentioned in it have offered their responses to the inspector general 's conclusions , according to the sources .
Almost from the start , the long-awaited report was expected to chastise Comey for his handling of the Clinton-related probe . But in apparently describing Comey 's defiance of authority , the draft report was criticizing a man who prided himself on his leadership style at the FBI and has since dedicated his post-government life to promoting a new generation of effective leaders .
The draft of Horowitz 's wide-ranging report specifically called out Comey for ignoring objections from the Justice Department when he disclosed in a letter to Congress just days before the 2016 presidential election that FBI agents had reopened the Clinton probe , according to sources . Clinton has said that letter doomed her campaign .
Before Comey sent the letter to Congress , at least one senior Justice Department official told the FBI that publicizing the bombshell move so close to an election would violate longstanding department policy , and it would ignore federal guidelines prohibiting the disclosure of information related to an ongoing investigation , ███ was told .
In an interview in April , ███ Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos asked Comey : `` If Attorney General Lynch had ordered you not to send the letter , would you have sent it ? ''
`` No , '' Comey responded . `` I believe in the chain of command . ''
But in backing Trump 's ultimate decision to fire Comey last year , Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein slammed Comey 's letter to Congress and said it `` was wrong '' for Comey `` to usurp the Attorney General 's authority '' when he announced in July 2016 that the FBI would not be filing charges against Clinton or her aides .
`` It is not the function of the Director to make such an announcement , '' Rosenstein said in a letter to Trump recommending Comey be fired . `` At most , the Director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors . ''
Horowitz 's draft report cited Comey for failing to consult with Lynch and other senior Justice Department officials before making his announcement on national TV . While saying there was no `` clear evidence '' that Clinton `` intended to violate '' the law , Comey insisted the former secretary of state was `` extremely careless '' in her `` handling of very sensitive , highly classified information . ''
`` I have not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice or any other part of the government . They do not know what I am about to say , '' Comey said before cameras on July 5 , 2016 .
By then , Lynch had taken the unusual step of publicly declaring she would accept the FBI 's recommendations in the case , after an impromptu meeting with former president Bill Clinton sparked questions about her impartiality .
Comey has defended his decisions as director , insisting he was trying to protect the FBI from even further criticism and `` did n't see that I had a choice . ''
`` The honest answer is I screwed up a couple of things , but ... I think given what I knew at the time , these were the decisions that were best calculated to preserve the values of the institutions , '' Comey told ███ . `` I still think it was the right thing to do . ''
More than a year ago , as lawmakers increasingly voiced concern over how the FBI and Justice Department handled matters surrounding the 2016 election , the inspector general 's office announced that it had launched an investigation into an array of allegations , including an allegation `` that Department or FBI policies or procedures were not followed in connection with , or in actions leading up to or related to , the FBI Director 's public announcement on July 5 , 2016 . ''
A week before the announcement , while the investigation into Hillary Clinton was still underway , a political firestorm erupted in Washington after Lynch happened to run into Bill Clinton in Arizona and briefly met with him inside a plane sitting on a tarmac there . Days later , with questions swirling over whether Bill Clinton tried to improperly influence the investigation into his wife , Lynch haphazardly announced that she would not recuse herself from the matter but would `` fully expect to accept '' whatever recommendation the FBI made .
Comey later called it a `` tortured half-out , half-in approach . '' And after such a `` strange '' announcement , `` I decided I have to step away from her and show the American people the FBI 's work separately , '' Comey told ███ .
The inspector general 's office seemed to similarly view Lynch 's announcement as strange , with the draft report criticizing her for how she handled the impromptu tarmac meeting and its aftermath , according to sources familiar with the findings .
In April , when Comey was promoting his new book `` A Higher Loyalty , '' Lynch issued a statement saying that during the Clinton email investigation she `` trusted '' the `` non-partisan career prosecutors '' handling the case `` to assess the facts and make a recommendation -- one that I ultimately accepted because I thought the evidence and law warranted it . ''
Nevertheless , ███ has confirmed that Horowitz 's draft report went on to criticize senior FBI officials , including Comey and fired FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe , for their response to the late discovery of a laptop containing evidence that may have related to the Clinton investigation .
That discovery prompted the FBI 's letter to Congress announcing the reopening of the Hillary Clinton email probe . Hundreds of thousands of emails had been found on the laptop of disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner , whose wife , Huma Abedin , was a top aide to the secretary of state .
It took weeks for the FBI to start analyzing the laptop 's contents , and Horowitz 's draft report criticized senior FBI officials for how long the laptop languished inside the bureau , sources told ███ .
The Associated Press first reported that the draft report criticized senior FBI officials for their handling of the laptop .
McCabe was fired from the FBI in March , after Horowitz concluded in a separate report that McCabe `` lacked candor '' when speaking to internal investigators about his role in a disclosure to the media . The matter has since been referred to the U.S. attorney in Washington for possible prosecution , and McCabe 's legal team is now seeking a grant of immunity from lawmakers who want him to testify before a Senate panel about Horowitz 's findings .
Talking with ███ about his own firing , Comey said he decided to write a book afterward because , `` It occurred to me maybe I can be useful by offering a view to people , especially to young people , of what leadership should look like and how it should be centered on values . ''
███ was unable to ascertain information about another key part of the inspector general 's report : whether animus toward Trump may have influenced the FBI 's investigation of Hillary Clinton 's emails or the subsequent probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 election .
FBI senior agent Peter Strzok and FBI attorney Lisa Page exchanged hundreds of messages in the lead-up to the election , including messages calling Trump `` an idiot '' and saying the Republican Party `` needs to pull their head out of their '' rear-ends . The messages also included critiques of Hillary Clinton .
`` There are so many horrible things to tell , the public has the right to know . Transparency ! '' Trump said in his Twitter message on Tuesday .

justice_department,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2015/0304/Justice-Department-report-rips-Ferguson-police-why-that-s-not-the-whole-story,Justice Department report rips Ferguson police: why that's not the whole story,2015-03-04,Patrik Jonsson,"A Department of Justice report finding that the Ferguson , Mo. , Police Department was rife with racial bias highlights broader problems in American policing . But it also serves as a contrast to a significant but less-sensational development : cops in some cities have begun to walk more softly on their beats .
The Justice Department report on police in Ferguson , where the death of Michael Brown last August led to months of raucous protests , came two days after President Obama released a slew of recommendations from a federal policing task force , including using less confrontational tactics and reining in creeping militarism .
But even as those recommendations sink in , there ’ s evidence that , at least in some neighborhoods , beat cops are already implementing reforms designed to promote more empathetic dealings with the public . That shift has , in a very short time , contributed to a “ watershed moment ” for policing in the United States , says Lewis Walker , a Western Michigan University sociologist who studies policing trends .
To be sure , a lot of beat cops shrug at efforts to eliminate ticket quotas and to curb street searches as “ liberal mumbo jumbo , ” says Peter Moskos , a sociologist at John Jay College in New York who turned his experiences as a Baltimore beat cop into the book “ Cop in the Hood . ”
Yet police chiefs in cities such as Atlanta and Kalamazoo , Mich. , are making profound changes . And for all the station house grumbling about cops being blamed for society ’ s problems , the emerging reforms do , at their heart , touch a libertarian , anti-statist streak found among many American cops , where focus on arrests for minor drug violations and crimes like “ manner of walking in roadway ” are seen as counterproductive state meddling , say Mr. Moskos and others .
“ Officers on the whole are well-intended , they don ’ t feel they ’ re intentionally targeting anybody , just being hypervigilant in those neighborhoods and digging , ” says Kalamazoo Police Chief Jeff Hadley . “ But there are unintended consequences to that type of policing , which is why police departments have begun to challenge assumptions in terms of style and how implicit bias plays into our decisionmaking . ”
Broadly speaking , American policing is at a difficult juncture . Under Attorney General Eric Holder , the Department of Justice has written scathing critiques of police culture in cities like Cleveland and Albuquerque , where high-profile shootings have garnered national attention . Meanwhile , the advent of ubiquitous smartphone cameras have given Americans unvarnished glimpses of policing gone tragically wrong .
The Justice Department 's Ferguson findings , which allege that a mostly white police force made racist jokes and gave black suspects far less leeway and discretion than white ones , still define many places . Adding to the tension , US police culture is traditionally monolithic and tough to budge , given the solidarity born of the shared experience of facing both mortal dangers and the sometimes impossible and messy tasks appointed to them by the public .
Yet departments that have challenged that culture by changing reward structures , curbing policies that disproportionately impact minorities , and hiring from nontraditional labor pools have seen dramatic results .
Evidence from cities including Seattle , Kalamazoo , and Atlanta suggests that a seemingly intractable police culture can in some cases be quite malleable .
“ Officers say , ‘ What ’ s in it for me to change how I police ? ’ ” says Mr. Hadley . “ That ’ s why we have to take a hard look at internal reward systems . Traditionally , the guy who would get a pat on the back and promoted to the SWAT team tended to be the guy who ’ s kicking [ the stuffing ] out of everybody – the guy who gets a couple of good arrests but racks up 100 complaints in the process . But that kind of old-school mentality isn ’ t carrying water anymore . ”
A study commissioned by Hadley in Kalamazoo found a police department that , he says , behaved much like the one in Ferguson .

“ The biggest win isn ’ t necessarily for the community , it ’ s for the officers , ” says Hadley . “ By creating positive human contact between us and the community , it not only changes the community ’ s thought process but the officers ’ thought process . It doesn ’ t take long . ”","A Department of Justice report finding that the Ferguson, Mo., Police Department was rife with racial bias highlights broader problems in American policing. But it also serves as a contrast to a significant but less-sensational development: cops in some cities have begun to walk more softly on their beats.

The Justice Department report on police in Ferguson, where the death of Michael Brown last August led to months of raucous protests, came two days after President Obama released a slew of recommendations from a federal policing task force, including using less confrontational tactics and reining in creeping militarism.

But even as those recommendations sink in, there’s evidence that, at least in some neighborhoods, beat cops are already implementing reforms designed to promote more empathetic dealings with the public. That shift has, in a very short time, contributed to a “watershed moment” for policing in the United States, says Lewis Walker, a Western Michigan University sociologist who studies policing trends.

To be sure, a lot of beat cops shrug at efforts to eliminate ticket quotas and to curb street searches as “liberal mumbo jumbo,” says Peter Moskos, a sociologist at John Jay College in New York who turned his experiences as a Baltimore beat cop into the book “Cop in the Hood.”

Yet police chiefs in cities such as Atlanta and Kalamazoo, Mich., are making profound changes. And for all the station house grumbling about cops being blamed for society’s problems, the emerging reforms do, at their heart, touch a libertarian, anti-statist streak found among many American cops, where focus on arrests for minor drug violations and crimes like “manner of walking in roadway” are seen as counterproductive state meddling, say Mr. Moskos and others.

“Officers on the whole are well-intended, they don’t feel they’re intentionally targeting anybody, just being hypervigilant in those neighborhoods and digging,” says Kalamazoo Police Chief Jeff Hadley. “But there are unintended consequences to that type of policing, which is why police departments have begun to challenge assumptions in terms of style and how implicit bias plays into our decisionmaking.”

Broadly speaking, American policing is at a difficult juncture. Under Attorney General Eric Holder, the Department of Justice has written scathing critiques of police culture in cities like Cleveland and Albuquerque, where high-profile shootings have garnered national attention. Meanwhile, the advent of ubiquitous smartphone cameras have given Americans unvarnished glimpses of policing gone tragically wrong.

The Justice Department's Ferguson findings, which allege that a mostly white police force made racist jokes and gave black suspects far less leeway and discretion than white ones, still define many places. Adding to the tension, US police culture is traditionally monolithic and tough to budge, given the solidarity born of the shared experience of facing both mortal dangers and the sometimes impossible and messy tasks appointed to them by the public.

Yet departments that have challenged that culture by changing reward structures, curbing policies that disproportionately impact minorities, and hiring from nontraditional labor pools have seen dramatic results.

Evidence from cities including Seattle, Kalamazoo, and Atlanta suggests that a seemingly intractable police culture can in some cases be quite malleable.

“Officers say, ‘What’s in it for me to change how I police?’ ” says Mr. Hadley. “That’s why we have to take a hard look at internal reward systems. Traditionally, the guy who would get a pat on the back and promoted to the SWAT team tended to be the guy who’s kicking [the stuffing] out of everybody – the guy who gets a couple of good arrests but racks up 100 complaints in the process. But that kind of old-school mentality isn’t carrying water anymore.”

A study commissioned by Hadley in Kalamazoo found a police department that, he says, behaved much like the one in Ferguson. While white motorists were far more likely to be carrying contraband, officers targeted black drivers for searches at far higher rates, even in white parts of the city. In a year, the city cut the number of searches at traffic stops by 42 percent. But fewer searches and arrests didn’t materialize into more crime, as many officers feared. Instead, the number of seizures of illegal guns increased and the city’s overall crime fell by 7 percent.

In Seattle, a series of controversies involving officers using social media to disparage gays and blacks led to backlash from an unexpected front. Last week, local police union president Ron Smith, whose organization has long defended more-traditional policing, told his members that police work has to “change to adapt to societal expectations.”

But those won’t last forever.”

And in Atlanta, Police Chief George Turner fired or forced into retirement record numbers of officers who refused to abandon hard-charging policing practices. In addition, he began to promote paragons of a new kind of police officer, including the city’s first openly gay deputy chief.

USA TODAY

The wife of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer acquitted in the killing of Trayvon Martin, has been sentenced to one year probation and 100 hours of community service after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor perjury charge for lying at her husband's bond hearing.

Shellie Zimmerman, in court Wednesday, admitted that she perjured herself before Judge Kenneth Lester at an April 22, 2012, bond hearing for her husband. At that hearing, she told Lester, who was then presiding over her husband's case, that the couple had little funds.

But in a court filing, State Attorney Angela Corey said Shellie Zimmerman perjured herself by failing to reveal that George Zimmerman had collected more than $100,000 through Internet donations.

George Zimmerman instructed Shellie Zimmerman on how to transfer money from his bank account into hers and his sister's while he was in jail in April 2012, according to recordings of jail calls released by the Florida State Attorney's Office. According to an affidavit, Shellie Zimmerman transferred more than $74,000 to her personal account days before the April bond hearing. Nearly $50,000 was transferred to an account held by Zimmerman's sister.

Taped phone calls between the couple revealed that they had discussed the money transfers in code to hide the funds, according to the affidavit. Prosecutors allege that Zimmerman and his wife talked about $10, $20 and $100 to mask the fact that they were referring to thousands of dollars. The calls also showed that George Zimmerman instructed his wife to ""pay off all the bills,"" including payments to American Express and Sam's Club.

Lester ruled on June 3, 2012, that Shellie Zimmerman had ""testified untruthfully"" about their finances. She was later arrested on June 12, 2012, and jailed briefly in Seminole County before posting a $1,000 bond.

George Zimmerman killed Trayvon Martin on Feb. 26, 2012, in a gated townhouse community in Sanford, Fla., as the teen returned home from buying snacks at a convenience store.

GEORGE ZIMMERMAN:Wants Florida to cover some legal fees

Zimmerman said he shot the unarmed teenager in self-defense after being attacked. A jury last month found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter.

Shellie Zimmerman had originally faced a third-degree felony perjury charge but the court accepted a plea deal. Wednesday, she pleaded guilty to ""perjury not in official proceedings,"" which is a misdemeanor. She also filed in open court a letter of apology to Lester. A copy of the letter was not immediately available to USA TODAY.

Assistant State Attorney John Guy, one of the attorneys who argued before the court at George Zimmerman's trial, was back in court to handle Shellie Zimmerman's case.

As part of Shellie Zimmerman's one year of probation, she was given a list of conditions she must abide by.

In part, she cannot possess, carry or own a firearm and must get permission to own any other type of weapon. She also must get permission from her probation officer before moving, changing jobs or leaving the county where she lives.

She must also report regularly to a probation officer, pay $263 in court fees/fines and pay the state of Florida $50 per month as a cost of supervision while on probation.

Her probation can also be revoked if she violates the law, associates with anyone engaged in criminal activity or uses any drugs not prescribed by a doctor.",www.usatoday.com,center,oNORLQdelXbkQxAC
justice_department,Slate,0,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/02/william-barr-fall-department-of-justice-donald-trump.html,The Fall of the DOJ,2020-02-19,Dahlia Lithwick,"After the worst week in the history of an independent Justice Department since Watergate , on Tuesday , Donald Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of 11 grifters , white-collar criminals , and liars . Declaring himself “ the chief law enforcement officer of the country ” ( he isn ’ t ) , the president continued to tweet at the federal judge who will sentence his buddy , Roger Stone , on Thursday , even though his own Attorney General William Barr has said that Trump tweeting about ongoing criminal investigations and cases make it “ impossible for me to do my job. ” On Tuesday night , Barr leaked to the press that he is contemplating quitting the DOJ if Trump continues to insert himself publicly into ongoing matters of federal criminal law enforcement . This would be a shame for Barr , since both he and Trump seek to create a banana republic in the United States—the only difference is that Barr wants it to have the vestigial trappings of a constitutional democracy and the president ’ s outbursts keep getting in his way .
The crisis at the Justice Department began in earnest last week . Four federal prosecutors quit the Roger Stone case ( and one departed the Justice Department altogether ) after Barr withdrew their proposed sentencing recommendation following Trump ’ s tweet demanding a lesser punishment for Stone .

After the worst week in the history of an independent Justice Department since Watergate, on Tuesday, Donald Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of 11 grifters, white-collar criminals, and liars. Declaring himself “the chief law enforcement officer of the country” (he isn’t), the president continued to tweet at the federal judge who will sentence his buddy, Roger Stone, on Thursday, even though his own Attorney General William Barr has said that Trump tweeting about ongoing criminal investigations and cases make it “impossible for me to do my job.” On Tuesday night, Barr leaked to the press that he is contemplating quitting the DOJ if Trump continues to insert himself publicly into ongoing matters of federal criminal law enforcement. This would be a shame for Barr, since both he and Trump seek to create a banana republic in the United States—the only difference is that Barr wants it to have the vestigial trappings of a constitutional democracy and the president’s outbursts keep getting in his way.

The crisis at the Justice Department began in earnest last week. Four federal prosecutors quit the Roger Stone case (and one departed the Justice Department altogether) after Barr withdrew their proposed sentencing recommendation following Trump’s tweet demanding a lesser punishment for Stone. Barr, insisting that he had undermined the career prosecutors in the case despite Trump’s tweets and not because of them, did an astonishing ABC interview in which he asked the president to stop interfering with the cases he was already ably undermining himself. “I’m not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody,” he said.

Barr has already installed politically supportive U.S. attorneys to review the DOJ’s work in several high-profile cases that involved the president, including the Michael Flynn prosecution and the Russia probe completed by Robert Mueller. Barr also just announced that he would like to conscript local sheriffs in his efforts to retaliate against so-called sanctuary cities. In other words, he is working assiduously to cast doubt on any prosecutions that touch Trump and also to intimidate the president’s alleged enemies. All he is asking in exchange is for the president’s quiet compliance with the program. But Trump continues to tweet about his grudges and imaginary persecutions, now going after a juror in an overt effort to chill juries that do not support him. This is not a good look for Barr, as it undermines his ability to quietly complete the job, and Barr knows it.

Donald Trump doesn’t understand that the DOJ isn’t his personal law firm.

Over the weekend, more than 2,000 former DOJ employees signed a public letter urging Barr to resign over his handling of the Stone sentencing, and Donald Ayer, who served as deputy attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, called for Barr’s resignation in the Atlantic. “Bill Barr’s America is not a place that anyone, including Trump voters, should want to go,” Ayer wrote. “It is a banana republic where all are subject to the whims of a dictatorial president and his henchmen. To prevent that, we need a public uprising demanding that Bill Barr resign immediately, or failing that, be impeached.” Last week, the president of the American Bar Association, Judy Perry Martinez, issued an abrupt statement in support of prosecutorial independence.

The 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides for a way to remove a president who is unable to perform the duties of the office. (This is different from impeachment, the proscribed method to remove a president for misconduct.) The vice president and a majority of cabinet officers must agree, in writing, that the president is unable to discharge the duties of the office. There is no provision for law enforcement — the FBI, lawyers at DOJ, or someone such as Andy McCabe — to force a president from office. Discussions on how, or whether, to attempt to exercise the 25th Amendment in this way is truly indicative of a coup mentality by career bureaucrats.
