A doomed Supreme Court strategy

Under current Senate rules, a minority of as few as 40 Republicans can block a Supreme Court nominee. And both presidents and potentially vulnerable incumbent senators generally prefer to do things through large bipartisan votes rather than narrow partisan ones.

Liberal activists, by contrast, though officially supportive of Judge Garland’s nomination, are not thrilled by it. Garland is on the more conservative side of plausible Democratic nominees, and is also on the older side. Activist groups, in other words, would love to see Clinton revoke Garland’s nomination in favor of a younger and more left-wing choice.

The actual Republican Party, by signaling its intention to block any nominee for any reason, will give Chuck Schumer precisely the political rationale he needs to further curb filibuster — opening the door to a more left-wing justice and potentially more liberal legislation as well.

More Clinton investigations

Perhaps nothing in the history of American government has been more thoroughly investigated than Hillary Clinton’s four-year tenure as Secretary of State. Seven different investigations were mounted into Benghazi alone, but when none of them turned up any wrongdoing, House Republicans decided to convene an eighth investigation — a special select committee designated exclusively to Benghazi.

As Kevin McCarthy, the number two House Republican, explained, the purpose of the eighth investigation was to harm Clinton’s presidential campaign. As he told Sean Hannity in September 2015:

Chaffetz runs the House Oversight Committee, so doing investigations is absolutely his job. If Clinton’s administration does not generate an investigation-worthy controversy or two, I would be shocked. But he’s not saying he will investigation fresh accusations of wrongdoing. He’s saying that after tens of millions of dollars have already been spent investigating Clinton’s State Department years and after Clinton wins an election in which the fruits of those investigations were a major issue, he wants to go investigate them again.

The definition of insanity

If 2016 has taught us anything, it’s that politics is unpredictable.

A strategy of obstructing Clinton on policy — even when it leads to a worse substantive outcome for conservatives than they could have gotten by compromising — plus extensive investigations that simply presuppose Clinton’s guilt might turn out to be political gold. Even if they don’t, a hothouse atmosphere governed by Day One insistence that Crooked Hillary is obviously guilty of immense crimes might encourage Republican voters to nominate a candidate who’s more palatable to mainstream voters next time. Even if that doesn’t happen, bad luck for the American economy or other substantive setbacks in foreign policy could make Clinton super-unpopular.

Anything’s possible.

But fundamentally, as the frequently misattributed saying goes, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.

And thus, far for all the talk of a divided party and a post-Trump civil war, doing exactly that looks like a consensus strategy for the GOP.

us_house,Fox Online News,2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cohen-to-accuse-trump-of-knowledge-in-wikileaks-leak-plot-call-him-a-racist-conman,"Cohen to accuse Trump of knowing about Roger Stone-WikiLeaks plot, but deny 'direct evidence' of Russia collusion",,Gregg Re,"In his testimony before the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Wednesday , Michael Cohen will accuse his former client , President Trump , of knowing that his adviser Roger Stone was reaching out to WikiLeaks concerning the publication of stolen Democratic National Committee emails .
But Cohen apparently will not claim Trump directed those communications , and Cohen will specifically assert that he lacks direct evidence of improper collusion by the Trump campaign with Russia -- a significant admission , given Cohen 's longtime status as the president 's former top lawyer and fixer .
`` Questions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia , '' Cohen will testify . `` I do not . I want to be clear . But , I have my suspicions . ''
In his prepared remarks , which were obtained by Fox News and first reported by Politico , Cohen will additionally point to what he will call an `` unusual '' episode in Trump Tower in approximately June 2016 , when Donald Trump , Jr. supposedly whispered about a `` meeting '' in Trump 's ear -- followed allegedly by Trump 's reply , `` Ok , good . Let me know . ''
Trump has maintained that he did not know in advance about the meeting -- backing up Trump Jr. , who told the Senate Judiciary Committee the same thing in September 2017 and would face potential criminal liability if he were lying . But the administration has changed its accounting of whether Trump was personally involved in drafting a response to media reports about the meeting .
Early Wednesday , President Trump tweeted that Cohen was `` lying in order to reduce his prison time , '' and referred to published reports that Cohen had been disbarred by the New York State Supreme Court -- reports that have not been independently confirmed by Fox News .
The president was tweeting from Hanoi , Vietnam -- where he is attending a summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un .
According to Cohen , `` nothing went on in Trump world , especially the campaign , without Mr. Trump ’ s knowledge and approval . So , I concluded that Don Jr. was referring to that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting about dirt on 18 Hillary with the Russian representative when he walked behind his dad ’ s desk that day . ''
Cohen is slated to outline a slew of other alleged misdeeds by Trump , including lying about his total assets to reduce his taxes and even trying to strongarm academic officials into keeping his SAT scores secret .
In a text message to the Washington Post , Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani strongly denied Cohen 's reported claims , and pointed to Cohen 's release of secret audio tapes of his conversations with Trump as evidence that Cohen ca n't be trusted .
`` It 's pathetic , '' Giuliani said . `` This is a lawyer who tapped his own client when he claimed he was being loyal . If you believe him you are a fool . He bragged he was connected to Russian organized crime and he may be . His father-in-law , who gave him millions [ to invest ] , was convicted of tax fraud in a money-laundering operation . Let 's see if these Democrats want to ask him about his many crimes having nothing to do with anyone but his coterie of business associates with questionable connections . ''
`` If you believe him you are a fool . '' — Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani
In perhaps the most significant portions of his opening statement , according to the transcript , Cohen tells Congress that Trump `` was a presidential candidate who knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails . ''
Stone , who has denied any wrongdoing , has been indicted by a grand jury on charges of obstruction , making false statements and witness tampering as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s probe into possible Russian collusion by the Trump campaign .
Separately , Cohen will also call Trump a `` racist , '' a `` conman , '' and a `` cheat , '' all based , he will claim , on `` documents that are irrefutable . ''
`` I ’ m giving the Committee today three years of President Trump ’ s financial statements , from 2011-2013 , which he gave to Deutsche Bank to inquire about a loan to buy the Buffalo Bills and to Forbes , '' Cohen will say . `` It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes , such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes , and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes . ''
Later , Cohen adds : `` Mr. Trump directed me to find a straw bidder to purchase a portrait of him that was being auctioned at an Art Hamptons event . The objective was to ensure that his portrait , which was going to be auctioned last , would go for the highest price of any portrait that afternoon . The portrait was purchased by the fake bidder for $ 60,000 . Mr. Trump directed the Trump Foundation , which is supposed to be a charitable organization , to repay the fake bidder , despite keeping the art for himself . ''
Cohen also claims he will provide `` copies of letters I wrote at Mr. Trump ’ s direction that threatened his high school , colleges , and the College Board not to release his grades or SAT scores . ''
The former Trump fixer will also provide what he calls proof for his previous claims that Trump organized hush-money payments to two women who claimed affairs with Trump .
`` He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair , and to lie to his wife about it , which I did , '' Cohen will testify . `` Lying to the first lady is one of my biggest regrets . She is a kind , good person . I respect her greatly – and she did not deserve that . I am giving the Committee today a copy of the $ 130,000 wire transfer from me to Ms. Clifford ’ s attorney during the closing days of the presidential campaign that was demanded by Ms. Clifford to maintain her silence about her affair with Mr. Trump .
`` I am providing a copy of a $ 35,000 check that President Trump personally signed from his personal bank 14 account on August 1 , 2017 – when he was President of the United States – pursuant to the cover-up , which was the basis of my guilty plea , to reimburse me – the word used by Mr. Trump ’ s TV lawyer -- for the illegal hush money I paid on his behalf , '' Cohen continues . `` This $ 35,000 check was one of 11 check installments that was paid throughout the year – while he was President . ''
In addition to lying to Congress , Cohen pleaded guilty last year to campaign finance violations for his involvement in the hush money payments . Federal prosecutors in New York have said Trump directed Cohen to arrange the payments to buy the silence of adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in the run-up to the 2016 campaign . Cohen told a judge that he agreed to cover up Trump 's `` dirty deeds '' out of `` blind loyalty . ''
Cohen is set to begin a three-year prison sentence in May . Trump denies the allegations and says Cohen lied to get a lighter sentence .
The president and some commentators have also characterized Cohen as a `` rat '' -- an insult that Cohen will seek to address .
`` Over the past two years , I have been smeared as ' a rat ' by the president of the United States , '' Cohen will say . `` The truth is much different ''
Meanwhile , in a remarkable social media post on the eve of the hearing , a top Republican suggested that lurid details of Cohen 's private life may take center stage .
The blockbuster public testimony threatened to overshadow Trump 's summit in Vietnam with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , prompting some observers to say the timing was more than coincidental .
Tuesday was the first of three consecutive days of congressional appearances scheduled for Cohen . After the public hearing Wednesday , he will appear before the House intelligence panel Thursday , again speaking in private .
Republicans are expected to aggressively attempt to discredit Cohen , given that he has acknowledged lying previously . White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement Tuesday it was `` laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word , and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies . ''
RNC TELLS MICHAEL COHEN TO 'HAVE FUN IN PRISON , ' AS GOP PREPS WAR ROOM AHEAD OF TESTIMONY
Cohen will also suggest that Trump wanted him to lie to Congress about the aborted Trump Tower Moscow project -- a lie for which Cohen has pleaded guilty . But Cohen will stop short of saying Trump directly told him to lie , according to the transcript .
`` To be clear : Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it . He lied about it because he never expected to win the election , '' Cohen will say . `` He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project . And so I lied about it , too – because Mr. Trump had made clear to me , through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country , that he wanted me to lie . And he made it clear to me because his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before I gave it to Congress . ''
`` We 're witness testing , not witness tampering . '' — Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz
Buzzfeed News last month published a bombshell , discredited report , citing two law enforcement officials who said Cohen acknowledged to Mueller ’ s office that Trump told him to lie to Congress about a potential real estate deal in Moscow , and claim that the negotiations ended months before they did so as to conceal Trump ’ s involvement .
But Mueller issued his first public statement in more than a year to repudiate the BuzzFeed report just 24 hours after its publication , flatly asserting that the story was `` not accurate . '' The Washington Post has since reported that Mueller intended his rare denial to mean that the story was `` almost entirely incorrect , '' and that the Special Counsel 's Office immediately `` reviewed evidence to determine if there were any documents or witness interviews like those described , reaching out to those they thought might have a stake in the case . They found none . ''
One Republican House member , meanwhile , did more than just question Cohen 's credibility in the run-up to the hearing on Wednesday . Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz tweeted Tuesday that the world is `` about to learn a lot '' about Cohen and suggested he knew of disparaging information that could come out during his testimony .
Gaetz , a Trump ally who talks to the president frequently , is not a member of the committee that will question Cohen . He did not offer any evidence . Still , the tweet was extraordinary because his remarks appeared to some Democrats to constitute threatening or intimidating a witness .
In a tweet , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote , `` I encourage all Members to be mindful that comments made on social media or in the press can adversely affect the ability of House Committees to obtain the truthful and complete information necessary to fulfill their duties . ''
Pelosi went on to suggest that Gaetz may have even opened himself to legal liability , warning that the Constitution 's Speech or Debate Clause -- which provides virtually absolute legal immunity to statements made by senators and representatives during congressional debates -- might not protect Gaetz , who made his comments away from the House floor .
`` We 're witness testing , not witness tampering , '' Gaetz countered in an interview with reporters . `` When witnesses come before Congress , their truthfulness and veracity are in question and we have the opportunity to test them . ''
Lanny Davis , one of Cohen 's lawyers , said in a statement that he would n't respond to Gaetz 's `` despicable lies and personal smears , except to say we trust that his colleagues in the House , both Republicans and Democrats , will repudiate his words and his conduct . ''
Democrats have been alternately suspicious of Cohen and eager to hear what he has to say . Sen. Mark Warner , the intelligence panel 's top Democrat , suggested in a brief statement to reporters outside Tuesday 's interview that Cohen had provided important information .
JUDGE NAP : COHEN TESTIMONY IS DESIGNED TO DISTRACT FROM SECOND TRUMP-KIM SUMMIT
`` Two years ago , when this investigation started , I said it may be the most important thing I am involved in in my public life in the Senate , and nothing I 've heard today dissuades me from that view , '' Warner said .
Senators on the intelligence panel attended Tuesday 's private meeting , a departure from the committee 's usual practice , where witness interviews are conducted by staff only . The Senate intel panel 's chairman , Richard Burr , suggested to The Associated Press before the meeting that his committee would take steps to ensure that Cohen was telling the truth .
`` I 'm sure there will be some questions we know the answers to , so we 'll test him to see whether in fact he 'll be truthful this time , '' Burr said .
At least one Republican member of the intelligence panel refused to go to the meeting . `` I do n't have any desire to go listen to a lying lawyer , '' said Texas Sen. John Cornyn .","In his testimony before the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Wednesday, Michael Cohen will accuse his former client, President Trump, of knowing that his adviser Roger Stone was reaching out to WikiLeaks concerning the publication of stolen Democratic National Committee emails.

""I am providing a copy of a $35,000 check that President Trump personally signed from his personal bank 14 account on August 1, 2017 – when he was President of the United States – pursuant to the cover-up, which was the basis of my guilty plea, to reimburse me – the word used by Mr. Trump’s TV lawyer -- for the illegal hush money I paid on his behalf,"" Cohen continues. ""This $35,000 check was one of 11 check installments that was paid throughout the year – while he was President.""

In addition to lying to Congress, Cohen pleaded guilty last year to campaign finance violations for his involvement in the hush money payments. Federal prosecutors in New York have said Trump directed Cohen to arrange the payments to buy the silence of adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in the run-up to the 2016 campaign. Cohen told a judge that he agreed to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty.""

Cohen is set to begin a three-year prison sentence in May. Trump denies the allegations and says Cohen lied to get a lighter sentence.

The president and some commentators have also characterized Cohen as a ""rat"" -- an insult that Cohen will seek to address.

""Over the past two years, I have been smeared as 'a rat' by the president of the United States,"" Cohen will say. ""The truth is much different""

Meanwhile, in a remarkable social media post on the eve of the hearing, a top Republican suggested that lurid details of Cohen's private life may take center stage.

The blockbuster public testimony threatened to overshadow Trump's summit in Vietnam with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, prompting some observers to say the timing was more than coincidental.

Tuesday was the first of three consecutive days of congressional appearances scheduled for Cohen. After the public hearing Wednesday, he will appear before the House intelligence panel Thursday, again speaking in private.

Republicans are expected to aggressively attempt to discredit Cohen, given that he has acknowledged lying previously. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement Tuesday it was ""laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies.""

Cohen will also suggest that Trump wanted him to lie to Congress about the aborted Trump Tower Moscow project -- a lie for which Cohen has pleaded guilty. But Cohen will stop short of saying Trump directly told him to lie, according to the transcript.

""To be clear: Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election,"" Cohen will say. ""He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project. And so I lied about it, too – because Mr. Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie. And he made it clear to me because his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before I gave it to Congress.""

""We're witness testing, not witness tampering."" — Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz

Buzzfeed News last month published a bombshell, discredited report, citing two law enforcement officials who said Cohen acknowledged to Mueller’s office that Trump told him to lie to Congress about a potential real estate deal in Moscow, and claim that the negotiations ended months before they did so as to conceal Trump’s involvement.

But Mueller issued his first public statement in more than a year to repudiate the BuzzFeed report just 24 hours after its publication, flatly asserting that the story was ""not accurate."" The Washington Post has since reported that Mueller intended his rare denial to mean that the story was ""almost entirely incorrect,"" and that the Special Counsel's Office immediately ""reviewed evidence to determine if there were any documents or witness interviews like those described, reaching out to those they thought might have a stake in the case. They found none.""

One Republican House member, meanwhile, did more than just question Cohen's credibility in the run-up to the hearing on Wednesday. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz tweeted Tuesday that the world is ""about to learn a lot"" about Cohen and suggested he knew of disparaging information that could come out during his testimony.

Gaetz, a Trump ally who talks to the president frequently, is not a member of the committee that will question Cohen. He did not offer any evidence. Still, the tweet was extraordinary because his remarks appeared to some Democrats to constitute threatening or intimidating a witness.

In a tweet, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote, ""I encourage all Members to be mindful that comments made on social media or in the press can adversely affect the ability of House Committees to obtain the truthful and complete information necessary to fulfill their duties.""

Pelosi went on to suggest that Gaetz may have even opened himself to legal liability, warning that the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause -- which provides virtually absolute legal immunity to statements made by senators and representatives during congressional debates -- might not protect Gaetz, who made his comments away from the House floor.

""We're witness testing, not witness tampering,"" Gaetz countered in an interview with reporters. ""When witnesses come before Congress, their truthfulness and veracity are in question and we have the opportunity to test them.""

Lanny Davis, one of Cohen's lawyers, said in a statement that he wouldn't respond to Gaetz's ""despicable lies and personal smears, except to say we trust that his colleagues in the House, both Republicans and Democrats, will repudiate his words and his conduct.""

Democrats have been alternately suspicious of Cohen and eager to hear what he has to say. Sen. Mark Warner, the intelligence panel's top Democrat, suggested in a brief statement to reporters outside Tuesday's interview that Cohen had provided important information.

JUDGE NAP: COHEN TESTIMONY IS DESIGNED TO DISTRACT FROM SECOND TRUMP-KIM SUMMIT

""Two years ago, when this investigation started, I said it may be the most important thing I am involved in in my public life in the Senate, and nothing I've heard today dissuades me from that view,"" Warner said.

Senators on the intelligence panel attended Tuesday's private meeting, a departure from the committee's usual practice, where witness interviews are conducted by staff only. The Senate intel panel's chairman, Richard Burr, suggested to The Associated Press before the meeting that his committee would take steps to ensure that Cohen was telling the truth.

""I'm sure there will be some questions we know the answers to, so we'll test him to see whether in fact he'll be truthful this time,"" Burr said.

At least one Republican member of the intelligence panel refused to go to the meeting. ""I don't have any desire to go listen to a lying lawyer,"" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn.

Porter was the third former Trump adviser to draw a House Judiciary subpoena within the past two weeks . Porter and the other two advisers - Trump ’ s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn - are due to appear before the committee at 10 a.m. EDT on Sept. 17 .
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said the proceedings would help the Democratic-led panel determine whether to recommend Trump ’ s impeachment to the full House of Representatives .
Porter is a former White House staff secretary who witnessed a number of episodes laid out in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s Russia investigation report , including one involving then-White House Counsel Don McGahn that Democrats view as key to their investigation of the Trump presidency .
“ Rob Porter was prominently featured in the special counsel ’ s description of President Trump ’ s efforts to obstruct justice by directing ... McGahn to fire the special counsel , and then ordering him to lie about it , ” Nadler said in a statement .
Democrats want Lewandowski and Dearborn to testify about another damaging episode that involves the president ’ s alleged efforts to pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to direct Mueller ’ s Russia investigation away from the 2016 Trump campaign .
“ No one is above the law , ” Nadler said , adding “ any other American would have been prosecuted based on the evidence Special Counsel Mueller uncovered in his report . ”
It is not clear whether the White House will seek to block the testimony of Porter and Dearborn , as it has that of McGahn and other onetime Trump White House aides . Lewandowski , a Trump confidant who has never served on the White House staff , has said he will testify .
McGahn told Mueller that Trump repeatedly instructed him to have the special counsel removed and then asked him to deny having been so instructed when news of the action emerged in news reports . McGahn did not carry out either instruction .
According to the Mueller report , Trump turned to Porter to pressure McGahn into writing a letter of denial .
“ If he doesn ’ t write a letter , then maybe I ’ ll have to get rid of him , ” the Mueller report quotes Trump as telling Porter . The report said Porter recalled that the president referred to McGahn as a “ lying bastard . ”
Trump also asked Porter to stay in touch with former Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand , whom Porter knew , as a possible replacement for Sessions after the attorney general recused himself from the Russia probe and refused Trump ’ s demands that he reverse his decision .
“ In asking him to reach out to Brand , Porter understood the president to want to find someone to end the Russia investigation or fire the special counsel , although the president never said so explicitly , ” the Mueller report said .

Porter was the third former Trump adviser to draw a House Judiciary subpoena within the past two weeks. Porter and the other two advisers - Trump’s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn - are due to appear before the committee at 10 a.m. EDT on Sept. 17.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said the proceedings would help the Democratic-led panel determine whether to recommend Trump’s impeachment to the full House of Representatives.

Porter is a former White House staff secretary who witnessed a number of episodes laid out in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation report, including one involving then-White House Counsel Don McGahn that Democrats view as key to their investigation of the Trump presidency.

“Rob Porter was prominently featured in the special counsel’s description of President Trump’s efforts to obstruct justice by directing ... McGahn to fire the special counsel, and then ordering him to lie about it,” Nadler said in a statement.

Democrats want Lewandowski and Dearborn to testify about another damaging episode that involves the president’s alleged efforts to pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to direct Mueller’s Russia investigation away from the 2016 Trump campaign.

“No one is above the law,” Nadler said, adding “any other American would have been prosecuted based on the evidence Special Counsel Mueller uncovered in his report.”

Porter could not be immediately reached for comment.

It is not clear whether the White House will seek to block the testimony of Porter and Dearborn, as it has that of McGahn and other onetime Trump White House aides. Lewandowski, a Trump confidant who has never served on the White House staff, has said he will testify.

McGahn told Mueller that Trump repeatedly instructed him to have the special counsel removed and then asked him to deny having been so instructed when news of the action emerged in news reports. McGahn did not carry out either instruction.

According to the Mueller report, Trump turned to Porter to pressure McGahn into writing a letter of denial.

“If he doesn’t write a letter, then maybe I’ll have to get rid of him,” the Mueller report quotes Trump as telling Porter. The report said Porter recalled that the president referred to McGahn as a “lying bastard.”

Trump also asked Porter to stay in touch with former Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand, whom Porter knew, as a possible replacement for Sessions after the attorney general recused himself from the Russia probe and refused Trump’s demands that he reverse his decision.

“In asking him to reach out to Brand, Porter understood the president to want to find someone to end the Russia investigation or fire the special counsel, although the president never said so explicitly,” the Mueller report said.

Porter was interviewed twice by the special counsel team, and, according to the Mueller report, took contemporaneous notes during a number of other incidents that now interest Democrats.

WASHINGTON – The newly minted House Democratic majority pushed through a series of spending bills on Thursday to reopen the federal government, but congressional Republicans dismissed the effort as pointless political theater and the White House threatened a presidential veto as a partial government shutdown neared its third week.

Just hours after Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi reclaimed the speaker’s gavel and Democrats returned to the power for the first time in eight years, the House sought to end the 13-day shutdown by voting 241-190 to fund eight of the nine shuttered departments.

The legislation would fund all eight departments for the remainder of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. It passed largely along party lines, with seven Republicans joining Democrats in supporting the bill.

The House alsovoted 239-192, again mostly along party lines, to fund the Department of Homeland Security at current spending levels through Feb. 8. Five Republicans backed the legislation.

The legislation includes $1.3 billion for border security but none of the funding that President Donald Trump is demanding to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The temporary funding would enable the department to reopen and buy more time for Congress and the White House to resolve their standoff over border wall funding.

The spending package is part of a strategy by Democrats to put pressure on Trump and congressional Republicans as the impact of the shutdown becomes more pronounced across much of the country.

“Let’s open the government, and let’s get to work,” said Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., and chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee.

But Trump and GOP lawmakers showed no signs of retreating.

The White House Office of Management and Budget issued a statement suggesting Trump would veto the bill if it lands on his desk.

“The administration is committed to working with the Congress to reopen lapsed agencies but cannot accept legislation that provides unnecessary funding for wasteful programs while ignoring the nation’s urgent border security needs,” the statement said.

At the White House, Trump made a surprise appearance in the press briefing room a few hours before the vote to make his case for additional border security funding.

Steve King ( R-IA ) was unceremoniously booted from his House committee assignments by members of the Republican Steering Committee , four days after racist comments King made to the New York Times — “ White nationalist , white supremacist , Western civilization — how did that language become offensive ? ” — became publicly known .
King ’ s comments proved too much for his Republican colleagues . “ If he doesn ’ t understand why ‘ white supremacy ’ is offensive , he should find another line of work , ” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell . His sentiments were shared by conservatives more broadly .
But King ’ s comments to the New York Times were new only in that he specifically defended the words “ white nationalist ” and “ white supremacist. ” For more than two decades in public office , both in Iowa and in the US House , King ’ s racism has been his most readily identifiable characteristic .
Join the ███ Video Lab Go behind the scenes . Chat with creators . Support ███ video . Become a member of the ███ Video Lab on YouTube today . ( Heads up : You might be asked to sign in to Google first . )
Like when he directly compared the existence of the Congressional Black Caucus to having an abortion . Or when he endorsed a white nationalist in Toronto ’ s mayoral election . Or when he ’ s taken foreign trips to meet with far-right groups founded by Nazis . Or when he ’ s espoused his belief that “ white nationalist ” wasn ’ t a “ derogatory term ” until just a few years ago . Or any of myriad examples that are so prevalent and widely known that even the conservative outlets that condemned King for his remarks to the New York Times listed those examples , too .
And yet in 2015 , even after King ’ s comments about DREAMer immigrant kids having “ calves the size of cantaloupes ” and his decision to bring a far-right Dutch politician who believes that the Quran is “ worse than Mein Kampf ” to the Capitol , conservatives didn ’ t feel the need to distance themselves . The Federalist lauded his birthright citizenship proposal ; National Review was still describing him as a “ conservative firebrand ” and “ outspoken , ” words one might use to describe , say , Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) , not someone who routinely voices praise for bafflingly racist novels .
There ’ s a larger problem , one far bigger than King , or conservatism . The way we talk about race and racism in the United States is wrong . In short , we think of “ racist ” as an insult rather than as an adjective . And we have narrowed down the concept of racism to an almost ludicrous extent , in effect often excusing real racism — such as that espoused by people like King — and its impact on nonwhite Americans because it is not literally wearing a hood or setting a cross alight on a lawn .
First and foremost , it ’ s important to note that in brass-tacks political terms , King ’ s pre-2019 political fortunes rested on his perceived position as a potential political kingmaker for up-and-coming conservatives — including presidential candidates — and as a reliable GOP vote in Congress representing a heavily conservative district in a very important state .
Thus , Republicans largely treated his many , many , many racist statements as “ white noise , ” while privately believing , as several conservative pundits told me last year , that he ’ s a “ joke ” and “ a stupid asshole . ”
But then came the 2018 midterm elections , and while King beat his Democratic opponent , J.D . Scholten , he won by just 3 percentage points in a district that was widely viewed as a safe Republican seat ( and that King had won by more than 22 points every time he ran except for in 2012 ) . The election was so close in part because of his rhetoric . King also lost major financial backers just a week before Election Day , when news broke that he had met with a far-right Austrian political group in Europe .
The race changed perceptions of King — now less a political kingmaker , more a political liability who has never introduced a bill that became a law and had trouble hanging on to a safe Trump seat . And with a Republican primary challenger with experience and none of King ’ s racial baggage waiting in the wings for 2020 , the decision to cut ties with King has been made far easier .
Consider that last year , I asked then-House Speaker Paul Ryan ’ s office if he had any comment on King ’ s endorsement of white nationalist Faith Goldy for mayor of Toronto . His spokesperson responded , “ That ’ s a political question for our political team. ” Not anymore , apparently .
Then there ’ s the matter of King ’ s biggest political focus : immigration restrictionism . Keeping immigration hawks on board with the GOP once meant catering to him . But with Donald Trump in the White House — a president who has made immigration his centerpiece issue as well — King ’ s immigration stance is less distinct . ( During a White House visit in early 2017 , King even told Trump that he had “ market-tested ” his immigration policy . ) A Republican looking to bolster their immigration-hawk bona fides can skip King and just voice support for Trump .
It ’ s also worth noting that for many conservatives , the issue of race and racism is a particularly sensitive one for fairly obvious reasons : namely , the lengthy history of racism in the conservative movement . Many on the right have long been hypersensitive to accusations of racism , often reacting by circling the wagons around those within their camp who they believe have been unfairly accused of a potentially fatal allegation .
In 2017 , Peter Beinart wrote on these fears in the Atlantic :
Conservatives feel their cultural vulnerability acutely . In 2011 , researchers at Tufts University observed that conservatives consume more “ outrage-based ” political radio and television than liberals do . One reason , they suggested in a follow-up paper , is that conservatives are more fearful than liberals of discussing politics with people with whom they disagree , because they dread being called a bigot . “ When asked how they feel about talking politics , ” the researchers noted , “ every single conservative respondent raised the issue of being called racist. ” Liberals expressed no comparable fear . As a result , they felt less need to take refuge in the “ safe political environs provided by outrage-based programs . ”
So when King tweeted in March 2017 , “ We can ’ t restore our civilization with somebody else ’ s babies ” — a comment that came under fire from critics — conservative pundit Ben Shapiro argued that criticism of that racist comment showed the media ’ s “ deep desire to paint Republicans as racists rather than defenders of Western cultural superiority. ” He said that there were two ways of interpreting the statement — one as racist , the other as “ badly phrased but not racist ” — and that King ’ s other comments regarding the tweet showed that the latter was true .
That article now includes an update added last week , with Shapiro writing that “ this article gave far too generous an interpretation of King ’ s words ” and that the “ first interpretation ” — King being a racist — “ was not as implausible as it seemed at the time . ”
It shouldn ’ t have been . King ’ s racism — his blatant bias against and contempt for nonwhite people — was obvious from the very beginnings of his political career , even back in 1996 when he ran for Iowa state Senate . He is a Congress member and a racist , a political operator within the conservative wing of the GOP and a racist , and he even served as co-chair of a GOP presidential campaign while being a racist , because it is entirely possible to be all of the above , all at the same time .
And King got away with it for more than 15 years in Congress because many conservatives — and many Americans — are operating under a definition of racism that defines egregious examples of racism out of existence . This is a country that is , in Jamelle Bouie ’ s words at Slate , “ largely indifferent to racial inequality but is highly sensitive to accusations of racism. ” We talk about racism , and racists , in a way that turns an egregious evil into a mere show of poor form , and we have turned calling someone a racist into the real sin .
We talk about racism in very specific — and bad — ways
“ I think that the way a better part of America defines what a racist is someone who self identifies as a white nationalist or a white supremacist , ” said Ibram X. Kendi , a historian at American University and author of Stamped From the Beginning : The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America . “ Someone who is in the Ku Klux Klan , someone who says the n-word , someone who engages in racial violence . Anything else , according to them , is not racist . ”
We tend to define racism in a way that will not implicate our own views or ideas . “ I think people define racism in a way that exonerates them . If they can narrow [ the definition of racism ] as much as possible to things they are not saying or doing or are about , that leaves them off the hook , ” Kendi continued .
In his view , rather than “ racist ” being “ a descriptive term with a clear-cut definition , ” we have turned it into a “ fixed derogatory putdown , ” an insult . He told me that “ by conceiving it in this way , we create a culture of denial in which everyone denies being racist but very few people know what a racist is . ”
In effect , the term “ racist , ” which has an actual meaning , has now been turned into a schoolyard insult . Recall the study Beinart referenced in the Atlantic that found conservative respondents were very concerned about being called a racist . Or the West Virginia woman who described former first lady Michelle Obama as an “ ape in heels ” in a social media post in 2016 , and who said in an apology she sent to news outlets , “ Those who know me know that I ’ m not in any way racist ! ”
Even William H. Regnery , who founded the white supremacist think tank National Policy Institute , currently run by white supremacist Richard Spencer , told the Atlantic , “ I ’ m a tribalist . I ’ m not a racist or white supremacist. ” ( The original mission statement of the National Policy Institute reads in part , “ NPI seeks to elevate the consciousness of whites , ensure our biological and cultural continuity , and protect our civil rights . ” )
But this phenomenon of steering clear of the word “ racist , ” or dumbing down the concept of racism , isn ’ t exclusive to white supremacists . News outlets like NBC News are loath even to refer to King ’ s egregious ( and racist ) comments as racist . NBC ’ s standards department told reporters in an email to avoid directly doing so , saying “ it is ok to attribute to others as in ‘ what many are calling racist ’ or something like that. ” ( This has reportedly been revised , but apparently , reporters should avoid referring to King himself as “ racist . ” )
Folks at the network dissented from the idea that they could n't call King 's comments `` racist , '' and the clarified guidance agrees on this point : OK to call comments racist . But the guidance also says to apply extreme care in calling King himself `` racist . '' — ErikWemple ( @ ErikWemple ) January 15 , 2019
Our inability to talk about racism , or racists , is even more apparent when we ’ re discussing Americans as a group . Here ’ s an example . On Tuesday ’ s episode of the daytime talk show The View , during a discussion of King and funding for a border wall , one panelist described the wall as “ sort of this dog whistle for racism. ” That comment eventually led co-host Meghan McCain to exclaim , referencing the number of Americans who support a border wall with Mexico , “ Do you think 42 percent of Americans are racist ? ! ”
Jenée Desmond-Harris has called this phenomenon — of arguing that large groups of Americans simply can ’ t be racist because reasons — “ vanity sizing for racism. ” She wrote for ███ in early 2017 : “ The argument that a large number of Americans can ’ t be racist should be based on evidence that they don ’ t fit a particular definition , not on simple squeamishness about the broad application of the word , ” adding “ insistence on being precious about who ’ s labeled racist does nothing to change the impact of racism — however you define it — on the ground . ”
That brings us back to King , whose lengthy history of saying racist things while being very bad at his job never seriously threatened his role in that job until two other things happened : He said those racist things in a very obvious way to the New York Times , and he finally became seen as politically expendable by his fellow Republicans .
His racism , once “ white noise , ” could then become disqualifying to even the most “ squeamish ” of conservatives . And what was blatantly obvious to millions of Americans who had watched King speak or tweet or meet with far-right groups in foreign countries could finally become obvious — even to the Republican Party .","On Monday, Rep. Steve King (R-IA) was unceremoniously booted from his House committee assignments by members of the Republican Steering Committee, four days after racist comments King made to the New York Times — “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” — became publicly known.

King’s comments proved too much for his Republican colleagues. “If he doesn’t understand why ‘white supremacy’ is offensive, he should find another line of work,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. His sentiments were shared by conservatives more broadly.

But King’s comments to the New York Times were new only in that he specifically defended the words “white nationalist” and “white supremacist.” For more than two decades in public office, both in Iowa and in the US House, King’s racism has been his most readily identifiable characteristic.

Like when he directly compared the existence of the Congressional Black Caucus to having an abortion. Or when he endorsed a white nationalist in Toronto’s mayoral election. Or when he’s taken foreign trips to meet with far-right groups founded by Nazis. Or when he’s espoused his belief that “white nationalist” wasn’t a “derogatory term” until just a few years ago. Or any of myriad examples that are so prevalent and widely known that even the conservative outlets that condemned King for his remarks to the New York Times listed those examples, too.

And yet in 2015, even after King’s comments about DREAMer immigrant kids having “calves the size of cantaloupes” and his decision to bring a far-right Dutch politician who believes that the Quran is “worse than Mein Kampf” to the Capitol, conservatives didn’t feel the need to distance themselves. The Federalist lauded his birthright citizenship proposal; National Review was still describing him as a “conservative firebrand” and “outspoken,” words one might use to describe, say, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), not someone who routinely voices praise for bafflingly racist novels.

There’s a larger problem, one far bigger than King, or conservatism. The way we talk about race and racism in the United States is wrong. In short, we think of “racist” as an insult rather than as an adjective. And we have narrowed down the concept of racism to an almost ludicrous extent, in effect often excusing real racism — such as that espoused by people like King — and its impact on nonwhite Americans because it is not literally wearing a hood or setting a cross alight on a lawn.

Steve King lost votes — and political power

First and foremost, it’s important to note that in brass-tacks political terms, King’s pre-2019 political fortunes rested on his perceived position as a potential political kingmaker for up-and-coming conservatives — including presidential candidates — and as a reliable GOP vote in Congress representing a heavily conservative district in a very important state.

Thus, Republicans largely treated his many, many, many racist statements as “white noise,” while privately believing, as several conservative pundits told me last year, that he’s a “joke” and “a stupid asshole.”

But then came the 2018 midterm elections, and while King beat his Democratic opponent, J.D. Scholten, he won by just 3 percentage points in a district that was widely viewed as a safe Republican seat (and that King had won by more than 22 points every time he ran except for in 2012). The election was so close in part because of his rhetoric. King also lost major financial backers just a week before Election Day, when news broke that he had met with a far-right Austrian political group in Europe.

The race changed perceptions of King — now less a political kingmaker, more a political liability who has never introduced a bill that became a law and had trouble hanging on to a safe Trump seat. And with a Republican primary challenger with experience and none of King’s racial baggage waiting in the wings for 2020, the decision to cut ties with King has been made far easier.

Consider that last year, I asked then-House Speaker Paul Ryan’s office if he had any comment on King’s endorsement of white nationalist Faith Goldy for mayor of Toronto. His spokesperson responded, “That’s a political question for our political team.” Not anymore, apparently.

Then there’s the matter of King’s biggest political focus: immigration restrictionism. Keeping immigration hawks on board with the GOP once meant catering to him. But with Donald Trump in the White House — a president who has made immigration his centerpiece issue as well — King’s immigration stance is less distinct. (During a White House visit in early 2017, King even told Trump that he had “market-tested” his immigration policy.) A Republican looking to bolster their immigration-hawk bona fides can skip King and just voice support for Trump.

It’s also worth noting that for many conservatives, the issue of race and racism is a particularly sensitive one for fairly obvious reasons: namely, the lengthy history of racism in the conservative movement. Many on the right have long been hypersensitive to accusations of racism, often reacting by circling the wagons around those within their camp who they believe have been unfairly accused of a potentially fatal allegation.

In 2017, Peter Beinart wrote on these fears in the Atlantic:

Conservatives feel their cultural vulnerability acutely. In 2011, researchers at Tufts University observed that conservatives consume more “outrage-based” political radio and television than liberals do. One reason, they suggested in a follow-up paper, is that conservatives are more fearful than liberals of discussing politics with people with whom they disagree, because they dread being called a bigot. “When asked how they feel about talking politics,” the researchers noted, “every single conservative respondent raised the issue of being called racist.” Liberals expressed no comparable fear. As a result, they felt less need to take refuge in the “safe political environs provided by outrage-based programs.”

So when King tweeted in March 2017, “We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies” — a comment that came under fire from critics — conservative pundit Ben Shapiro argued that criticism of that racist comment showed the media’s “deep desire to paint Republicans as racists rather than defenders of Western cultural superiority.” He said that there were two ways of interpreting the statement — one as racist, the other as “badly phrased but not racist” — and that King’s other comments regarding the tweet showed that the latter was true.

That article now includes an update added last week, with Shapiro writing that “this article gave far too generous an interpretation of King’s words” and that the “first interpretation” — King being a racist — “was not as implausible as it seemed at the time.”

It shouldn’t have been. King’s racism — his blatant bias against and contempt for nonwhite people — was obvious from the very beginnings of his political career, even back in 1996 when he ran for Iowa state Senate. He is a Congress member and a racist, a political operator within the conservative wing of the GOP and a racist, and he even served as co-chair of a GOP presidential campaign while being a racist, because it is entirely possible to be all of the above, all at the same time.

And King got away with it for more than 15 years in Congress because many conservatives — and many Americans — are operating under a definition of racism that defines egregious examples of racism out of existence. This is a country that is, in Jamelle Bouie’s words at Slate, “largely indifferent to racial inequality but is highly sensitive to accusations of racism.” We talk about racism, and racists, in a way that turns an egregious evil into a mere show of poor form, and we have turned calling someone a racist into the real sin.

The parts of Pelosi’s plan outlined so far have drawn concerns from progressives.

Pocan called it “horrendous” that her proposal would not require Medicare to negotiate prices for all drugs, but instead set a minimum of 25 drugs per year where prices had to be negotiated. He added that there are some good parts to the plan, namely that the mandated lower prices would apply to people with private insurance plans, not just Medicare.

In more than four hours of questioning , House Republicans painted a picture of Richards and other Planned Parenthood leaders hosting pricey parties , flying first class and spending more time fundraising than focusing on women 's health care .
`` The question before us is : Does this organization -- does Planned Parenthood really need a federal subsidy ? '' said House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz , R-Utah . `` Does it need federal dollars ? Every time we spend a federal dollar , what we 're doing is pulling money out of somebody 's pocket and we 're giving it to somebody else . What I do n't like , what I do n't want to tolerate , what I do n't want to become numb to is wasting those taxpayer dollars . ''
The hearing offered a chance for both parties to trade shots on Planned Parenthood , which is under fire after a series of edited videos surfaced this summer which purportedly show organization officials discussing the sale of fetal tissue . Some conservative Republicans are seizing on the issue to press Congress to defund Planned Parenthood as part of a broader spending package .
Planned Parenthood gets roughly $ 450 million a year in federal funding , of which almost $ 400 million is reimbursement for services covered by Medicaid . Federal funds are prohibited by law from being used for abortion , and Planned Parenthood 's federal funding covers services such as cancer screenings and birth control .
At the hearing , Democratic supporters of Planned Parenthood accused their Republican colleagues of being misogynistic and more interested in political hits than an actual investigation . Richards argued the videos -- produced by conservative activists at the Center for Medical Progress -- are misleading .
`` The outrageous accusations leveled against Planned Parenthood based on heavily doctored videos are offensive and categorically untrue . I realize , though , that the facts have never gotten in the way of these campaigns to block women from health care they need and deserve , '' Richards told the committee .
But the videos have become potent tools for conservatives looking to end federal support for the group .
Chaffetz opened the hearing with an emotional story of his mother and father dying from cancer . He choked up at times as he talked about losing them . He talked about his wife 's work with a plastic surgeon who does reconstructive surgery for women with breast cancer . He then pivoted to his argument that the government should spend more on cancer screening and research while ending funding for Planned Parenthood .
`` This has absolutely nothing to do with providing health care to young women who need a breast exam , '' Chaffetz said .
Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings , the panel 's top Democrat , fired back , saying that most of the federal funding goes to services for poor women . He then countered with his own personal story , noting that his mother-in-law died from cancer last week .
`` I understand what you 're talking about . I get it , '' Cummings said .
Richards , in written testimony , called the videos `` a deliberate and systematic effort by ( CMP Director ) David Daleiden and other opponents of safe and legal abortion to infiltrate our health centers , try to entrap our staff into potentially illegal conduct , and create discredited , doctored videos designed to smear Planned Parenthood . ''
Following Richards ' opening comments , Chaffetz opened a rapid-fire line of questioning , verbally running over Richards repeatedly as he painted a picture of one Planned Parenthood organization dedicated to political work and abortions , not health care .
`` My guess is you run the mothership here . When you show up and want to have something done , it 's probably done , '' he said .
At one point , Chaffetz denied a member 's request that he yield .
Richards struggled to answer as Chaffetz repeatedly said he had limited time and many questions . But when she did , she said their political work and health care operations were clearly -- and legally -- separated .
As Chaffetz presented a slide that showed an increase in abortions , Richards said she was blindsided and had not seen the slide before . `` It does n't feel like we 're trying to get to the truth here , '' she said .
Chaffetz pressed Richards about her six-figure salary , asking why she should be earning close to $ 600,000 . It was part of a larger argument he made that Planned Parenthood did not need federal dollars .
House Oversight Republicans released a report Tuesday that detailed spending on parties , including $ 35 million for an office near Madison Square Garden in New York City .
`` Affiliates routinely host lavish parties . The funding used for one affiliate 's 'Gathering of Goddesses and Gods ' event or another 's 'Chocolate Champagne ' and 'Murder Mystery ' fundraisers could have been used on health services , '' the report said .
But Democrats rushed to Richards ' defense , with some accusing Republicans of being anti-women .
`` My colleagues like to say this is n't a war on women . Look at how you 've been treated as a witness , '' said Rep. Gerry Connolly , a Virginia Democrat . `` The disrespect , the misogyny rampant here today , tells us what is really going on . ''
The undercover videos have been at the center of the effort by conservative Republicans to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood , with some threatening to shut down the federal government if federal funding for the group is n't ceased . That effort failed in the Senate , but House lawmakers will decide Wednesday on whether to shut down the government as part of the vote on another continuing resolution .
House Speaker John Boehner , who has denounced conservative hardliners since he announced his plan to resign last week , promised Sunday he would work with Democrats to keep the government open .
Outside Washington , the debate over Planned Parenthood and its abortion services has been one of the dominant issues from the campaign trail to state capitols .
Utah Republican Gov . Gary Herbert announced that he would no longer allow federal dollars to pass through the state to the group , spurring the Planned Parenthood Association of Utah to announce Monday that it was suing the state .
Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster launched an investigation of Planned Parenthood in July , shortly after the first CMP video was released . But he said Monday that the probe `` discovered no evidence whatsoever to suggest that Planned Parenthood 's St. Louis facility is selling fetal tissue , '' according to Koster , a Democrat .
The videos were repeatedly referenced during both Republican presidential debates in recent weeks , as several 2016 hopefuls have urged Congress to defund the organization .
Democratic White House hopefuls took to Twitter to show their support for Planned Parenthood as part of a `` pink out '' campaign .

(CNN) – A bill that provides back pay for furloughed Federal workers during the government shutdown unanimously passed the House during a rare Saturday session on Capitol Hill.

Some 800,000 federal workers have been stuck at home without pay since October 1 when Congress failed to pass a budget for the new fiscal year.

On Friday, the White House said the president would sign the measure.

House Speaker John Boehner and GOP House leadership held the vote as part of a strategy to pass piecemeal spending legislation that addressed the issues brought up by the government shutdown.

Although Democrats oppose the incremental approach, saying it amounts to conservatives choosing to fund programs and services they like, the bill passed with strong bipartisan support.

Retroactive pay is guaranteed under the bill, but federal workers can't expect their paychecks until after the government shutdown ends and Congress reaches a resolution on the budget.

It’s unclear when the Senate might vote on the bill.

Shortly after the vote both parties in the House held press conferences, giving their separate takes on its significance.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor used the vote to highlight the fact that the government shutdown has left many American citizens in the lurch even if back pay for furloughed workers is secured.

“What about the vets? Do the Democrats not feel it's important to make sure the pain is eased on them? What about the sick children that need access to clinical trials? Is it not as important to ease the pain of the shutdown for them? Or is it just the federal employees that the Democratic minority thinks is important?” Cantor asked.

However, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi shifted the conversation away from the piecemeal funding to the broader issue of how to end the shutdown. Pelosi announced that 195 voting House Democrats have signed their names to a letter saying they will support a resolution in line with the $988 billion budget that has received support from some House Republicans.

The letter to Speaker Boehner demands “a vote on a clean continuing resolution immediately so that government functioning can resume and Americans can move on with their lives.”

The letter is consistent with the Democrats long-standing call for a ""clean"" spending resolution without any Obamacare provisions.

However, Pelosi called the Democrats latest maneuver an “unprecedented offer” because she promises that Democrats will not try to force any new conditions on House negotiations with the Senate.

If Boehner put the resolution to a vote, Democrats would need about two dozen more votes from Republicans in order to reach the two-thirds majority.

However, up until now, Boehner has been unwilling to bring the resolution to a vote, and its unlikely House Republicans would defy GOP leadership and side with the Democrats.

Shortly after the bill passed the House on Saturday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced that most Defense Department civilian workers who were furloughed would be asked to return to work beginning next week.

Hagel said Pentagon and Justice Department attorneys have found that the law allows the Department of Defense to bring back employees whose responsibilities contribute to the morale, well-being, capabilities and readiness of service members.

The answer , to be decided by the House Judiciary Committee , seems increasingly likely to result in a House vote later this month to make Trump just the third president in U.S. history to be impeached .
And it carries far-reaching consequences for a restless nation fiercely divided over Trump 's fitness for office — ramifications that will long echo through the halls of a partisan Congress and extend far into the 2020 election cycle , when voters will be asked to deliver their own verdict on the impulsive figure in the Oval Office .
Up until now , the impeachment inquiry has been piloted by the House Intelligence Committee , which staged a long series of closed-door depositions and public hearings with senior diplomats and national security officials with knowledge of Trump 's handling of foreign policy in Kyiv .
Those opening rounds featured a dry , just-the-facts approach designed to glean the details surrounding any efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure foreign leaders to find dirt on the president 's domestic political opponents .
Committee Democrats worked through the Thanksgiving recess drafting a report on their findings , which will become available to members of the Intelligence Committee Monday evening . The panel will then vote Tuesday evening to adopt the report , along with any minority views , and send it on to the Judiciary Committee .
The Judiciary panel has a different assignment , charged with crunching the accumulated evidence and determining if it merits the drafting of impeachment articles to be brought to the House floor for votes . Democrats maintain — at least publicly — that the decision remains unresolved . Yet they 're sending early signals that a vote on articles is all but inevitable .
“ If you take a look at what the Founding Fathers were concerned about , it was the interference by foreign governments in our political system that was one of their gravest concerns , '' Rep. Zoe Lofgren Zoe Ellen LofgrenDemocrats express confidence in case as impeachment speeds forward Sunday shows — Nadler : A jury would convict Trump in 'three minutes flat ' Judiciary Democrat says House should focus on Ukraine , avoid Mueller report in articles of impeachment MORE ( D-Calif. ) , a senior Judiciary member , said on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' program Sunday . `` Nixon 's behavior did n't fall into that range . So , in that way , this conduct is more serious . ”
The Judiciary panel 's first hearing on the matter , scheduled for Wednesday morning , will feature legal experts providing their own assessments of Trump 's actions , as they relate to the constitutional grounds for impeaching a president .
The White House on Sunday informed the Judiciary Committee it will not participate in Wednesday 's hearing , but did not rule out taking part in future impeachment hearings .
The launch of the next phase is a clear indication that Democrats are charging ahead with the process even without hearing from prominent White House officials who have refused to cooperate while the courts decide the limits , if any , on claims of executive immunity .
“ They want ... to play a political game and tie the process up in the courts as long as they can and run the clock out , '' Rep. Val Demings Valdez ( Val ) Venita DemingsPelosi faces tough choices on impeachment managers Impeachment inquiry enters critical new phase Lawmakers turn attention to potential witnesses at Judiciary impeachment hearings MORE ( D-Fla. ) , a member of the Intelligence panel , told ABC 's `` This Week '' on Sunday . “ We ’ re not willing to play that game . ”
With the changing venue comes a new cast of characters set to assume a starring role . For more than two months , the public face of impeachment has been Rep. Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffLawmakers prep ahead of impeachment hearing Top Republican : Democrats ' weekend document dump shows impeachment inquiry is a 'farce ' Nunes : 'Sickening ' that Schiff obtained his phone records MORE ( D-Calif. ) , the cautious and taciturn chairman of the Intelligence Committee who conducted the process with an iron fist over the howls of Republicans claiming the president has been subjected to a partisan witch hunt .
That changes on Wednesday , when Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler Jerrold ( Jerry ) Lewis NadlerLawmakers prep ahead of impeachment hearing Trump : Fox News 'panders ' to Democrats by having on liberal guests Democrats express confidence in case as impeachment speeds forward MORE ( D-N.Y. ) resumes the helm after months leading the earlier examination of former special counsel Robert Mueller Robert ( Bob ) Swan MuellerTrump says he 'll release financial records before election , knocks Dems ' efforts House impeachment hearings : The witch hunt continues Speier says impeachment inquiry shows 'very strong case of bribery ' by Trump MORE 's extensive investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election .
Nadler took the Judiciary gavel this year after pressing the case that he was best suited to manage a “ constitutional crisis. ” With impeachment now in its later stages , part of his challenge will be to manage the more unwieldy Judiciary Committee — which has almost twice as many members as Intelligence , including some of Trump 's most outspoken allies — and prevent the process from devolving into a partisan spectacle while the TV cameras roll .
In a letter to Trump last week , Nadler prefaced Wednesday 's hearing as a scholarly examination of `` the constitutional framework through which the House may analyze the evidence gathered in the present inquiry . ''
`` The Committee intends this hearing to serve as an opportunity to discuss the historical and constitutional basis of impeachment , as well as the Framers ' intent and understanding of terms like 'high crimes and misdemeanors , ' `` Nadler wrote .
It 's a civics lesson with the highest stakes , as Democrats are scrambling to move public opinion in their favor — an essential factor if they 're to have any chance of winning support from Republicans in the Senate , where the process will shift if the House passes articles of impeachment .
Polls have consistently shown that roughly half the country supports Trump 's removal — a figure much higher than that surrounding former President Clinton 's impeachment in 1998 . But the numbers , which cut largely across partisan lines , have n't moved significantly in recent weeks , when Democrats were hoping the public hearings would erode Trump 's support . No Republican in either chamber has endorsed the impeachment process .
Democrats insist that 's no obstacle as they press ahead toward likely votes on impeachment articles .

The answer, to be decided by the House Judiciary Committee, seems increasingly likely to result in a House vote later this month to make Trump just the third president in U.S. history to be impeached.

And it carries far-reaching consequences for a restless nation fiercely divided over Trump's fitness for office — ramifications that will long echo through the halls of a partisan Congress and extend far into the 2020 election cycle, when voters will be asked to deliver their own verdict on the impulsive figure in the Oval Office.

The shift, in many ways, won't be subtle.

Up until now, the impeachment inquiry has been piloted by the House Intelligence Committee, which staged a long series of closed-door depositions and public hearings with senior diplomats and national security officials with knowledge of Trump's handling of foreign policy in Kyiv.

Those opening rounds featured a dry, just-the-facts approach designed to glean the details surrounding any efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure foreign leaders to find dirt on the president's domestic political opponents.

Committee Democrats worked through the Thanksgiving recess drafting a report on their findings, which will become available to members of the Intelligence Committee Monday evening. The panel will then vote Tuesday evening to adopt the report, along with any minority views, and send it on to the Judiciary Committee.

The Judiciary panel has a different assignment, charged with crunching the accumulated evidence and determining if it merits the drafting of impeachment articles to be brought to the House floor for votes. Democrats maintain — at least publicly — that the decision remains unresolved. Yet they're sending early signals that a vote on articles is all but inevitable.

""Nixon's behavior didn't fall into that range. So, in that way, this conduct is more serious.”

The Judiciary panel's first hearing on the matter, scheduled for Wednesday morning, will feature legal experts providing their own assessments of Trump's actions, as they relate to the constitutional grounds for impeaching a president.

The White House on Sunday informed the Judiciary Committee it will not participate in Wednesday's hearing, but did not rule out taking part in future impeachment hearings.

The launch of the next phase is a clear indication that Democrats are charging ahead with the process even without hearing from prominent White House officials who have refused to cooperate while the courts decide the limits, if any, on claims of executive immunity.

Val Demings Valdez (Val) Venita DemingsPelosi faces tough choices on impeachment managers Impeachment inquiry enters critical new phase Lawmakers turn attention to potential witnesses at Judiciary impeachment hearings MORE (D-Fla.), a member of the Intelligence panel, told ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday. “We’re not willing to play that game.”

With the changing venue comes a new cast of characters set to assume a starring role. For more than two months, the public face of impeachment has been Rep. Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffLawmakers prep ahead of impeachment hearing Top Republican: Democrats' weekend document dump shows impeachment inquiry is a 'farce' Nunes: 'Sickening' that Schiff obtained his phone records MORE (D-Calif.), the cautious and taciturn chairman of the Intelligence Committee who conducted the process with an iron fist over the howls of Republicans claiming the president has been subjected to a partisan witch hunt.

Nadler took the Judiciary gavel this year after pressing the case that he was best suited to manage a “constitutional crisis.” With impeachment now in its later stages, part of his challenge will be to manage the more unwieldy Judiciary Committee — which has almost twice as many members as Intelligence, including some of Trump's most outspoken allies — and prevent the process from devolving into a partisan spectacle while the TV cameras roll.

In a letter to Trump last week, Nadler prefaced Wednesday's hearing as a scholarly examination of ""the constitutional framework through which the House may analyze the evidence gathered in the present inquiry.""

""The Committee intends this hearing to serve as an opportunity to discuss the historical and constitutional basis of impeachment, as well as the Framers' intent and understanding of terms like 'high crimes and misdemeanors,' "" Nadler wrote.

It's a civics lesson with the highest stakes, as Democrats are scrambling to move public opinion in their favor — an essential factor if they're to have any chance of winning support from Republicans in the Senate, where the process will shift if the House passes articles of impeachment.

Polls have consistently shown that roughly half the country supports Trump's removal — a figure much higher than that surrounding former President Clinton's impeachment in 1998. But the numbers, which cut largely across partisan lines, haven't moved significantly in recent weeks, when Democrats were hoping the public hearings would erode Trump's support. No Republican in either chamber has endorsed the impeachment process.

Democrats insist that's no obstacle as they press ahead toward likely votes on impeachment articles.

In an interview with ███ published Tuesday , Chaffetz said the probe would n't focus on Clinton , but `` when she creates her own private email system , she 's ensnarled herself . ''
But on Wednesday evening , Speaker Paul Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy summoned Chaffetz ( R-Utah ) to the Capitol to let him know that he is not permitted to launch an investigation that involves Clinton in any way .
Ryan and McCarthy have been clear from the beginning : They believe the FBI and Justice Department should handle the investigation into Clinton ’ s use of personal email for government business , and that congressional involvement could disrupt the criminal probe and give the appearance of a GOP witch hunt .
Ryan , however , had given Chaffetz a green light to proceed — with caution — investigating systematic problems within his committee ’ s broad jurisdiction , while making clear his preference that Chaffetz steer clear of Clinton personally .
Now , following the ███ story , GOP leadership says he may not even investigate systematic issues if they involve Clinton .
Their directive puts Chaffetz in a position where he would have to investigate government officials ’ use of personal email and Freedom of Information Act requests without looking at the person who many say has violated transparency principles the most .
The back and forth comes just a day after the House Science Committee , which recently launched its own investigation into Clinton ’ s email server , told ███ it has changed direction and is now opting to delay its inquiry and defer to the FBI .
Chaffetz hadn ’ t scheduled a hearing yet , but the Utah Republican has obtained new information , according to sources close to the committee . Chaffetz said the probe will be larger than Clinton but that she ’ s right in the middle of it .
“ The Oversight Committee has jurisdiction on the Federal Records Act , and we intend to pursue that , ” Chaffetz said in an interview this week before the GOP talked to him Wednesday evening . “ We also have jurisdiction on FOIA [ the Freedom of Information Act ] , so if you ’ re not providing emails , it begs the question of your compliance under FOIA . So , I ’ m not specifically trying to target the secretary , but when she creates her own private email system , she ’ s ensnarled herself . ”
He added , “ I ’ m trying to be as cautious as I can . I don ’ t think we should be any harder on her , but I don ’ t think we should be any easier on her . It ’ s bigger and broader than just Hillary Clinton . ”
Within House Republican leadership , there is heightened sensitivity to congressional scrutiny of Clinton . Ryan prefers that federal authorities handle any potential criminal elements of Clinton ’ s email scandal , while Rep. Trey Gowdy ’ s House Select Committee on Benghazi handle anything related to Benghazi .
Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas , chairman of the House Science , Space and Technology Committee , decided to delay his look at Clinton ’ s private email server after House Republican leadership expressed unease . An aide on the panel said the “ committee temporarily will defer to the FBI ’ s expanding investigation , ” citing new information that 22 emails on Clinton ’ s server were top secret .
“ We expect the FBI to do its job and fully investigate cyber vulnerabilities that may have resulted from former Secretary Clinton ’ s decision to deviate from established cybersecurity standards and requirements , ” the aide said .
Chaffetz said he ’ s sensitive to the FBI investigation , but that won ’ t stop him .
“ The FBI should pursue any violations and criminal allegations , ” Chaffetz said . “ I would argue we also have jurisdictional prerogative on Federal Records Act and FOIA [ matters ] . We ’ re being very cautious . I don ’ t want to overstep , but we ’ re also trying to move forward . ”
Top Republicans seem divided over the wisdom of Chaffetz ’ s move . Some believe it ’ s a legitimate exercise of his oversight authority . But others think he ’ s on a partisan fishing expedition that will unavoidably target Clinton .
Far from looking to protect Clinton , Ryan and McCarthy simply believe they should leave criminal matters to the FBI . Congressional interference would look ham-handed , overly partisan and could disrupt the federal investigation , the GOP leaders believe , according to sources close to them .
Chaffetz says his investigation will deal with systematic issues across the government . He ’ s aiming to examine noncompliance with FOIA , as well as the use of personal email for government business and how it could affect record-keeping policies . He said the use of private emails to conduct government business is “ bigger and broader than just problems at the State Department . ”
“ They seem to be the worst offender , but you also have this problem at the Department of Defense , ” Chaffetz said . “ Anybody who would use a nongovernment server to interact on government business is in violation . That ’ s just been known for a long time , that is the law . [ Clinton ] is by no means the only violator . I ’ m still looking at it from 60,000 feet , and wondering who ’ s violating it , how are they doing it and how do we get them to be in compliance . The inspectors general keep issuing reports , and we ’ re not ignoring those . ”
Chaffetz , however , has long sought a role in investigating Clinton — as has his committee , which is filled with conservative lawmakers .

Story Continued Below

But on Wednesday evening, Speaker Paul Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy summoned Chaffetz (R-Utah) to the Capitol to let him know that he is not permitted to launch an investigation that involves Clinton in any way.



On Thursday, Chaffetz said he had no comment.

Ryan and McCarthy have been clear from the beginning: They believe the FBI and Justice Department should handle the investigation into Clinton’s use of personal email for government business, and that congressional involvement could disrupt the criminal probe and give the appearance of a GOP witch hunt.

Ryan, however, had given Chaffetz a green light to proceed — with caution — investigating systematic problems within his committee’s broad jurisdiction, while making clear his preference that Chaffetz steer clear of Clinton personally.

Now, following the POLITICO story, GOP leadership says he may not even investigate systematic issues if they involve Clinton.

Their directive puts Chaffetz in a position where he would have to investigate government officials’ use of personal email and Freedom of Information Act requests without looking at the person who many say has violated transparency principles the most.

The back and forth comes just a day after the House Science Committee, which recently launched its own investigation into Clinton’s email server, told POLITICO it has changed direction and is now opting to delay its inquiry and defer to the FBI.

Chaffetz hadn’t scheduled a hearing yet, but the Utah Republican has obtained new information, according to sources close to the committee. Chaffetz said the probe will be larger than Clinton but that she’s right in the middle of it.

“The Oversight Committee has jurisdiction on the Federal Records Act, and we intend to pursue that,” Chaffetz said in an interview this week before the GOP talked to him Wednesday evening. “We also have jurisdiction on FOIA [the Freedom of Information Act], so if you’re not providing emails, it begs the question of your compliance under FOIA. So, I’m not specifically trying to target the secretary, but when she creates her own private email system, she’s ensnarled herself.”

He added, “I’m trying to be as cautious as I can. I don’t think we should be any harder on her, but I don’t think we should be any easier on her. It’s bigger and broader than just Hillary Clinton.”

Within House Republican leadership, there is heightened sensitivity to congressional scrutiny of Clinton. Ryan prefers that federal authorities handle any potential criminal elements of Clinton’s email scandal, while Rep. Trey Gowdy’s House Select Committee on Benghazi handle anything related to Benghazi.

Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, decided to delay his look at Clinton’s private email server after House Republican leadership expressed unease. An aide on the panel said the “committee temporarily will defer to the FBI’s expanding investigation,” citing new information that 22 emails on Clinton’s server were top secret.

“We expect the FBI to do its job and fully investigate cyber vulnerabilities that may have resulted from former Secretary Clinton’s decision to deviate from established cybersecurity standards and requirements,” the aide said.

Chaffetz said he’s sensitive to the FBI investigation, but that won’t stop him.

“The FBI should pursue any violations and criminal allegations,” Chaffetz said. “I would argue we also have jurisdictional prerogative on Federal Records Act and FOIA [matters]. We’re being very cautious. I don’t want to overstep, but we’re also trying to move forward.”

Top Republicans seem divided over the wisdom of Chaffetz’s move. Some believe it’s a legitimate exercise of his oversight authority. But others think he’s on a partisan fishing expedition that will unavoidably target Clinton.

Far from looking to protect Clinton, Ryan and McCarthy simply believe they should leave criminal matters to the FBI. Congressional interference would look ham-handed, overly partisan and could disrupt the federal investigation, the GOP leaders believe, according to sources close to them.

Chaffetz says his investigation will deal with systematic issues across the government. He’s aiming to examine noncompliance with FOIA, as well as the use of personal email for government business and how it could affect record-keeping policies. He said the use of private emails to conduct government business is “bigger and broader than just problems at the State Department.”

“They seem to be the worst offender, but you also have this problem at the Department of Defense,” Chaffetz said. “Anybody who would use a nongovernment server to interact on government business is in violation. That’s just been known for a long time, that is the law. [Clinton] is by no means the only violator. I’m still looking at it from 60,000 feet, and wondering who’s violating it, how are they doing it and how do we get them to be in compliance. The inspectors general keep issuing reports, and we’re not ignoring those.”

Chaffetz, however, has long sought a role in investigating Clinton — as has his committee, which is filled with conservative lawmakers.

“I’m with the chairman on this,” said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, who sits on the oversight panel. “Look, we have jurisdiction over [the] Federal Records Act. And if it’s appropriate, and I think it is, for us to look at that, I think we should do it in a professional way. Look, there were 60,000 emails. She got to decide which ones were private and which ones went to State Department. Then the State Department got to further screen. We have yet to learn the date parameters, search terms, who had the final say” over which emails to make available as public records.

In a Capitol filled with politicians brimming with ambition, the 48-year-old Chaffetz stands out. Just eight years into his congressional career, he chairs a committee with sweeping jurisdiction over the federal bureaucracy. He has considered running for the Senate, launched a quixotic bid against his former close friend McCarthy for speaker last fall and now is publicly musing about running for governor of Utah in 2020.

Former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) blocked Chaffetz from getting anywhere near the investigation. But when Boehner left Congress in late October, Chaffetz took the opportunity to try to edge back in.

On Jan. 7, Chaffetz met with Ryan and Gowdy (R-S.C.) in a small ceremonial office just off the House floor.

House Republicans stripped food stamp provisions opposed by conservatives and narrowly passed scaled back legislation on Thursday to overhaul the nation's farm programs.

Democrats chastised the GOP for ignoring initiatives they argue poor Americans need to keep from going hungry.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Capitol Hill Democrats who soon will run the House of Representatives are prioritizing climate change nearly a decade after their attempts to slow global warming helped whisk them out of power.

Party leaders vowed to hold hearings on President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to undo Obama-era climate rules and demanded internal documents on administration decisions to scale back restrictions on fossil fuels that contribute to global warming.

Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who is vying to regain her role as House speaker, said she planned to revive a special congressional panel designed to examine climate change. The Select Committee on Energy Independence & Global Warming was shelved after Republicans took over the House in 2010.

That urgency grew after the release Friday of a dire government report that climate change poses an increasing risk to the planet in the form of extreme weather, worsening health conditions, the spread of new diseases, increasing drought and famine and economic decline.

Trump said Monday that he's not buying the National Climate Assessment's warning that the effects of global warming could reduce the nation's GDP by as much as 10 percent by 2100.

""I don't believe it,"" he said when asked about the conclusions of the report, which was written by dozens of top scientists from 13 federal agencies in the Trump administration.

Though they won back the House during the midterm elections by campaigning largely on health care, Democrats got the backing of environmental groups that poured tens of millions of dollars into their campaigns and registered liberal voters.

The quandary for the party leaders when they take back power Jan. 3 is how aggressively to pursue an issue that contributed to the tea party wave that fueled the Republican takeover of the House in 2010.

How prepared are they to address opponents' arguments that ""alarmist"" climate change policies would increase energy prices and reduce consumer choice? How willing are they to take on a president who was elected two years ago on an America First platform that promised to ""bring back coal"" as part of an energy independence agenda?

For now, Democrats are content to build a case through fierce congressional oversight and the power to subpoena administration records, knowing that any major legislation they could pass probably would be vetoed by the president even if it got past the GOP-controlled Senate.

Lawmakers led by incoming Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone, D-N.J., demanded documents related to Environmental Protection Agency proposals to let states regulate their power plants, freeze fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks and roll back requirements on the power industry to check and repair methane leaks.

""The tragic and human and financial costs of unchecked climate change are high and increasing fast, and unfortunately the administration's actions for the last two years are only exacerbating these conditions,"" Pallone wrote in a letter Nov. 20 to EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler.

The emphasis on climate change – which Trump has labeled a ""hoax"" perpetrated by China – comes amid a cascade of scientific reports, including from the United Nations, that portend catastrophic social, economic and environmental consequences within decades if global temperatures keep rising.

Effects are already being felt through stronger hurricanes, more intense wildfires, melting glaciers and loss of habitat, researchers say.

Despite broad evidence that greenhouse gases from fossil fuels are a primary culprit, the Trump administration made expansion of fossil fuels, including more offshore oil and gas drilling and mining, a centerpiece of its energy and economic agenda.

The president pushed to undo Obama-era steps aimed at addressing climate change: proposing a new Clean Power Plan rule to give states more authority to regulate the industry; recommending a freeze on mile-per-gallon standards for cars and light trucks after the 2020 model year; and withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, the international accord to gradually reduce emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane.

""It's always important to know ... more about the real influence and the real reasons and the real beneficiaries of these decisions,"" he said. ""The public has a right to know that.""

Pelosi was speaker in 2009 when the chamber narrowly passed a ""cap and trade"" bill to address climate change. Portrayed by opponents as little more than an energy tax that would hit consumers' wallets, the measure never came up for a vote in the Democratic-controlled Senate and helped fuel the tea party wave that propelled Republicans to take control of the House in 2010.

Though the effects and predicted consequences of climate change have grown more dire since then, some House Democrats are content with modest efforts to address global warming.

“It’s going to be, I think, more of an opportunistic strategy, where, in various pieces of legislation across the board, we’re going to insert measures that address climate change,” Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., co-chair of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, told The Hill newspaper.

Even if the House did pass an aggressive plan, it's doubtful the GOP-controlled Senate would take it up.

Hicks, who was behind closed doors with the committee for more than nine hours, initially refused to answer any questions from investigators about the presidential transition or her time in the White House, with her lawyer telling the panel she was doing so under instructions from the White House.

It was only after Democrats tried to subpoena Hicks for her testimony on the spot, and it became clear that Hicks had discussed the transition in a recent interview with the Senate Intelligence Committee, that she and her legal team conferred with the White House and then answered ""most"" of the committee's questions about the transition, according to Rep.

us_house,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50246324,Trump impeachment: House to vote on how inquiry should proceed,,,"The US House of Representatives has passed a resolution to formally proceed with the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump .
The measure details how the inquiry will move into a more public phase . It was not a vote on whether the president should be removed from office .
This was the first test of support in the Democratic-controlled House for the impeachment process .
The White House condemned the vote , which passed along party lines .
Only two Democrats - representing districts that Mr Trump won handily in 2016 - voted against the resolution , along with all Republicans , for a total count of 232 in favour and 196 against .
The resolution also sets out due process rights for Mr Trump 's lawyers under the congressional inquiry .
The Republican president is accused of trying to pressure Ukraine into investigating unsubstantiated corruption claims against his political rival , Joe Biden , and his son who worked with Ukrainian gas company Burisma .
Republicans have criticised Democrats for the closed hearings - in which Republican lawmakers have also taken part . But Democrats insist they were needed to gather evidence ahead of the public stage of the investigation , and deny allegations they have been secretive .
The resolution moves the inquiry to a new phase , which could eventually see articles of impeachment recommended against Mr Trump . If that happened , and the House voted to pass the articles , a trial would be held in the Senate .
Republicans have been clamouring for weeks for the Democrats to hold a full vote that will formalise the impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives . Now they got one .
Republicans will continue to object to what they see as an unfair process with a preordained result . Democrats will push ahead with an investigation that they always intended would culminate in dramatic public hearings and ( perhaps ) an impeachment vote .
This does n't mean that Thursday 's proceedings are meaningless , however . For the first time since 1998 , the House is taking a significant step toward impeaching a president .
The resolution gives the public some idea what to expect in the days ahead - including lots of Intelligence Committee sparring between Democrats and Republicans , a look at the transcripts from some of the high-profile witness depositions already conducted and , at some point , a formal report that could serve as the basis of articles of impeachment .
It 's not exactly uncharted territory in US history , but the course being set leads toward a historic clash with the presidency at stake .
In the first stage , the House Intelligence Committee will hold public hearings in the coming weeks . It will have the right to make public transcripts of depositions taken in private .
In the second stage , a public report on the findings will be sent to the House Judiciary Committee which will conduct its own proceedings and report on `` such resolutions , articles of impeachment , or other recommendations as it deems proper '' .
President Trump 's lawyers will be allowed to take part in the Judiciary Committee stage .
Republicans will be able to subpoena documents or witnesses although they could still be blocked as both panels are controlled by Democrats .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who is the most senior elected Democrat , said the procedures would allow lawmakers to decide whether to impeach Trump `` based on the truth '' .
`` I do n't know why the Republicans are afraid of the truth , '' she added .
But House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy argued that Democrats are trying to remove Trump `` because they are scared they can not defeat him at the ballot box '' in next year 's presidential election .
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement : `` Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats have done nothing more than enshrine unacceptable violations of due process into House rules . ''
At the heart of the investigation , which was announced by Mrs Pelosi last month , is a phone call on 25 July between Mr Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky .
A rough transcript of the call shows Mr Trump asking for an investigation into the Bidens . Joe Biden is a frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination ahead of next year 's presidential election .
The call was the subject of a complaint by a whistleblower , whose identity has been closely protected by lawmakers .
Tim Morrison , who served as top adviser on Russia and Europe at the National Security Council , has testified to lawmakers .
He was one of the officials authorised to listen in on Mr Trump 's call with the president of Ukraine .
The aide corroborated last week 's testimony by Bill Taylor , the top US diplomat in Ukraine , that Mr Trump had tried to use his office to prod Ukraine into investigating Mr Biden .
But Mr Morrison , who stepped down on Wednesday , also told the committee : `` I want to be clear , I was not concerned that anything illegal was discussed . ''
Meanwhile , House investigators have invited former US National Security Adviser John Bolton to testify on 7 November .
Mr Bolton 's lawyer said his client was not willing to appear voluntarily . No subpoena requiring him to testify has been issued so far .
Mr Bolton had angrily referred to alleged White House political pressure on Ukraine as `` a drug deal '' , according to US media .","Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The moment US House votes for impeachment inquiry

The Republican president is accused of trying to pressure Ukraine into investigating unsubstantiated corruption claims against his political rival, Joe Biden, and his son who worked with Ukrainian gas company Burisma.

Mr Trump denies wrongdoing.

Republicans have criticised Democrats for the closed hearings - in which Republican lawmakers have also taken part. But Democrats insist they were needed to gather evidence ahead of the public stage of the investigation, and deny allegations they have been secretive.

The resolution moves the inquiry to a new phase, which could eventually see articles of impeachment recommended against Mr Trump. If that happened, and the House voted to pass the articles, a trial would be held in the Senate.

A historic clash ahead

Republicans have been clamouring for weeks for the Democrats to hold a full vote that will formalise the impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives. Now they got one.

It won't alter the dynamic in Washington, however.

Republicans will continue to object to what they see as an unfair process with a preordained result. Democrats will push ahead with an investigation that they always intended would culminate in dramatic public hearings and (perhaps) an impeachment vote.

This doesn't mean that Thursday's proceedings are meaningless, however. For the first time since 1998, the House is taking a significant step toward impeaching a president.

The resolution gives the public some idea what to expect in the days ahead - including lots of Intelligence Committee sparring between Democrats and Republicans, a look at the transcripts from some of the high-profile witness depositions already conducted and, at some point, a formal report that could serve as the basis of articles of impeachment.

It's not exactly uncharted territory in US history, but the course being set leads toward a historic clash with the presidency at stake.

What does the resolution say?

In the first stage, the House Intelligence Committee will hold public hearings in the coming weeks. It will have the right to make public transcripts of depositions taken in private.

In the second stage, a public report on the findings will be sent to the House Judiciary Committee which will conduct its own proceedings and report on ""such resolutions, articles of impeachment, or other recommendations as it deems proper"".

President Trump's lawyers will be allowed to take part in the Judiciary Committee stage.

Republicans will be able to subpoena documents or witnesses although they could still be blocked as both panels are controlled by Democrats.

What's the reaction?

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is the most senior elected Democrat, said the procedures would allow lawmakers to decide whether to impeach Trump ""based on the truth"".

""I don't know why the Republicans are afraid of the truth,"" she added.

But House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy argued that Democrats are trying to remove Trump ""because they are scared they cannot defeat him at the ballot box"" in next year's presidential election.

White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement: ""Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats have done nothing more than enshrine unacceptable violations of due process into House rules.""

What's behind the impeachment inquiry?

At the heart of the investigation, which was announced by Mrs Pelosi last month, is a phone call on 25 July between Mr Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

A rough transcript of the call shows Mr Trump asking for an investigation into the Bidens. Joe Biden is a frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination ahead of next year's presidential election.

The call was the subject of a complaint by a whistleblower, whose identity has been closely protected by lawmakers.

What about Thursday's testimony?

Tim Morrison, who served as top adviser on Russia and Europe at the National Security Council, has testified to lawmakers.

He was one of the officials authorised to listen in on Mr Trump's call with the president of Ukraine.

The aide corroborated last week's testimony by Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, that Mr Trump had tried to use his office to prod Ukraine into investigating Mr Biden.

But Mr Morrison, who stepped down on Wednesday, also told the committee: ""I want to be clear, I was not concerned that anything illegal was discussed.""

Meanwhile, House investigators have invited former US National Security Adviser John Bolton to testify on 7 November.

Mr Bolton's lawyer said his client was not willing to appear voluntarily. No subpoena requiring him to testify has been issued so far.

Mr Bolton had angrily referred to alleged White House political pressure on Ukraine as ""a drug deal"", according to US media.",www.bbc.com,center,psAJXHDDaclUSnrC

House Democrats are set to resume their impeachment inquiry on Tuesday with a deposition from another diplomat who appeared uneasy with President Trump 's strategy to pressure Ukraine for political help .
Ambassador William Taylor , who has been serving as the interim head of the U.S. diplomatic mission to Kyiv , is scheduled to talk behind closed doors with members and staff of the Intelligence , Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees .
Taylor is the longtime foreign policy specialist who feared that Trump 's strategy could become `` a nightmare '' and who said the policy that he and his colleagues were executing might prompt him to quit .
Trump used a combination of personal aides , led by attorney Rudy Giuliani , and diplomats to encourage Ukraine to launch investigations that Trump thought might help him in the 2020 presidential race .
Democratic critics of the president who are carrying out the impeachment inquiry say that , in exchange , Washington would grant access to Trump and keep up military assistance to Ukraine — assistance that had been flowing since Ukraine was invaded by Russia in 2014 .
The administration has denied making an explicit link between any investigations and aid .
Other diplomats are said to have told members of Congress that they were n't fully aware of Trump 's and Giuliani 's true aims until late summer , when — after military aid to Ukraine was frozen , prompting press reports and questions from Congress — they began to piece the story together .
`` Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations ? '' Taylor asked the U.S. ambassador to the European Union , Gordon Sondland , in messages on Sept. 1 .
That was the policy Trump had wrought , although the president is said to have told Sondland , who phoned him to ask about what the U.S. was doing , that there was no `` quid pro quo . ''
The White House has gone back and forth as to the nature of the specific exchange between Washington and Kyiv , but it has confirmed and defended the substance of the policy .
Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters that diplomats work for the president , that foreign policy is necessarily political and that people should `` get over it . ''
Trump also dismissed the impeachment inquiry on Monday as evidence that Democrats have no strategy to unseat him fairly in the 2020 election . The president said that he assumes he 'll be impeached , which would lead to a trial in the Senate — one that Trump also assumes he 'll win with the support he enjoys there from majority Republicans .
National security and diplomatic specialists are said to have told Congress that they resented the involvement of an outsider , in Giuliani , and a few of them are understood to have opposed Trump 's pressure strategy on its merits .
For one , it flouted the will of Congress , which had been authorizing and appropriating the military support to Ukraine for years . And for another reason , it sowed doubts about American resolve in Eastern Europe , to the detriment of Ukraine and the benefit of Russia , some argued .
`` The message to the Ukrainians ( and Russians ) we send with the decision on security assistance is key , '' Taylor wrote in another text message in September . `` With the hold '' — the interruption in delivery of funding that Kyiv was expecting — `` we have already shaken their faith in us . Thus my nightmare scenario . ''
The Democrats ' depositions have taken place behind closed doors and so the picture that has emerged about their discoveries is incomplete . Reporters have had to rely in part on accounts given by others about what is being said in testimony or on only opening statements that have been made public .
The committees ' witness on Wednesday is Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper . She is a career Defense Department official who 's responsible for policy toward Russia and Eastern Europe — including Ukraine .
Members and committee staff likely want to ask her for the Defense Department 's perspective on the events of the past few months , given the key role the military has played in supplying weapons and other assistance to Ukrainian forces fighting Russian and Russian-backed groups in the east .
Trump and the White House have said one reason that military assistance to Ukraine was frozen was the U.S. wanted more assurances about Kyiv 's commitment to fighting corruption .

House Democrats are set to resume their impeachment inquiry on Tuesday with a deposition from another diplomat who appeared uneasy with President Trump's strategy to pressure Ukraine for political help.

Ambassador William Taylor, who has been serving as the interim head of the U.S. diplomatic mission to Kyiv, is scheduled to talk behind closed doors with members and staff of the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees.

Taylor is the longtime foreign policy specialist who feared that Trump's strategy could become ""a nightmare"" and who said the policy that he and his colleagues were executing might prompt him to quit.

Trump used a combination of personal aides, led by attorney Rudy Giuliani, and diplomats to encourage Ukraine to launch investigations that Trump thought might help him in the 2020 presidential race.

Democratic critics of the president who are carrying out the impeachment inquiry say that, in exchange, Washington would grant access to Trump and keep up military assistance to Ukraine — assistance that had been flowing since Ukraine was invaded by Russia in 2014.

The administration has denied making an explicit link between any investigations and aid.

Other diplomats are said to have told members of Congress that they weren't fully aware of Trump's and Giuliani's true aims until late summer, when — after military aid to Ukraine was frozen, prompting press reports and questions from Congress — they began to piece the story together.

""Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?"" Taylor asked the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, in messages on Sept. 1.

That was the policy Trump had wrought, although the president is said to have told Sondland, who phoned him to ask about what the U.S. was doing, that there was no ""quid pro quo.""

The White House has gone back and forth as to the nature of the specific exchange between Washington and Kyiv, but it has confirmed and defended the substance of the policy.

Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters that diplomats work for the president, that foreign policy is necessarily political and that people should ""get over it.""

Trump also dismissed the impeachment inquiry on Monday as evidence that Democrats have no strategy to unseat him fairly in the 2020 election. The president said that he assumes he'll be impeached, which would lead to a trial in the Senate — one that Trump also assumes he'll win with the support he enjoys there from majority Republicans.

The outsider

National security and diplomatic specialists are said to have told Congress that they resented the involvement of an outsider, in Giuliani, and a few of them are understood to have opposed Trump's pressure strategy on its merits.

For one, it flouted the will of Congress, which had been authorizing and appropriating the military support to Ukraine for years. And for another reason, it sowed doubts about American resolve in Eastern Europe, to the detriment of Ukraine and the benefit of Russia, some argued.

That's what Taylor, Tuesday's witness, said to his counterparts.

""The message to the Ukrainians (and Russians) we send with the decision on security assistance is key,"" Taylor wrote in another text message in September. ""With the hold"" — the interruption in delivery of funding that Kyiv was expecting — ""we have already shaken their faith in us. Thus my nightmare scenario.""

The Democrats' depositions have taken place behind closed doors and so the picture that has emerged about their discoveries is incomplete. Reporters have had to rely in part on accounts given by others about what is being said in testimony or on only opening statements that have been made public.

Additions and deletions

The committees' witness on Wednesday is Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper. She is a career Defense Department official who's responsible for policy toward Russia and Eastern Europe — including Ukraine.

Members and committee staff likely want to ask her for the Defense Department's perspective on the events of the past few months, given the key role the military has played in supplying weapons and other assistance to Ukrainian forces fighting Russian and Russian-backed groups in the east.

Trump and the White House have said one reason that military assistance to Ukraine was frozen was the U.S. wanted more assurances about Kyiv's commitment to fighting corruption.

The White House blocked that aid in the summer, even though, as NPR has revealed, the Defense Department had certified in May that Ukraine's corruption-fighting progress was sufficient to clear the way for about $250 million in assistance.

Cooper likely will be questioned about how much she or others in the Pentagon knew about the full picture of what was involved with the freeze that followed the green light from the Defense Department.

The road goes ever on

Lawmakers canceled the depositions they had planned for Thursday and Friday because the House instead is planning memorial events for the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who chaired the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.

Two other prospective witnesses this week have said they won't show.

The acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russ Vought, scoffed at Democrats' inquiry on Twitter on Monday and vowed that neither he nor OMB's associate director of national security programs, Michael Duffey, would appear as requested.

The White House has declared Democrats' impeachment inquiry invalid because, among other reasons, the full House hasn't been able to cast a vote on whether to convene one.

That and other objections prompted White House counsel Pat Cipollone to notify House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that the administration wouldn't play ball.

Trump's supporters in Congress — including Republican Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia — also observe that for as much as Pelosi has sought to make the Ukraine affair the focus of the current impeachment efforts, Democrats' first impeachment proposals were filed, for various causes, years ago.

For many of the best-known prospective witnesses in the administration, including Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others, Cipollone's bulwark has held.

But the stream of agency-level experts and others has nonetheless continued, in part because witnesses have so far been unwilling to fight congressional subpoenas.

US Attorney General William Barr has refused to testify to the Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee on his handling of the Russia inquiry.

Mr Barr had previously objected to a plan for lawyers to ask questions at Thursday's hearing.

Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler accused the White House of a ""complete stonewalling of Congress"".

The Justice Department also said that it would not comply with a subpoena issued by Mr Nadler asking for an unredacted version of Mr Mueller's report as well as files from the investigation.

His defence of his actions before the Republican-led Senate Justice Committee came after Special Counsel Robert Mueller - who led the investigative hunt for links between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia - expressed frustration over the report summary.

Mr Mueller is expected to testify to Congress later this month.

Why won't Barr testify?

A Department of Justice statement said Mr Nadler had placed conditions on the House Judiciary Committee hearing that were ""unprecedented and unnecessary"".

The department said that the planned move to have attorneys question Mr Barr was unnecessary because most of the committee members were themselves lawyers.

However, Mr Nadler told reporters he believed that Mr Barr was afraid to testify on Thursday given ""how dishonest he has been"".

""He is terrified of having to face a skilled attorney,"" he said, adding: ""We plan on subpoenaing him if he decides not to show up. He can run but he can't hide.""

""I hope and expect that the attorney general will think overnight and will be there as well,"" Mr Nadler said.

What did Barr tell the Senate?

He testified for the first time on Wednesday since the release of Mr Mueller's 448-page report.

The special counsel did not establish any collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign.

However, the report did not exonerate the president of obstruction of justice. It concluded the Republican president had repeatedly intervened with an inquiry that he feared would doom his presidency.

Mr Barr, who was appointed by Mr Trump, told the Senate Judiciary Committee he was ""frankly surprised"" Mr Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether the president had tried to obstruct justice.

""I think that if he felt that he shouldn't go down the path of making a traditional prosecutorial decision, then he shouldn't have investigated,"" he said.

Mueller 'frustrated' with Barr summary

Mr Barr's testimony came after a letter he had received from Mr Mueller was made public.

In the document, the special counsel stated that Mr Barr's summary ""did not fully capture the context, nature and substance"" of his report's findings, and caused ""public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation"".

Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time. They will also say that there’s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here. But… ‘even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly, the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis. Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange.’… ‍ “In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid, the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation. There is enough here to support impeachment. Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter.”

Story Continued Below

We have our answer. Nobody with the slightest sense of political self-preservation or the scantest hope of having a future. McCarthy (looking ten years older than he did a week ago) used English words to explain his ‘later-for-you statement (“If we're going to unite and be strong, we need a new face to do that"") but had he answered in song, it would have been “zip-a-dee-doo-dah!” Stunned members were said to be openly weeping in the cloakroom, but nary one of the tear-soaked super-majority was rushing to raise his hands shouting “Pick Me! Pick me!”

When asked if he was interested in the gig, Rep. Mac Thornberry, conservative from Texas cattle country, told reporters on the Hill, ""I'd rather be a vegetarian.”

This is because the overstuffed 247-member House majority (brilliantly secured in perpetuity by Bush-era electoral gerrymandering) is, like New York in the 1970s or the Washington Nationals right now, essentially ungovernable.

Here are five reasons why only a fool, hero, caretaker (or some combination of all) would want the job Boehner dearly hopes to vacate by month’s end, but can’t.

1. Ted Cruz is running for president. It’s been jokingly said that the Texas tea party god, who often crossed the rotunda to whip up ultra-conservatives against Boehner’s budget deals, is “Speaker Cruz.” He’s lashed Boehner as a sell-out and cheered the 2013 government shutdown, and even with his nemesis gone, Cruz is going to continue to barbecue the GOP “establishment” – i.e. anybody who has a job that requires them to compromise with the White House. And that’s basically the job description.

Moreover, bashing Congress is the mouth-breathing of political discourse, anyone can do it, and often does. At present, the overall Congressional approval rating is about 16 percent – and that’s pretty good, considering it touched high single digits in recent years. Donald Trump, who had no particular beef with McCarthy but is on good terms with Cruz, offered a don’t-let-the-door-hit-you tweet because, you know, why not? “Great, Kevin McCarthy drops out of SPEAKER race. We need a really smart and really tough person to take over this very important job!” he wrote before suggesting his daughter Ivanka take the job.

Presumably, he loves her too much to have been serious.

2. The “catastrophic” 2013 government shutdown didn’t scare the tea party. Boehner, who had a Midwestern plastic salesman’s love for a folksy maxim, was fond of saying that the tea party wing of his party would recede once they had “touched the stove” – by shutting down the government.

Nope. Cruz delivered his celebrated semi-filibuster against Obamacare, and his members scuttled attempts to cut a stopgap deal with the White House. After a 16-day shutdown, the two sides agreed to a short-term funding deal – with polls showing 8 in 10 Americans blamed Republicans for the disruption, with tea party support tanking nationally.

Democrats predicted the GOP would pay a steep price for their recklessness in the 2014 elections. Not only were the wrong, they were historically wrong: Midterms are, by their nature, base elections, so fired-up anti-Obama Republicans romped, picking up nine Senate seats and the majority.

When Phillip Bump of the Washington Post analyzed the post-shutdown polling, he concluded “if there is a repeat of the government shutdown, how it affects 2016 -- if at all -- is probably impossible to predict.”

3. If you have any chance of winning, you're automatically the “establishment.” McCarthy is safely in the red zone of any standard definition of “conservative” but to his party’s right wing, he might as well have been King Boehner II. The tea party, fresh off deposing the last speaker, was leery of anybody who followed the pre-ordained lines of succession – despite McCarthy’s reputation as glad-handing bridge builder willing to hear out their complaints.

4. Paul Ryan doesn't want to be speaker -- yet.

Plus he delivered a passionate pep talk on behalf of his fallen friend McCarthy. The former 2012 vice-presidential candidate isn't much more conservative that McCarthy, but he's arguably the one Republican with the national stature to overcome the reflexive insurrection from the right.

Until Thursday it seemed unlikely, but my colleague Anna Palmer says Ryan has cancelled a couple of fundraisers over the next few days, so stay tuned.

5. Your best friend will be Nancy Pelosi. The last speaker to really run the place is still a force to be reckoned with, and even with her shrunken cadre of 177 members – the minority leader is in control. Most (if not all) of Pelosi’s people stick with her on any critical vote, especially budget roll-calls, and Boehner has increasingly relied on her to ram through measures his right wing won’t support. That’s proven to be a useful partnership for all involved (Tea party members, ever worried about primary challengers on their right, get to say they fought the good fight but were betrayed).

With lawmakers headed home for Thanksgiving break , the question on everyone ’ s minds is “ what comes next ? ”
In its rough form , what ’ s next is that the House Intelligence Committee and Chair Adam Schiff ( D-CA ) will compile and submit a report of its investigation to the House Judiciary Committee . The Judiciary Committee hasn ’ t had jurisdiction on the narrow Ukraine-focused impeachment investigation , but it ’ s the body that will decide whether or not to draft articles of impeachment — the “ charges ” against Trump .
There are no more public hearings on the schedule for now . Of course , this could change if someone else with valuable testimony comes forward . But some Democrats don ’ t want to wait long for a star witness like former National Security Adviser John Bolton — who has said he won ’ t testify unless compelled by a court .
“ He blew our timeline up , ” Rep. Stephen Lynch ( D-MA ) , a member of the House Oversight Committee told ███ recently , adding that testimony from other sources about Bolton made it seem like he was opposed to Trump ’ s objectives in Ukraine . “ When we looked at the evidence we wanted from him , we had other sources . ... He can be prickly at times , and you ’ re not sure what he ’ s going to come out with . ”
An Intelligence Committee spokesperson declined to comment on whether there would be additional hearings before or after the Thanksgiving holiday , or when Schiff would submit his report .
For a while , the buzz around Capitol Hill has been that the Judiciary Committee could draft articles to send to the full House before Christmas . Some House Democrats have said they ’ d like to vote on impeachment by the end of the year , but there ’ s still no set timeline . On Thursday , the Washington Post reported Senate Republicans are in talks with senior White House officials to limit a Senate impeachment trial to two weeks , and it ’ s likely the earliest a trial could come is January .
On Thursday , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi left the door open to the possibility of more testimony , but was careful not to put forth any deadlines .
“ All of this is up to the committees of jurisdiction . They have the responsibility and they see the flow of evidence in fact , ” Pelosi said . “ We aren ’ t finished yet , the day is not over , and you never know what testimony of one person may lead to need for testimony of the other , as we saw with Ambassador Taylor at the beginning of last week bringing forth Mr. Holmes today . ”
An aide to a member on the Intelligence Committee told ███ that while there ’ s some talk at the staff level of holding more sessions , Democrats are feeling confident they have enough information about Trump ’ s efforts to co-opt US foreign policy and compel the Ukrainian president to open investigations that would benefit him politically . The House comes back to Washington the week after Thanksgiving , when work will resume .
“ Certainly there ’ s more to investigate re : [ Secretary of State Mike ] Pompeo , etc. , ” the aide said , “ but for the case against the president at this point we have more than enough . ”
Pelosi also repeated her invitation to President Trump to appear before the committees under oath . “ We haven ’ t made any decision , and as I said to the president , if you have any information that is exculpatory , please bring it forward , because it seems the facts are uncontested as to what happened , ” she said . “ If you have reason to convince people that something was different — under oath — please let us know . ”
The spotlight is about to move to the House Judiciary Committee
After the Thanksgiving break is done , the intense focus around impeachment will likely switch from the Intelligence Committee to the Judiciary Committee .
While the Intelligence Committee ( along with the House Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees ) has had jurisdiction over the House ’ s impeachment investigation , the Judiciary Committee will ultimately be the group deciding whether or not to move articles , which would then go to the Senate for the official trial — if approved by the full House . Here ’ s how the rest of the House ’ s side of the process works , as I wrote along with my ███ colleagues Li Zhou and Matt Yglesias :
Once House lawmakers ’ investigation is complete — we don ’ t yet know when that will be — they can decide whether or not to recommend articles of impeachment , or charges to be specifically brought against the president . The House Judiciary Committee would vote on these charges and then advance them to a vote by the full House . The House then decides if it officially wants to charge the president on these counts , a move that requires a simple majority to pass .
Four Judiciary Committee members told ███ on Wednesday they ’ re not yet sure the timeline will be .

“ I don ’ t want to prejudge it , but this evidence is so damning , and you ’ ll notice there ’ s no exculpatory information coming out from the administration , ” Rep. Madeleine Dean ( D-PA ) told ███ .

The spotlight is about to move to the House Judiciary Committee

After the Thanksgiving break is done, the intense focus around impeachment will likely switch from the Intelligence Committee to the Judiciary Committee.

While the Intelligence Committee (along with the House Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees) has had jurisdiction over the House’s impeachment investigation, the Judiciary Committee will ultimately be the group deciding whether or not to move articles, which would then go to the Senate for the official trial — if approved by the full House.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-NY ) , who drew attention to climate change during a sit-in at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’ s office before she was even sworn in , is releasing a formal resolution in the House this week outlining her exact policy proposal for the Green New Deal — an ambitious idea that aggressively tackles climate change to reduce carbon emissions in the next 10 years . It also includes plans for universal health care and a significant expansion of the social safety net .
“ The major thing here is to define it before other people get to define it for her , ” said Waleed Shahid , spokesman for the Justice Democrats . “ As multiple 2020 candidates say they support the Green New Deal , our movement is going to be defining it to ensure that what these candidates are calling for is a World War II-style mobilization of our economy . ”
Behind the scenes , Ocasio-Cortez and her allies have been mobilizing a campaign to get House Democrats and 2020 presidential candidates to sign onto it — not just in vague platitudes of support , but throwing their weight behind the specifics of the deal .
“ Once this resolution is announced , there will be a really clear litmus test for what they support , ” said Stephen O ’ Hanlon , spokesman for climate activist group Sunrise Movement .
But there ’ s something larger at work here . The Green New Deal is fundamentally about making climate change a central Democratic priority in 2020 — without shoving aside health care and the economy . After years of this globally important issue languishing on the national agenda , it has come roaring back .
Until now , the Green New Deal has been more of an idea than an actual policy . This week , an Ocasio-Cortez resolution is set to make its debut . The plan prioritizes climate change , but its strength lies in its symbolic ties to one of the Democratic party ’ s biggest historical successes : the original New Deal under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
As historian Eric Rauchway recently wrote in the Washington Post , FDR ’ s vision for the 1932 New Deal in many ways was a “ green ” New Deal that included a significant social justice component . FDR ’ s plan included sustainable ways to shape the nation ’ s waterways and agriculture , trying to ensure there wouldn ’ t be another Dust Bowl , the severe drought that came about from poor farming practices .
But as Rauchway writes , FDR ’ s social justice idealism fell by the wayside as the president had to compromise to get things done quickly . This could be a lesson for politicians who want to make the second version ; the speed and scale required could create problems for marginalized communities .
Activists were clearly inspired by this . Our original guide for what the Green New Deal looks like lies in a working document that called for the formation of a House Select Committee for a Green New Deal ( ultimately , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi agreed to a select committee on climate change , but it did not go as far as progressives hoped ) .
The Green New Deal ’ s biggest goal is making the United States carbon neutral by 2030 and turning the country into a global leader in renewable energy in the process . This would be a massive transformation ; the document calls for the country to upgrade every residential and industrial building to be energy efficient , and completely cut fossil fuel emissions from major industries and US infrastructure .
The document reads a bit like a progressive manifesto : In addition to calling for the United States to generate 100 percent of its power demand through renewable sources like wind and solar by the year 2030 , it also calls for progressive programs like Medicare for all , a jobs guarantee program , and a universal basic income . And though the actual resolution is expected to focus more on energy and environmental issues , the basic structure will likely be similar .
Rather than trying to incentivize private business to change its practices , the plan is calling for significant involvement from the federal government for a solution to climate change that ’ s both broad enough to meet the scale and fast enough to respond to devastating impacts like sea level rise , drought , fires , and major storms that we are already seeing .
“ The level of investment required will be massive , ” the document reads . “ The speed of investment required will be massive . Even if all the billionaires and companies could make the investments required , they would not be able to pull together a coordinated response in the narrow window of time required to jump-start major new projects and major new sectors . ”
As ███ ’ s Dave Roberts wrote in his in-depth explainer of the plan :
As we will see , the exact details of the GND remain to be worked out , but the broad thrust is fairly simple . It refers , in the loosest sense , to a massive program of investments in clean-energy jobs and infrastructure , meant to transform not just the energy sector , but the entire economy . It is meant both to decarbonize the economy and to make it fairer and more just .
If climate change were one of the central policy agenda items among Democrats in this presidential election cycle , it would be a noticeable departure from the past .
Democrats have talked about climate change as the most important issue out there for some time , but there has been seemingly little urgency in Congress to take action . The last large bill House Democrats passed to address climate change was the American Clean Energy and Security Act , a cap-and-trade bill that passed the House in 2009 ; it failed in the Senate . Former President Barack Obama ’ s signature climate policy was the Clean Power Plan ; he also joined the international Paris climate agreement . President Donald Trump has undone both of those actions , pulling the US out of the Paris deal and attempting to roll back the Clean Power Plan .
Climate change has been at risk of falling off the agenda permanently — and many conservative groups and leaders ( including the current president ) love to inject doubt whenever the US is hit with cold temperatures on the well-established fact that climate change is real and caused by humans .
With Republicans controlling the House and Senate for the first two years of Trump ’ s presidency , climate change wasn ’ t taken seriously on Capitol Hill at all .

How AOC and activist groups plan to push this policy in the House
The coalition — made up of Sunrise Movement , Justice Democrats , and Ocasio-Cortez herself has already gotten about 40 members of Congress to sign onto an effort pushing for the creation of a select committee on a Green New Deal to hash out the details of the lofty idea .
That didn ’ t pan out as hoped ; while Pelosi agreed to the creation of a select committee on climate change , it wasn ’ t as powerful as other committees that have subpoena power — something Ocasio-Cortez and progressive groups wanted . And House leadership has made no commitments yet on actually taking up a Green New Deal resolution when it is released .
When the resolution is released , activists plan to go back to every House member and senator who supported the select committee and get them to back Ocasio-Cortez ’ s updated plan .
“ For people who have supported the select committee , we ’ re not assuming any of them support the resolution , ” O ’ Hanlon said .
Even some members who say they support the idea of a Green New Deal say they are wary of signing onto support Ocasio-Cortez ’ s resolution without know exactly what the proposal contains .
“ I won ’ t sign on before I see it , ” DeFazio said .
Some 2020 Democrats have also been cautious about a full-throated endorsement . While the Green New Deal has been endorsed by declared or potential candidates including Kamala Harris , Bernie Sanders , Kirsten Gillibrand , Mike Bloomberg , and Cory Booker , exactly what that means is fuzzy . Staff for 2020 contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-MA ) told Axios she supports the “ idea ” of a Green New Deal .
The fact this proposal is a catch-all of the most progressive programs means it probably isn ’ t going anywhere in the House , where House Energy and Commerce Chair Frank Pallone has already called the plan too ambitious and unlikely to generate consensus among moderate Democrats in the House , never mind the Senate .
“ The goal of trying to reduce fossil fuels and get to a carbon neutral economy is important and something that I agree with , ” Pallone told the Asbury Park Press last month . “ The Green New Deal says you can do it in 10 years . I don ’ t know if that ’ s technologically feasible . ... Beyond that it ’ s probably not politically feasible . ”
But to Ocasio-Cortez and Green New Deal backers , that ’ s not the point . They are banking that the idea will keep spreading . Even some in the House who are skeptical of whether the plan is feasible agree that the branding of the Green New Deal — harkening back to the days of FDR — is a brilliant marketing strategy .
The Green New Deal is becoming a progressive litmus test
Progressives are clearly using the Green New Deal to push the debate in their direction . The left wants to make sure they have fully vetted and influenced the ideas of any Democrats that have a shot at winning the White House .
If Democrats take back the White House and the Senate in 2020 — a big though not impossible if — activists want to have bills ready to go in 2021 to tackle climate change . Realistically , the bills that come out of the House in the next two years probably won ’ t be as bold as the proposal Ocasio-Cortez is floating .
Justice Democrats and the Sunrise Movement are clear : They won ’ t support a candidate for president that won ’ t back the Green New Deal . They ’ re aided by the fact that many 2020 contenders already support Medicare for All , and many — including Booker , Harris , and Sanders — have already floated some of the other components of a Green New Deal : a universal basic income and jobs guarantee .
But activists won ’ t be totally satisfied until 2020 candidates do two things : embrace Ocasio-Cortez ’ s plan and pledge not to take fossil fuel money .
“ We ’ re focusing on getting all the 2020 contenders to endorse the full vision of the Green New Deal and get specific about it , ” O ’ Hanlon said . “ All of the 2020 candidates need to know that if they want to be taken seriously by young people , they need to reject fossil fuel money and back the Green New Deal . ”","The Green New Deal ricocheted into America’s political consciousness in record time.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who drew attention to climate change during a sit-in at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office before she was even sworn in, is releasing a formal resolution in the House this week outlining her exact policy proposal for the Green New Deal — an ambitious idea that aggressively tackles climate change to reduce carbon emissions in the next 10 years. It also includes plans for universal health care and a significant expansion of the social safety net.

“The major thing here is to define it before other people get to define it for her,” said Waleed Shahid, spokesman for the Justice Democrats. “As multiple 2020 candidates say they support the Green New Deal, our movement is going to be defining it to ensure that what these candidates are calling for is a World War II-style mobilization of our economy.”

Behind the scenes, Ocasio-Cortez and her allies have been mobilizing a campaign to get House Democrats and 2020 presidential candidates to sign onto it — not just in vague platitudes of support, but throwing their weight behind the specifics of the deal.

“Once this resolution is announced, there will be a really clear litmus test for what they support,” said Stephen O’Hanlon, spokesman for climate activist group Sunrise Movement.

But there’s something larger at work here. The Green New Deal is fundamentally about making climate change a central Democratic priority in 2020 — without shoving aside health care and the economy. After years of this globally important issue languishing on the national agenda, it has come roaring back.

What is the Green New Deal?

Until now, the Green New Deal has been more of an idea than an actual policy. This week, an Ocasio-Cortez resolution is set to make its debut. The plan prioritizes climate change, but its strength lies in its symbolic ties to one of the Democratic party’s biggest historical successes: the original New Deal under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

As historian Eric Rauchway recently wrote in the Washington Post, FDR’s vision for the 1932 New Deal in many ways was a “green” New Deal that included a significant social justice component. FDR’s plan included sustainable ways to shape the nation’s waterways and agriculture, trying to ensure there wouldn’t be another Dust Bowl, the severe drought that came about from poor farming practices.

But as Rauchway writes, FDR’s social justice idealism fell by the wayside as the president had to compromise to get things done quickly. This could be a lesson for politicians who want to make the second version; the speed and scale required could create problems for marginalized communities.

Activists were clearly inspired by this. Our original guide for what the Green New Deal looks like lies in a working document that called for the formation of a House Select Committee for a Green New Deal (ultimately, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi agreed to a select committee on climate change, but it did not go as far as progressives hoped).

The Green New Deal’s biggest goal is making the United States carbon neutral by 2030 and turning the country into a global leader in renewable energy in the process. This would be a massive transformation; the document calls for the country to upgrade every residential and industrial building to be energy efficient, and completely cut fossil fuel emissions from major industries and US infrastructure.

The document reads a bit like a progressive manifesto: In addition to calling for the United States to generate 100 percent of its power demand through renewable sources like wind and solar by the year 2030, it also calls for progressive programs like Medicare for all, a jobs guarantee program, and a universal basic income. And though the actual resolution is expected to focus more on energy and environmental issues, the basic structure will likely be similar.

Rather than trying to incentivize private business to change its practices, the plan is calling for significant involvement from the federal government for a solution to climate change that’s both broad enough to meet the scale and fast enough to respond to devastating impacts like sea level rise, drought, fires, and major storms that we are already seeing.

“The level of investment required will be massive,” the document reads. “The speed of investment required will be massive. Even if all the billionaires and companies could make the investments required, they would not be able to pull together a coordinated response in the narrow window of time required to jump-start major new projects and major new sectors.”

As Vox’s Dave Roberts wrote in his in-depth explainer of the plan:

As we will see, the exact details of the GND remain to be worked out, but the broad thrust is fairly simple. It refers, in the loosest sense, to a massive program of investments in clean-energy jobs and infrastructure, meant to transform not just the energy sector, but the entire economy. It is meant both to decarbonize the economy and to make it fairer and more just.

Why climate change feels urgent now

If climate change were one of the central policy agenda items among Democrats in this presidential election cycle, it would be a noticeable departure from the past.

Democrats have talked about climate change as the most important issue out there for some time, but there has been seemingly little urgency in Congress to take action. The last large bill House Democrats passed to address climate change was the American Clean Energy and Security Act, a cap-and-trade bill that passed the House in 2009; it failed in the Senate. Former President Barack Obama’s signature climate policy was the Clean Power Plan; he also joined the international Paris climate agreement. President Donald Trump has undone both of those actions, pulling the US out of the Paris deal and attempting to roll back the Clean Power Plan.

Climate change has been at risk of falling off the agenda permanently — and many conservative groups and leaders (including the current president) love to inject doubt whenever the US is hit with cold temperatures on the well-established fact that climate change is real and caused by humans.

With Republicans controlling the House and Senate for the first two years of Trump’s presidency, climate change wasn’t taken seriously on Capitol Hill at all.

“We weren’t even allowed to hold hearings on the issue or things that would contribute to carbon reduction,” said Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-OR), chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. “The Republicans were a total roadblock for us even talking about climate change. They don’t believe in it. Well, some of them do, but their leadership and the president certainly don’t.”

But as Vox’s Umair Irfan has written, there are signs that bold ideas to address the crisis are now more welcome. With recent hurricanes, droughts, and raging wildfires all clearly exacerbated by global warming, people are experiencing the effects of climate change for themselves, and more people are getting concerned.

A recent nationally representative poll from Yale University and George Mason University found 69 percent of Americans are “somewhat worried” about climate change and 29 percent are “very worried,” the highest those numbers have ever been.

As Irfan writes:

The United States saw billions of dollars in damages and dozens of deaths last year as rising temperatures increased the damages from extreme events. These disasters helped make the somewhat abstract warming of the planet tangible in people’s minds.

In other words, the time is now for climate activists and their allies in Congress to make their case for action.

But in a stunning reversal , as Fox News first reported , leadership at the Justice Department overruled the prosecutors on the case , scaling back the proposed sentence for Stone , which immediately led Democrats to accuse Trump of interfering in the process by tweeting about his displeasure with the DOJ . Trump denies it , and the case lately has been complicated further by questions over possible juror bias .
During an interview with CNN on Wednesday , Swalwell , D-Calif. , was asked whether Democrats would look to launch a new impeachment inquiry on the new controversy .
“ You know , we ’ re not going to take our options off the table , ” Swalwell , a member of the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees , told CNN . “ We don ’ t wake up in the morning wanting to impeach him . ”
He added : “ We want to work with him on prescription drugs , background checks , and infrastructure , but we ’ re not going to let him just torch this democracy because he thinks that he ’ s been let off once and we ’ re not going to do something about it . ”
Swalwell ’ s comments come as several Democrats on Capitol Hill have demanded investigations -- and even the resignation of Attorney General Bill Barr -- after the move to scale back the Stone sentence .
“ Congress must act immediately to rein in our lawless Attorney General , ” Sen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass. , tweeted Wednesday . “ Barr should resign or face impeachment . ”
Sen. Richard Blumenthal , D-Conn. , also slammed Barr , saying he “ ought to be ashamed and embarrassed and resign as a result of this action directly interfering in the independent prosecution of Roger Stone. ” He also said the controversy was yet another example of “ political interference by the president to alter the independent decisions of the Department of Justice . ”
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler , D-N.Y. , didn ’ t answer a question on whether Barr should resign but said : “ I think the behavior is extremely egregious . ”
TRUMP DENIES INTERFERING IN ROGER STONE CASE , STAYS MUM ON POSSIBLE PARDON

Ilhan Omar on Monday shot down calls to have other members of Congress boycott visits to Israel but said continued U.S. aid should be made dependent on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu improving conditions for the Palestinians .
Ms. Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib , whom Israel barred from entering based on their support for the anti-Israel Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions ( BDS ) movement , held a press conference to denounce their treatment and accuse Mr. Netanyahu and President Trump of conspiring to keep them from making the trip .
They said members of Congress should be able to see what Israel does with billions of dollars of aid and urged their colleagues to consider curtailing assistance .
“ We must be asking , as Israel ’ s ally , that Netanyahu stop the expansion of settlements on Palestinian land and ensure full rights for Palestinians if we are to give them aid , ” said Ms. Omar , Minnesota Democrat .
She and Ms. Tlaib , Michigan Democrat , were supposed to be in Israel Monday , but Mr. Netanyahu announced last week they wouldn ’ t be admitted .
His government previously had signaled they would be allowed , but he said after seeing their itinerary he concluded they were looking for a platform to grandstand , rather than engaging in a fact-finding mission .
Ms. Omar denied that claim , saying that she , Ms. Tlaib and Rep. Stacey Plaskett were planning on meeting with members of the Knesset , Israel ’ s national assembly . Ms. Tlaib also said they would be meeting with Israeli military veterans who have advocated for Palestinian self-determination .
A version of their itinerary , obtained by a reporter for Israel ’ s public broadcaster , showed meetings with several Palestinian activists and international human rights groups , but no lawmakers or officials .
They said their trip was organized by Miftah , a nonprofit Palestinian advocacy group that has drawn criticism .
They said they learned of the group from other members of Congress , and were surprised at the criticism .
“ We ’ re also taken aback and learn from everybody else that there ’ s some issues regarding them , ” Ms. Tlaib said , calling those questions a “ distraction . ”

us_house,Fox Online News,2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-impeachment-hearings-trump-moderate-democrats,Day One of public impeachment hearings puts pressure on moderate Dems,,"Gregg Re, Christian Jacobs, Wearing Fedora","All eyes were on moderate House Democrats in swing districts Wednesday night , after the first day of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump wrapped up with no major revelations -- but also highlighted weaknesses in Democrats ' key witnesses , who relied primarily on second-hand information and never once interacted with the president .
At one point in Wednesday 's hearing , Rep. Mike Quigley , D-Ill. , even appeared to embrace hearsay testimony , claiming that `` hearsay can be much better evidence than direct '' and that `` countless people have been convicted on hearsay because the courts have routinely allowed and created , needed exceptions to hearsay . '' It was unclear which of those limited exceptions would apply to Wednesday 's testimony -- and whether Quigley 's argument would persuade critical swing-vote Democrats .
The House is now comprised of 431 members , meaning Democrats need 217 yeas to impeach Trump . There are currently 233 Democrats , so Democrats can only lose 16 of their own and still impeach the president . 31 House Democrats represent more moderate districts that Trump carried in 2016 .
Freshman Rep. Elissa Slotkin , D-Mich. -- who flipped a GOP district in 2018 that Trump won by 7 points in 2016 -- told Fox News that she was tentatively weighing all the evidence .
`` My constituents expect me to make an objective decision , '' Slotkin said as the hearings concluded , `` not one based on an hour of testimony . ''
Slotkin went on to acknowledge that launching an impeachment inquiry was a `` politically tough thing to do . ''
`` I 'm not waking up in the morning looking for some golden poll , '' Slotkin said , insisting that she would analyze all testimony carefully in the coming days .
Reports have emerged that , should Trump be impeached by a majority vote in the House , Senate Republicans might strategically hold a lengthy trial to `` scramble '' the 2020 Democratic presidential primary -- including by requiring several of the contenders to remain in Washington to handle the trial . Trump is all but certain to be acquitted by the GOP-controlled Senate in the event of impeachment , given that a two-thirds vote is required in the Senate to remove the president .
As the public hearing wrapped up on Wednesday , the panel voted 13-9 , along party lines , to table a Republican motion to subpoena the whistleblower -- signaling that not many minds had been swayed .
'COUP HAS STARTED , ' WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY SAID IN 2017 , VOWING IMPEACHMENT
A GOP source close to the House Intelligence Committee told Fox News late Wednesday that Republicans have full confidence in counsel Steve Castor , and he will continue to lead the questioning in the next round of public impeachment hearings . GOP members were pleased with his questioning today , the source said .
The day provided one previously undisclosed allegation . Career diplomat William Taylor , the charge d ’ affaires in Kiev , offered testimony , for the first time , that the president was overheard by a member of his staff on July 26 asking EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland about “ the investigations , ” to which Sondland supposedly responded that “ the Ukrainians were ready to move forward. ” Taylor said that following Sondland ’ s call with Trump , the member of his staff asked what Trump thought about Ukraine .
“ Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden , which Giuliani was pressing for , ” Taylor said , revealing new information from his prior testimony last month . “ At the time I gave my deposition on October 22 , I was not aware of this information . I am including it for completeness . ”
But , Republicans pointed out that Taylor 's testimony was unverifiable hearsay , several layers deep -- and that Sondland has previously testified that Trump explicitly told him there were `` no quid pro quo ’ s of any kind '' with Ukraine , including one in which military aid would be conditioned on any politically motivated investigations . ( Sondland later amended his testimony , claiming his recollection had been `` refreshed , '' to say that he had come to `` understand '' from other sources that Trump wanted Ukraine to issue an `` anti-corruption statement . '' )
`` 'Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. [ Tim ] Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I had conveyed this message to Mr. [ Andriy ] Yermak on September 1 , 2019 , in connection with Vice President Pence ’ s visit to Warsaw and a meeting with President [ Volodymyr ] Zelensky , ' '' Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan said , incredulously reading a statement from Sondland .
`` We ’ ve got six people having four conversations in one sentence , and you just told me this is where you got your 'clear understanding , ' '' Jordan continued , as Taylor appeared to laugh . `` Ambassador , you were n't on the call , were you ? You 've never talked to Chief of Staff [ Mick ] Mulvaney ? You 've never met the president . ... And you 're their star witness ? ''
Even CNN analyst Jeffrey Toobin noted that Democrats had a `` problem , '' in that their key witnesses Wednesday had never directly interacted with Trump . `` And , that 's a problem if you 're going to impeach the president , '' Toobin said .
Jordan also reminded viewers that President Obama had declined to provide lethal aid to Ukraine , even after Russia 's invasion . Trump , on the other hand , eventually provided Javelin missiles . And , Ukraine 's president has said he felt no pressure , improper or otherwise , from the Trump administration to engage in any investigations .
Trump , for his part , said he was too busy to watch on Wednesday and denied having such a phone call . `` First I 've heard of it , '' he said when asked .
At a news conference with Turkey 's leader , Trump vowed to release another transcript of an earlier call with Ukraine on Thursday . He called Democrats ' efforts a hopeless `` witch hunt . ''
The president pointed to Sondland 's written testimony : `` The one thing I 've seen that Sondland said , he did speak to me for a brief moment , he did speak to me for a brief moment -- [ he testified previously that ] I said , no 'quid pro quo , ' under any circumstances , and that 's true . In any event , it 's more second-hand information . ... The only thing , and I guess Sondland has stayed with his testimony , that there was no quid-pro-quo , pure and simple . ''
Media observers questioned whether the proceedings ultimately would sway any opinions , or make things any easier for moderate Democrats . ABC News ' George Stephanopoulos mused on-air , `` part of me is wondering , what do facts matter anymore in these debates ? ''
Meanwhile , Christian Jacobs , 50 , sat in a beach bar in St. Petersburg , wearing a fedora and reluctantly watching the drama on television , as The Associated Press put it .
FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE : ICIG COMPLAINT ALLEGES UKRAINE WHISTLEBLOWER VIOLATING LAW BY COLLECTING ANONYMOUS DONATIONS FROM PROHIBITED SOURCES
`` I did not want this , '' Jacobs , a Democrat , said , glancing at the TV and vaping . He said he had been leaning closer toward impeachment .
`` I 'm so afraid , left to his own devices , what else he may do , '' Jacobs said of Trump .
`` I did not want this . '' — Christian Jacobs , 50 , wearing fedora and sipping marijuana vape pen
Anthony Harris , cutting hair in Savannah , Georgia , had the hearing on in his shop , but he said , `` It 's gotten to the point now where people are even tired of listening . ''
Lawmakers largely signaled that the hours of partisan back-and-forth did not appear to leave a singular moment etched in the public consciousness the way the Watergate proceedings or former President Clinton 's impeachment did .
`` No real surprises , no bombshells , '' said committee member Rep. Chris Stewart , R-Utah .
Taylor and Kent had defied White House instructions not to appear . Both received subpoenas .
They were among a dozen current and former officials who already testified behind closed doors . Wednesday was the start of days of public hearings expected to stretch into next week .
All day , the diplomats testified about how an ambassador was fired , the new Ukraine government was confused and they discovered an `` irregular channel '' -- a shadow U.S. foreign policy orchestrated by the president 's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani which raised alarms in diplomatic and national-security circles .
For their part , Republican lawmakers observed that the president -- not unelected career bureaucrats -- dictated foreign policy .
At its core , the inquiry has stemmed from Trump ’ s July 25 phone call when he asked Zelensky for `` a favor . ''
The White House already has released a transcript of the call , in which the two discussed past U.S. `` support '' for Ukraine , as well as Ukraine 's issues with corruption . On the call , Trump asked Kiev to investigate reports that Ukraine was involved in 2016 election interference .
Later on , the president also mentioned former Vice President Joe Biden 's push to have Ukraine 's chief prosecutor fired , and suggested the country look into the matter .
The call came a day after former Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's widely derided appearance on Capitol Hill appeared to leave Democrats ' hopes for impeachment dashed .","All eyes were on moderate House Democrats in swing districts Wednesday night, after the first day of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump wrapped up with no major revelations -- but also highlighted weaknesses in Democrats' key witnesses, who relied primarily on second-hand information and never once interacted with the president.

Trump is all but certain to be acquitted by the GOP-controlled Senate in the event of impeachment, given that a two-thirds vote is required in the Senate to remove the president.

As the public hearing wrapped up on Wednesday, the panel voted 13-9, along party lines, to table a Republican motion to subpoena the whistleblower -- signaling that not many minds had been swayed.

'COUP HAS STARTED,' WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY SAID IN 2017, VOWING IMPEACHMENT

A GOP source close to the House Intelligence Committee told Fox News late Wednesday that Republicans have full confidence in counsel Steve Castor, and he will continue to lead the questioning in the next round of public impeachment hearings. GOP members were pleased with his questioning today, the source said.

The day provided one previously undisclosed allegation. Career diplomat William Taylor, the charge d’affaires in Kiev, offered testimony, for the first time, that the president was overheard by a member of his staff on July 26 asking EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland about “the investigations,” to which Sondland supposedly responded that “the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.” Taylor said that following Sondland’s call with Trump, the member of his staff asked what Trump thought about Ukraine.

“Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,” Taylor said, revealing new information from his prior testimony last month. “At the time I gave my deposition on October 22, I was not aware of this information. I am including it for completeness.”

But, Republicans pointed out that Taylor's testimony was unverifiable hearsay, several layers deep -- and that Sondland has previously testified that Trump explicitly told him there were ""no quid pro quo’s of any kind"" with Ukraine, including one in which military aid would be conditioned on any politically motivated investigations. (Sondland later amended his testimony, claiming his recollection had been ""refreshed,"" to say that he had come to ""understand"" from other sources that Trump wanted Ukraine to issue an ""anti-corruption statement."")

""'Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. [Tim] Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I had conveyed this message to Mr. [Andriy] Yermak on September 1, 2019, in connection with Vice President Pence’s visit to Warsaw and a meeting with President [Volodymyr] Zelensky,'"" Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan said, incredulously reading a statement from Sondland.

""We’ve got six people having four conversations in one sentence, and you just told me this is where you got your 'clear understanding,'"" Jordan continued, as Taylor appeared to laugh. ""Ambassador, you weren't on the call, were you? You've never talked to Chief of Staff [Mick] Mulvaney? You've never met the president. ... And you're their star witness?""

Even CNN analyst Jeffrey Toobin noted that Democrats had a ""problem,"" in that their key witnesses Wednesday had never directly interacted with Trump. ""And, that's a problem if you're going to impeach the president,"" Toobin said.

Jordan also reminded viewers that President Obama had declined to provide lethal aid to Ukraine, even after Russia's invasion. Trump, on the other hand, eventually provided Javelin missiles. And, Ukraine's president has said he felt no pressure, improper or otherwise, from the Trump administration to engage in any investigations.

Trump, for his part, said he was too busy to watch on Wednesday and denied having such a phone call. ""First I've heard of it,"" he said when asked.

At a news conference with Turkey's leader, Trump vowed to release another transcript of an earlier call with Ukraine on Thursday. He called Democrats' efforts a hopeless ""witch hunt.""

The president pointed to Sondland's written testimony: ""The one thing I've seen that Sondland said, he did speak to me for a brief moment, he did speak to me for a brief moment -- [he testified previously that] I said, no 'quid pro quo,' under any circumstances, and that's true. In any event, it's more second-hand information. ... The only thing, and I guess Sondland has stayed with his testimony, that there was no quid-pro-quo, pure and simple.""

Media observers questioned whether the proceedings ultimately would sway any opinions, or make things any easier for moderate Democrats. ABC News' George Stephanopoulos mused on-air, ""part of me is wondering, what do facts matter anymore in these debates?""

Meanwhile, Christian Jacobs, 50, sat in a beach bar in St. Petersburg, wearing a fedora and reluctantly watching the drama on television, as The Associated Press put it.

""I did not want this,"" Jacobs, a Democrat, said, glancing at the TV and vaping. He said he had been leaning closer toward impeachment.

""I'm so afraid, left to his own devices, what else he may do,"" Jacobs said of Trump.

Anthony Harris, cutting hair in Savannah, Georgia, had the hearing on in his shop, but he said, ""It's gotten to the point now where people are even tired of listening.""

Lawmakers largely signaled that the hours of partisan back-and-forth did not appear to leave a singular moment etched in the public consciousness the way the Watergate proceedings or former President Clinton's impeachment did.

""No real surprises, no bombshells,"" said committee member Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah.

Taylor and Kent had defied White House instructions not to appear. Both received subpoenas.

They were among a dozen current and former officials who already testified behind closed doors. Wednesday was the start of days of public hearings expected to stretch into next week.

All day, the diplomats testified about how an ambassador was fired, the new Ukraine government was confused and they discovered an ""irregular channel"" -- a shadow U.S. foreign policy orchestrated by the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani which raised alarms in diplomatic and national-security circles.

For their part, Republican lawmakers observed that the president -- not unelected career bureaucrats -- dictated foreign policy.

At its core, the inquiry has stemmed from Trump’s July 25 phone call when he asked Zelensky for ""a favor.""

The White House already has released a transcript of the call, in which the two discussed past U.S. ""support"" for Ukraine, as well as Ukraine's issues with corruption. On the call, Trump asked Kiev to investigate reports that Ukraine was involved in 2016 election interference.

Later on, the president also mentioned former Vice President Joe Biden's push to have Ukraine's chief prosecutor fired, and suggested the country look into the matter.

The call came a day after former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's widely derided appearance on Capitol Hill appeared to leave Democrats' hopes for impeachment dashed.

Republicans are certain to argue that the request for Trump's taxes is yet another example of unreasonable scrutiny by Democrats frustrated with indications that Mueller's report will not doom Trump's presidency. One reason that the request appears to be comparatively narrow -- for returns between 2013 and 2018 -- could be to confine the search to the period immediately before and during Trump's political career and to stave off accusations that the Democrats are embarking on an illegitimate fishing expedition.

The drama threatens to draw in some key members of the Trump administration -- including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

Mnuchin said at a congressional hearing in March that he would ""comply with the law"" if asked to release Trump's returns -- though also suggested the final call could rest with the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service.

It is significant therefore that Neal's request was made to the IRS and not the Treasury.

It is certain that the President would see any decision by Mnuchin to get involved and comply with Neal's request as a flagrant personal betrayal.

Neal's gambit now puts Charles Rettig, the current IRS commissioner, who was nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate, in a delicate political position.

It is all but certain that the administration will take steps to challenge the Democratic interpretation of the law on which the request is based. Such a scenario could see the Ways and Means committee issue a subpoena after Neal's April 10 deadline and the unleashing of a complicated legal duel.

The fight could become a cause celebre that works its way through the court system and even reaches the Supreme Court, and the conservative majority that is newly restocked by Trump.

The committee spent weeks plotting its move in the hope of preparing the most complete case possible for the court battle to come.

Neal argued that he needed to see Trump's returns in order to properly consider legislation related to the IRS's practice of auditing sitting presidents.

""Under the Internal Revenue Manual, individual income tax returns of a President are subject to mandatory examination, but this practice is IRS policy and not codified in the Federal tax laws,"" Neal wrote in a letter to the IRS.

""It is necessary for the committee to determine the scope of any such examination and whether it includes a review of underlying business activities required to be reported on the individual income tax return.""

Trump has long seen scrutiny of his complicated and difficult to penetrate personal finances as a red line that should not be crossed.

In addition to Trump's personal records, Neal requested information from the President's business entities, including the Bedminster golf course LLC, as well as DJT Holdings LLC, DJT Holdings Managing Member LLC, DTTM Operations LLC, DTTM Operations Managing Member Cor, LFB Acquisition Member Corp and LFB Acquisition LLC.

Neal's request is specific and under the section of the IRS code that he is using only he, and not other chairmen of House committees can see the returns.

The House is holding a hearing on the U.S. response to the Ebola outbreak

Rep. Darrell Issa, the committee's chairman, said Klein declined to attend

One day after the fourth case of Ebola was diagnosed in the United States, lawmakers met with administration and public health officials in an already-scheduled congressional hearing to hash out some concerns about the handling of the deadly virus.

Here are four concerns raised in the hearing:

1. Why hire a lawyer? Ebola czar Ron Klain was invited to attend the hearing, but having started the job just this past week, he did not accept the invitation.

President Trump tweeted that he would “love” to have Mr. Sondland testify, but that the process was a “totally compromised kangaroo court.”

“Republican’s [sic] rights have been taken away,” he tweeted.

Who’s right? Here are three questions about this crucial procedural matter.

1. How does impeachment begin?

The Constitution vests impeachment powers in the House of Representatives. Beyond that, the House votes on its own procedural rules. That leaves lots of room for interpretation and leeway for alternate beginnings.

“The Constitution is very clear about impeachment, but it is also not specific,” says Matt Glassman, an expert on legislative procedure at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, in a recent podcast.

In the two presidential impeachments of the modern era, the House did have an official kickoff vote on a resolution authorizing the way ahead. That’s important precedent, and could make voters and Republican officials view the process as more serious.

2. Why hasn’t Speaker Pelosi put it to a vote?

There are both political and procedural reasons why Speaker Pelosi might not want to hold an impeachment-opening vote, or see it as necessary.

Drawing up such a resolution would be both difficult and politically risky. Democrats might find themselves divided over what to include. Should impeachment focus only on President Trump’s actions in regards to Ukraine, or should it refer back to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation or other controversial aspects of his presidency?

While moderate Democrats may feel the party has been driven to impeachment by presidential actions, that does not mean they want to take any more votes on it than they have to.

Speaker Pelosi may also be holding an impeachment-inquiry vote in reserve, in case she needs it to convince the courts to force the White House to turn over documents or testimony.

3. Why are Republicans pressing the matter?

The White House has its own procedural and political reasons for demanding a vote – which mirror those of House Democrats.

Republicans may want an impeachment vote to provide subpoena power to the House minority. That would allow them to carry out a parallel investigation of the actions of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden in Ukraine, or to call witnesses they feel could debunk charges made against President Trump.

In the Nixon and Clinton cases, the kickoff vote did provide such authority to minority members. In practice, however, its impact could be limited, as the actual issuance of subpoenas would likely still be subject to full committee votes in which Democrats would triumph.

Otherwise , it 'd be way too easy lapse into inextricable despair and , in some cases , moron-induced alcoholism .
In spite of the rapid dumbing-down of the GOP ( see also Mr. Trump ) , they continue to churn out more dummies .
Enter Kevin McCarthy . The Bakersfield , California Republican is the most likely conservative white-guy to ascend into John Boehner 's post as Speaker of the House . And he should n't have been allowed anywhere near Congress , much less a leadership post .
By now , we 're all aware of McCarthy 's admission that the congressional select committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks is almost exclusively designed to undermine Hillary Clinton 's presidential aspirations .
They say gaffes are merely the truths spoken out loud . This was certainly the case with McCarthy . By the way , we should underscore at this point how McCarthy is n't just another ambitious member of Congress . He 's the House Majority Leader . So , yes , the House Majority Leader accidentally spilled the beans on one of the longest running scams in congressional history -- one of the biggest wastes of taxpayer money since Ken Starr 's probe into President Clinton 's pants-parties .
That 's pretty bad . But McCarthy 's bad week did n't end there .
Either McCarthy is incapable of reading , or he has the worst speech-writing staff in the history of American politics -- and that includes Sarah Palin 's self-authored Patriotic Mad Libs . Three days after Boehner announced his resignation from Congress , McCarthy was propped up for a foreign policy speech before the John Hay Initiative . The ostensible goal was to burnish McCarthy 's political heft , but the exact opposite happened and , frankly , even the dumbest Republicans ought to be embarrassed to caucus with this idiot .
`` We must engage this war of radical Islam if our life depended on it . Because it does . ''
War of radical Islam ? `` On '' or `` against '' makes more sense , of course . And should n't it be `` lives '' and not `` life ? '' Honestly , the rest of the quotes will make this passage seem comparatively Shakespearean .
`` This 'safe zone ' would create a stem a flow of refugees ... Unlike during the surge in Iraq when Petraeus and Crocker had an effective politically strategy to match the military strategy . ''
There 's no such phrase as `` stem a flow . '' There 's something called `` stemflow . '' One can also stem the flow of something , which is possibly what he meant . But `` politically strategy '' is just ridiculous .
`` The absence of leadership over the past six years has had a horrific consequences all across the globe . ''
Was anyone fired for this ? How the hell is he still a contender for Speaker ?
`` In the past few years alone , I have visited Poland , Hungria , Estonia , Russia and Georgia ... ''
Hungria . Which is north of Freedonia and adjacent to that fake island where Balki from `` Perfect Strangers '' came from .
`` It defies belief that the president would allow the ban on Iranian oil exports to be lifted . And also stand by while Russia blackmails an entire continent , all the while keeping the place of the band on America . ''
I have no idea what any of that means . Which continent ? Let 's get real here : we should amend the Constitution so that when any elected politician mutilates the English language this badly , their desk chair turns into an ejector-seat that summarily launches them out of Congress . Let 's get on this now before it 's too late .
`` We do n't have the same as difficult decision that this White House is managing the decline and putting us in tough decisions for the future . ''
To be fair , gaffes are part of being a public figure . Spend enough time in front of a microphone and weird crap will inevitably fall out . However , a `` stem a flow '' of gaffes like this is inexcusable for a leader who 's stepping into an office that 's two heartbeats away from the presidency . Again , was it his speechwriter ? Was he unable to read the prepared remarks ? Why was he incapable of correcting the remarks on-the-fly ? Was he having a stroke ? Even the party of George W. Bush and Sarah Palin should , in a sane world , stand up and in a unified voice block this nincompoop from becoming Speaker . They wo n't , of course , and Boehner will likely hand his gavel over to the guy who , with a straight face , said he visited a place called `` Hungria . ''
The good news , on the other hand , is that we 'll all have another GOP doofus to kick around for a while . Silver linings , etc .
Ever since Karl Rove and the Bush administration systematically altered the political landscape making it perfectly acceptable to be completely incompetent and still get re-elected by low-information voters who think politicians should n't be any smarter than the people who elect them : we 've mostly settled for idiots . Sadly , the demystification of the presidency and electoral politics has convinced us that anyone can hold these jobs and that leaders should be `` just like us . ''
Sorry , but the guy you might want to have a beer with should n't control the nuclear launch codes or the destiny of the free world . We should demand leaders who are devastatingly smart , engaged , disciplined , centered and intellectually curious . We should be gravitationally drawn to leaders with impeccable schooling and robust speaking skills . The salient question is this : Why do n't Republicans want the same ? Why are they so willing to settle for feckless trolls like Donald Trump or marble-mouthed dilettantes like Kevin McCarthy ? It might be somewhat acceptable if they actually took responsibility for putting us all in tough decisions for the future , but the party of personal responsibility will never do that . And it ’ s hurting America .","We get it. It's too easy to tease certain Republicans for being, to put it politely, intellectually disengaged -- even though it's too often irresistible to go there.

Enter Kevin McCarthy. The Bakersfield, California Republican is the most likely conservative white-guy to ascend into John Boehner's post as Speaker of the House. And he shouldn't have been allowed anywhere near Congress, much less a leadership post.

By now, we're all aware of McCarthy's admission that the congressional select committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks is almost exclusively designed to undermine Hillary Clinton's presidential aspirations.

They say gaffes are merely the truths spoken out loud. This was certainly the case with McCarthy. By the way, we should underscore at this point how McCarthy isn't just another ambitious member of Congress. He's the House Majority Leader. So, yes, the House Majority Leader accidentally spilled the beans on one of the longest running scams in congressional history -- one of the biggest wastes of taxpayer money since Ken Starr's probe into President Clinton's pants-parties.

That's pretty bad. But McCarthy's bad week didn't end there.

Either McCarthy is incapable of reading, or he has the worst speech-writing staff in the history of American politics -- and that includes Sarah Palin's self-authored Patriotic Mad Libs. Three days after Boehner announced his resignation from Congress, McCarthy was propped up for a foreign policy speech before the John Hay Initiative. The ostensible goal was to burnish McCarthy's political heft, but the exact opposite happened and, frankly, even the dumbest Republicans ought to be embarrassed to caucus with this idiot.

Here are some highlights:

""We must engage this war of radical Islam if our life depended on it. Because it does.""

War of radical Islam? ""On"" or ""against"" makes more sense, of course. And shouldn't it be ""lives"" and not ""life?"" Honestly, the rest of the quotes will make this passage seem comparatively Shakespearean.

""This 'safe zone' would create a stem a flow of refugees... Unlike during the surge in Iraq when Petraeus and Crocker had an effective politically strategy to match the military strategy.""

There's no such phrase as ""stem a flow."" There's something called ""stemflow."" One can also stem the flow of something, which is possibly what he meant. But ""politically strategy"" is just ridiculous.

""We have isolated Israel, while bolding places like Iran.""

It's emboldening. Who's responsible for this crap?

""The absence of leadership over the past six years has had a horrific consequences all across the globe.""

Was anyone fired for this? How the hell is he still a contender for Speaker?

""In the past few years alone, I have visited Poland, Hungria, Estonia, Russia and Georgia...""

Hungria. Which is north of Freedonia and adjacent to that fake island where Balki from ""Perfect Strangers"" came from.

""It defies belief that the president would allow the ban on Iranian oil exports to be lifted. And also stand by while Russia blackmails an entire continent, all the while keeping the place of the band on America.""

I have no idea what any of that means. Which continent? Let's get real here: we should amend the Constitution so that when any elected politician mutilates the English language this badly, their desk chair turns into an ejector-seat that summarily launches them out of Congress. Let's get on this now before it's too late.

""We don't have the same as difficult decision that this White House is managing the decline and putting us in tough decisions for the future.""

Um. Huh?

To be fair, gaffes are part of being a public figure. Spend enough time in front of a microphone and weird crap will inevitably fall out. However, a ""stem a flow"" of gaffes like this is inexcusable for a leader who's stepping into an office that's two heartbeats away from the presidency. Again, was it his speechwriter? Was he unable to read the prepared remarks? Why was he incapable of correcting the remarks on-the-fly? Was he having a stroke? Even the party of George W. Bush and Sarah Palin should, in a sane world, stand up and in a unified voice block this nincompoop from becoming Speaker. They won't, of course, and Boehner will likely hand his gavel over to the guy who, with a straight face, said he visited a place called ""Hungria.""

The good news, on the other hand, is that we'll all have another GOP doofus to kick around for a while. Silver linings, etc.

Ever since Karl Rove and the Bush administration systematically altered the political landscape making it perfectly acceptable to be completely incompetent and still get re-elected by low-information voters who think politicians shouldn't be any smarter than the people who elect them: we've mostly settled for idiots. Sadly, the demystification of the presidency and electoral politics has convinced us that anyone can hold these jobs and that leaders should be ""just like us.""

Sorry, but the guy you might want to have a beer with shouldn't control the nuclear launch codes or the destiny of the free world. We should demand leaders who are devastatingly smart, engaged, disciplined, centered and intellectually curious. We should be gravitationally drawn to leaders with impeccable schooling and robust speaking skills. The salient question is this: Why don't Republicans want the same? Why are they so willing to settle for feckless trolls like Donald Trump or marble-mouthed dilettantes like Kevin McCarthy? It might be somewhat acceptable if they actually took responsibility for putting us all in tough decisions for the future, but the party of personal responsibility will never do that.

House Speaker Paul Ryan described the proposal , which lowers the number of tax brackets from seven to four and increases the standard deduction , as a series of tax cuts and breaks aimed at helping most Americans .
`` It 's very clear and obvious that the whole purpose of this is a middle-class tax cut , '' Ryan said in an interview with CNN 's Phil Mattingly , shortly after the bill was made public . `` And more to the point , we need to get faster economic growth . ''
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said during Republicans ' news conference that the tax bill `` has President ( Donald ) Trump 's full support . ''
The President issued a statement applauding the bill 's release but added `` there is much work left to do . '' Trump later told reporters in the Oval Office that a tax reform bill will be done `` before Christmas , '' calling it `` one of the great Christmas presents . ''
However , not all Republicans were happy . Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York tweeted that he planned to vote no on the bill in its current form , citing the proposal 's elimination of the deduction for state and local taxes , also known as SALT .
`` I am a NO to House # TaxReform bill in its current form . A lot of good aspects , but its not there yet , '' he tweeted , linking to a longer statement
According to the bill , individuals would still be able to deduct their local and state property taxes but only up to $ 10,000 .
For that reason , the legislation has struck a nerve with other New York and New Jersey Republicans . Brady already made a key concession when he said that he said he would still allow individuals to deduct their property taxes in the new bill . But that was n't enough for some who wanted to see the income deduction restored as well .
The bill , called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , would permanently lower the corporate tax rate to 20 % and limit the home interest deduction to loans up to $ 500,000 . The bill would also increase the standard deduction for individuals and households , repeal the alternative minimum tax and increase the child tax credit to $ 1,600 . The House GOP bill would also repeal the estate tax in 2024 .
According to another source in the GOP meeting , Brady started his tax presentation with a quote from Ronald Reagan , the last President to sign a massive tax reform bill .
`` I feel like we just played the World Series of Tax Reform and the American people won , '' Brady said , quoting remarks Reagan made when signing his tax overhaul from the 1980s . Brady is a Texas Republican whose Houston Astros won the World Series just hours before .
Despite the optimistic tone set by GOP leaders , there are still key questions about what will be in the bill and whether the leadership can wrangle the votes they will need to deliver President Donald Trump a major legislative victory by the end of the year .
Now , the hard work begins of both selling the bill and keeping special interests at bay . Many lobbyists on K Street and outside groups admit the GOP lawmakers have kept a tight lid on the process . Once groups see what has been cut and what has been saved , winners and losers will be defined and the fight to preserve valuable tax breaks will begin . Over the weekend , one group , the National Association of Home Builders , already came out against the not-even-released bill .
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , a California Republican , notes he 's from a state with high state and local taxes and says lawmakers pushing for changes need to take a broader look at how the reform package will benefit their constituents .
`` What 's happening is people are looking at this as one item instead of looking at everything we are doing , lowering the rate , doubling the standard deduction , '' McCarthy told CNN . `` You 're better off with this . ''
In advance of the bill 's release , some Republicans were already criticizing the details . On Thursday , Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted that the $ 600 proposed child tax credit increase in the House 's tax reform plan was n't enough .
`` House # TaxReform plan is only starting point.But $ 600 # ChildTaxCredit increase does n't achieve our & @ POTUS goal of helping working families , '' he wrote .
During a conversation with reporters last Wednesday , Rubio said a $ 2,000 child tax credit was necessary to provide tangible relief to middle-class families . In 2015 , Rubio , joined by Republican Sen. Mike Lee , proposed a child tax credit worth $ 2,500 per child .
Republican leaders have argued that the party learned valuable lessons from the health care debate that crashed and burned in the Senate this summer .
But , already , the GOP encountered a setback Tuesday with deadlines when Brady announced that the bill 's release would be delayed by a single day . Some members also fear the GOP 's tax effort in the House has shared some frustrating parallels with Obamacare repeal .
For one , Republicans are spooked by the ambitious timeline that has been laid out by their leadership . Members are expecting to get a massive tax bill Thursday only to turn around and amend it in committee days later .
`` We started differently on tax reform than we did health care , but I hope that we do n't end up back on the same tracks that led us to the debacle on health care , '' said Rep. Mark Walker , the chairman of the Republican Study Committee . `` We know this is going to be hundreds of pages and being able to take the time to process it fairly is something that is crucial . ''
Another twist that came up in the hours before the bill was released came from Trump himself .
The President tweeted Wednesday morning that he wanted to see a repeal of the individual mandate in the tax bill , a move that many House and Senate republicans openly admitted would complicate the process .
`` Would n't it be great to Repeal the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate in ObamaCare and use those savings for further Tax Cuts for the Middle Class . The House and Senate should consider ASAP as the process of final approval moves along . Push Biggest Tax Cuts EVER , '' Trump wrote in a series of two consecutive tweets

“After the election, it ought to garner more serious commentary, evaluation and judicial review,” said Todd Gaziano of the Pacific Legal Foundation. “It can have some very helpful consequences for a principle that I think liberals and conservatives should both be concerned about, and that is the president’s unilateral authority to rewrite a statute in dozens of ways.”",www.politico.com,left,ScNwsjv372d7uSdU

Initial reaction to Pelosi’s plan was negative from House and Senate Republicans, many of whom are not keen on letting the government negotiate prices, viewing it as price fixing.

After Pelosi unveiled her proposal, Trump said on Twitter he liked an alternative authored by Republican Senator Chuck Grassley “very much.” But Trump also said it was “great to see” Pelosi’s bill and he urged a bipartisan approach.

It was unclear how much support Pelosi’s proposal will receive ahead of the November 2020 presidential and congressional election. Healthcare costs are a top issue for Democrats campaigning for their party’s nomination.

“We hope to have White House buy-in, because that seems to be the root to getting any votes in the United States Senate, and we want as strong a bipartisan vote as we can in the House and the Senate,” Pelosi told a news conference.

Americans pay the highest prices for prescription drugs in the world. Most other developed nations have single-payer systems with their governments negotiating prices. Trump has slammed lower drug prices abroad as “global freeloading.”

Pelosi’s proposal would allow the U.S. government every year to negotiate prices on at least 25 of the 250 most costly drugs that lack competition, a summary of the bill said. The lower prices would be available to all U.S. consumers, not just the government’s Medicare program for the elderly. Companies that refuse to negotiate would face monetary penalties.

Democrats promised to curb prescription drug prices during last year’s congressional election campaign, when they captured the majority in the House of Representatives.

Trump has also promised to lower prices but has been struggling to deliver on that before the 2020 election.

‘PAINFUL’ PENALTIES

Drug companies that refuse to negotiate would have to pay a “non-compliance fee starting at 65 percent of the gross sales of the drug in question,” the bill summary said. This would increase by 10% every quarter up to a maximum of 95%. Pelosi said penalties had to be “painful” in order to work.

The plan set an upper limit for negotiated prices as no more than 120% of the volume-weighted average of the prices paid in six other countries: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and Britain.

The price index provision could be aimed at getting White House support, since the Trump administration has said it is working on a similar rule on some Medicare drug prices.

Grassley urged senators to back the drug pricing bill he authored together with Democrat Ron Wyden as the “moderate” alternative to Pelosi’s approach.

The drug industry lobbying group PhRMA said Pelosi’s plan “would end the current market based system that has made the United States the global leader in developing innovative, lifesaving treatments and cures.”

The Pelosi proposal threads the needle between moderate and more left-leaning Democrats in the House, but is too liberal for the Republican-led Senate, said Dan Mendelson, founder of healthcare consultancy Avalere Health.

Some progressive Democrats want changes in the bill.

Here are the key takeaways from Hill's testimony:

Bolton was 'furious' about the push for Ukraine investigations

Hill told the House impeachment inquiry committees that Bolton was angry over efforts to arrange a White House meeting between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in exchange for political investigations.

Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, was part of a meeting with Ukrainian officials in July. At one point, he leaned across Bolton to speak to the Ukrainians, and said that a White House meeting had already been secured, according to Hill.

“Ambassador Sondland blurted out: ‘Well, we have an agreement with the Chief of Staff (Mick Mulvaney) for a meeting if these investigations in the energy sector start,"" Hill said.

Bolton then ""immediately stiffened"" and ended the meeting abruptly, but told Hill to participate in a subsequent meeting to determine plans between the countries for going forward.

“And that’s when Bolton was just, you know, I wouldn’t say apoplectic, but pretty furious,” Hill said.

Hill said she cautioned Sondland in a follow-up conversation against making the commitment for the White House meeting: “It has to go through proper procedures.”

After the meeting, Bolton told Hill to report the incident to National Security Council lawyer John Eisenberg. ""I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,"" Bolton told Hill to relay, according to the transcript.

Giuliani's 'whirlwind' of Ukraine claims

Hill confirmed that key administration officials were so in the dark about Giuliani’s involvement in Ukraine that they learned what he was up to by watching his frequent appearances on television.

“Every single day, it seemed that he was on television, you know, basically spouting off, you know, one thing after another,” Hill told House investigators.

“And it was clearly starting to create this, you know, meta-alternate narrative about Ukraine,"" Hill said. She called the information Giuliani was pushing through the media a ""whirlwind.""

Giuliani's spreading of accusations against former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch is also documented in the testimony of other officials who have been deposed in the impeachment inquiry, including that of State Department official George Kent. Giuliani helped push the claim that Yovanovitch was undermining the president.

Gordon Sondland's activities were 'deeply concerning'

Yovanovitch's ouster was ""some kind of tipping point or turning point,"" Hill said, ""because it was after she was removed from her position that you started to see, you know, more of this activity.""

Hill testified that an unusual chain of command opened up in Ukraine policy, with several officials ""doing all kinds of things that were not in their portfolio.""

Hill was 'shocked' by Trump's call with Zelensky

Hill left her position days before the now infamous July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky. She testified that she was on vacation — snorkeling, to be precise — at the time of the phone call.

Hill and Republican questioners butt heads

The GOP committee members and their counsel who questioned Hill seemed to frustrate her over questions about whether she had a partisan bias.

Rep. Trey Gowdy ’ s decision to seek a review of the materials , first highlighted in a series of ███ stories last week , carries consequences for the 2016 election in which Mrs. Clinton is expected to seek the presidency . It could also move the committee to examine the strained relationship between the State Department and Pentagon , which sharply disagreed over the 2011 war in Libya and the response to the terrorist attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi a year later .
The Times reported last week that U.S. intelligence did not support Mrs. Clinton ’ s story of an impending genocide in Libya that she used to sell the war against Moammar Gadhafi ’ s regime . The newspaper also unveiled secretly recorded tapes from Libya that showed that the Pentagon and Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich so distrusted her stewardship of the war that they opened their own diplomatic channels with the Gadhafi regime .
The tapes included candid conversations and allegations that Mrs. Clinton took the U.S. to war on false pretenses and was not listening to the advice of military commanders or career intelligence officers .
“ Chairman Gowdy and the committee are aware of the details reported by The ███ , and we are reviewing them as part of the committee ’ s inquiry into Benghazi , ” Benghazi Committee spokesman Jamal Ware announced Monday .
The emergence of the tapes and a new line of inquiry immediately had repercussions , especially on the political front where the 2016 president race has heated up .
Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky , a 2016 GOP hopeful who has been intensely critical of Mrs. Clinton ’ s handling of the 2011 Libya intervention , said the stories demonstrate she is not the right person to lead the country or the nation ’ s military .
“ Hillary ’ s judgment has to be questioned – her eagerness for war in Libya should preclude her from being considered the next Commander in Chief , ” said Sen. Paul , who opposed the Libyan intervention at the onset .
“ We want someone in that office with wisdom and better judgment… We created chaos in Libya – as a result many arms have gone to Syria which are now aiding jihadi terrorists . I couldn ’ t fathom how Hillary Clinton could become Commander and Chief after this , ” he added .
Mrs. Clinton ’ s spokesman have declined any comment about the tapes .
The Times reported that on one of the tapes , a Pentagon liaison told a Gadhafi aide that Army Gen. Charles Jacoby , a top aide to Adm. Mullen , “ does not trust the reports that are coming out of the State Department and CIA , but there ’ s nothing he can do about it , ” the Pentagon liaison said , offering a candid assessment of tensions within the Obama administration .
“ I can tell you that the President is not getting accurate information so at some point someone has to get accurate information to him… I think about a way through former Secretary Gates or maybe to Admiral Mullen to get him information . ”
Rep. Ted Poe , R-Texas , chairman of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Crime , Terrorism , Homeland Security and Investigations , said the Pentagon ’ s actions were “ highly unusual , ” but said that it would make sense for the Pentagon to want to make sure their Commander in Chief was getting accurate information .
“ I think it ’ s unusual to have the military say wait a minute , that ’ s not true , ” Mr. Poe said in a telephone interview with the Times . “ You have a false report from the Secretary of State , and then the military holding a completely different view of what ’ s taking place .
“ They wanted [ the president ] to have facts – facts as opposed to what Secretary Clinton was hoping the facts would be ; that Moammar Gadhafi was killing innocent women and children . That was was a false narrative . So , it would make sense that they would want to get that information straight to the president and not go through the Secretary of State , ” he added
In reaction to the Times final installment of the series on Monday , which revealed secret Libyan intelligence reports that linked NATO supported rebels to al-Qaeda , Rep. Louie Gohmert said the news was not a complete surprise .
“ During the Obama-Clinton hunger to enter a bombing war in Libya , some of us knew the rebels included al-Qaeda but we did not know the full extent of their involvement , ” he said . “ So we pleaded for U.S. restraint . With bombing in their heart and radical Islamists whispering in their ears , the Obama-Clinton team would not even entertain offers of a ceasefire and peaceful transition of power . While acting under U.N. approval to prevent atrocities , it appears the Obama-Clinton bombing barrages caused atrocities that sent a country into chaos which is continuing today . ”
The Times series about the Libyan intervention was also picked up across the Atlantic .
Britain ’ s Daily Mail described the story as “ stunning ” declaring that , “ [ Sec . ] Clinton will face tough questions about her march to war against Moammar Gadhafi if she runs for president . ”
Mr. Poe said that he believes the series will prompt new questions , especially with the current state of military and political affairs in Libya .
“ As far as I ’ m concerned Benghazi is not going away , ” Mr. Poe said . “ That the U.S. would give in and arm rebels and criminals to overthrow Col. Gadhafi , and then mislead the world on that is shameful . We now have chaos in Libya… it ’ s the U.S. ’ undoing of a country . Gadhafi was no saint , but what we have now are gangsters and jihadists running the country . We have chaos because the US intervened in a deceitful way .
“ Unfortunately , the administration is making more of an effort to protect Hillary Clinton ’ s involvement than they are in finding out the truth about what was really behind the overthrow of Gaddafi by the U.S . ”","The chairman of a special House committee created to investigate the 2012 Benghazi tragedy on Monday instructed his staff to review secretly recorded tapes and intelligence reports that detail Hillary Rodham Clinton’s role in advocating and executing the war in Libya, opening the door for a possible expansion of his probe.

Rep. Trey Gowdy’s decision to seek a review of the materials, first highlighted in a series of Washington Times stories last week, carries consequences for the 2016 election in which Mrs. Clinton is expected to seek the presidency. It could also move the committee to examine the strained relationship between the State Department and Pentagon, which sharply disagreed over the 2011 war in Libya and the response to the terrorist attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi a year later.

The Times reported last week that U.S. intelligence did not support Mrs. Clinton’s story of an impending genocide in Libya that she used to sell the war against Moammar Gadhafi’s regime. The newspaper also unveiled secretly recorded tapes from Libya that showed that the Pentagon and Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich so distrusted her stewardship of the war that they opened their own diplomatic channels with the Gadhafi regime.

The tapes included candid conversations and allegations that Mrs. Clinton took the U.S. to war on false pretenses and was not listening to the advice of military commanders or career intelligence officers.

“Chairman Gowdy and the committee are aware of the details reported by The Washington Times, and we are reviewing them as part of the committee’s inquiry into Benghazi,” Benghazi Committee spokesman Jamal Ware announced Monday.

The emergence of the tapes and a new line of inquiry immediately had repercussions, especially on the political front where the 2016 president race has heated up.

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a 2016 GOP hopeful who has been intensely critical of Mrs. Clinton’s handling of the 2011 Libya intervention, said the stories demonstrate she is not the right person to lead the country or the nation’s military.

“Hillary’s judgment has to be questioned – her eagerness for war in Libya should preclude her from being considered the next Commander in Chief,” said Sen. Paul, who opposed the Libyan intervention at the onset.

“We want someone in that office with wisdom and better judgment… We created chaos in Libya – as a result many arms have gone to Syria which are now aiding jihadi terrorists. I couldn’t fathom how Hillary Clinton could become Commander and Chief after this,” he added.

Mrs. Clinton’s spokesman have declined any comment about the tapes.

Miller,"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler on Monday put a fine point on Democrats ’ impeachment case against President Trump , arguing that the president put himself before the country .
“ We surely agree that no public official , including and especially the president of the United States , should use his public office for private gain , ” he said at the opening of an evidentiary hearing before his committee .
Based on the evidence presented , the committee will proceed to write articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump .
Mr. Nadler , New York Democrat , called the process a “ solemn and serious undertaking ” that Congress must engage in to address serious threats to America ’ s institutions , such as “ free and fair elections . ”
He said both sides should be able to agree on the fact of the case if Republicans would remove “ their blinders . ”
“ We agree that no president should put himself before the country , ” Mr. Nadler said . “ The Constitution and his oath of office , his promise to American citizens , require the country ’ s president to put the country first . ”
Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing and denounced the House impeachment drive as a partisan “ sham . ”
The articles of impeachment are expected to include charges of abuse of power , bribery and obstructing the congressional probe , all of which stem from Mr. Trump asking Ukraine to investigate political rival Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter .
Republicans argue that Mr. Trump ’ s action , though unconventional , did not cross the line into criminality . They ’ ve also vouched for the legitimacy of investigating Hunter Biden , who landed a $ 50,000-a-month job on a Ukraine natural gas company , while his father was the point man for Obama White House policy in that graft-riddled country .
The impeachment case stems from a July 25 phone call in which Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky for a “ favor ” in investigating the Bidens and Ukraine meddling in the 2016 election .
A whistleblower , who is believed to be a CIA official assigned to the White House , accused the president of abusing his power for personal gain on the call , including withholding $ 391 million of U.S. military aid from Ukraine as leverage .
A rough transcript of the call the White House released in late September did not show the president present a quid pro quo deal for the investigations , but Democrats have argued the threat was understood and part of an ongoing pressure campaign of “ shadow ” foreign policy conducted by Mr. Trump ’ s private lawyer , former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani .
The quid pro quo , a Latin term meaning a transaction of “ this for that , ” is the crux of the Democrats ’ case that Mr. Trump engaged in a bribery or extortion scheme that warrants impeachment .
The Judiciary Committee is reviewing evidence gathered by an inquiry led by the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence . Much of the evidence was presented in two weeks of public hearings last month .
The most powerful testimony yet in the inquiry came from Gordon Sondland , the ambassador to the European Union , who said he offered a quid pro quo of a prized White House visit for the newly-elected Mr. Zelensky for the investigations . But Mr. Sondland said he “ presumed ” that was what Mr. Trump wanted .
In his only conversation with the president about it , Mr. Trump told him that there was “ no quid pro quo , ” Mr. Sondland testified .
None of the witnesses in the impeachment inquiry linked the holdup of military assistance to the investigations or provided a reason for the holdup . The aid was delayed for about two months , before the money started to flow to Ukraine on Sept. 11 , two days after the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community informed Congress of the whistleblower complaint .
Mr. Trump has acknowledged that he wanted an investigation into alleged corruption involving Mr. Biden and his son Hunter , who landed a high-paying job on the board of Ukraine natural gas company Burisma Holdings in 2014 . At the time , his father was the point man for Obama White House policy in the country , which is notorious for corruption , especially in the energy industry .

The prosecutor was widely viewed as not doing enough to combat corruption . But the prosecutor , Viktor Shokin , also had looked into corruption allegations against Burisma and Mykola Zlochevsky , the Ukraine oligarch running the company .

us_house,Reuters,1,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-antisemitism/debate-over-anti-semitism-charges-exposes-divide-in-democratic-party-idUSKCN1QO2N7,Debate over anti-Semitism charges exposes divide in Democratic Party,2019-03-08,Amanda Becker,"WASHINGTON ( ███ ) - The U.S. House of Representatives approved a broad resolution condemning bigotry on Thursday after remarks by a Democratic member that some viewed as anti-Semitic exposed an ideological and generational rift in the party .
Some Democrats , including several U.S. senators who are seeking the party ’ s 2020 presidential nomination , warned that party leaders were playing into Republicans ’ hands and had stymied legitimate debate over U.S.-Israel policy .
The House , which is controlled by Democrats , approved the resolution condemning anti-Semitism , anti-Muslim discrimination and other forms of bigotry by a 407-to-23 vote .
The vote came less than a week after Representative Ilhan Omar , one of the two first Muslim women elected to Congress , made statements at a Washington event that were denounced by some as anti-Semitic .
The resolution does not mention Omar by name . But Republicans have seized on Omar ’ s statements and the resulting intra-party conflict as a sign the Democratic Party is fractured .
Many Democrats , in turn , have said House leaders were cowed by a Republican effort to divert attention from bigotry within their own ranks and that Omar is being held to a different standard .
“ Unfortunately , I think the Democratic leadership here has made what I think is a pretty serious mistake in caving to this pressure , ” said Democratic strategist Peter Daou , who has advised Hillary Clinton and John Kerry .
The disagreement began after Omar , in an appearance at a Washington book store , said she feared that statements she and fellow Representative Rashida Tlaib made about foreign policy and the pro-Israel lobbying group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) would be viewed as anti-Semitic because they are Muslim .
“ I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it ’ s OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country . I want to ask why is it OK for me to talk about the influence of the NRA ( National Rifle Association ) , of fossil fuel industries or Big Pharma , and not talk about a powerful lobbying group that is influencing policies ? ” Omar said .
Omar ’ s critics denounced the statement as playing into the anti-Semitic trope that Jewish Americans are loyal to Israel over the United States . Omar said opposing the policies of Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not synonymous with anti-Semitism .
Omar , in a joint statement issued after Thursday ’ s vote with Tlaib and Representative Andre Carson , a Democrat from Indiana , said “ we are tremendously proud to be part of a body that has put forth a condemnation of all forms of bigotry . ”
Omar had previously apologized for February tweets that her critics said suggested Jewish Americans used money to influence pro-Israel U.S. policies .
Representative Liz Cheney , the No . 3 House Republican , told reporters on Wednesday that Omar “ embodies a vile , hate-filled , anti-Semitic , anti-Israel bigotry . ”
President Donald Trump on Twitter on Wednesday called the Democratic response “ shameful . ”
Cheney , complaining that the House should have “ rebuked ” Omar by name and removed her from the Foreign Affairs Committee , voted against the resolution .
Other Republicans who voted no , such as Chris Collins of New York , said the bill was not “ strong enough in support of Israel , the only true democracy in the Middle East . ”
Republican Representative Steve King , who was condemned by the House in January for questioning why white supremacy is considered offensive , voted present .
Democrats had been divided over how best to handle Omar ’ s comments .
Democratic Representative Eliot Engel , who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee , said he welcomes policy debate but that it was “ deeply offensive to call into question the loyalty of fellow American citizens because of their political views , including the U.S.-Israel relationship . ”

That ’ s something we have to grapple with , ” Daou said .","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives approved a broad resolution condemning bigotry on Thursday after remarks by a Democratic member that some viewed as anti-Semitic exposed an ideological and generational rift in the party.

Some Democrats, including several U.S. senators who are seeking the party’s 2020 presidential nomination, warned that party leaders were playing into Republicans’ hands and had stymied legitimate debate over U.S.-Israel policy.

The House, which is controlled by Democrats, approved the resolution condemning anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim discrimination and other forms of bigotry by a 407-to-23 vote.

The vote came less than a week after Representative Ilhan Omar, one of the two first Muslim women elected to Congress, made statements at a Washington event that were denounced by some as anti-Semitic.

The resolution does not mention Omar by name. But Republicans have seized on Omar’s statements and the resulting intra-party conflict as a sign the Democratic Party is fractured.

Many Democrats, in turn, have said House leaders were cowed by a Republican effort to divert attention from bigotry within their own ranks and that Omar is being held to a different standard.

“Unfortunately, I think the Democratic leadership here has made what I think is a pretty serious mistake in caving to this pressure,” said Democratic strategist Peter Daou, who has advised Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.

The disagreement began after Omar, in an appearance at a Washington book store, said she feared that statements she and fellow Representative Rashida Tlaib made about foreign policy and the pro-Israel lobbying group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) would be viewed as anti-Semitic because they are Muslim.

“I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it’s OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country. I want to ask why is it OK for me to talk about the influence of the NRA (National Rifle Association), of fossil fuel industries or Big Pharma, and not talk about a powerful lobbying group that is influencing policies?” Omar said.

Omar’s critics denounced the statement as playing into the anti-Semitic trope that Jewish Americans are loyal to Israel over the United States. Omar said opposing the policies of Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not synonymous with anti-Semitism.

Omar, in a joint statement issued after Thursday’s vote with Tlaib and Representative Andre Carson, a Democrat from Indiana, said “we are tremendously proud to be part of a body that has put forth a condemnation of all forms of bigotry.”

Omar had previously apologized for February tweets that her critics said suggested Jewish Americans used money to influence pro-Israel U.S. policies.

Representative Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, told reporters on Wednesday that Omar “embodies a vile, hate-filled, anti-Semitic, anti-Israel bigotry.”

President Donald Trump on Twitter on Wednesday called the Democratic response “shameful.”

Cheney, complaining that the House should have “rebuked” Omar by name and removed her from the Foreign Affairs Committee, voted against the resolution.

Other Republicans who voted no, such as Chris Collins of New York, said the bill was not “strong enough in support of Israel, the only true democracy in the Middle East.”

Republican Representative Steve King, who was condemned by the House in January for questioning why white supremacy is considered offensive, voted present.

Democrats had been divided over how best to handle Omar’s comments.

Democratic Representative Eliot Engel, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, said he welcomes policy debate but that it was “deeply offensive to call into question the loyalty of fellow American citizens because of their political views, including the U.S.-Israel relationship.”

Young, progressive House newcomers like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and several Democratic presidential candidates, however, came to Omar’s defense.

Adam Schiff said Sunday the whistleblower at the center of a growing scandal surrounding President Donald Trump will testify before the House Intelligence Committee “ very soon . ”
That whistleblower filed a formal complaint alleging Trump attempted to use “ the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election. ” Reporting identified that country as Ukraine and the solicitation to be a request to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden , who is currently a Democratic candidate for president .
Trump has acknowledged asking Ukrainian leaders to investigate Biden , arguing — without evidence — the former vice president worked to shield his son , Hunter Biden , from corruption investigations in that country . The White House has released a rough transcript of a conversation between Trump and Ukraine ’ s president that contains the request , but Trump maintains he has not done anything wrong .

Schiff said on ABC ’ s This Week that he expects the whistleblower to share information helpful to the committee ’ s ongoing investigation . “ That whistleblower will be allowed to come in without a minder from the Justice Department or from the White House to tell the whistleblower what they can and can not say ; we ’ ll get the unfiltered testimony . ”

The whistleblower — whose identity remains largely hidden — has signaled that he is open to testifying before both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees ; Schiff said that while he and his colleagues are working to ensure the testimony happens “ very soon , ” they are doing so at a cautious pace to protect the whistleblower ’ s confidentiality , particularly in light of comments Trump made to staffers while at the UN on Thursday that were interpreted by some as a suggestion the whistleblower and those that contributed information to the complaint ought to be executed . Schiff also said the committee must wait for the acting director of national intelligence to issue security clearances to the whistleblower ’ s lawyers .
The whistleblower ’ s testimony could answer lingering questions raised by the complaint
A September letter from the intelligence community ’ s inspector general to Rep. Adam Schiff , chair of the House Intelligence Committee , said the whistleblower ’ s complaint “ relates to one of the most significant and important of the [ director of national intelligence ’ s ] responsibilities to the American people . ”
It has since been released , first to members of Congress and then in redacted form to the public . Many congresspeople called it troubling , with Rep. Mike Quigley ( D-IL ) saying it “ reinforces our concerns ” and is “ deeply disturbing. ” After reviewing the document , Sen. Ben Sasse ( R-NE ) said , “ Republicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons to say there ’ s no there there when there ’ s obviously lots that ’ s very troubling there. ” A number of the complaint ’ s allegations — including its central claim that Trump asked a foreign government to investigate a rival — seemed to be corroborated by a memo the White House released of a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky .
Democrats were concerned after reading reports of the complaint ’ s contents that Trump attempted to coerce Zelensky into investigating Biden by withholding military aid the country needs to fight Russian aggressors . Despite having been approved by Congress , that aid was repeatedly frozen ahead of Trump ’ s call with Zelensky and only finally released in September .
The whistleblower ’ s complaint did not say definitely whether its author had evidence Trump froze the aid for quid pro quo purposes ; the president has strongly denied doing so , but the timing of the delay and the fact that , in the rough transcript provided by the White House , Trump asks Zelensky to do him a “ favor ” — right after the Ukrainian president brings up weapons — has led Trump ’ s critics to question his motives . When the whistleblower testifies , Democrats on Schiff ’ s committee will likely try to gain information about this element of the scandal and work to extract leads from the whistleblower that might allow them to confirm or refute allegations of quid pro quo .
Both Democrats and Republicans on the committee will also be interested in hearing about the sources the whistleblower used to compile their report . The complaint cites “ White House officials ” as being the actual source of the information the whistleblower used to support his allegations . In television appearances and in statements to the press , many Republicans have argued the fact the whistleblower did not personally witness any of the wrongdoing outlined in the complaint invalidates the entire document .
For example , Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R-IA ) told ███ , “ What ’ s concerning to me is it ’ s based upon secondhand and third-hand reports ... so you got to get more facts behind it ; ” Sunday , Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-SC ) called the allegations “ hearsay . ”
Questions have also been raised about the whistleblower ’ s political affiliation , with Republicans arguing the individual is biased ; on CNN ’ s State of the Union Sunday , Rep. Jim Jordan ( R-OH ) referred to the whistleblower as “ a bureaucrat who didn ’ t like the president ” in reference to a letter the intelligence community ’ s inspector general sent to the acting director of national intelligence that read : “ Although the [ inspector general of the intelligence community ’ s ] preliminary review identified some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival candidate , such evidence did not change my determination that the complaint relating to the urgent concern ‘ appears credible . ’ ”
The second part of that statement has largely been ignored by the president ’ s defenders , and it is not clear what the inspector general meant by rival candidate — whether that referred to a Republican rival in the 2016 primary like Sen. Marco Rubio or whether it refers to support for a Democrat like Joe Biden .

‘BALONEY’

It has been 20 years since Americans last witnessed impeachment proceedings, when Republicans brought charges against Democratic President Bill Clinton arising from a sexual relationship he had with a White House intern. He was acquitted in the Senate.

After weeks of investigation into Trump’s request that Ukraine investigate Biden and his businessman son, Hunter Biden, the committee is focused on two articles charging Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

Democrats have accused Trump of abusing his power by withholding $391 million in security aid to Ukraine - a vulnerable U.S. ally facing Russian aggression - and holding back a coveted White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as leverage to pressure Kiev into investigating the Bidens.

us_house,The Hill,1,http://thehill.com/homenews/house/317473-democrats-plot-protest-for-trumps-speech-to-congress,Democrats plot protest for Trump’s speech to Congress,2017-02-02,,"House Democrats are rallying behind a plan to make President Trump ’ s first speech to Congress as uncomfortable as possible by inviting guests they say will suffer under new White House policies .
The strategy means Trump will likely face a crowd including ethnic minorities , LGBT people , undocumented immigrants , the disabled and others when he addresses a joint session on Feb. 28 .
It ’ s a shift in tactics for Democrats , some of whom skipped Trump ’ s inauguration last month in protest .
Democrats say there are no plans to stage a similar boycott of Trump ’ s speech , but they want to put him face-to-face with people who feel alienated and targeted by his controversial executive orders .
In a letter circulating on Capitol Hill , a group of liberals is urging fellow Democrats to bring guests who have made “ a positive impact ” on the community “ despite discrimination or marginalization . ”
“ It is our hope that their presence in the House Gallery will remind President Trump that he is not the arbiter of patriotism , ” reads the letter . “ This country belongs to all of us , and his rhetoric of intolerance will not stand . ”
The authors of the letter are as diverse as the crowd they ’ re seeking to assemble .
They include Reps. Jim Langevin ( R.I. ) , who was shot accidentally as a teen and became the first quadriplegic to serve in Congress ; Michelle Lujan Grisham ( N.M. ) , head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus ; Cedric Richmond ( La . ) , chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus ; Judy Chu ( Calif. ) , head of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus ; and David Cicilline ( R.I. ) and Jared Polis ( Colo. ) , the co-chairman of the LGBT Equality Caucus .
“ We want to send a strong message to the [ president ] that he can not push these communities aside , and he can not change the fabric of this country , ” they wrote .
Some liberals are also eyeing another form of protest during the speech : When Trump walks down the center aisle of the House chamber on the way to the dais , they ’ re hoping no Democrats scramble to get in the picture for the traditional handshake .
“ We have to have a higher standard , ” Rep. Luis Gutiérrez ( D-Ill. ) said .
“ For sure I will not be nearby , ” Rep. Filemon Vela ( D-Texas ) echoed .
Trump ’ s campaign rhetoric was combative from the very start , and he ’ s brought that approach with him to the White House .
Most recently , he temporarily banned all refugees from entering the U.S. — and Syrian refugees idefinitely — as well as immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries . The move sparked an outcry from Democrats and human rights groups , and drew thousands of protestors to airports and streets across the country .
It ’ s that spirit of protest the Democrats are hoping to sustain as Trump prepares for his speech to Congress .
“ Instead of celebrating the very diversity that makes our country a beacon of inclusion and equality , he has chosen to vilify , bully and alienate women , immigrants , people of color , people with disabilities , and people of differing faiths , ” the Democrats wrote in their letter .
“ His rhetoric emboldens those who seek a scapegoat for the challenges this country faces . ”","House Democrats are rallying behind a plan to make President Trump’s first speech to Congress as uncomfortable as possible by inviting guests they say will suffer under new White House policies.

The strategy means Trump will likely face a crowd including ethnic minorities, LGBT people, undocumented immigrants, the disabled and others when he addresses a joint session on Feb. 28.

It’s a shift in tactics for Democrats, some of whom skipped Trump’s inauguration last month in protest.

Democrats say there are no plans to stage a similar boycott of Trump’s speech, but they want to put him face-to-face with people who feel alienated and targeted by his controversial executive orders.

In a letter circulating on Capitol Hill, a group of liberals is urging fellow Democrats to bring guests who have made “a positive impact” on the community “despite discrimination or marginalization.”

“It is our hope that their presence in the House Gallery will remind President Trump that he is not the arbiter of patriotism,” reads the letter. “This country belongs to all of us, and his rhetoric of intolerance will not stand.”

The authors of the letter are as diverse as the crowd they’re seeking to assemble.

They include Reps. Jim Langevin (R.I.), who was shot accidentally as a teen and became the first quadriplegic to serve in Congress; Michelle Lujan Grisham (N.M.), head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus; Cedric Richmond (La.), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus; Judy Chu (Calif.), head of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus; and David Cicilline (R.I.) and Jared Polis (Colo.), the co-chairman of the LGBT Equality Caucus.

“We want to send a strong message to the [president] that he cannot push these communities aside, and he cannot change the fabric of this country,” they wrote.

Some liberals are also eyeing another form of protest during the speech: When Trump walks down the center aisle of the House chamber on the way to the dais, they’re hoping no Democrats scramble to get in the picture for the traditional handshake.

“We have to have a higher standard,” Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) said.

“For sure I will not be nearby,” Rep. Filemon Vela (D-Texas) echoed.

Trump’s campaign rhetoric was combative from the very start, and he’s brought that approach with him to the White House.

Most recently, he temporarily banned all refugees from entering the U.S. — and Syrian refugees idefinitely — as well as immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. The move sparked an outcry from Democrats and human rights groups, and drew thousands of protestors to airports and streets across the country.

It’s that spirit of protest the Democrats are hoping to sustain as Trump prepares for his speech to Congress.

“Instead of celebrating the very diversity that makes our country a beacon of inclusion and equality, he has chosen to vilify, bully and alienate women, immigrants, people of color, people with disabilities, and people of differing faiths,” the Democrats wrote in their letter.

“His rhetoric emboldens those who seek a scapegoat for the challenges this country faces.”",www.thehill.com,center,6PksPvNk2pMe1Mk7

A report found that the IRS targeted conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status
A huge increase in workload , rather than deliberate targeting , led to `` foolish mistakes '' and the political discrimination in the Internal Revenue Service cited by an inspector general 's report , the agency 's outgoing commissioner said Friday .
The testimony by Steven Miller , who was forced to announce his resignation this week as acting IRS commissioner , came at the first congressional hearing on the matter that has put President Barack Obama 's administration on the defensive .
Rep. Dave Camp , chairman of the Republican-led panel , and other GOP members sought to depict the controversy as indicative of government gone wild , with the IRS abusing conservative groups and other political foes of the administration .
`` This kind of reconfirms that , you know what , they can do anything they want to anybody they want any time they want , '' GOP Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania said about the IRS .
The public gallery erupted in cheers and applause when he concluded by saying : `` This is absolutely an overreach and this is an outrage for all Americans . ''
Democrats on the committee also expressed outrage at the targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status , but they pointed out that the top IRS official at the time was appointed by Republican President George W. Bush , not Obama .
They also noted that the inspector general 's report stated there was no evidence of any political motivation for what happened , or influence from outside the IRS .

However , the inspector general who filed the report on the political targeting , J. Russell George , told Friday 's hearing that he notified top Treasury officials , including Deputy Secretary Neal Wolin , as early as June 2012 that he was reviewing the office that handles tax-exempt applications .
George made clear that he only told them that he was conducting a review , which he said was prompted by a request from someone he described as a congressional staff member .
`` It was not to inform them of the results of the audit , it was to inform them of the fact that we were conducting the audit , '' George later clarified .
A Treasury official , who discussed the matter on the condition of not being identified , told CNN that Wolin learned of the review , but not any findings , in the summer of 2012 . Wolin did not discuss the review with anyone outside the Treasury department , the official said .
The Treasury Department oversees the quasi-independent IRS . Some Republicans are trying to find a link between the Obama administration and the IRS targeting , and the GOP-led House Oversight Committee has invited Wolin to appear at a hearing next week on the IRS controversy .
In his opening remarks Friday , Miller described an IRS division that handles requests for tax exempt status by political groups as overwhelmed by a surge that followed the Supreme Court 's 2010 Citizens United decision , which greatly expanded the ability of corporations , unions and other organizations to participate in election spending , though not through direct contributions to candidates or parties .
`` I think that what happened here was that foolish mistakes were made by people who were trying to be more efficient in their workload selection , '' Miller said , calling the practices described in the inspector general 's report as `` intolerable '' and a `` mistake , '' but `` not an act of partisanship . ''
He apologized for what he later called `` horrible customer service , '' but he also stubbornly rejected any accusation that it amounted to politicizing the work of the IRS .
Miller came under aggressive and accusatory questioning from Camp and other Republicans , who claimed he misled Congress by failing to reveal the extent of the problem at previous hearings dating back a year .
`` When asked the truth and you know the truth and you have a legal responsibility to inform others of the truth but you do n't share that truth , what is that called ? '' Camp asked .
A tense exchange with Rep. Diane Black , a Tennessee Republican , involved Miller 's denial that what he called the `` listing '' of names or phrases that triggered extra scrutiny of exemption requests amounted to political `` targeting , '' the word used in the inspector general 's report .
Miller acknowledged that the list of triggering phrases was conservative-based , causing Black to cut him off by declaring : `` Then I would say its targeted . You ca n't have that both ways . ''
GOP Rep. Devin Nunes of California later asked why Miller resigned if he was n't personally involved in the improper acts . Miller replied : `` I resigned because as the acting commissioner , what happens in the IRS , whether I was personally involved or not , stopped at my desk . ''
`` And so , I should be held accountable for what happens , '' he said . `` Whether I was personally involved or not , a very different question , sir . ''
Another Republican , Rep. Tom Reed of New York , took exception with Miller 's characterization of his resignation , noting it meant he would retire with full benefits and `` nothing bad is going to happen to you . ''
With an incredulous grin , Miller responded : `` Nothing bad is happening to me , congressman ? ''
Reed remained stern-faced , noting Miller continued to get his taxpayer-funded salary .
`` You 're getting paid for being here today , right ? '' Reed asked , to which Miller , his smile gone , dryly replied : `` Right . ''
After the hearing , Camp described a `` disturbing lack of detail and information '' during testimony .
`` We 're going to continue to pursue this , as a committee , to find out who knew what , when , where , and how these decisions were made and how they were carried out , '' he said .
Earlier he told reporters the panel wanted unspecified records from Miller 's tenure at the IRS .
Democrats sought to balance rejection of any perception of political manipulation by the IRS in the case with an effort to portray the situation as a poorly managed increase in demand for tax exempt status by political groups .
Rep. Jim McDermott , D-Washington , said the vast majority of the increased applications for tax exempt status after the Citizens United decision were from `` far right groups , '' while fellow Democratic Rep. Richard Neal of Washington said the conservative organizations wanted to be involved politically without revealing donors -- as allowed for the 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) groups under the federal tax code .
`` It all started right after Citizens United , '' McDermott said , adding that political groups `` saw the door open '' and thought that `` we can get in , we can do political advertising . ''
He described a difference between `` stupid mistakes and deliberate mistakes , '' adding that the IRS officials handling the requests took a shortcut `` they deeply regret . ''
Democrats repeatedly asked George , who wrote the report on the controversy , to reiterate that there was no evidence of political motivation . Each time , George agreed his review found no such evidence .
Rep. Sander Levin , the panel 's ranking Democrat , specifically cited the former IRS commissioner , Douglas Shulman , for what he called misleading Congress on the issue . Shulman was not a witness at Friday 's hearing , but is scheduled to appear at other congressional hearings next week .
According to the report by George , the agency developed and followed a faulty policy to determine whether the applicants were engaged in political activities , which would disqualify the groups from receiving tax-exempt status .
The controversial move began in early 2010 and continued for more than 18 months , the report said , declaring that `` the IRS used inappropriate criteria that identified for review Tea Party and other organizations applying for tax-exempt status based upon their names or policy positions instead of indications of potential political campaign intervention . ''
Among the criteria used by IRS officials to flag applications was a `` Be On the Look Out '' list , which was discontinued in 2012 , the report said .
-- Whether `` Tea Party , '' `` Patriots '' or `` 9/12 Project '' was referenced in the case file .
-- Whether the issues outlined in the application included government spending , government debt or taxes .
-- Whether there was advocating or lobbying to `` make America a better place to live . ''
-- Whether a statement in the case file criticized how the country is being run .
-- Whether it advocated education about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
Conservative groups complain their requests were delayed for months or even years through the targeting that sought to prevent ineligible political groups from getting tax exempt status . Miller testified Friday that determining the political nature of groups was one of the hardest tasks of IRS officers tasked with assessing requests for tax exempt status .
IRS officials , according to the report , did not consult anyone beyond the agency about the development of the additional screening criteria . They believed that the criteria they came up with were a screening shortcut meant to help with the influx of applications , the report said .
The IRS scrutiny began after the Citizens United case . Following the ruling , the number of politically oriented groups seeking tax exempt status as social welfare organizations under section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) of the federal tax code increased greatly at a time when the federal government , including the IRS , was dealing with austerity measures that reduced or stagnated personnel and resources .
Some Democrats pointed to budget cuts at the IRS as a reason for the agency 's inability to properly enact an increasingly complex tax code .
However , the IRS watchdog found that the criteria used to flag potential political applications resulted in substantial delays and the request of unnecessary information from the groups .
The investigation by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration was initiated after congressional complaints began to surface in the media in 2012 that the IRS was targeting conservative groups and holding up applications .
In a written response included in the report , the IRS commissioner of the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division said there was no criminal behavior behind the actions of the agents , but rather inefficient management .
`` We believe the front-line career employees that made the decisions acted out of a desire for efficiency and not out of any political and partisan viewpoint , '' the commissioner wrote .
Obama called the inspector general 's findings outrageous and forced Miller 's resignation , which takes effect in early June .
Meanwhile , the commissioner of the IRS ' Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division also announced his retirement Thursday . Joseph Grant will leave in June , according to an internal IRS memo provided to CNN . Miller also is scheduled to exit then .
On Friday , Miller told the committee that more changes would be coming to the IRS over the controversy , implying that more officials would be forced to leave .
`` We 're not done yet . We 're not , '' he said . `` We now have the Treasury inspector general 's report . We now have the sense of the facts . Now is the time for those that remain , including the incoming acting commissioner ... to take those actions . ''
Obama has appointed Danny Werfel , a White House budget office official who has served in both Democratic and Republican administrations , to succeed Miller through the end of the fiscal year on September 30 .
Treasury Secretary Jack Lew met Friday with Werfel and directed him to conduct `` a thorough review of the organization in an effort to restore public confidence in the IRS and ensure the organization is providing excellent and unbiased service to the taxpayer , '' a Treasury official told CNN .
The official said Lew asked Werfel to report to Obama within 30 days on progress made in holding wrongdoers responsible , correcting problems that allowed the targeting to occur and providing a `` forward-looking systemic view '' of the IRS .
In his opening statement , Camp said the controversy `` goes against the very principles of free speech and liberty '' on which the nation was founded .
He also said the IRS lied to Congress about the targeting , and cited what he called five violations of taxpayer rights by the agency 's practice , including intimidation of conservative groups and leaking of confidential information .
`` The reality is this is not a personnel problem , '' he said , instead calling it the result of an agency being too large and powerful , with the freedom to abuse that power . `` Under this administration , the IRS has abused its power to tax and destroyed the faith of the American people '' in the tax system .
Levin agreed that the IRS targeting was wrong , and he singled out former and current IRS officials for misconduct .
However , Levin specifically disagreed with Camp that the issue reflects a cultural problem in Obama 's administration .
`` If this hearing becomes essentially a bootstrap to continue the campaign of 2012 and prepare the campaign of 2014 , we will be making a very , very serious mistake , '' Levin said .
Among the recommendations made by the Treasury inspector general : The IRS must better document reasons why applications are chosen for review , develop a process to track requests for assistance , develop and provide training to employees before each election cycle and immediately resolve outstanding cases .
The report also called on Treasury to develop guidelines to explain social welfare activity -- the primary factor in obtaining tax-exempt status .
Already , the controversy has leaked into the debate over House Republican efforts to repeal Obama 's health care reform law . The IRS official in charge of that agency 's implementation of the program , Sarah Hall Ingram , once headed the unit under scrutiny in the scandal .
Miller , who appointed Ingram to the position , on Friday described her as an excellent public servant .
Camp told CNN on Thursday that he does not yet know if the scandal rises to the level of criminal conduct . Other Republican leaders have said they want criminal charges in the case .
`` But clearly this is serious , '' he said . `` I think the penalties should be serious . I think Infringing on people 's constitutional rights is not something we should look ( at ) as a trifling matter . ''
Camp promised more hearings to follow , partly to hear from Shulman , who was running the agency when the targeting program went into effect .
Shulman also will testify before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday , a House GOP aide told CNN . Shulman voluntarily agreed to attend . He is no longer in the government .
Another official at the heart of the scandal , Lois Lerner , told the committee through an attorney that she was in Montreal . Lerner did n't attend the hearing , and Levin 's opening statement said she should lose her job as director of the program assessing applications for tax exempt status .","Story highlights NEW : A top State Department official is invited to appear before a House panel next week

us_house,Michael Goodwin,2,https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/goodwin-adam-schiffs-dull-impeachment-hearings-are-a-flop/,Goodwin: Adam Schiff’s dull impeachment hearings are a flop,2019-11-13,,"Day One of impeachment was not exactly must-see TV . Sure , it was interesting and substantive at times , which would be compliments if this were a graduate school seminar about the lonely lives and confusing experiences of far-flung diplomats .
But this was a congressional hearing to determine whether to file charges against and ultimately remove the president of the United States . By that standard , the Adam Schiff show was a flop .
I would call it a sensational flop , except that would suggest a sense of drama the day never produced . A five-hour slog that doesn ’ t hit pay dirt or end up anywhere meaningful can ’ t be sensational .
The Schiff show was more of a quiet , methodical flop . Imagine a slow leak in a big balloon and you ’ ll get the picture .
Still , the impact is significant . At the start of the day , impeachment was a one-party fever , and so it remains .
Nothing that happened Wednesday changes that critical dynamic . At this point , time and public patience are not the impeachers ’ friends .
The lack of surprising or even new developments are major strikes against them . They have the burden of proving their hatred for President Trump is based on something other than resentment over his election or his tweets . That should be a fairly low bar , but they couldn ’ t get over it .
Although the hearing wasn ’ t as deadly as special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s hapless final appearance , it certainly didn ’ t move the Dems closer to their goal of running Trump out of town .
If Schiff , the zealous California chair of the intelligence panel , has a compelling vision about how to persuade the public that the president committed crimes or anything approaching crimes involving Ukraine , it escapes me . The first day of hearings and the first witnesses should have at least been able to produce facts and tantalizing hints that would leave viewers wanting more .
see also Highlights from Day 1 of Trump impeachment hearings The House Intelligence Committee began its historic public hearings on ...
Instead , the performances of acting Ukraine Ambassador William Taylor and State Department official George Kent left the impression there is little or nothing more to want . Everything to come likely will offer only more detail about the things we already know .
As several GOP members argued , it is impossible to prove the allegations of a quid pro quo when Ukraine got the American aid even though it never promised to investigate that country ’ s role in the 2016 election or the hiring of Hunter Biden by an energy company for $ 50,000 a month when his father was vice president .
That idea was captured best when Ohio Republican Jim Jordan got Taylor to acknowledge he had three meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky over a 55-day period after the Trump phone call . Not once , Jordan said and Taylor agreed , did Zelensky complain that Trump was pressuring him to do the investigation or that there had been a holdup in aid .
“ And you ’ re the star witnesses , ” Jordan said , which got a laugh out of Taylor and many in the room .
It was a compelling moment that underscored the difficulty — and maybe the insanity — of what Democrats are trying to do . Moreover , even if they could prove a quid pro quo , would the American people find it impeachable just 11 months before an election ? Would the Senate convict and remove Trump on such thin gruel ?
Schiff seemed to sense the problems with his case and tried to argue that Zelensky had to fear retribution from Trump . It was a clear suggestion that the Ukrainian president was lying when he repeatedly said publicly he felt no pressure from Trump .
As Republican John Ratcliffe of Texas put it , if Dems believe that , they would have to impeach two presidents — Trump and Zelensky .
Rep. Joaquin Castro ( D-Texas ) trotted out the most ridiculous argument of the day , saying the fact that the investigations into the Bidens and 2016 didn ’ t happen doesn ’ t really matter .
“ Is attempted murder a crime ? ” he asked the witnesses . Perhaps he was joking , but I ’ m afraid he was serious .

Is that all they’ve got?

Day One of impeachment was not exactly must-see TV. Sure, it was interesting and substantive at times, which would be compliments if this were a graduate school seminar about the lonely lives and confusing experiences of far-flung diplomats.

But this was a congressional hearing to determine whether to file charges against and ultimately remove the president of the United States. By that standard, the Adam Schiff show was a flop.

I would call it a sensational flop, except that would suggest a sense of drama the day never produced. A five-hour slog that doesn’t hit pay dirt or end up anywhere meaningful can’t be sensational.

The Schiff show was more of a quiet, methodical flop. Imagine a slow leak in a big balloon and you’ll get the picture.

Still, the impact is significant. At the start of the day, impeachment was a one-party fever, and so it remains.

Nothing that happened Wednesday changes that critical dynamic. At this point, time and public patience are not the impeachers’ friends.

The lack of surprising or even new developments are major strikes against them. They have the burden of proving their hatred for President Trump is based on something other than resentment over his election or his tweets. That should be a fairly low bar, but they couldn’t get over it.

Although the hearing wasn’t as deadly as special counsel Robert Mueller’s hapless final appearance, it certainly didn’t move the Dems closer to their goal of running Trump out of town.

If Schiff, the zealous California chair of the intelligence panel, has a compelling vision about how to persuade the public that the president committed crimes or anything approaching crimes involving Ukraine, it escapes me. The first day of hearings and the first witnesses should have at least been able to produce facts and tantalizing hints that would leave viewers wanting more.

Instead, the performances of acting Ukraine Ambassador William Taylor and State Department official George Kent left the impression there is little or nothing more to want. Everything to come likely will offer only more detail about the things we already know.

As several GOP members argued, it is impossible to prove the allegations of a quid pro quo when Ukraine got the American aid even though it never promised to investigate that country’s role in the 2016 election or the hiring of Hunter Biden by an energy company for $50,000 a month when his father was vice president.

That idea was captured best when Ohio Republican Jim Jordan got Taylor to acknowledge he had three meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky over a 55-day period after the Trump phone call. Not once, Jordan said and Taylor agreed, did Zelensky complain that Trump was pressuring him to do the investigation or that there had been a holdup in aid.

“And you’re the star witnesses,” Jordan said, which got a laugh out of Taylor and many in the room.

It was a compelling moment that underscored the difficulty — and maybe the insanity — of what Democrats are trying to do. Moreover, even if they could prove a quid pro quo, would the American people find it impeachable just 11 months before an election? Would the Senate convict and remove Trump on such thin gruel?

Schiff seemed to sense the problems with his case and tried to argue that Zelensky had to fear retribution from Trump. It was a clear suggestion that the Ukrainian president was lying when he repeatedly said publicly he felt no pressure from Trump.

As Republican John Ratcliffe of Texas put it, if Dems believe that, they would have to impeach two presidents — Trump and Zelensky.

Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) trotted out the most ridiculous argument of the day, saying the fact that the investigations into the Bidens and 2016 didn’t happen doesn’t really matter.

“Is attempted murder a crime?” he asked the witnesses. Perhaps he was joking, but I’m afraid he was serious.

Unfortunately, Schiff is also serious about not wanting to hear the other side of the story. He refuses to summon the so-called whistleblower, and his party shows absolutely no interest in learning why Hunter Biden got rich while his father was visiting Ukraine repeatedly.

Republicans kept bringing up both topics and Kent acknowledged that he had raised concerns nearly four years ago about the “perception of a conflict of interest” with the State Department and Biden’s office, but got no ­response.

Similarly, Dems and their media handmaidens mock Trump’s interest in what role Ukraine played in 2016, deriding it as a wild conspiracy theory.

But in fact, it is well established that Ukraine’s Washington embassy helped spread dirt on Paul Manafort when he was Trump campaign chairman and that some Ukraine officials met with Hillary Clinton aides and other Democrats in 2016. Among them was Alexandra Chalupa, a former Democratic National Committee contractor who worked with Ukrainians to get dirt on Trump.

According to Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican at Wednesday’s hearing, Dems took her name out of the testimony transcripts before releasing them. That’s ­curious.

All of which points to the biggest problem with the Schiff show. Dems obviously fear a fair and complete investigation of all the facts, one that reveals their contacts with the whistleblower, his political connections and all the events involving Ukraine and the Bidens.

WASHINGTON – Rep. John Conyers is stepping down from his top spot on the House Judiciary Committee as a congressional ethics panel probes sexual harassment allegations against the Michigan Democrat.

Conyers again denied the harassment allegations in a statement released Sunday but said he has requested to step down as the Judiciary Committee's ranking member.

""To be clear, I would like very much to remain as ranking member,"" he said in a statement. ""There is still much work to be done on core concerns like securing civil rights, enacting meaningful criminal justice reforms, and protecting access to the ballot box. ... But I have come to believe that my presence as ranking member on the committee would not serve these efforts while the ethics committee investigation is pending.""

Conyers, 88, has denied harassing an employee who received a 2015 settlement of more than $27,000 from his office funds. He did confirm the settlement, saying last week that his ""office resolved the allegations — with an express denial of liability — in order to save all involved from the rigors of protracted litigation. That should not be lost in the narrative.""

The House Ethics Committee has opened an investigation into the allegations.

After the report of the settlement was published last week, a second woman accused the congressman of harassing her while she worked was his aide. Melanie Sloan said that he verbally abused her, criticized her appearance and once showed up to a meeting in his underwear.

In response to Conyers' decision to step aside, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that ""zero tolerance means consequences.""

""We must ensure the Congress has a climate of dignity and respect with zero tolerance for sexual harassment,"" the California Democrat said in a statement.

Conyers has long served on the powerful panel, including a stint as its chairman from 2007 to 2011.

Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, the second most senior Democrat on the committee, said his party's work on the panel must move forward.

""I will do everything in my power to continue to press on the important issues facing our committee, including criminal justice reform, workplace equality and holding the Trump administration accountable,"" Nadler said in a statement. ""Ranking Member Conyers has a 50-year legacy of advancing the cause of justice, and my job moving forward is to continue that critical work.""

The announcements come after Pelosi insisted during an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press that Conyers deserves due process as the House Ethics Committee probes sexual harassment allegations against the congressman and his use of office funds to settle one case.

""John Conyers is an icon in our country,"" she said. ""He has done a great deal to protect women. ... The fact is, as John reviews his case — which he knows, which I don't — I believe he will do the right thing.""

But when asked whether the ""right thing"" meant the Michigan Democrat's resignation, Pelosi dodged the question.

""He will do the right thing in terms of what he knows about his situation,"" Pelosi replied. ""That he's entitled to due process. But women are entitled to due process as well.""

Pelosi did not say whether she believed Conyers' accusers, saying that it was up to the Ethics Committee to review the cases.

""I don't know who they are,"" she said.

Attorney Lisa Bloom said Sunday that she represents the woman who filed a sexual harassment complaint in 2014. Her client ""was forced"" to sign a confidentiality agreement when she received the settlement, Bloom said.

""We call upon Mr. Conyers and the Office of Compliance to release my client from her confidentiality agreement so that she may have a voice to tell her own story,"" Bloom said in a statement. ""Basic fairness and decency dictate that if Mr. Conyers can speak publicly about the matter, the woman should be free to do so as well.""

The accusations against Conyers surfaced as more women have come forward to charge sexual misconduct against men in power. On Capitol Hill, Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., is also facing allegations that he touched women inappropriately.

Anita Hill — the lawyer who famously told Congress in 1991 that her then-boss, Clarence Thomas, had sexually harassed her after he was nominated to the Supreme Court — also discussed on the NBC show how more women were opening up about their experiences.

""I can't say I was entirely surprised about the #MeToo allegations and the stories that came out of #MeToo,"" she said.

She noted that Washington had been unable to ""lead on this issue"" when she testified about Thomas, now a Supreme Court justice.

""We have made progress, but unfortunately 26 years ago, Washington wasn’t ready to lead on this issue, and I’m afraid even today Washington cannot lead the country on this issue,"" she said.

us_house,CNN (Web News),0,https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/11/politics/paul-ryan-retirement-house-speaker/index.html,House Speaker Paul Ryan won't seek re-election,2018-04-11,"Lauren Fox, Deirdre Walsh, Maegan Vazquez","Washington ( CNN ) House Speaker Paul Ryan is not seeking re-election and will retire from Congress after this year , the Wisconsin Republican announced Wednesday .
`` You realize something when you take this job , '' Ryan told reporters on Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning . `` It 's a big job with a lot riding on you ... but you also know this is not a job that does not last forever . ... You realize you hold the office for just a small part of our history . So you better make the most of it . ''
He reminded reporters that he took the job `` reluctantly '' in 2015 , when he took over from John Boehner , but Ryan also said he has no `` regrets . ''
`` I like to think I 've done my part , my little part in history to set us on a better course , '' Ryan said .
Ryan 's departure is a blow to GOP members who saw the Wisconsin Republican as a stable and policy-oriented leader in a party shaken by the tumultuous Donald Trump presidency . He has been a fundraising juggernaut ahead of the midterms this fall , and helped translate GOP agenda items into legislation such as a series of tax cuts and rolling back banking legislation put in place under Democrats .
In his prepared remarks , Ryan focused on the tax law that passed last year as a key legacy he left behind and spoke at length about his desire to go home to Wisconsin to be with his family . He said that the 2018 midterms and the chance that he would n't be speaker did n't factor at all into his decision to announce his retirement .
Looming in the aftermath of Ryan 's announcement is the reality of an impending leadership race that will now stretch for months ahead of a contentious midterm election . But Ryan downplayed that it would be a distraction .
Trump , who has at times fought with congressional Republicans including Ryan , tweeted praise for the speaker after his announcement .
`` Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man , and while he will not be seeking re-election , he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question . We are with you Paul ! '' Trump wrote .
The discussions about Ryan 's future have been closely held , according to a person familiar with the decision . Along with his wife , Janna , and his three kids , Ryan has been discussing next steps with a group of roughly six close aides for the last several months .
This person said Ryan made his decision over the spring recess with his family while spending some time with them overseas after his official trip wrapped up in the Czech Republic .
`` This has been a direction that he has been heading in for a while , but I will say as recently as February he has been talking about running again , '' this person said . Even before his biggest legislative accomplishment -- tax reform -- was across the finish line Ryan was contemplating that this would be his last term in the House .
The speaker directed his aides to never definitely say he was running for re-election , and his public comments always gave him the room to step down next year .
One thing that was always part of the speaker 's calculus , and he has spoken about throughout his career , was the impact of losing his father at the age of 16 .
`` It 's always weighed heavily on him . and at a moment like this when his kids are reaching the same age as when his father passed away , it 's especially poignant , '' the person familiar with the decision told reporters .
While it has long been expected that Ryan would leave after the 115th Congress , sources close to him have said for weeks they expected he would run again in order to raise money for the party and not throw his conference into a leadership battle . Ryan `` recently '' came to the conclusion that was n't the best path for him , one of the sources said .

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana are among the contenders congressional observers see as most likely to replace Ryan .
Scalise demurred when asked if he would run for the speakership .
`` We 're getting way ahead of ourselves . Obviously , there 's a lot of speculation , but I 've been real clear for a long time , I do n't want to get into speculation , '' he told Fox News , adding , `` We 've got to make sure we keep the majority . ''
Scalise told Politico in March that he would not rule out running for the speakership if Ryan were to retire .
One source with the conservative bloc , the House Freedom Caucus , says McCarthy is , at this early stage , likely to have the support to become the next speaker with the group 's chairman , Rep. Mark Meadows , a front-runner to become majority leader .
Ryan is likely to weigh in publicly on who should succeed him as speaker . The person familiar with Ryan 's decision said , `` He has thoughts on this and he will share those at a later time . ''
That source insisted that the leadership race can wait until January , and the speaker can still effectively lead the GOP conference : `` He has confidence that his leadership team will be able to pull together and get the job done for the rest of the year . ''
Even though the Republican conference was not always unified behind Ryan , members of both parties and both chambers praised his tenure .
`` Paul Ryan is a person of true integrity who I have had the great fortune to know over the last eight years , '' GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said in a statement . `` He has served Janesville , southeastern Wisconsin and our nation honorably . We should all be grateful for his sacrifice and understand his desire to be a full-time dad . ''
In an apparent reference to the struggles facing Ryan , Rep. Trey Gowdy released a statement both praising the retiring speaker and encouraging those who think they can do better to step up .
`` To those within Congress who always seemed to have a better idea or a smarter strategy , now is your chance to run for speaker , '' the South Carolina Republican said in his statement . `` To those outside of Congress who always seemed to have a better idea or a smarter strategy , you do not have to be a member of the House to be speaker of the House and hence , now is your chance to run for speaker . ''
Meadows , of North Carolina , praised Ryan 's tenure in a statement after the news broke .
`` Speaker Ryan has served our country well for decades as a thoughtful policy leader in the House , '' he told CNN . `` He will be successful in any future endeavor and I wish him all the best . ''
Even Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic leader in the House and former speaker herself , found some kind words for her Republican counterpart .
`` Despite our differences , I commend his steadfast commitment to our country , '' Pelosi said in a statement . `` During his final months , Democrats are hopeful that he joins us to work constructively to advance better futures for all Americans . ''
According to two sources with direct knowledge , in calls this morning with his leadership team , Ryan made clear much of this decision was about spending time with his family , but also noted that he planned to leave after this Congress and did n't think it was fair to his district or the GOP conference to run for re-election only to leave right after . Sources familiar told CNN that Ryan called McCarthy and Scalise about his retirement before the news broke .
Ryan called Trump and Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday morning ahead of his announcement , a source familiar with their conversation told CNN .
The speaker met with members of his caucus on Wednesday morning . Rep. Darrell Issa of California told CNN that Ryan told members he promises to be more than a `` Sunday dad '' and he cited his family as part of his decision . At one point Wednesday morning , reporters outside the conference room could hear a long applause from inside the meeting .
Ryan , a Wisconsin Republican , has been in Congress since 1999 and became House speaker in 2015 . Ryan reluctantly ran to replace then-Speaker Boehner of Ohio , who retired after sparring regularly with the most conservative members of his conference , including many members of the House Freedom Caucus .
Some of Ryan 's close friends previously told CNN that he might leave office after the 2018 midterms . Ryan said in a January interview with CBS News that re-election was a decision he and his wife were planning to make together in late spring , and in March he denied a rumor that he would n't seek re-election .
The news of Ryan 's retirement was first reported by Axios .","Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan is not seeking re-election and will retire from Congress after this year, the Wisconsin Republican announced Wednesday.

""You realize something when you take this job,"" Ryan told reporters on Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning. ""It's a big job with a lot riding on you ... but you also know this is not a job that does not last forever. ... You realize you hold the office for just a small part of our history. So you better make the most of it.""

He reminded reporters that he took the job ""reluctantly"" in 2015, when he took over from John Boehner, but Ryan also said he has no ""regrets.""

""I like to think I've done my part, my little part in history to set us on a better course,"" Ryan said.

Ryan's departure is a blow to GOP members who saw the Wisconsin Republican as a stable and policy-oriented leader in a party shaken by the tumultuous Donald Trump presidency. He has been a fundraising juggernaut ahead of the midterms this fall, and helped translate GOP agenda items into legislation such as a series of tax cuts and rolling back banking legislation put in place under Democrats.

In his prepared remarks, Ryan focused on the tax law that passed last year as a key legacy he left behind and spoke at length about his desire to go home to Wisconsin to be with his family. He said that the 2018 midterms and the chance that he wouldn't be speaker didn't factor at all into his decision to announce his retirement.

""None whatsoever actually,"" Ryan said.

Looming in the aftermath of Ryan's announcement is the reality of an impending leadership race that will now stretch for months ahead of a contentious midterm election. But Ryan downplayed that it would be a distraction.

Trump, who has at times fought with congressional Republicans including Ryan, tweeted praise for the speaker after his announcement.

""Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. We are with you Paul!"" Trump wrote.

How Ryan made his decision

The discussions about Ryan's future have been closely held, according to a person familiar with the decision. Along with his wife, Janna, and his three kids, Ryan has been discussing next steps with a group of roughly six close aides for the last several months.

This person said Ryan made his decision over the spring recess with his family while spending some time with them overseas after his official trip wrapped up in the Czech Republic.

""This has been a direction that he has been heading in for a while, but I will say as recently as February he has been talking about running again,"" this person said. Even before his biggest legislative accomplishment -- tax reform -- was across the finish line Ryan was contemplating that this would be his last term in the House.

The speaker directed his aides to never definitely say he was running for re-election, and his public comments always gave him the room to step down next year.

One thing that was always part of the speaker's calculus, and he has spoken about throughout his career, was the impact of losing his father at the age of 16.

""It's always weighed heavily on him. and at a moment like this when his kids are reaching the same age as when his father passed away, it's especially poignant,"" the person familiar with the decision told reporters.

Who will replace Ryan?

While it has long been expected that Ryan would leave after the 115th Congress, sources close to him have said for weeks they expected he would run again in order to raise money for the party and not throw his conference into a leadership battle. Ryan ""recently"" came to the conclusion that wasn't the best path for him, one of the sources said.

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana are among the contenders congressional observers see as most likely to replace Ryan.

Scalise demurred when asked if he would run for the speakership.

""We're getting way ahead of ourselves. Obviously, there's a lot of speculation, but I've been real clear for a long time, I don't want to get into speculation,"" he told Fox News, adding, ""We've got to make sure we keep the majority.""

Scalise told Politico in March that he would not rule out running for the speakership if Ryan were to retire.

One source with the conservative bloc, the House Freedom Caucus, says McCarthy is, at this early stage, likely to have the support to become the next speaker with the group's chairman, Rep. Mark Meadows, a front-runner to become majority leader.

Ryan is likely to weigh in publicly on who should succeed him as speaker. The person familiar with Ryan's decision said, ""He has thoughts on this and he will share those at a later time.""

That source insisted that the leadership race can wait until January, and the speaker can still effectively lead the GOP conference: ""He has confidence that his leadership team will be able to pull together and get the job done for the rest of the year.""

Republicans say they're going to miss Ryan

Even though the Republican conference was not always unified behind Ryan, members of both parties and both chambers praised his tenure.

""Paul Ryan is a person of true integrity who I have had the great fortune to know over the last eight years,"" GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said in a statement. ""He has served Janesville, southeastern Wisconsin and our nation honorably. We should all be grateful for his sacrifice and understand his desire to be a full-time dad.""

In an apparent reference to the struggles facing Ryan, Rep. Trey Gowdy released a statement both praising the retiring speaker and encouraging those who think they can do better to step up.

""To those within Congress who always seemed to have a better idea or a smarter strategy, now is your chance to run for speaker,"" the South Carolina Republican said in his statement. ""To those outside of Congress who always seemed to have a better idea or a smarter strategy, you do not have to be a member of the House to be speaker of the House and hence, now is your chance to run for speaker.""

Meadows, of North Carolina, praised Ryan's tenure in a statement after the news broke.

""Speaker Ryan has served our country well for decades as a thoughtful policy leader in the House,"" he told CNN. ""He will be successful in any future endeavor and I wish him all the best.""

Even Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House and former speaker herself, found some kind words for her Republican counterpart.

""Despite our differences, I commend his steadfast commitment to our country,"" Pelosi said in a statement. ""During his final months, Democrats are hopeful that he joins us to work constructively to advance better futures for all Americans.""

Ryan wants to spend time with his family

According to two sources with direct knowledge, in calls this morning with his leadership team, Ryan made clear much of this decision was about spending time with his family, but also noted that he planned to leave after this Congress and didn't think it was fair to his district or the GOP conference to run for re-election only to leave right after. Sources familiar told CNN that Ryan called McCarthy and Scalise about his retirement before the news broke.

Ryan called Trump and Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday morning ahead of his announcement, a source familiar with their conversation told CNN.

The speaker met with members of his caucus on Wednesday morning. Rep. Darrell Issa of California told CNN that Ryan told members he promises to be more than a ""Sunday dad"" and he cited his family as part of his decision. At one point Wednesday morning, reporters outside the conference room could hear a long applause from inside the meeting.

Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has been in Congress since 1999 and became House speaker in 2015. Ryan reluctantly ran to replace then-Speaker Boehner of Ohio, who retired after sparring regularly with the most conservative members of his conference, including many members of the House Freedom Caucus.

Story Continued Below

Ryan was intent on moving swiftly to overhaul the motion whereby one member of the House could force a vote to remove the speaker by a supermajority. His skeptics, however, were wary.

When North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows filed a so-called motion to declare the speakership vacant in late July, it was the beginning of the end for Boehner. Ryan knew he could suffer the same fate. The Ways and Means chairman told his closest friends that he couldn’t operate with that kind of threat hanging over his head.

He had a few options at hand, but no clear strategy for how he would remove the dangling legislative anvil. But he felt strongly it had to get done. Ryan intended to act quickly.

It was a power move that would leave no doubt who was in charge.

He delayed his bid to change the motion on the House floor and told conservatives they would discuss the reform as part of a larger conversation about overhauling the House rules later this fall or early next year.

Jordan spread the message to his allies: Ryan had come around.

The about-face was one of several critical shifts during Ryan’s flash campaign for the speakership. It’s not that Ryan was rearranging his ideological makeup or abandoning long-held beliefs. Ryan was — and, in many ways, still is — getting accustomed to wielding power over the masses. For years, he has had his hands on the levers of power, but the Ways and Means and Budget committees are far different from the speakership. Ryan’s fiefdom has always been limited to a few dozen loyal members of his committee.

The unruly 247-member House Republican Conference is another beast altogether. The incentive structure flips: It’s easier to exert leverage over the speaker by opposing him than supporting him.

He ticked through the reasons at length.

“I’m more of a policy person,” he said. “I prefer spending my days on policy and my weekends at home with my family. My weekends consist of going to the YMCA for basketball and then one of their neighborhood parishes for basketball these days. I want to keep doing that. … The speaker is expected to fly around the country on weekends as well, helping folks — I’m not going to do that.

“ We ’ re pretty much there , ” Lynch told ███ Thursday morning in the Capitol . “ Some details need to be cleared up , but I think that we ’ re in a good place . And I think she would agree with that . ”
Asked if he ’ s leaning toward supporting her , Lynch said , “ Yeah , I am . That ’ s fair . ”
Lynch was one of the 16 Democrats to sign a Nov. 19 letter designed to demonstrate that Pelosi lacks the 218 votes she needs to win the Speaker ’ s gavel on the House floor on Jan. 3 .
Lynch huddled with Pelosi on Wednesday , where the pair discussed Lynch ’ s legislative priorities for the next Congress , including efforts to boost infrastructure spending , and protect union pensions and health care plans .
“ We had a great conversation and my goal is to get reassurances that we were going to adopt an agenda that would focus more intently on regular working families , ” Lynch said . “ And it seems that on a number of those issues , we ’ re aligned . ”
The news that Lynch was wavering in his opposition to Pelosi was first reported by Politico on Wednesday .
Lynch was one of just 34 House Democrats to vote in 2010 against the Affordable Care Act , a monumental health care law championed by Pelosi . Lynch , a former ironworker and union president , said his opposition hinged on the inclusion of a tax hike on high-cost insurance plans , including many offered by unions . Congress has delayed that provision , known as the Cadillac tax , until 2020 . Lynch is seeking assurances it never takes effect .
“ Pension reform is a big issue for our folks , as well as this potential tax on union health care benefits , which was included in the Affordable Care Act , which is why I voted against it , ” he said .
Lynch , a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , said he ’ s also looking to “ re-empower ” that panel after two years of the Trump administration , during which Republican leaders did very little to examine the many controversies swirling around the White House .
And she was all for that , ” Lynch said . “ So we had a great conversation , and I think we ’ re closer to each other now , our positions . I think they ’ re fairly clear .
“ She has some great ideas about what our priorities would be , ” he added . “ So I told her that while I was opposed to her initially , our positions are more in harmony now . ”

“We’re pretty much there,” Lynch told The Hill Thursday morning in the Capitol. “Some details need to be cleared up, but I think that we’re in a good place. And I think she would agree with that.”

Asked if he’s leaning toward supporting her, Lynch said, “Yeah, I am. That’s fair.”

Lynch was one of the 16 Democrats to sign a Nov. 19 letter designed to demonstrate that Pelosi lacks the 218 votes she needs to win the Speaker’s gavel on the House floor on Jan. 3.

Lynch huddled with Pelosi on Wednesday, where the pair discussed Lynch’s legislative priorities for the next Congress, including efforts to boost infrastructure spending, and protect union pensions and health care plans.

“We had a great conversation and my goal is to get reassurances that we were going to adopt an agenda that would focus more intently on regular working families,” Lynch said. “And it seems that on a number of those issues, we’re aligned.”

The news that Lynch was wavering in his opposition to Pelosi was first reported by Politico on Wednesday.

Lynch was one of just 34 House Democrats to vote in 2010 against the Affordable Care Act, a monumental health care law championed by Pelosi. Lynch, a former ironworker and union president, said his opposition hinged on the inclusion of a tax hike on high-cost insurance plans, including many offered by unions. Congress has delayed that provision, known as the Cadillac tax, until 2020. Lynch is seeking assurances it never takes effect.

“Pension reform is a big issue for our folks, as well as this potential tax on union health care benefits, which was included in the Affordable Care Act, which is why I voted against it,” he said.

Lynch, a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said he’s also looking to “re-empower” that panel after two years of the Trump administration, during which Republican leaders did very little to examine the many controversies swirling around the White House.

And she was all for that,” Lynch said. “So we had a great conversation, and I think we’re closer to each other now, our positions. I think they’re fairly clear.

“She has some great ideas about what our priorities would be,” he added. “So I told her that while I was opposed to her initially, our positions are more in harmony now.”

Lynch said the talks with Pelosi will continue, as he seeks “some assignments … with respect to pension reform and infrastructure that I’m interested in.”

“She was accommodative with respect to those as well,” he said. “So I think we’re in a good place.”

WASHINGTON – Days after House Republicans lost their majority and gathered to choose new leaders from their shrunken ranks, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik stood up at the closed-door meeting and asked her colleagues to look around.

“This is not reflective of the American public,” Stefanik said of the overwhelmingly white group of new and returning lawmakers that included only 13 women. “We need to do better.”

Weeks later, Stefanik was frustrated that there still wasn’t enough introspection.

“Some people are scratching their heads, wondering why those larger conversations aren’t happening,” Stefanik told USA TODAY.

Likewise, Indiana Rep. Susan Brooks, the outgoing co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Caucus for Women’s Issues, said she is in mourning for her defeated female colleagues. The Republican who was supposed to succeed Brooks as caucus co-chair – California Rep. Mimi Walters – was among the November casualties.

“Everyone is struggling right now for answers,” she said. “Fifty-two Republican women ran for Congress … and only 13 of us made it across the finish line.”

That will be the lowest number of Republican women in the House in a quarter-century.

By contrast, voters elected a record 89 Democratic women to the House. Republicans have never had more than 25 women, a record set in 2006.

There will be only one Republican woman in the freshman class: Carol Miller of West Virginia.

(In the Senate, Republicans expanded their number of women by one to seven. The number of Democratic female senators will remain the same at 17.)

Though there’s been much attention on this election’s “Year of the Woman,” which sent a record number of women to Congress and to state legislatures nationwide, there’s been less focus on the diminished ranks of Republican women.

Some narrowly lost and would have done better in a year when all Republicans weren’t facing headwinds.

But even in good years for the GOP, such as when it took over the House in 2010, Republican women have not expanded their ranks the way Democrats have.

'You need to be more proactive'

Experts said Republicans don’t have the same support for women that Democrats do to help recruit candidates, raise campaign funds and win primaries. That’s hard to do, said Idaho State University assistant professor Malliga Och, when the party tends to be dismissive of “identity politics” as something that lowers the quality of candidates.

“You cannot just say, 'Oh, women should be there,' and wait for the women to come,” said Och, who studies women in politics. “You need to be more proactive.”

As more women identify with the Democratic Party – as shown by the 19-percentage-point gender gap in votes for House candidates – the pool of potential Republican candidates shrinks.

“We have especially failed to bring our message to, and connect with, women and racial minorities,” Utah Rep. Mia Love, the only black Republican woman in Congress and one of the five female House incumbents defeated in November, wrote in an opinion piece published Wednesday.

The losses Republican women suffered at the state legislative level also reduced the pipeline of potential congressional candidates.

“For the party, the optics of it are terrible,” said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.

How the parties diverged

The parties’ paths started diverging in 1992, the last “Year of the Woman.”

In the 1980s, Republican women in Congress made up a slightly greater share of their caucus than Democratic women did in theirs – though the numbers on both sides were small.

In the 1990s, Democrats began significantly expanding the share of women in their caucus with help from groups such as EMILY’s List, which raises money for female Democrats who support abortion rights.

Republican women found it harder to win primaries as the party became more conservative on abortion and other issues, Walsh said.

“In general, the party shifted to the right,” she said. “The resources for Republican women weren’t there. They were only building on the Democratic side.”

Brooks, who was first elected in 2012, said Republican women don’t have the national fundraising network or as many donors who will contribute the maximum.

“I’ve been saying this ever since I’ve been here,” she said, “The women in the Republican Party have not been supported financially and have not had the fundraising success that many of our male counterparts have.”

Republicans have made periodic attempts to address such issues.

“Every cycle, there’s one or two PACs that come up that want to elect more Republican women,” Och said. “And in a cycle or two, they disappear.”

Stefanik, the first woman to lead recruitment efforts for the campaign arm of House Republicans, took the job in 2017 to focus on finding more women and nontraditional candidates for this year’s election.

Although 120 Republican women filed to run, 52 were nominated – one short of the GOP record set in 2004. While more than 43 percent of the Democrats’ House candidates were women, only 13 percent of Republicans were.

Republican women who won their party's nomination didn't do as well as their male counterparts in the general election.

Stefanik felt restricted by the party’s policy of not getting involved in primaries, which she said impedes efforts to nominate more women. Now that her leadership role with the National Republican Congressional Campaign is over, Stefanik plans to focus her own political action committee on giving early support to female candidates.

“The party needs to have a wake-up call,” she said.

“We do need to emphasize that we’re looking for more women. There’s no question we need to ask that. But just because of your gender does not mean you are the right candidate,” Emmer said. “If we had had the right candidates, we would’ve had a lot more of them get through the primaries.”

Addressing family issues

In addition to finding candidates “from all different walks of life that actually reflect that community,” Emmer said, Congress should address issues such as flex time and housing allowances that would make it easier for women to have families and serve in Congress.

“There are a lot of women that, I will tell you, they should be the ones in the state legislature or in Congress, but instead their husband is doing it,” Emmer said, “because they’ve made the decision that they’re going to be the one operating the household.”

Emmer, The New York Times reported, got the job of NRCC chair over Missouri Rep. Ann Wagner who has worked on past GOP efforts to better engage female voters and recruit female candidates.

Bustos hopes diversity will also grow on the Republican side because the composition of the House will never match the 51 percent of the population that’s female with Democrats alone.

""If the makeup of Congress truly reflected the makeup of America, then we would be a much better country and a better world,"" Bustos said.

A higher value

Polls and academic research show Democrats place a higher value on electing more women to Congress than Republicans do, according to Republican pollster Christine Matthews.

Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the one Republican woman who will be in House leadership next year, told Fox News after the election that the party needs to make sure it recruits female candidates. She dismissed the idea that Democrats should be applauded for electing more women, saying many of those newly elected are socialists whose ideas would hurt the country.

House Republicans have been destined for modest gains in the midterms despite a favorable political environment. Now, just five weeks until Election Day, the party is raising its ambitions, jumping into Democratic strongholds long thought to be beyond the GOP’s reach.

The goal: Achieve their biggest House majority since Harry Truman’s presidency.

Story Continued Below

Over the past several weeks, the National Republican Congressional Committee has reserved millions of dollars of TV advertising time in two House districts — one in upstate New York, the other in northern Maine — that broke sharply for Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election but where GOP prospects have been on the rise.

In the coming days, the House GOP campaign arm is polling to gauge whether to invest in three other blue congressional districts that have only recently come onto the national radar, according to two sources familiar with the deliberations. Two of them comprise the eastern, more liberal half of Iowa. The other is in Obama’s native Hawaii.

The goal is to broaden a political map that, much to the GOP’s frustration, has remained stubbornly narrow. Thanks to a recent round of redistricting that limited the number of seats vulnerable to an opposing party takeover, the House playing field comprises only around three dozen districts. If the election were held today, Republicans, who currently have a 17-seat majority, would gain perhaps six or seven seats — short of the 11-seat benchmark they’ve set.

So the GOP is venturing into places one wouldn’t expect. The stakes are high: Republicans are trying to achieve a governing majority, something that has eluded John Boehner in his tenure as speaker. If they can meet their 11-district goal, Republicans will have 245 seats, their largest delegation since 1949. It would also give the party a buffer heading into a 2016 House election expected to be more generous to Democrats.

Encroaching on the Democratic turf won’t be easy. The upstate New York seat, centered in Syracuse, has been represented the past two years by Democratic Rep. Dan Maffei; Obama carried it by 16 points in 2012.

( Also on POLITICO: Liberal doves run as war hawks)

The NRCC launched ads there in mid-September, with messaging that’s distinct from what the committee has emphasized in more conservative areas. There are no pointed attacks on the president or his health care law. Some of the spots highlight the biography of the GOP candidate, former organized crime prosecutor John Katko.

Republicans face a similar challenge in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District, where they started airing ads this week. Obama won the district by 9 points in 2012 and by 10 points four years earlier. But Republicans contend they’re gaining ground. An independent poll released last weekend actually had the GOP candidate in Maine, former state Treasurer Bruce Poliquin, with a 10-point lead over his Democratic opponent.

The NRCC has booked more than $1 million in advertising time in each of the districts.

The Iowa and Hawaii seats are even harder slogs for the GOP, but party officials say there’s cause for encouragement in both cases. Democrats’ struggles in the Iowa Senate and governor’s races, they argue, could trickle down to the congressional races.

Kevin McCarthy explains why he is n't running for Speaker of the House . The House GOP 's historic implosion McCarthy 's stunning move leaves the House with no apparent line of succession to power .
House Republicans are in a historic state of chaos , torn between two ideological poles with no clear sense of who will serve as their next leader , and no idea of their governing agenda with several legislative battles in the coming weeks .
California Rep. Kevin McCarthy ’ s decision to abandon his bid for speaker Thursday afternoon just moments before a planned closed party election has set off a leadership scramble not seen in more than a decade . What makes this even more extraordinary , though , is there 's no obvious line of succession to power .
McCarthy was dogged by a host of factors . He thought he would win the speakership , but be crippled by the same problems that dogged Speaker John Boehner . He said Republicans created the Select Committee on Benghazi to harm Hillary Clinton ’ s chances of winning the presidency , which alarmed Republicans .
The general consensus inside the House Republican Conference is that there is just one man standing who can garner the 218 votes needed to be speaker : Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan . He has resisted calls to run in the past , but the top two Republicans — Boehner and McCarthy — have asked him to reconsider . He has canceled his fundraising appearances for the next 48 hours , and is considering a bid .
Republicans are floating the names of other lawmakers , including Reps. Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia , Mike Conaway and Bill Flores of Texas , John Kline of Minnesota and Tom Cole of Oklahoma . Some of these men — most notably the retiring Kline — have been mentioned as caretakers of the office until after the 2016 elections . Reps. Daniel Webster of Florida and Jason Chaffetz of Utah , the two men who ran against McCarthy , are still in the race for the speakership .
Because McCarthy will remain majority leader , there will be no race for his position or whip . Reps. Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Tom Price of Georgia have both spent the past several weeks running for the majority leader job . Reps. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina , Pete Sessions of Texas and Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma will all be forced to abandon their campaigns for whip .
Boehner planned to resign effective Oct. 30 , but he says he will now stay on as speaker until Republicans select his successor . Boehner canceled an appearance on NBC ’ s “ The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon ” after McCarthy withdrew from consideration .
The chaos harkens to another dark time for Republicans . In Dec. 1998 , during the impeachment proceedings of President Bill Clinton , Louisiana Rep. Bob Livingston plunged the House into chaos by admitting to extramarital affairs , and resigning from Congress . Livingston was speaker designate , slated to take the job from the outgoing Newt Gingrich . The admission stunned Capitol Hill , and the country .
Rep. Tom Delay of Texas , then majority whip , sensed an opportunity , and rallied his vote-counting operation behind Rep. Dennis Hastert ( R-Ill. ) . Within a matter of hours , while other Republicans hesitated to run for speaker , DeLay lined up the votes for Hastert . The race was over before the other hopefuls could organize .

Kevin McCarthy explains why he isn't running for Speaker of the House. The House GOP's historic implosion McCarthy's stunning move leaves the House with no apparent line of succession to power.

House Republicans are in a historic state of chaos, torn between two ideological poles with no clear sense of who will serve as their next leader, and no idea of their governing agenda with several legislative battles in the coming weeks.

California Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s decision to abandon his bid for speaker Thursday afternoon just moments before a planned closed party election has set off a leadership scramble not seen in more than a decade. What makes this even more extraordinary, though, is there's no obvious line of succession to power.

Story Continued Below

McCarthy was dogged by a host of factors. He thought he would win the speakership, but be crippled by the same problems that dogged Speaker John Boehner. He said Republicans created the Select Committee on Benghazi to harm Hillary Clinton’s chances of winning the presidency, which alarmed Republicans.

Now, the party is searching for a new answer.

The general consensus inside the House Republican Conference is that there is just one man standing who can garner the 218 votes needed to be speaker: Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan. He has resisted calls to run in the past, but the top two Republicans — Boehner and McCarthy — have asked him to reconsider. He has canceled his fundraising appearances for the next 48 hours, and is considering a bid.

Republicans are floating the names of other lawmakers, including Reps. Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia, Mike Conaway and Bill Flores of Texas, John Kline of Minnesota and Tom Cole of Oklahoma. Some of these men — most notably the retiring Kline — have been mentioned as caretakers of the office until after the 2016 elections. Reps. Daniel Webster of Florida and Jason Chaffetz of Utah, the two men who ran against McCarthy, are still in the race for the speakership.

Because McCarthy will remain majority leader, there will be no race for his position or whip. Reps. Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Tom Price of Georgia have both spent the past several weeks running for the majority leader job. Reps. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, Pete Sessions of Texas and Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma will all be forced to abandon their campaigns for whip.

Boehner planned to resign effective Oct. 30, but he says he will now stay on as speaker until Republicans select his successor. Boehner canceled an appearance on NBC’s “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” after McCarthy withdrew from consideration.

The chaos harkens to another dark time for Republicans. In Dec. 1998, during the impeachment proceedings of President Bill Clinton, Louisiana Rep. Bob Livingston plunged the House into chaos by admitting to extramarital affairs, and resigning from Congress. Livingston was speaker designate, slated to take the job from the outgoing Newt Gingrich. The admission stunned Capitol Hill, and the country.

Rep. Tom Delay of Texas, then majority whip, sensed an opportunity, and rallied his vote-counting operation behind Rep. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.). Within a matter of hours, while other Republicans hesitated to run for speaker, DeLay lined up the votes for Hastert. The race was over before the other hopefuls could organize. Hastert helped soothe the battered Republican Conference. To this day, he is the longest-serving Republican speaker.

Seventeen years later, the Republicans need a soothing force once again. And that process will begin Friday morning, when the party retreats to a room in the Capitol basement for a special GOP conference meeting. Party leaders want to get the Republican lawmakers on the same page.

“If we're going to be strong, we need to be united,” McCarthy said at a news conference after his announcement. He said the party needs a “new face,” and he did not want to win the job with the bare minimum level of support.

The conservative House Freedom Caucus continues to loom large. The bloc of roughly 40 Republicans endorsed Webster Wednesday, and vowed to vote together in the closed party election.

That was a key moment for McCarthy, demonstrating to him how difficult the contest would have been, he said. For a period of time, McCarthy considered forcing Republicans to vote in an open ballot to show he could get the 218 votes needed to win the speakership on the floor.

Instead, he stepped down.

Michael Cohen was just the beginning.

President Trump's former personal lawyer named names when he testified before the House oversight committee on Wednesday. He told the panel about Trump Organization personnel with knowledge of what Cohen alleged are criminal or questionable actions within the business.

Cohen's knowledge about the inner workings of the Trump Organization is expansive. The former lawyer, now disbarred in the state of New York, once maintained an office close to Trump's in New York City's Trump Tower.

Now congressional Democrats are turning their attention to other figures in the Trump Organization. Here are the names you need to know.

Felix Sater

Sater is a real estate developer and longtime Trump business associate who was involved in the Trump Organization's efforts to build a Trump Tower project in Moscow. He is scheduled to testify in an open hearing before the House intelligence committee on March 14.

Sater is notable for his previous connections to organized crime and the work he also has reportedly done on behalf of the U.S. government as an undercover informant.

It was Sater who suggested to Cohen and Trump that one way to clear the way for Trump Tower in Moscow might be to offer Russian President Vladimir Putin a free penthouse, according to Cohen.

Republicans battered Cohen over his credibility, and they are likely to do the same with Sater, a man from whom Trump has tried in the past to distance himself.

Allen Weisselberg

The chief financial officer of the Trump Organization has been a key player in all of Trump's business and other dealings. Weisselberg and Donald Trump Jr., for example, signed one of the checks repaying Cohen for the money Cohen paid adult film actress Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet ahead of Election Day in 2016.

The president's three oldest children are among his top advisers and have been a part of all the family's major business dealings, Cohen told lawmakers.

That includes the potential Trump Tower Moscow real estate project. Ivanka Trump and her brother Donald Trump Jr. both were briefed about it repeatedly, Cohen said.

The chairman of the House oversight committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said that Americans following these investigations should follow the names Cohen gave and also that his panel would be interested in interviewing them.

Lieberman is an executive vice president in Trump's company who's responsible for managing many of its subsidiary enterprises, according to his Bloomberg bio.

That includes modeling agencies, real estate and golf courses, and it was in discussing these operations that his name came up in Cohen's testimony, along with that of chief operating officer Calamari.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., asked Cohen about practices he had described involved with inflating the value of assets held by Trump or his companies.

Sometimes Trump overstated the value of his properties to make them appear more valuable and himself seem more wealthy, Cohen said. Sometimes, Cohen said, Trump submitted information to authorities that made his properties seem much less valuable than they actually were, reducing the amount in taxes he would have to pay.

So did Trump ever give inflated information about his assets to an insurance company, Ocasio-Cortez asked — something that could violate the law?

Yes, Cohen said. When asked who could give the committee more information, he recommended Weisselberg, Lieberman and Calamari.

“ Your actions both past and present are incompatible with your duty as Chairman of this Committee , ” the letter stated . “ We have no faith in your ability to discharge your duties in a manner consistent with your Constitutional responsibility and urge your immediate resignation as Chairman of this Committee . ”
The letter follows the conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's Russia probe , which turned up no evidence of collusion between Trump campaign members and Russia during the 2016 presidential election .
President Trump himself went even further than congressional Republicans Thursday morning , tweeting :
“ Congressman Adam Schiff , who spent two years knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking , should be forced to resign from Congress ! ”
Another top Republican , Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , also lambasted Schiff on Thursday - comparing the California lawmaker to director Oliver Stone .
`` He 's made some pretty outrageous comments that Mueller could not verify , Graham said . `` He 's getting into conspiracy land and he 's acting like an Oliver Stone type figure . That to me is not helpful to him but I 'm not going to ask him to resign for Congress . ''
Schiff , a vocal critic of the president , has doubled down on his claim that Trump and his administration colluded with foreign powers despite Mueller ’ s findings .
“ Undoubtedly , there is collusion , ” Schiff told The Washington Post after Attorney General William Barr 's four-page summary of Mueller 's investigation was released Sunday . He told the paper that the question of whether Trump or the people around him were compromised by a hostile foreign power was not in any part of Mueller ’ s report .
SCHIFF FACES MOUNTING GOP CALLS FOR RESIGNATION OVER COLLUSION CLAIMS
The letter to Schiff was sent as those same Republicans confronted Schiff at the start of a Russia-themed hearing Thursday morning .
Rep. Michael Conaway , R-Texas , attacked Schiff for driving a “ false narrative ” about collusion between Trump and Russia and “ undermining the faith ” of the American people . Conaway then went on to demand Schiff immediately resign his committee chairmanship , saying that Republicans on the committee have “ no faith in you . ”
Schiff defended himself during Thursday ’ s hearing – pointing to evidence of Russian hacking during the last presidential election , that Russian operatives offered dirt on Hillary Clinton during the campaign and that members of Trump ’ s campaign and family took meetings with Russians .
“ You might think that ’ s okay that they lied about the meeting , ” Schiff said . “ I don ’ t think that ’ s okay . ”
Schiff on Monday signed a letter with his fellow House committee chairs demanding the full Mueller report by April 2 .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , said earlier this week that the mounting calls to remove Schiff were `` absolutely ridiculous . '' She consulted with Schiff and other committee leaders over the weekend as Barr notified Congress of Mueller 's report and summarized the details .
A Pelosi aide said Schiff was being attacked because he 's done `` an outstanding job . ''
`` Democrats are n't going to be intimidated by the White House or Congressional Republicans , '' spokeswoman Ashley Etienne said . `` We 're not going to be distracted from securing the release of the full Mueller report and the underlying evidence , and we will continue to pursue legitimate oversight because that 's what the Constitution requires .

us_house,The Hill,1,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/426525-momentum-for-earmarks-grows-with-dem-majority,Momentum for earmarks grows with Dem majority,2019-01-23,,"With Democrats back in control of the House after eight years of Republican control , there is strong support for reviving earmarks — the power to direct money on pet projects — which caused a major scandal in Congress during the George W. Bush years .
Senate and House lawmakers from both parties predict there will be a serious push to bring back earmarks once the government shutdown is finally over — with one exception .
Earmarks is a dirty word , so if the specially allocated funds return , they will be referred to as “ congressionally directed spending . ”
Support for bringing back earmarks is not unanimous , but it is growing in both parties as Republicans and Democrats alike say too much power has shifted to the presidency .
“ When you discontinue earmarks , you ’ re saying the administration can better spend the money in my district . They know best what we need , ” said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver ( D-Mo . ) .
He said it is “ not just some , it is the majority ” in the House Democratic Caucus that back ending the earmark ban .
“ Based on what I ’ m hearing , on the other side , they too believe it was a mistake to discontinue earmarks , ” he said of his GOP colleagues .
At the same time , he says the internal discussions have been muted because of the partial government shutdown .
“ This is not a good time to talk about earmarks , ” he said .

Congressional earmarks reached their peak in the middle of Bush ’ s administration , when the fiscal 2005 defense spending bill included 2,506 earmarks worth $ 9 billion and the energy and water development bill included 2,313 earmarks worth $ 4.9 billion , according to the Congressional Research Service .
The proliferation of earmarks fueled the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal and led to the downfall of former Rep. Randy “ Duke ” Cunningham ( R-Calif. ) , who was sentenced to eight years in prison after pleading guilty to directing federal spending after receiving bribes from lobbyists .
The explosion in earmarks prompted a backlash that helped Democrats win control of the House in 2006 .
Yet the practice continued unabated under former President Obama and a Democratic Congress .
The fiscal 2009 omnibus spending package included 9,000 earmarks totaling $ 5 billion .

They think that if individual members of Congress have more power to direct federal resources back to their home states and districts , they are more likely to agree to bipartisan compromises and pass bills .
A spokeswoman for Shelby noted that the rules package passed by the new House Democratic majority did not include a prohibition on congressionally directed spending .
“ I think it ’ s not coincidental that the appropriations system and other legislative [ process ] dramatically deteriorated in their ability to produce a result at the same time that the Congress stopped directing the administration as to how money should be spent , ” said Blunt , who also chairs the Senate Republican Policy Committee .
One of the strongest proponents of earmarks is House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer Steny Hamilton Hoyer Hoyer calls GOP efforts to out whistleblower 'despicable ' Live coverage : House holds first public impeachment hearing Congress hunts for path out of spending stalemate MORE ( D-Md . ) , who like Pelosi served as a member of the House Appropriations Committee .
Hoyer says earmarks or congressionally directed spending should be allowed , albeit with reforms to make it tougher to secure shady deals for lobbyists or lawmakers ’ personal gain .
“ I strongly support restoring Congressionally directed spending with the reforms that Democrats put in place when we previously had the majority to ensure transparency and accountability , ” he said in a statement to ███ .
Hoyer noted that when Democrats controlled the House from 2007 to 2010 , they adopted reforms to prevent a return to the scandals of Abramoff ’ s days .
“ Those reforms included eliminating projects going to for-profit entities , requiring members to certify that they had no financial interest in their requests , and ensuring that members post all of their requests along with a justification for each project on their congressional websites , ” he said .
Hoyer said he and his Democratic colleagues will be “ discussing a path forward ” in the weeks ahead .
But while there is growing enthusiasm in the House for bringing back earmarks , some Senate Republicans remain skeptical .
“ I don ’ t think there is sentiment among [ Senate ] Republicans to change our rules and we ’ re in the majority . I think it ’ s something that a lot of our members feel strongly about , ” said Senate Republican Whip John Thune John Randolph ThuneSenate GOP waves Trump off early motion to dismiss impeachment charges Trump encounters GOP resistance to investigating Hunter Biden Republicans warn election results are 'wake-up call ' for Trump MORE ( S.D . ) .

Bush years.

Senate and House lawmakers from both parties predict there will be a serious push to bring back earmarks once the government shutdown is finally over — with one exception.

Earmarks is a dirty word, so if the specially allocated funds return, they will be referred to as “congressionally directed spending.”

Support for bringing back earmarks is not unanimous, but it is growing in both parties as Republicans and Democrats alike say too much power has shifted to the presidency.

“When you discontinue earmarks, you’re saying the administration can better spend the money in my district. They know best what we need,” said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.).

He said it is “not just some, it is the majority” in the House Democratic Caucus that back ending the earmark ban.

“Based on what I’m hearing, on the other side, they too believe it was a mistake to discontinue earmarks,” he said of his GOP colleagues.

At the same time, he says the internal discussions have been muted because of the partial government shutdown.

“This is not a good time to talk about earmarks,” he said.

Other lawmakers also expressed support for bringing back earmarks.

“The idea of member-directed funds, I think it’s a good idea. I know that I was always proud to have press conferences and press releases on all the things I did,” she said.

Schakowsky said the Democratic caucus should “have that conversation” after the shutdown ends.

“This is something that was clearly set out in the Constitution as the role of the legislative branch,” she says of the power to direct spending to specific projects. “Nowhere does it say, you think about what these priorities are going to be and then give it up to the [federal] agencies to determine what the priority is.”

Congressional earmarks reached their peak in the middle of Bush’s administration, when the fiscal 2005 defense spending bill included 2,506 earmarks worth $9 billion and the energy and water development bill included 2,313 earmarks worth $4.9 billion, according to the Congressional Research Service.

The proliferation of earmarks fueled the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal and led to the downfall of former Rep. Randy “Duke” Cunningham (R-Calif.), who was sentenced to eight years in prison after pleading guilty to directing federal spending after receiving bribes from lobbyists.

The explosion in earmarks prompted a backlash that helped Democrats win control of the House in 2006.

Yet the practice continued unabated under former President Obama and a Democratic Congress.

The fiscal 2009 omnibus spending package included 9,000 earmarks totaling $5 billion.

The practice came to a screeching halt in November 2010, after Republicans took control of the House in the Tea Party revolution and Speaker John Boehner John Andrew BoehnerFrom learning on his feet to policy director Is Congress retrievable?

Obama declared in his January 2011 State of the Union that “if a bill comes to my desk with earmarks in it, I will veto it. I will veto it.”

But the ensuing six years of Obama’s presidency was one of the most legislatively unproductive stretches in recent years, marked by stalemates over what had previously been considered routine business, such as raising the nation’s debt limit and funding the government.

They think that if individual members of Congress have more power to direct federal resources back to their home states and districts, they are more likely to agree to bipartisan compromises and pass bills.

A spokeswoman for Shelby noted that the rules package passed by the new House Democratic majority did not include a prohibition on congressionally directed spending.

“I think it’s not coincidental that the appropriations system and other legislative [process] dramatically deteriorated in their ability to produce a result at the same time that the Congress stopped directing the administration as to how money should be spent,” said Blunt, who also chairs the Senate Republican Policy Committee.

One of the strongest proponents of earmarks is House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer Steny Hamilton Hoyer Hoyer calls GOP efforts to out whistleblower 'despicable' Live coverage: House holds first public impeachment hearing Congress hunts for path out of spending stalemate MORE (D-Md.), who like Pelosi served as a member of the House Appropriations Committee.

Hoyer says earmarks or congressionally directed spending should be allowed, albeit with reforms to make it tougher to secure shady deals for lobbyists or lawmakers’ personal gain.

“I strongly support restoring Congressionally directed spending with the reforms that Democrats put in place when we previously had the majority to ensure transparency and accountability,” he said in a statement to The Hill.

Hoyer noted that when Democrats controlled the House from 2007 to 2010, they adopted reforms to prevent a return to the scandals of Abramoff’s days.

“Those reforms included eliminating projects going to for-profit entities, requiring members to certify that they had no financial interest in their requests, and ensuring that members post all of their requests along with a justification for each project on their congressional websites,” he said.

Hoyer said he and his Democratic colleagues will be “discussing a path forward” in the weeks ahead.

But while there is growing enthusiasm in the House for bringing back earmarks, some Senate Republicans remain skeptical.

“I don’t think there is sentiment among [Senate] Republicans to change our rules and we’re in the majority.

Ever since Nancy Pelosi announced last week that she was instructing the Judiciary Committee to draft articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, speculation swirled as to what exactly they would look like.

Would they be broad, sweeping in a hodgepodge of alleged presidential misdeeds that include evidence gathered over the course of Mr Trump's three-year presidency? Or would they go narrow, and focus primarily on this latest Ukraine controversy.

Now we have our answer. Narrow it is.

Democrats probably decided to, as the saying goes, ""keep it simple, stupid"".

They have what they hope will be an easy to understand case of presidential abuse of power, by using the vast tools of foreign policy at his disposal for personal political gain. As a backstop to these charges, they are accusing the president of attempting to obstruct Congress's investigation by denying relevant documents and witness testimony.

At stake, they will argue, is the security of the 2020 presidential election and the protection of congressional authority as a co-equal branch of government.

The main script from here appears clear - a quick vote in the Judiciary Committee, followed by one on the floor of the House of Representatives; presidential impeachment and a Senate trial.

In the meantime, much to the consternation of some liberals, congressional Democrats will move to hand the president a policy victory - by approving his renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

And during all of this, a fever of allegations and accusations continue to swirl and threaten to erupt and disrupt the process in one way or another. There's claims of intelligence agency misconduct in its investigation of 2016 Trump-Russia ties, presidential Twitter barbs at his own FBI director, criminal investigations of the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and much more.

While the main script may be clear, beneath the surface unpredictability is the only predictable result.

Republicans claim Democrats knew ahead of time what the president ’ s former personal lawyer was planning to testify to on Capitol Hill , voicing concern of cooperation — and even coaching — between Cohen and the committee majorities .
Democrats have strongly rejected these claims , stating that meeting in advance with potential witnesses is standard practice for committees conducting investigations .
One such clash took place over the weekend when conservative Rep. Mark Meadows Mark Randall MeadowsDemocrats seize on new evidence in first public impeachment hearing House Republicans call impeachment hearing 'boring , ' dismiss Taylor testimony as hearsay Key takeaways from first public impeachment hearing MORE ( R-N.C. ) accused House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffGraham : Senate trial 'must expose the whistleblower ' Graham says Schiff should be a witness in Trump impeachment trial Democrats seize on new evidence in first public impeachment hearing MORE ( D-Calif. ) of meeting with Cohen for 10 hours ahead of his planned testimony .
“ Before Michael Cohen ’ s testimony last week , he and Adam Schiff met for TEN hours . But last Sunday , Schiff told CBS his only contact with Cohen was to ‘ invite him to testify ’ and ‘ allay concerns. ’ Really ? That took 10 hours ? ” Meadows said on Friday in a tweet , which President Trump Donald John TrumpGOP senators balk at lengthy impeachment trial Warren goes local in race to build 2020 movement 2020 Democrats make play for veterans ' votes MORE then retweeted .
“ Did Democrats lead the witness ? ” continued Meadows , a member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee .
“ Sorry , Mr. Trump and Mr. Meadows . I was not part of any of the staff proffer sessions with Mr. Cohen , ” Schiff tweeted .
“ You really should be more careful about making or propagating false statements if you wish to condemn Cohen and others , ” he added .
Lanny Davis , a spokesman and attorney for Cohen , also weighed in , telling ███ that Schiff “ did not ” attend the pretestimony interviews and adding that “ Mr . Meadows is in the habit of accusing first [ and looking ] for facts second . ”
A source familiar with the situation confirmed that Cohen met with Democratic staffers four separate times , for a total of 10 hours . The Daily Beast first reported the length of their interviews .
During these interviews , Cohen largely went over the text of his prior 2017 testimony with the congressional investigators , the source said .
But Meadows doubled down Monday , while also attacking Cohen on his credibility .
“ You would think after prepping with Adam Schiff ’ s team for 10+ hours , Mr. Cohen could make it through a hearing without lying to Congress ... again . Apparently not , ” Meadows tweeted .
Republicans have argued that Cohen can not be trusted to tell the truth because he is a known liar who has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress .
Other Democrats on the Intelligence panel came to Schiff ’ s defense .

Eric Swalwell Eric Michael SwalwellKey takeaways from first public impeachment hearing Kent , Taylor say they 're not 'Never Trumpers ' after Trump Twitter offensive Live coverage : House holds first public impeachment hearing MORE ( D-Calif. ) tweeted Saturday .

A source familiar with the matter maintained that “ only topics ” were discussed in advance of Cohen ’ s testimony , not “ answers to any questions . ”
“ Speaking to congressional staff before a witness testifies is commonly done and appropriate , ” the source told ███ . “ The meetings with Mr. Cohen were to allow him to reread his prior testimony . In addition , Mr. Cohen has been willing to meet with Republican staffers and members ahead of the testimony . Congressional [ staffers ] traveled to New York to see him as a courtesy because he was sick . ”
An Oversight committee source indicated that Cohen also spoke to Republican committee staff ahead of the hearing .
Former Rep. Tom Davis ( R-Va. ) , who served as chairman of the then-House Government Reform Committee from 2003 to 2007 , said this is a practice that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have used with witnesses over the past 30 years — and one that will likely occur again in the future .
“ It is not best practices , but it is not uncommon . And what I found out is Democrats screamed when Republicans did it , and now Republicans are obviously doing the same thing , ” Tom Davis told ███ in an interview , calling it both a “ legitimate ” concern and a complaint .
“ I don ’ t think this is the last time that this will happen . But look , the disadvantage is that whenever you do that , you make yourself vulnerable to charges of coaching the witness . That is the downside . Maybe you were and maybe you weren ’ t , nobody is there to know , ” he continued .
He said while it does not help with bipartisan relations , it can help the majority prove their point , as the public hearing before the House Oversight and Reform Committee did .
“ It certainly allows the majority in this case to be able to get their witness across and prove their point . And this was a star witness for them . You haven ’ t seen more cameras up there in a long , long time ... So , you want to make sure , at least , your star witness is going to support your claims or your narrative , ” Tom Davis said .
“ They want to make sure this runs smoothly , and I think they are going to want to know in advance what he is likely to say so they can elicit it in public , ” he said .
Judicial Watch , a right-leaning government watchdog group , has seized on the Republicans ’ concerns , filing a complaint against Schiff that asks the head of the Office of Congressional Ethics ( OCE ) to investigate whether the Intelligence chairman inappropriately interacted with witnesses .
“ We call upon the OCE to investigate Rep. Schiff and his previously undisclosed , inappropriate contact with key witnesses in congressional investigation over which that Member holds significant sway , ” reads the Judicial Watch complaint , which was addressed to OCE Chairman David Skaggs .
“ Rep . Schiff ’ s conduct creates the appearance of unethical collusion and synchronization of efforts that calls into question whether Cohen ’ s testimony was a legitimate congressional hearing or well-rehearsed political theatre , ” it continues .
Meadows ’ s tweet came two days after Rep. Michael Turner ( R-Ohio ) , a member of the Intelligence Committee , pressed Cohen on whether he “ coordinated ” with Democrats or their aides to help him prepare his statements .
“ Clearly , there will be questions as to whether or not such contacts , if they occurred , constitute witness tampering , obstruction of justice , or collusion , collaboration , and cooperation between the House Democratic majority , their staff , and you , ” reads the letter Turner delivered to Cohen while he was testifying before the panel for a second time .
Turner , who asked Cohen to answer a series of questions regarding the extent of contact he had with Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence committees as well as the House Oversight and Reform Committee , noted that Cohen acknowledged to lawmakers during his Oversight hearing that he had contact with Schiff prior to his testimony .
“ Were any such meetings helpful to Cohen in the preparation of his statements ? ” he asked .
“ If these meetings occurred , did Democratic members or staff assist Cohen in preparation of his statements ? ”
Cohen ’ s Oversight testimony was public , but he met privately with the House Intelligence Committee twice .
Other lawmakers circled around whether Cohen met with Democratic staff ahead of his testimony on ███ .

Republicans claim Democrats knew ahead of time what the president’s former personal lawyer was planning to testify to on Capitol Hill, voicing concern of cooperation — and even coaching — between Cohen and the committee majorities.

Democrats have strongly rejected these claims, stating that meeting in advance with potential witnesses is standard practice for committees conducting investigations.

One such clash took place over the weekend when conservative Rep.

“Before Michael Cohen’s testimony last week, he and Adam Schiff met for TEN hours. But last Sunday, Schiff told CBS his only contact with Cohen was to ‘invite him to testify’ and ‘allay concerns.’ Really? That took 10 hours?” Meadows said on Friday in a tweet, which President Trump Donald John TrumpGOP senators balk at lengthy impeachment trial Warren goes local in race to build 2020 movement 2020 Democrats make play for veterans' votes MORE then retweeted.

“Did Democrats lead the witness?” continued Meadows, a member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee.

Schiff fired back, calling Meadows’s claims “false.”

“Sorry, Mr. Trump and Mr. Meadows. I was not part of any of the staff proffer sessions with Mr. Cohen,” Schiff tweeted.

“You really should be more careful about making or propagating false statements if you wish to condemn Cohen and others,” he added.

Lanny Davis, a spokesman and attorney for Cohen, also weighed in, telling The Hill that Schiff “did not” attend the pretestimony interviews and adding that “Mr. Meadows is in the habit of accusing first [and looking] for facts second.”

A source familiar with the situation confirmed that Cohen met with Democratic staffers four separate times, for a total of 10 hours. The Daily Beast first reported the length of their interviews.

During these interviews, Cohen largely went over the text of his prior 2017 testimony with the congressional investigators, the source said.

But Meadows doubled down Monday, while also attacking Cohen on his credibility.

“You would think after prepping with Adam Schiff’s team for 10+ hours, Mr. Cohen could make it through a hearing without lying to Congress... again. Apparently not,” Meadows tweeted.

Republicans have argued that Cohen cannot be trusted to tell the truth because he is a known liar who has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress.

Other Democrats on the Intelligence panel came to Schiff’s defense.

“Now THIS is a false statement. They never met before. Rep. Mark Meadows should delete this tweet & apologize,” Rep. Eric Swalwell Eric Michael SwalwellKey takeaways from first public impeachment hearing Kent, Taylor say they're not 'Never Trumpers' after Trump Twitter offensive Live coverage: House holds first public impeachment hearing MORE (D-Calif.) tweeted Saturday.

“Mark, I was in the room. No one said Adam met with Cohen for 10 hours. That didn’t happen. Will you take down your post?” Rep. Jim Himes James (Jim) Andres HimesThe Hill's 12:30 Report: Dems, GOP dig in for public impeachment hearings The Hill's Morning Report - Witness transcripts plow ground for public impeachment testimony Democrats sharpen their message on impeachment MORE (D-Conn.) also wrote on Twitter.

A source familiar with the matter maintained that “only topics” were discussed in advance of Cohen’s testimony, not “answers to any questions.”

“Speaking to congressional staff before a witness testifies is commonly done and appropriate,” the source told The Hill. “The meetings with Mr. Cohen were to allow him to reread his prior testimony. In addition, Mr. Cohen has been willing to meet with Republican staffers and members ahead of the testimony. Congressional [staffers] traveled to New York to see him as a courtesy because he was sick.”

An Oversight committee source indicated that Cohen also spoke to Republican committee staff ahead of the hearing.

Former Rep. Tom Davis (R-Va.), who served as chairman of the then-House Government Reform Committee from 2003 to 2007, said this is a practice that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have used with witnesses over the past 30 years — and one that will likely occur again in the future.

“It is not best practices, but it is not uncommon. And what I found out is Democrats screamed when Republicans did it, and now Republicans are obviously doing the same thing,” Tom Davis told The Hill in an interview, calling it both a “legitimate” concern and a complaint.

“I don’t think this is the last time that this will happen. But look, the disadvantage is that whenever you do that, you make yourself vulnerable to charges of coaching the witness. That is the downside. Maybe you were and maybe you weren’t, nobody is there to know,” he continued.

He said while it does not help with bipartisan relations, it can help the majority prove their point, as the public hearing before the House Oversight and Reform Committee did.

“It certainly allows the majority in this case to be able to get their witness across and prove their point. And this was a star witness for them. You haven’t seen more cameras up there in a long, long time ... So, you want to make sure, at least, your star witness is going to support your claims or your narrative,” Tom Davis said.

“They want to make sure this runs smoothly, and I think they are going to want to know in advance what he is likely to say so they can elicit it in public,” he said.

Judicial Watch, a right-leaning government watchdog group, has seized on the Republicans’ concerns, filing a complaint against Schiff that asks the head of the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) to investigate whether the Intelligence chairman inappropriately interacted with witnesses.

“We call upon the OCE to investigate Rep. Schiff and his previously undisclosed, inappropriate contact with key witnesses in congressional investigation over which that Member holds significant sway,” reads the Judicial Watch complaint, which was addressed to OCE Chairman David Skaggs.

“Rep. Schiff’s conduct creates the appearance of unethical collusion and synchronization of efforts that calls into question whether Cohen’s testimony was a legitimate congressional hearing or well-rehearsed political theatre,” it continues.

Meadows’s tweet came two days after Rep. Michael Turner (R-Ohio), a member of the Intelligence Committee, pressed Cohen on whether he “coordinated” with Democrats or their aides to help him prepare his statements.

“Clearly, there will be questions as to whether or not such contacts, if they occurred, constitute witness tampering, obstruction of justice, or collusion, collaboration, and cooperation between the House Democratic majority, their staff, and you,” reads the letter Turner delivered to Cohen while he was testifying before the panel for a second time.

Turner, who asked Cohen to answer a series of questions regarding the extent of contact he had with Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence committees as well as the House Oversight and Reform Committee, noted that Cohen acknowledged to lawmakers during his Oversight hearing that he had contact with Schiff prior to his testimony.

“Were any such meetings helpful to Cohen in the preparation of his statements?” he asked.

“If these meetings occurred, did Democratic members or staff assist Cohen in preparation of his statements?”

Cohen’s Oversight testimony was public, but he met privately with the House Intelligence Committee twice.

Other lawmakers circled around whether Cohen met with Democratic staff ahead of his testimony on the Hill.

“Did you or anyone else on your team cooperate with the Democratic Party in preparing for this hearing?” Hice asked Cohen last week.

“We’ve spoken to the party,” Cohen replied.

Jordan later followed up on Hice’s questioning, asking: “Have you spoken to Chairman [Jerrold] Nadler or anyone on his staff or have any of your attorneys spoken to Chairman Nadler?”

Cohen said “no” he had not had such conversations, while also noting that he is “not aware” what conversations his legal team had, but he said he will ask them.

Patrick Boland, a Democratic spokesman for the House Intelligence Committee, described last week that the process of meeting a witness ahead of time as standard and “appropriate.”

`` This includes , but is not limited to , all summaries , exhibits , indices , tables of contents or other tables or figures , appendices , supplements , addenda or any other attachments whether written or attached in a separate electronic format , '' the subpoena says .
Nadler 's push comes a day after a redacted version of the report was made public . The White House has hailed the report , which found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government in 2016 , as a victory .
But Democrats have pointed to Mueller 's review of 10 instances where Trump may be considered to have obstructed justice -- although the special counsel did not conclude that Trump committed a crime -- as well as other details in the report as justification for Congress to see the full report , and for Mueller to testify to Congress .
Nadler and other Democrats have been particularly opposed to Attorney General William Barr 's decision to release a redacted version of the report to Congress . Barr said that he , along with special counsel , identified four areas of the report that needed redactions , including grand jury material , information the intelligence community believes would reveal intelligence sources and methods , any material that could interfere with ongoing prosecutions , and information that could implicate the privacy or reputational interests of “ peripheral players . ”
TRUMP CAMPAIGN GOES ON POST-MUELLER ATTACK AGAINST 'OBAMA-ERA DOJ AND FBI , ' WARNS 'JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED '
But Nadler has claimed that the committee needs to see the full report , as well as the underlying evidence , in order to determine any further action they may choose to take against the president or his associates .
`` My Committee needs and is entitled to the full version of the report and the underlying evidence consistent with past practice , '' he said in a statement . `` The redactions appear to be significant . We have so far seen none of the actual evidence that the Special Counsel developed to make this case . Even the redacted version of the report outlines serious instances of wrongdoing by President Trump and some of his closest associates . It now falls to Congress to determine the full scope of the alleged misconduct and to decide what steps we must take going forward . ''
Nadler is requesting the information on May 1 , a day before Barr is set to appear before the House Judiciary Committee . If the Justice Department does n't respond , Democrats could hold officials in contempt of Congress or fight it out in court . Nadler 's committee also holds the power to launch impeachment proceedings , something that a number of House Democrats and 2020 presidential hopefuls have indicated they may support .
Republicans immediately pushed back on Nadler 's demand . Ranking Member Doug Collins , R-Ga. , accused him of `` rushing to subpoena material '' and of disregarding `` good faith transparency without even taking the department up on its offer to review material under the redactions . ''
`` As a result , today 's subpoena is wildly overbroad , '' he said . `` It commands the department to provide Congress with millions of records that would be plainly against the law to share because the vast majority of these documents came as a result of nearly 2,800 subpoenas from a grand jury that is still ongoing . ''","House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., issued a subpoena Friday to obtain the ""complete and unredacted"" version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia report, as well as the underlying materials -- the next step in what is almost certain to be a lengthy political and legal battle between Democrats and Republicans over the report.

MUELLER REPORT IGNITES NEW DEM BATTLE OVER IMPEACHMENT

Nadler's push comes a day after a redacted version of the report was made public. The White House has hailed the report, which found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government in 2016, as a victory.

But Democrats have pointed to Mueller's review of 10 instances where Trump may be considered to have obstructed justice -- although the special counsel did not conclude that Trump committed a crime -- as well as other details in the report as justification for Congress to see the full report, and for Mueller to testify to Congress.

Nadler and other Democrats have been particularly opposed to Attorney General William Barr's decision to release a redacted version of the report to Congress. Barr said that he, along with special counsel, identified four areas of the report that needed redactions, including grand jury material, information the intelligence community believes would reveal intelligence sources and methods, any material that could interfere with ongoing prosecutions, and information that could implicate the privacy or reputational interests of “peripheral players.”

TRUMP CAMPAIGN GOES ON POST-MUELLER ATTACK AGAINST 'OBAMA-ERA DOJ AND FBI,' WARNS 'JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED'

But Nadler has claimed that the committee needs to see the full report, as well as the underlying evidence, in order to determine any further action they may choose to take against the president or his associates.

""My Committee needs and is entitled to the full version of the report and the underlying evidence consistent with past practice,"" he said in a statement. ""The redactions appear to be significant. We have so far seen none of the actual evidence that the Special Counsel developed to make this case. Even the redacted version of the report outlines serious instances of wrongdoing by President Trump and some of his closest associates. It now falls to Congress to determine the full scope of the alleged misconduct and to decide what steps we must take going forward.""

Nadler is requesting the information on May 1, a day before Barr is set to appear before the House Judiciary Committee. If the Justice Department doesn't respond, Democrats could hold officials in contempt of Congress or fight it out in court. Nadler's committee also holds the power to launch impeachment proceedings, something that a number of House Democrats and 2020 presidential hopefuls have indicated they may support.

Republicans immediately pushed back on Nadler's demand. Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., accused him of ""rushing to subpoena material"" and of disregarding ""good faith transparency without even taking the department up on its offer to review material under the redactions.""

""As a result, today's subpoena is wildly overbroad,"" he said. ""It commands the department to provide Congress with millions of records that would be plainly against the law to share because the vast majority of these documents came as a result of nearly 2,800 subpoenas from a grand jury that is still ongoing.""

WASHINGTON — Congressional approval ratings hover at historic lows. The Republican Party's brand has tanked. More people than ever think their own congressman should be sent packing. And the most notable act in one of the most unproductive legislative periods on record was shutting down the government for 16 days.

Yet Republicans are forecast to pick up as many as a dozen U.S. House seats this November, strengthening their grip on the House majority. ""I'd rather be us than them,"" crows Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., who chairs the House GOP's 2014 campaign operation.

Democrats say they expect to make gains in the House, but Republicans have a host of built-in advantages this year, including:

• Recently redrawn districts have resulted in fewer competitive seats.

• Historical midterm-election-year trends indicate a limited Democratic turnout.

• President Obama's waning popularity is part of a political climate suggesting that Democrats cannot expect a ""wave"" election to turn the tide in their favor.

Democrats and Republicans are locked in a competitive struggle over who will control the U.S. Senate next year. But barring a seismic political event between now and Election Day, the GOP's control of the U.S. House is not in question. Here's why.

If it ain't got that swing

It's hard to win the hand when the deck is stacked.

In 2012, congressional district lines were redrawn, as is constitutionally required every 10 years, based on population shifts. Republicans had the upper hand in many states after the GOP won control of governorships and state legislatures following the 2010 Tea Party wave. The end result has been a precipitous drop in the number of competitive seats and a rise in the number of seats considered so safely Republican or Democratic that they are unlikely to ever switch party control.

Today, roughly 50 districts in the 435-member House make up the entirety of the 2014 battleground.

The non-partisan Cook Political Report ranks just 16 of those districts, 13 held by Democrats and three by Republicans, as competitive enough that neither party has a clear advantage with fewer than 100 days to go before Election Day.

The current House makeup includes 234 Republicans and 199 Democrats, and there are two vacant seats that are safely Democratic. That means Democrats need a net gain of 17 seats for a takeover. They'd have to pick up 17 Republican seats and lose none of their own, or make even greater gains in GOP territory to make up for any losses.

Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., who runs the House Democrats' campaign operation, maintains that the election climate is still unfolding. He believes Democrats could easily benefit from mounting voter frustration at the House GOP's ongoing struggles with governing. ""You're going into a midterm election with voter revulsion aimed at Republicans,"" he says.

At a recent roundtable with reporters, Israel would not concede that Republicans will maintain control, but he stopped short of predicting a Democratic majority. ""My job is not to get hung up in punditry but to obsess on what's in my control,"" he says.

However, he agreed that Democrats need to do a better job in the next round of redistricting to level the playing field.

""We have to be smart and better going in to the 2020 redistricting, I will say that,"" he says.

The downside for Democrats?

They won't have a chance to run in new, redesigned districts until the 2022 elections.

The midterm voter

To Democrats' advantage, their long-term future includes a broader, more diverse and expanding base of young people, women and minorities.

To Democrats' detriment, their voters are less likely to show up in midterm elections than Republicans' older and whiter base.

To Democrats' 2014 peril, this year is on track to maintain that trend.

""I am absolutely sure (turnout) will be lower than 2010 or 2006,"" says Curtis Gans, an expert on voter turnout. While Gans is more bullish on Democrats' prospects than most election handicappers, he also maintains that Democrats can't take back the House this year.

""The Democrats could make a very good case that they've done some things and Republicans have done nothing but obstruct,"" Gans says. ""When you have a Congress with a 7% approval rating, at some point, that's got to take a toll.""

No wave in sight

In order to take back the House, Democrats would need a ""wave"" election in which one party enjoys dramatic political gains. But there is no wave on the horizon, largely because of the president's unpopularity. There have been only four times in the past two decades in which the House saw a net seat change in the double digits. In those four election years — 1994, 2006, 2008 and 2010 — the wave was fueled by backlash against the incumbent president's party.

Republicans won control of the U.S. House under President Clinton in 1994; Democrats won control back and increased their majority under President Bush in 2006 and 2008. Republicans returned to the majority in 2010 with the Tea Party-inspired wave under Obama. The prospect of 2014 becoming a wave election year benefiting congressional Democrats is more than just unlikely. It would be unprecedented in modern politics.

Obama and the six-year itch

Democrats are also facing a trend commonly known as the ""six-year itch,"" in which the president's party historically loses seats in Congress. Not all presidents have fallen victim to it — Clinton enjoyed congressional gains in 1998 — but Obama is not expected to experience a repeat, and Clinton's gains were not enough to switch party control.

While Obama has worked to build the campaign war chests of the House and Senate Democratic campaign operations this year, he's been largely absent on the campaign trail, where Democrats in tight races are seeking to portray themselves as independent of the president and his agenda. ""They have to run from their leaders; they cannot embrace them,"" Walden said. ""The only thing they can embrace is the fundraising.""

Thirty-two Democrats voted against nominating Pelosi for speaker by secret ballot , even though she was running unopposed . Pelosi ’ s next big vote is in front of the entire House on January 3 , and she needs to flip at least 18 of her dissenters to win .
After sweeping the House in a wave election , Democrats are trying to unite against President Donald Trump and behind Pelosi . But Pelosi ’ s decades of leadership experience — the foundation behind the pitch she is making to members as to why she should remain in the top spot — is spurring a small rebellion .
Pelosi and the No . 2 and No . 3 House Democrats Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn all ran unopposed on Wednesday . Pelosi was cutting deals up to the last minute before the vote to gather as much support as possible behind her , but not everyone was on board . Though the 32 no votes are far fewer than the 63 Democrats who voted against her for minority leader just two years ago , it ’ s a signal that a number of House Democrats want Pelosi and her longtime deputies to step aside .
Directly before the speaker ’ s vote , Pelosi met with three of her most vocal Democratic opponents : Reps. Seth Moulton ( MA ) , Kathleen Rice ( NY ) , and Tim Ryan ( OH ) . Moulton and Rice in particular pressed Pelosi on whether she would provide a clear transition plan ahead of 2020 , opening up the path for a new leader to emerge .
“ People need to know when this leadership team plans on turning the reins over to the next generation of leaders , ” Rice told reporters .
“ Unfortunately , our concerns were dismissed outright , ” she said in a statement .
Nevertheless , the Pelosi era , which began more than a decade ago , is extremely likely to continue when Congress reconvenes in January .
The Democratic leader sounded as confident as ever when she stepped to the microphone and declared victory at a press conference — even as the votes were still being counted .
Pelosi faces some of her strongest criticism from freshmen and other young members , so it was significant that the Democratic leader was nominated by Rep. Joe Kennedy ( MA ) , a young Congress member who argued Pelosi had the experience to build consensus in the party and fight back against Trump .
The symbolism of Kennedy , who is from the same state as “ Never Nancy ” movement leader Seth Moulton , wasn ’ t lost on people .
Other young members agreed with Kennedy , laying out reasons why they backed Pelosi .
“ She is a brilliant leader , someone who has the experience , the tenacity and determination to lead us in a direction that ’ s going to produce prosperity for all Americans , ” said Rep.-elect Ilhan Omar ( MN ) . “ I think at a time where we are at a dangerous crossroads at our country it ’ s going to be necessary to have someone who has the experience to take on this administration and fight back and make sure we have the checks and balances that are needed . ”
Rep. Eric Swalwell ( CA ) , another Democrat who spoke on Pelosi ’ s behalf in the closed-door caucus meeting Tuesday , said he ’ s been actively encouraging other young Democrats to back Pelosi and existing leadership .
“ The case to me is , we just won the Super Bowl of midterms , ” Swalwell told ███ . “ In the history of the Super Bowl , no coach has been fired after the Gatorade ’ s been dumped on him . Let ’ s keep the person that got us here , but also , she ’ s just the most effective person . ”
There ’ s new blood in leadership — but not at the top
It was telling that the most competitive leadership races were for lower-ranking slots : Democratic Caucus chair , vice chair , and chair of the Democratic Congressional Committee . Some contested races were about the left versus the establishment , but they were also about representation of younger members , women , and people of color in the House .
The Caucus chair election was the day ’ s first and most contentious race , as Rep. Hakeem Jeffries ( NY ) beat Rep. Barbara Lee ( CA ) . Lee and Jeffries are both members of the Congressional Black Caucus , but Lee later agreed that “ ageism and sexism ” were at play in her loss . ( Lee is 72 years old ; Jeffries is 48 . )
“ I absolutely think that ’ s the case , ” she told reporters . “ I ’ m a black woman and the institutional barriers are still there , so we just keep fighting . ”
Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus had backed Lee , a former Progressive Caucus chair . Rep. Pramila Jayapal ( WA ) , one of the caucus ’ s current co-chairs , said she had hoped to make history as the first African-American woman chair of the Democratic caucus .
“ I take some issue with generational change being just about age , I think it should be about ideas that resonate with young people across the country , ” Jayapal said . “ I hoped the results of this election — powered by black women , voters of color , and women — would have some resonance to this race . ”
Jeffries and new Assistant Democratic Leader Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico , 46 , are two young , diverse additions to the leadership team . But their additions aren ’ t enough to placate Democrats who hoped to see new blood at the very top of leadership .
Even though the Progressive Caucus was disappointed at the outcome of the caucus chair ’ s race , the group has thrown its full support behind the Pelosi , Hoyer , and Clyburn team . For now , Jayapal and others have resolved themselves to wait on generational change .
Pelosi now has a little over a month to whip the remaining votes she needs to become speaker . She needs to flip 18 of those votes — she can afford to lose 17 votes and still win .
Pelosi ’ s allies hope the secret ballot vote today can give members who oppose her the chance to vote no in secret to fulfill their promise to voters in their districts , and that they will turn around and vote yes in public on the floor on January .
But a few freshmen reiterated voting yes still wasn ’ t an option .
“ I will not break my pledge when the vote comes to the floor , ” Rep.-elect Max Rose ( NY ) said in a statement . “ Staten Islanders and South Brooklynites have been lied to enough and that ’ s not who I am or ever will be . ”
“ Nothing ’ s changed , ” Rep.-elect Jason Crow of Colorado , a Pelosi no vote , told ███ ahead of the caucus vote . Crow later released a statement that didn ’ t specify how he ’ d vote in January .
Pelosi ’ s opponents knew that she would be the nominee . They are now each focused on the January vote , but admitted there isn ’ t much of a targeted group strategy .
“ Let members do what they want to do , ” Rep. Kurt Schrader ( OR ) told reporters on Tuesday night . “ We need to get organized as Democrats . We have one big issue we ’ re not in agreement on , but I think everyone wants to work together , so we ’ re not going to make a big play of it tomorrow . January 3rd , if we ’ ve got the votes . It ’ s January 3 . ”
It ’ s the date Pelosi is focused on , too . And she still doesn ’ t have an opponent .","Nancy Pelosi won her nomination for House speaker easily on Wednesday, getting the vast majority of House Democrats to vote for her.

Though the 32 no votes are far fewer than the 63 Democrats who voted against her for minority leader just two years ago, it’s a signal that a number of House Democrats want Pelosi and her longtime deputies to step aside.

Directly before the speaker’s vote, Pelosi met with three of her most vocal Democratic opponents: Reps. Seth Moulton (MA), Kathleen Rice (NY), and Tim Ryan (OH). Moulton and Rice in particular pressed Pelosi on whether she would provide a clear transition plan ahead of 2020, opening up the path for a new leader to emerge.

“People need to know when this leadership team plans on turning the reins over to the next generation of leaders,” Rice told reporters.

But Rice characterized Pelosi as unwilling to listen.

“Unfortunately, our concerns were dismissed outright,” she said in a statement.

Nevertheless, the Pelosi era, which began more than a decade ago, is extremely likely to continue when Congress reconvenes in January.

The Democratic leader sounded as confident as ever when she stepped to the microphone and declared victory at a press conference — even as the votes were still being counted.

“I think we’re in pretty good shape,” Pelosi said.

Not all young members want someone new

Pelosi faces some of her strongest criticism from freshmen and other young members, so it was significant that the Democratic leader was nominated by Rep. Joe Kennedy (MA), a young Congress member who argued Pelosi had the experience to build consensus in the party and fight back against Trump.

The symbolism of Kennedy, who is from the same state as “Never Nancy” movement leader Seth Moulton, wasn’t lost on people.

Other young members agreed with Kennedy, laying out reasons why they backed Pelosi.

“She is a brilliant leader, someone who has the experience, the tenacity and determination to lead us in a direction that’s going to produce prosperity for all Americans,” said Rep.-elect Ilhan Omar (MN). “I think at a time where we are at a dangerous crossroads at our country it’s going to be necessary to have someone who has the experience to take on this administration and fight back and make sure we have the checks and balances that are needed.”

Rep. Eric Swalwell (CA), another Democrat who spoke on Pelosi’s behalf in the closed-door caucus meeting Tuesday, said he’s been actively encouraging other young Democrats to back Pelosi and existing leadership.

“The case to me is, we just won the Super Bowl of midterms,” Swalwell told Vox. “In the history of the Super Bowl, no coach has been fired after the Gatorade’s been dumped on him. Let’s keep the person that got us here, but also, she’s just the most effective person.”

There’s new blood in leadership — but not at the top

It was telling that the most competitive leadership races were for lower-ranking slots: Democratic Caucus chair, vice chair, and chair of the Democratic Congressional Committee. Some contested races were about the left versus the establishment, but they were also about representation of younger members, women, and people of color in the House.

The Caucus chair election was the day’s first and most contentious race, as Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (NY) beat Rep. Barbara Lee (CA). Lee and Jeffries are both members of the Congressional Black Caucus, but Lee later agreed that “ageism and sexism” were at play in her loss. (Lee is 72 years old; Jeffries is 48.)

“I absolutely think that’s the case,” she told reporters. “I’m a black woman and the institutional barriers are still there, so we just keep fighting.”

Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus had backed Lee, a former Progressive Caucus chair. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (WA), one of the caucus’s current co-chairs, said she had hoped to make history as the first African-American woman chair of the Democratic caucus.

“I take some issue with generational change being just about age, I think it should be about ideas that resonate with young people across the country,” Jayapal said. “I hoped the results of this election — powered by black women, voters of color, and women — would have some resonance to this race.”

Jeffries and new Assistant Democratic Leader Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, 46, are two young, diverse additions to the leadership team. But their additions aren’t enough to placate Democrats who hoped to see new blood at the very top of leadership.

Even though the Progressive Caucus was disappointed at the outcome of the caucus chair’s race, the group has thrown its full support behind the Pelosi, Hoyer, and Clyburn team. For now, Jayapal and others have resolved themselves to wait on generational change.

What’s next for Pelosi, and the movement opposing her

Pelosi now has a little over a month to whip the remaining votes she needs to become speaker. She needs to flip 18 of those votes — she can afford to lose 17 votes and still win.

Pelosi’s allies hope the secret ballot vote today can give members who oppose her the chance to vote no in secret to fulfill their promise to voters in their districts, and that they will turn around and vote yes in public on the floor on January.

But a few freshmen reiterated voting yes still wasn’t an option.

“I will not break my pledge when the vote comes to the floor,” Rep.-elect Max Rose (NY) said in a statement. “Staten Islanders and South Brooklynites have been lied to enough and that’s not who I am or ever will be.”

“Nothing’s changed,” Rep.-elect Jason Crow of Colorado, a Pelosi no vote, told Vox ahead of the caucus vote. Crow later released a statement that didn’t specify how he’d vote in January.

Pelosi’s opponents knew that she would be the nominee. They are now each focused on the January vote, but admitted there isn’t much of a targeted group strategy.

“Let members do what they want to do,” Rep. Kurt Schrader (OR) told reporters on Tuesday night. “We need to get organized as Democrats. We have one big issue we’re not in agreement on, but I think everyone wants to work together, so we’re not going to make a big play of it tomorrow. January 3rd, if we’ve got the votes. It’s January 3.”

It’s the date Pelosi is focused on, too. And she still doesn’t have an opponent.",www.vox.com,left,H9CG6pVD2NCmx9v1

Story Continued Below

With the clock ticking until the new Friday deadline to avert a DHS funding lapse, the GOP-controlled Senate will take the first step with a vote Monday on whether to head into formal negotiations with the House on financing the security agency. Senate Democrats are expected to block that move.

That will put the onus squarely back on Speaker John Boehner and his leadership team. Democrats fully expect the speaker to allow a vote on a so-called clean DHS funding measure that runs until the end of the fiscal year. But Republicans were coy over the weekend about what they’ll do, promising only that they’ll continue battling President Barack Obama’s executive actions on immigration.

“We want to get a conference with the Senate,” Boehner said Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “Now, [Senate Democrats have] made clear that they don’t want to go to conference. But they’re going to have a vote. If they vote, in fact, not to get a conference, this bill may be coming back to the House.”

The messy maneuvering wasn’t what Republican leaders had in mind when they took the reins of both chambers in January. Much of their early tenure has been marked by infighting over their response to Obama’s unilateral immigration moves. Republicans have tried to find a way to fund DHS and at the same time foil the president on immigration, but they’ve been blocked by Democrats at every turn.

Last week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) split off DHS financing from measures to stymie the immigration actions, and the Senate passed a clean funding bill with a 68-31 vote on Friday. But the more raucous and unpredictable House wasn’t ready to capitulate, openly defying the GOP leadership on the House floor by defeating its plan to fund DHS for three weeks.

A scramble ensued. Late Friday night, just hours before DHS was set to run out of money, Capitol Hill coalesced around a seven-day DHS funding fix. Obama signed it into law minutes before midnight. The weeklong extension came after Democratic aides reported reaching a deal with Republicans: House Democrats would provide the votes to get it approved, and, in return, Boehner would allow a vote this week to fund DHS through September. Democrats said it was predicated on the Senate rejecting Republicans’ request to negotiate a compromise funding deal.

“Your vote tonight will assure that we will vote for full funding next week,” Pelosi wrote in a “Dear Colleague” letter to House Democrats on Friday night.

Republicans deny making a pact.

“There is no such deal. There is no such bill,” House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Boehner said Sunday the only agreement with Pelosi was to follow “regular order.”

But Democrats would not have backed a seven-day DHS funding patch without some assurance from Boehner that he would put a DHS bill free of immigration provisions attacking Obama’s executive actions on the House floor.

Democrats Are Pushing Forward on Both,2019-12-10,Sheryl Gay Stolberg,"From The New York Times , I ’ m Michael Barbaro . This is “ The Daily. ” Today : House Democratic leaders have introduced two articles of impeachment against President Trump , charging him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress . My colleague Nick Fandos on the unseen fight among Democrats over whether two articles of impeachment was enough . It ’ s Wednesday , December 11 . Nick , how would you characterize the impeachment inquiry that we have all watched playing out over the past few weeks ?
So in an odd sense , there has been , for the last month or so , an air of inevitability about this inquiry , since Democrats decided to take it in the public and began holding fact-finding hearings , writing a written report that they released to the public , talking about the president ’ s pressure campaign on Ukraine . It seemed to all of us watching this closely that it was only going to end in one place , and that was with the impeachment of the president of the United States . But at the same time , privately , behind the scenes , there was a debate going on about one of the most fundamental unanswered questions about this . What exactly were they going to charge the president with ? What was the case against him going to encompass ?
That ’ s right , the constitutional term for charges , prosecutorial charges brought by the House against the president .
And what exactly is this debate ? I mean , if there have been public hearings , if there has been a report , and if there ’ s a unified front on just about everything leading up to that , what exactly is the debate ?
Well , so , to answer that question , you have to go back a little ways to the summer and early fall , before most of us ever heard about Ukraine and what Rudy Giuliani or President Trump were trying to accomplish there , when the debate in Congress as it had to do with impeachment was really centered on another set of facts , on another country , on another report , and that was —
archived recording 1 Special Counsel Robert Mueller , the investigating — archived recording 2 Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s report . archived recording 3 Special Counsel Robert Mueller .
— Bob Mueller , the special counsel , and his report on Russian election interference in the 2016 campaign and whether or not President Trump had illegally obstructed justice when he tried through various means to try and undercut or thwart that investigation .
I remember that . We did a few episodes on the subject .
We did , although it ’ s easy to forget now . But Democrats spent months with Mueller ’ s report . There was very serious evidence before them that the president had , for instance , instructed his White House counsel to fire Mueller early in the investigation , had tried to instruct his attorney general to take control of the investigation again and curtail it so the president wasn ’ t in its sights . But as week after week went by , they struggled to figure out how to make it urgent , how to bring it to life , because the report , frankly , didn ’ t come to firm conclusions itself about legality . It was written in this kind of dense style that ’ s hard to penetrate for most people . And so the issue , as much as they tried , never quite caught on with the public .
archived recording ( veronica escobar ) That process other than the criminal justice system for accusing a president of wrongdoing , is that impeachment ?
They put on a series of hearings , including with Mueller himself —
archived recording ( robert mueller ) I ’ m not going to comment on that .
— and still couldn ’ t unite their caucus around moving towards impeachment on this issue . And you started to see a not insubstantial number of Democrats who felt fervently that they should move forward with impeachment even if the public wasn ’ t fully on board with this .
But enough were holding back that there was no way they were going to have the votes to make that happen , and Speaker Pelosi wasn ’ t going to fully let that happen . So that was basically the state of affairs this fall when , out of nowhere , an anonymous whistle-blower complaint fell into the lap of the House Intelligence Committee and , within a couple of weeks , turned out to be what we now know as the “ Ukraine affair . ”
Right . And this suddenly unites just about all Democrats . It ’ s different .
It ’ s remarkable . In a very short period of time , you have moderate Democrats who were opposed , vocally opposed , to moving forward with an impeachment investigation based on the grounds of the Mueller report coming forward and enthusiastically volunteering not only that they ’ re O.K . with an inquiry , but if these charges , these suspicions are proven out to be true , they think the president should be outright impeached , that they should take the next step and go all the way there . And so there is an active group of progressive lawmakers that still want to see the Mueller case live on , that don ’ t want to completely set it aside . They ’ re forced to move that to the back burner for the two months that it ends up taking to investigate what really went down between the president and Ukraine .
archived recording ( nancy pelosi ) Therefore , today , I ’ m announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry .
And so , Nick , how does all of this that you have just told us relate to the question of , what would be the articles of impeachment brought against President Trump ?
So as the facts of the Ukraine investigation become clearer , as they begin to crystallize as time goes on , the debate starts to naturally shift towards , O.K. , so now , what are we going to do about it ? We figured out what happened . What do we want to charge the president with ? And as that discussion begins to happen around Ukraine articles , it becomes a natural time to say , hey , we ’ ve got this other thing , these developed set of facts , this investigation . It ’ s sitting on the back burner , good to go . Do we want to bring that in and marry it up ? And in part , that ’ s a natural discussion as this process goes on , because there ’ s enough similarity between what ’ s being alleged in the Ukraine investigation , and particularly President Trump ’ s attempts to obstruct the House ’ s impeachment investigation with the earlier Mueller case , and the president trying to conceal his actions from another investigator .
But as this process moves forward and comes back into the House Judiciary Committee , which is the panel that traditionally is tasked with drawing up articles of impeachment , with drawing up the charges to recommend what the House ought to do about it , this becomes a very live issue . This isn ’ t just academic anymore , because they have to decide in a matter of a couple weeks , what are we going to charge the president with ? And so it ’ s in that context in the last couple of weeks that Speaker Nancy Pelosi starts to more directly turn to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the Intelligence Committee , her kind of top lieutenants in the House , to start debating this problem . And it really culminates in a meeting in the speaker ’ s office last Thursday .
We ’ ll be right back . So , Nick , what happens last Thursday ?
archived recording ( nancy pelosi ) The president has engaged in abuse of power , undermining our national security and jeopardizing the integrity of our election .
So Thursday morning , as you may remember , Speaker Pelosi goes out before television cameras , and addresses the nation , and says —
archived recording ( nancy pelosi ) Today , I am asking our chairmen to proceed with articles of impeachment .
And I ’ m directing my House chairmen to begin drafting articles of impeachment .
Well , a few hours later , Pelosi meets with those chairmen in her office suite . It ’ s already decorated for Christmas . They all sit around a wooden dining room table . There ’ s a portrait of Abraham Lincoln looking down at them . And here are the key players sitting around that table — there ’ s Jerry Nadler , the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , who oversaw the earlier investigation into Bob Mueller ’ s findings and was the one leading the push towards discussing impeachment around it . He ’ s the one who ’ s now going to be tasked with having to move these articles over the finish line . There ’ s Richie Neal . He ’ s the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee , Democrat from Massachusetts , who is going after the president ’ s tax returns , as it happens , but doesn ’ t have a particular dog in this fight . There ’ s Maxine Waters of California from the Financial Services Committee ; Carolyn Maloney , the new Oversight Committee chairwoman ; Eliot Engel , who ’ s the Foreign Affairs chairman , other New Yorker ; and then Adam Schiff , the Intelligence Committee chairman who led the Ukraine investigation and really had been the face of the impeachment inquiry for its first two months or so . So it ’ s clear pretty quickly that this group is divided about exactly how they ought to go forward .
So Jerry Nadler speaks up . And he basically lays out a case for three articles of impeachment . Two of those have to do with Ukraine . And they are that the president abused the power of his office by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals for his own personal gain , that he conditioned official government acts to help himself , and then that he tried to conceal what had happened from Congress and took extraordinary steps to obstruct their impeachment inquiry . But then a third count of obstruction of justice based on the findings of the Mueller report .
Exactly . And what he argues is , it ’ s important that we show a pattern of conduct by the president . Because what he was doing towards Ukraine and the efforts that he ’ s taken to try and conceal that scheme from Congress , that ’ s not completely new . Yes , the facts are unique to that case , but we ’ ve seen this president disregarding the rule of law , disregarding accountability , flagrantly messing with foreign countries as it relates to elections for a long time now , and I think our case is potentially strengthened if we build it out in that way . And by the way , we did a lot of work on this question of obstruction of justice , and it ’ s not good . And what message would it send if the House of Representatives were to impeach this president and not charge him based on that conduct ?
Right . And perhaps he just didn ’ t want to see all that work tossed aside .
Yeah , I think that that ’ s a possibility too . And Nadler gets some backup from some of the other chairs in the room . But then Richie Neal from Massachusetts speaks up . And he says something interesting . He says , we ’ d do well to remember what happened in 1998 when the Republicans , then in the House majority , impeached another president , Bill Clinton . And they recommended — the Judiciary Committee recommended four articles of impeachment on the House floor . But the Republicans couldn ’ t all hold together . And two of them failed , casting a kind of odd shadow over their case just as it headed to the Senate for a trial . And his argument essentially was , we ought to bring forward our strongest case and the case that unites us . We don ’ t want to run risks of putting up articles that might fail on the floor or bring down the strength of what we think this Ukraine case offers . And he ’ s thinking very much in his mind back to that debate during the summer and the early fall where Democrats really were not united around obstruction of justice and , I think , is fearful that that could happen on the floor and embarrass Democrats .
So the fear that he ’ s identifying here is not that the third article of impeachment would fail when it gets to the Republican-controlled Senate , but that it actually might fail in the Democratically-controlled House .
Right . And that if it did , it would in some ways undermine the kind of seriousness of the Democrats ’ whole case . Because if they ’ re already expecting not to pick up any Republican votes and this is going to be a party-line impeachment , it looks a heck of a lot worse if you see some Democrats saying , eh , we don ’ t even necessarily agree with all of these charges . And when many of those Democrats who were opposed to pursuing impeachment based on the Mueller grounds came out in favor of an impeachment inquiry around Ukraine , they made very clear that there was a distinction in their minds .
And as this process has gotten closer towards the drafting of articles of impeachment , they ’ ve started popping back up and reminding any reporter that wants to listen that they still view those things as something different . And so Neal is cluing in on something very specific and very real here , and it resonates with others in the room . And then there ’ s Adam Schiff , the Intelligence Committee chairman . And his argument is that after two months of fact-finding , this Ukraine matter that he ’ s been scrutinizing is something of a higher order , that is so urgent — has to do with the president ’ s behavior right now and affecting an ongoing election — that they really ought not let that get bogged down with earlier , hard-fought debates and an older set of facts , that it ’ s important to make the case to the American people that this is something different and the lights are flashing right now . And that is why the House is acting and why it ’ s justified in acting , i.e . voting on articles of impeachment . So with all of these different arguments swirling in the air and through a bunch of other conversations with her individual members , Speaker Pelosi is trying to make a final decision about how to go forward . People who are close to her say that she was always reticent to proceed on an obstruction of justice ground . But she wanted to hear out these arguments and see where her caucus was . But as time went on , it became clear that she identified with the arguments that people like Schiff and Neal were making and some of these freshmen moderate lawmakers were telling her directly , which is , we see Ukraine as something different . We really think this is where our attention ought to be focused . And so with all of that in mind , she begins to guide this group towards a narrower set of charges just around Ukraine , towards jettisoning obstruction of justice for now .
So she is moving Democrats toward two articles of impeachment , not three .
That ’ s right . So by the end of the meeting last Thursday , the group , reluctantly for some , more enthusiastically for others , arrives at a kind of loose though not quite final agreement that it ’ s going to be two articles of impeachment , that they ’ re going to charge the president of the United States most likely with abuse of power and with obstruction of Congress , both having to do with Ukraine .
And that means that Mueller is basically over as a matter of impeachment .
So they arrive at a small workaround , at a kind of gesture at these earlier investigations , including in each of the articles that Democrats ultimately draft language that points back to earlier attempts by President Trump to solicit foreign interference and to obstruct United States government investigations . But that ’ s as far as they go . They never mention Bob Mueller . They don ’ t mention obstruction of justice in particular . And so if we saw this — what was once a pretty hot debate moved onto the back burner earlier this fall , it seems now that they ’ re turning off the stove on it , that for all intents and purposes what was pretty compelling evidence to a lot of lawmakers is basically going to go without an explicit and specified consequence for the president . Now , there are some who will argue that we may not be where we are today , that the House wouldn ’ t have been ready to impeach Donald Trump on the Ukraine episode , on the Ukraine scheme , if this hadn ’ t come first , if they hadn ’ t seen the president behave in the ways that the Mueller report chronicled . But that may be in the eye of the beholder .
So that pattern was meaningful for them . But in order to get to Ukraine and make Ukraine stick , something is sacrificed . And that is the Mueller investigation .
That ’ s right . And they want to be able to tell the larger story , to situate what happened in Ukraine in a larger story . But at the end of the day , what they decide is that we ’ re just going to charge the president based on what happened in these particular episodes .

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: House Democratic leaders have introduced two articles of impeachment against President Trump, charging him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. My colleague Nick Fandos on the unseen fight among Democrats over whether two articles of impeachment was enough. It’s Wednesday, December 11. Nick, how would you characterize the impeachment inquiry that we have all watched playing out over the past few weeks?

nicholas fandos

So in an odd sense, there has been, for the last month or so, an air of inevitability about this inquiry, since Democrats decided to take it in the public and began holding fact-finding hearings, writing a written report that they released to the public, talking about the president’s pressure campaign on Ukraine. It seemed to all of us watching this closely that it was only going to end in one place, and that was with the impeachment of the president of the United States. But at the same time, privately, behind the scenes, there was a debate going on about one of the most fundamental unanswered questions about this. What exactly were they going to charge the president with? What was the case against him going to encompass?

michael barbaro

Right. What would be the articles of impeachment?

nicholas fandos

That’s right, the constitutional term for charges, prosecutorial charges brought by the House against the president.

michael barbaro

And what exactly is this debate? I mean, if there have been public hearings, if there has been a report, and if there’s a unified front on just about everything leading up to that, what exactly is the debate?

nicholas fandos

Well, so, to answer that question, you have to go back a little ways to the summer and early fall, before most of us ever heard about Ukraine and what Rudy Giuliani or President Trump were trying to accomplish there, when the debate in Congress as it had to do with impeachment was really centered on another set of facts, on another country, on another report, and that was —

archived recording 1 Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the investigating — archived recording 2 Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report. archived recording 3 Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

nicholas fandos

— Bob Mueller, the special counsel, and his report on Russian election interference in the 2016 campaign and whether or not President Trump had illegally obstructed justice when he tried through various means to try and undercut or thwart that investigation.

michael barbaro

I remember that. We did a few episodes on the subject.

nicholas fandos

We did, although it’s easy to forget now. But Democrats spent months with Mueller’s report. There was very serious evidence before them that the president had, for instance, instructed his White House counsel to fire Mueller early in the investigation, had tried to instruct his attorney general to take control of the investigation again and curtail it so the president wasn’t in its sights. But as week after week went by, they struggled to figure out how to make it urgent, how to bring it to life, because the report, frankly, didn’t come to firm conclusions itself about legality. It was written in this kind of dense style that’s hard to penetrate for most people. And so the issue, as much as they tried, never quite caught on with the public.

archived recording (veronica escobar) That process other than the criminal justice system for accusing a president of wrongdoing, is that impeachment?

nicholas fandos

They put on a series of hearings, including with Mueller himself —

archived recording (robert mueller) I’m not going to comment on that.

nicholas fandos

— and still couldn’t unite their caucus around moving towards impeachment on this issue. And you started to see a not insubstantial number of Democrats who felt fervently that they should move forward with impeachment even if the public wasn’t fully on board with this.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

nicholas fandos

But enough were holding back that there was no way they were going to have the votes to make that happen, and Speaker Pelosi wasn’t going to fully let that happen. So that was basically the state of affairs this fall when, out of nowhere, an anonymous whistle-blower complaint fell into the lap of the House Intelligence Committee and, within a couple of weeks, turned out to be what we now know as the “Ukraine affair.”

michael barbaro

Right. And this suddenly unites just about all Democrats. It’s different.

nicholas fandos

It’s remarkable. In a very short period of time, you have moderate Democrats who were opposed, vocally opposed, to moving forward with an impeachment investigation based on the grounds of the Mueller report coming forward and enthusiastically volunteering not only that they’re O.K. with an inquiry, but if these charges, these suspicions are proven out to be true, they think the president should be outright impeached, that they should take the next step and go all the way there. And so there is an active group of progressive lawmakers that still want to see the Mueller case live on, that don’t want to completely set it aside. They’re forced to move that to the back burner for the two months that it ends up taking to investigate what really went down between the president and Ukraine.

archived recording (nancy pelosi) Therefore, today, I’m announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.

michael barbaro

And so, Nick, how does all of this that you have just told us relate to the question of, what would be the articles of impeachment brought against President Trump?

nicholas fandos

So as the facts of the Ukraine investigation become clearer, as they begin to crystallize as time goes on, the debate starts to naturally shift towards, O.K., so now, what are we going to do about it? We figured out what happened. What do we want to charge the president with? And as that discussion begins to happen around Ukraine articles, it becomes a natural time to say, hey, we’ve got this other thing, these developed set of facts, this investigation. It’s sitting on the back burner, good to go. Do we want to bring that in and marry it up? And in part, that’s a natural discussion as this process goes on, because there’s enough similarity between what’s being alleged in the Ukraine investigation, and particularly President Trump’s attempts to obstruct the House’s impeachment investigation with the earlier Mueller case, and the president trying to conceal his actions from another investigator.

michael barbaro

Right.

nicholas fandos

But as this process moves forward and comes back into the House Judiciary Committee, which is the panel that traditionally is tasked with drawing up articles of impeachment, with drawing up the charges to recommend what the House ought to do about it, this becomes a very live issue.

And it really culminates in a meeting in the speaker’s office last Thursday.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So, Nick, what happens last Thursday?

archived recording (nancy pelosi) The president has engaged in abuse of power, undermining our national security and jeopardizing the integrity of our election.

nicholas fandos

So Thursday morning, as you may remember, Speaker Pelosi goes out before television cameras, and addresses the nation, and says —

archived recording (nancy pelosi) The facts are uncontested.

nicholas fandos

At this point, we have seen enough evidence.

archived recording (nancy pelosi) Today, I am asking our chairmen to proceed with articles of impeachment.

nicholas fandos

And I’m directing my House chairmen to begin drafting articles of impeachment.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

nicholas fandos

Well, a few hours later, Pelosi meets with those chairmen in her office suite. It’s already decorated for Christmas. They all sit around a wooden dining room table. There’s a portrait of Abraham Lincoln looking down at them. And here are the key players sitting around that table — there’s Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who oversaw the earlier investigation into Bob Mueller’s findings and was the one leading the push towards discussing impeachment around it. He’s the one who’s now going to be tasked with having to move these articles over the finish line. There’s Richie Neal. He’s the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Democrat from Massachusetts, who is going after the president’s tax returns, as it happens, but doesn’t have a particular dog in this fight. There’s Maxine Waters of California from the Financial Services Committee; Carolyn Maloney, the new Oversight Committee chairwoman; Eliot Engel, who’s the Foreign Affairs chairman, other New Yorker; and then Adam Schiff, the Intelligence Committee chairman who led the Ukraine investigation and really had been the face of the impeachment inquiry for its first two months or so. So it’s clear pretty quickly that this group is divided about exactly how they ought to go forward.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

nicholas fandos

So Jerry Nadler speaks up. And he basically lays out a case for three articles of impeachment. Two of those have to do with Ukraine. And they are that the president abused the power of his office by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals for his own personal gain, that he conditioned official government acts to help himself, and then that he tried to conceal what had happened from Congress and took extraordinary steps to obstruct their impeachment inquiry. But then a third count of obstruction of justice based on the findings of the Mueller report.

michael barbaro

So he wants to bring back the Mueller report.

nicholas fandos

Exactly. And what he argues is, it’s important that we show a pattern of conduct by the president. Because what he was doing towards Ukraine and the efforts that he’s taken to try and conceal that scheme from Congress, that’s not completely new. Yes, the facts are unique to that case, but we’ve seen this president disregarding the rule of law, disregarding accountability, flagrantly messing with foreign countries as it relates to elections for a long time now, and I think our case is potentially strengthened if we build it out in that way. And by the way, we did a lot of work on this question of obstruction of justice, and it’s not good. And what message would it send if the House of Representatives were to impeach this president and not charge him based on that conduct?

michael barbaro

Right.

nicholas fandos

Does that set a precedent in and of itself?

michael barbaro

Right. And perhaps he just didn’t want to see all that work tossed aside.

nicholas fandos

Yeah, I think that that’s a possibility too. And Nadler gets some backup from some of the other chairs in the room. But then Richie Neal from Massachusetts speaks up. And he says something interesting. He says, we’d do well to remember what happened in 1998 when the Republicans, then in the House majority, impeached another president, Bill Clinton. And they recommended — the Judiciary Committee recommended four articles of impeachment on the House floor. But the Republicans couldn’t all hold together.

And he’s thinking very much in his mind back to that debate during the summer and the early fall where Democrats really were not united around obstruction of justice and, I think, is fearful that that could happen on the floor and embarrass Democrats.

michael barbaro

So the fear that he’s identifying here is not that the third article of impeachment would fail when it gets to the Republican-controlled Senate, but that it actually might fail in the Democratically-controlled House.

nicholas fandos

Right. And that if it did, it would in some ways undermine the kind of seriousness of the Democrats’ whole case. Because if they’re already expecting not to pick up any Republican votes and this is going to be a party-line impeachment, it looks a heck of a lot worse if you see some Democrats saying, eh, we don’t even necessarily agree with all of these charges. And when many of those Democrats who were opposed to pursuing impeachment based on the Mueller grounds came out in favor of an impeachment inquiry around Ukraine, they made very clear that there was a distinction in their minds.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

nicholas fandos

And as this process has gotten closer towards the drafting of articles of impeachment, they’ve started popping back up and reminding any reporter that wants to listen that they still view those things as something different. And so Neal is cluing in on something very specific and very real here, and it resonates with others in the room. And then there’s Adam Schiff, the Intelligence Committee chairman. And his argument is that after two months of fact-finding, this Ukraine matter that he’s been scrutinizing is something of a higher order, that is so urgent — has to do with the president’s behavior right now and affecting an ongoing election — that they really ought not let that get bogged down with earlier, hard-fought debates and an older set of facts, that it’s important to make the case to the American people that this is something different and the lights are flashing right now. And that is why the House is acting and why it’s justified in acting, i.e. voting on articles of impeachment. So with all of these different arguments swirling in the air and through a bunch of other conversations with her individual members, Speaker Pelosi is trying to make a final decision about how to go forward. People who are close to her say that she was always reticent to proceed on an obstruction of justice ground. But she wanted to hear out these arguments and see where her caucus was. But as time went on, it became clear that she identified with the arguments that people like Schiff and Neal were making and some of these freshmen moderate lawmakers were telling her directly, which is, we see Ukraine as something different. We really think this is where our attention ought to be focused. And so with all of that in mind, she begins to guide this group towards a narrower set of charges just around Ukraine, towards jettisoning obstruction of justice for now.

michael barbaro

So she is moving Democrats toward two articles of impeachment, not three.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. So by the end of the meeting last Thursday, the group, reluctantly for some, more enthusiastically for others, arrives at a kind of loose though not quite final agreement that it’s going to be two articles of impeachment, that they’re going to charge the president of the United States most likely with abuse of power and with obstruction of Congress, both having to do with Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And that means that Mueller is basically over as a matter of impeachment.

nicholas fandos

So they arrive at a small workaround, at a kind of gesture at these earlier investigations, including in each of the articles that Democrats ultimately draft language that points back to earlier attempts by President Trump to solicit foreign interference and to obstruct United States government investigations. But that’s as far as they go. They never mention Bob Mueller. They don’t mention obstruction of justice in particular. And so if we saw this — what was once a pretty hot debate moved onto the back burner earlier this fall, it seems now that they’re turning off the stove on it, that for all intents and purposes what was pretty compelling evidence to a lot of lawmakers is basically going to go without an explicit and specified consequence for the president. Now, there are some who will argue that we may not be where we are today, that the House wouldn’t have been ready to impeach Donald Trump on the Ukraine episode, on the Ukraine scheme, if this hadn’t come first, if they hadn’t seen the president behave in the ways that the Mueller report chronicled. But that may be in the eye of the beholder.

michael barbaro

So that pattern was meaningful for them. But in order to get to Ukraine and make Ukraine stick, something is sacrificed. And that is the Mueller investigation.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. And they want to be able to tell the larger story, to situate what happened in Ukraine in a larger story. But at the end of the day, what they decide is that we’re just going to charge the president based on what happened in these particular episodes.

michael barbaro

And that, of course, brings us to Tuesday morning.

archived recording (nancy pelosi) Good morning, everyone. On this solemn day, I recall that the first order of business for members of Congress is the solemn act to take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.

WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY HAS LONG HISTORY OF TRYING TO BRING DOWN TRUMP ; ADMITS CLIENT WORKED W/ DEM PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
This past September , Schiff , who long pushed unsubstantiated claims that the Trump team had conspired illegally with Russians , promised testimony from the whistleblower `` very soon . '' But , in recent weeks , he 's shifted course and suggested the testimony was unnecessary . In the meantime , it emerged that Schiff 's panel spoke with the whistleblower before the whistleblower complaint was filed , contrary to Schiff 's previous claims .
Trump repeatedly has demanded the release of the whistleblower 's identity , tweeting Sunday that the person `` must come forward . '' The whistleblower raised concerns about Trump 's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , in which he suggested Zelensky review Joe and Hunter Biden 's dealings there . The younger Biden routinely secured lucrative roles both domestically and abroad , with little relevant expertise , while his father was a powerful senator and , later , vice president .
The whistleblower 's secondhand account of the call has been providing a road map for House Democrats investigating whether the president and others in his orbit pressured Ukraine to probe political opponents , including former Vice President Joe Biden .
`` Reveal the Whistleblower and end the Impeachment Hoax ! '' Trump tweeted .
Trump later Sunday pushed the news media to divulge the whistleblower 's identity , asserting that the person 's accounting of events was incorrect . The whistleblower 's complaint has been corroborated in part by people with firsthand knowledge of the events who have appeared on Capitol Hill -- but key inconsistencies also have emerged .
For example , the complaint stated that Trump made a `` specific request that the Ukrainian leader locate and turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) and examined by the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike '' -- a request that did not appear in the declassified transcript of the call released by the Trump administration .
`` They know who it is . You know who it is . You just do n't want to report it , '' Trump told reporters at the White House . `` You know you 'd be doing the public a service if you did . ''
U.S. whistleblower laws have existed to protect the identity and careers of people bringing forward accusations of criminal wrongdoing by government officials , but many Republicans have argued -- citing career Justice Department officials -- that nothing criminal occurred during Trump 's call .
Republicans are said to have eyed a political opportunity in unmasking the CIA official , who the intelligence community 's inspector general said could have `` arguable political bias . ''
WHISTLEBLOWER CHECKED FORM INDICATING 'FIRSTHAND ' KNOWLEDGE -- CONTRARY TO CONGRESSIONAL DOCS
Zaid acknowledged in a statement last month that his client `` has come into contact with presidential candidates from both parties '' -- but insisted that the contact involved the politicians ' roles as `` elected officials – not as candidates . ''
And , Fox News reported in October that the whistleblower told the Intelligence Community Inspector General ( ICIG ) that bias against the president might be alleged against him or her for a third , previously unreported reason . Fox News previously reported the whistleblower was a registered Democrat and had a prior work history with a senior Democrat , but the third potential indicator of bias remained unclear .
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif. , said Sunday he had not yet discussed the whistleblower 's offer with Nunes , but stressed that the person should answer questions in a public appearance before the committee .
`` When you 're talking about the removal of the president of the United States , undoing democracy , undoing what the American public had voted for , I think that individual should come before the committee , '' McCarthy told CBS News ' `` Face the Nation . ''
`` We need an openness that people understand this , '' he added .
Zaid said his team had addressed the issue of alleged bias with Republican members of the committee and had stressed the need for anonymity to maintain the safety of the whistleblower and that person 's family , `` but with little effect in halting the attacks . ''
`` Let me be absolutely clear : Our willingness to cooperate has not changed , '' tweeted Andrew P. Bakaj , another attorney representing the whistleblower . `` What we object to and find offensive , however , is the effort to uncover the identity of the whistleblower . ''
Bakaj wrote Saturday that `` their fixation on exposing the whistleblower 's identity is simply because they 're at a loss as to how to address the investigations the underlying disclosure prompted . ''","Responding to a torrent of complaints from Republicans that the impeachment inquiry against President Trump is secretive and one-sided, a lawyer for the anonymous whistleblower who raised alarms about the presidents' dealings with Ukraine said Sunday his client is willing to answer written questions submitted by House Republicans.

But, late Sunday, House Oversight Committee ranking member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, seemingly rejected the offer from whistleblower attorney Mark Zaid, saying ""written answers will not provide a sufficient opportunity to probe all the relevant facts and cross examine the so-called whistleblower.""

""You don't get to ignite an impeachment effort and never account for your actions and role in orchestrating it,"" Jordan said.

Zaid responded by calling Jordan's response a ""deliberate deflection.""

The whistleblower attorney's surprise offer, made to Rep.

Political obituaries for Paul Ryan paint him as a sellout
Politico ’ s Alberta in a very sympathetic political obituary titled “ The Tragedy of Paul Ryan ” starts with the premise that he “ came to Congress as a Jack Kemp conservative and will depart as a Donald Trump Republican . ”
Barro , in a more scornful take for Business Insider , argues that “ the great tragedy of Paul Ryan is not that he sold his soul to Donald Trump . It ’ s that he got so little in return . ”
It ’ s true , of course , that relatively little of Ryan ’ s expansive policy agenda — which centered on privatizing and cutting Medicare while block-granting and cutting all means-tested social assistance — has been enacted during Trump ’ s time in office . But virtually none of that failure is because Trump opposed Ryan ’ s ideas or because Ryan sold out those ideas .
A bill subjecting Medicaid to block grants and swinging cuts , the American Health Care Act of 2017 , passed the US House of Representatives with the enthusiastic endorsement of Trump and his whole administration . This idea died ( in favor of the “ skinny repeal ” scheme ) due to opposition from Republican senators from Medicaid expansion states . Skinny repeal died later primarily because nobody actually thought it was a good idea ( though for a bill that nobody would defend on the merits , it came shockingly close to passing ) .
Block-granting the rest of the welfare state was abandoned as a GOP policy priority not because of Trump , but because Doug Jones beat Roy Moore and cut the GOP Senate majority so razor-thin that it didn ’ t make sense to try to move more controversial partisan bills .

There ’ s a lot that ’ s happening in Donald Trump ’ s Washington that would n't be happening if Marco Rubio or Scott Walker were president .

They are having limited success getting this done for the same reason that Nancy Pelosi couldn ’ t get Congress to pass a cap-and-trade bill when she was speaker — getting big laws through the Senate is hard — not because Trump is standing in the way . Even though Trump ’ s campaign promised in many ways to do just that .

Ryan made a reasonable choice about Trump

The impression that Ryan has in some sense “sold out” stems largely from the sense that it was wrong, morally speaking, of Ryan to have done so much to indulge Trump’s racism, his corruption, and his authoritarianism.

I, personally, think those are bad things to indulge.

But unlike Paul Ryan, I’m not a fanatical opponent of the welfare state who views American politics as an apocalyptic twilight struggle between the forces of individualism and collectivism.

Ryan, by contrast, believes in Paul Ryan’s ideas (ideas that, to be clear, are wrong and bad — in reality, helping people is good), and so he faced some tough choices around Trump.

On top of that , a wave of GOP retirements , some unexpected , have put Republicans in the unenviable position of having to defend 42 open seats this cycle , eight of which are in districts that Clinton won in 2016 and more than a dozen others in districts that Trump barely won .
The spate of GOP retirements creates more uncertainty and gives Democrats defending half as many open seats more paths to the majority .

But Emanuel also warned that the congressional map has shifted sharply in the GOP ’ s favor since 2006 , creating a much steeper climb for Democrats .

But I think many of us are ready . ''","The magic number of seats Democrats need to hit to win back the House majority is 23. But in reality, it’s almost certainly a much smaller number.

Several GOP-held seats are seemingly already in the bag, meaning Democrats likely need to take a smaller number of competitive seats — perhaps as few as 15 — to return to the majority for the first time since 2010.

It’s all making Republicans nervous — even before Tuesday’s special election in Ohio, where a Republican candidate appears to have just scraped by in a district that has been in GOP hands since 1983 and that President Trump Donald John TrumpGOP senators balk at lengthy impeachment trial Warren goes local in race to build 2020 movement 2020 Democrats make play for veterans' votes MORE won two years ago by 11 points.

“I don’t think there is necessarily a blue wave, but what concerns me is suburban districts in New Jersey, Philadelphia, New York, Illinois and California — those are not good for us,” said one House Republican from a blue state.

“Educated women, young people independents — they are energized. I clearly think [Democrats] have enough to win over 24 seats.”

Democrats, for their part, are taking nothing for granted, saying it’s well too soon to divert resources from any districts.

“The biggest strategic challenge [Democrats] have will come in September and October when they’ve got to make a decision whether some races are now in the safe column and they can divert resources to lean-Republican races,” said former Rep.

Republican members of the intelligence panel opened a Thursday session on Russian meddling with an attack on Schiff. They said all nine Republican panel members had signed a letter asking him to quit.

The Ohio Republican , stunning his colleagues , said he did n't want to put the House through a tumultuous vote on his speakership , and instead , he 'll leave Washington after 25 years and allow his party to pick a new successor in his absence .
Conservatives had been circling with threats of a fresh coup attempt — a showdown he felt he could win , but one he and his allies thought would do serious harm to the institution . But for all his grumbling over the down-and-out fights , the capitulations to rowdy right-wingers , and the `` spineless '' and `` squish '' insults , Boehner for five years had stuck it out , scoring a series of wins and maintaining his chain-smoking , merlot-swigging charm .
Boehner , who rose from bartender 's son to the most powerful man in Congress , was a classic mix of bravado and puddle of tears on Friday during a press conference announcing his decision to step aside at the end of October .
`` Last night I started thinking about this , and I woke up . I said my prayers as I always do , and I decided , you know , today ’ s the day I ’ m going to do this . As simple as that , '' Boehner said , veering from moist eyes to relief to whimsy , breaking into an impromptu rendition of `` Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah '' from the Disney movie `` Song of the South . ''
Boehner , 65 , planned to leave Congress at the end of 2014 , but returned because of the unexpected electoral defeat of his second-in-command , Eric Cantor . The feeling was that another agonizing round of internal GOP turmoil over his future `` would do irreparable damage to the institution , '' a Boehner aide said .
As he left the Capitol on Thursday evening , Boehner told two reporters — one from ███ and another from The Washington Post — that he had nothing left to accomplish after he brought Pope Francis to the Capitol . When asked whether he was resigning , Boehner laughed before exiting into a waiting SUV with his Capitol Police detail .
Boehner said that his No . 2 , House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy was so shocked when he broke the news to him Friday morning , that Boehner had to tell him `` about five times '' because he could n't believe it .
First elected to the House in 1990 , Boehner came into power on the momentum of the 2010 tea party wave . But it was that movement that gave him constant problems . He clashed with the right over the debt limit , government funding , Obamacare and taxes . His tenure will also be remembered for his complicated relationship with President Barack Obama . He and Obama tried — but repeatedly failed — to reach a `` grand bargain '' on government spending .
But Boehner has had some significant victories , including the landmark trade legislation that Congress passed earlier this year , as well as changes to entitlement programs .
Now that he does n't have internal political considerations to weigh , Boehner is certain to push through a government-funding bill next week that funds Planned Parenthood and keeps the government open .
“ I have been doing this for 27 years , and this is the most selfless act that I have ever seen , ” said Rep. Lynn Westmoreland ( R-Ga. ) , who is close with both Boehner and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R-Calif. ) . Rep. Jeb Hensarling ( R-Texas ) , a former member of leadership who has clashed with Boehner , had similarly kind words .
“ In the two years I served at the leadership table both my respect and affection grew for John Boehner , '' Hensarling said .
Conservatives — many of them members of the House Freedom Caucus — said they ’ re already preparing for the vote to replace Boehner .
“ He has a long record of distinguished service but it 's time for new leadership , ” said Rep. Tim Huelskamp ( R-Kan. ) . “ Conservatives will be working together ; it 's not going to be one or two of us , we 're going to make a deal . ”
Boehner 's decision , relayed in a closed Republican meeting Friday morning , will indeed set off one of the most intense leadership scrambles in modern congressional GOP politics . Second in line is McCarthy , who is widely expected to serve as the next speaker . But there is serious unrest in the House Republican ranks .
A clutch of conservatives has continuously clashed with establishment Republicans . It takes 218 votes on the House floor to win the speakership , and many GOP insiders believe that McCarthy is the only person who could cobble together a coalition of that size .
Should McCarthy win , it will set off a fierce battle for majority leader . Boehner allies appear to be rallying around McCarthy for speaker already , providing him a hefty base for the internal House Republican Conference election , and a speaker vote on the House floor .
One very formidable Republican is already taking himself out of the contest : Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin .
“ That is a good job for an empty nester , ” Ryan said .
The posturing within GOP ranks has been underway for weeks . House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana has been laying the groundwork for that battle , as has House Republican Conference Chairman Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington . Chief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry of North Carolina will be favored for House Republican whip .
There are wildcards , however . Rep. Peter Roskam ( R-Ill. ) , who has recently gained favor with the conservative right , is expected to eye a slot .
Boehner is one in a long line of speakers who have struggled with unrest in their own ranks , perhaps most notably dating back to Jim Wright , a Texas Democrat ousted in 1989 who lamented the “ mindless cannibalism ” of his colleagues . In the aftermath of Wright 's resignation , hyperpartisanship seemed to take hold , leading to heightened gridlock in Congress that many subsequent speakers have fought to break loose .
As for Boehner , there will be time for his close-knit team of aides to toast his speakership . He is holding a barbecue Sunday in Washington for current and former staff .
Conservatives celebrated Boehner 's departure . “ Americans deserve a Congress that fights for opportunity for all and favoritism to none , ” Heritage Action CEO Michael Needham said in a statement . “ Too often , Speaker Boehner has stood in the way . ”
In another sign of the triumphant feeling among conservatives , the crowd at the Values Voter Summit broke into cheers when Sen. Marco Rubio announced that Boehner was stepping down .
President Barack Obama , meanwhile , had kind words for Boehner , despite their often-friction-filled relationship . Obama , speaking at a press conference with Chinese President Xi Jinping , described Boehner as a `` good man '' who “ has kept his word when he ’ s made a commitment .
” Boehner understood , '' Obama added , that “ you don ’ t get 100 percent of what you want , but you have to work with people who you disagree with , sometimes strongly , in order to do the people ’ s business . ”
At her weekly news conference , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) called the resignation `` seismic '' and `` a stark indication of the disarray of the House Republicans . ”
Pelosi and Boehner had not spoken as of Friday morning , Pelosi said . She had called him around 8:30 a.m. Friday to check in on the latest on the government shutdown fight , but was told he was in a meeting and that he would call back . She found out during a weekly Democratic Caucus meeting , as phones lit up with the news of the resignation .","John Boehner has had enough.

But Boehner has had some significant victories, including the landmark trade legislation that Congress passed earlier this year, as well as changes to entitlement programs.

Now that he doesn't have internal political considerations to weigh, Boehner is certain to push through a government-funding bill next week that funds Planned Parenthood and keeps the government open.

“I have been doing this for 27 years, and this is the most selfless act that I have ever seen,” said Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-Ga.), who is close with both Boehner and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), a former member of leadership who has clashed with Boehner, had similarly kind words.

“In the two years I served at the leadership table both my respect and affection grew for John Boehner,"" Hensarling said.

Conservatives — many of them members of the House Freedom Caucus — said they’re already preparing for the vote to replace Boehner.

“He has a long record of distinguished service but it's time for new leadership,” said Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.). “Conservatives will be working together; it's not going to be one or two of us, we're going to make a deal.”

Boehner's decision, relayed in a closed Republican meeting Friday morning, will indeed set off one of the most intense leadership scrambles in modern congressional GOP politics. Second in line is McCarthy, who is widely expected to serve as the next speaker. But there is serious unrest in the House Republican ranks.

A clutch of conservatives has continuously clashed with establishment Republicans. It takes 218 votes on the House floor to win the speakership, and many GOP insiders believe that McCarthy is the only person who could cobble together a coalition of that size.

Should McCarthy win, it will set off a fierce battle for majority leader. Boehner allies appear to be rallying around McCarthy for speaker already, providing him a hefty base for the internal House Republican Conference election, and a speaker vote on the House floor.

One very formidable Republican is already taking himself out of the contest: Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.

“That is a good job for an empty nester,” Ryan said.

The posturing within GOP ranks has been underway for weeks. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana has been laying the groundwork for that battle, as has House Republican Conference Chairman Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington. Chief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry of North Carolina will be favored for House Republican whip.

There are wildcards, however. Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), who has recently gained favor with the conservative right, is expected to eye a slot.

Boehner is one in a long line of speakers who have struggled with unrest in their own ranks, perhaps most notably dating back to Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat ousted in 1989 who lamented the “mindless cannibalism” of his colleagues. In the aftermath of Wright's resignation, hyperpartisanship seemed to take hold, leading to heightened gridlock in Congress that many subsequent speakers have fought to break loose.

As for Boehner, there will be time for his close-knit team of aides to toast his speakership. He is holding a barbecue Sunday in Washington for current and former staff.

Conservatives celebrated Boehner's departure. “Americans deserve a Congress that fights for opportunity for all and favoritism to none,” Heritage Action CEO Michael Needham said in a statement. “Too often, Speaker Boehner has stood in the way.”

In another sign of the triumphant feeling among conservatives, the crowd at the Values Voter Summit broke into cheers when Sen. Marco Rubio announced that Boehner was stepping down.

President Barack Obama, meanwhile, had kind words for Boehner, despite their often-friction-filled relationship. Obama, speaking at a press conference with Chinese President Xi Jinping, described Boehner as a ""good man"" who “has kept his word when he’s made a commitment.

”Boehner understood,"" Obama added, that “you don’t get 100 percent of what you want, but you have to work with people who you disagree with, sometimes strongly, in order to do the people’s business.”

At her weekly news conference, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the resignation ""seismic"" and ""a stark indication of the disarray of the House Republicans.”

Pelosi and Boehner had not spoken as of Friday morning, Pelosi said. She had called him around 8:30 a.m. Friday to check in on the latest on the government shutdown fight, but was told he was in a meeting and that he would call back. She found out during a weekly Democratic Caucus meeting, as phones lit up with the news of the resignation.

The House Republican Conference voted Monday night to approve a change to House rules to weaken the independence of the Office of Congressional Ethics and place it under the oversight of the House Ethics Committee, a panel controlled by party leaders.

It will be part of a broader House Rules package to be voted on by the full body on Tuesday after the 115th Congress officially convenes and the House elects a speaker.

The Office of Congressional Ethics was established in 2008 under House Democrats, in response to the era of lobbying scandals made notable by Jack Abramoff, the former lobbyist who went to prison on corruption charges.

It is the first independent body to have an oversight role in House ethics. There is no Senate counterpart. The OCE independently reviews allegations of misconduct against House members and staff, and if deemed appropriate refers them to the House Ethics Committee for review. The OCE cannot independently punish lawmakers for any ethics violations.

House Speaker Paul Ryan spoke out against the move, according to a source in the room who said Ryan stated that ""there's a bipartisan way to better reform the office.""

President-elect Donald Trump was critical of the vote, tweeting Tuesday morning, ""With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it may be, their number one act and priority.""

Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway had defended the move earlier, telling ABC's Good Morning America that the election justified the action by congressional Republicans. ""There's a mandate there for them to make significant change,"" Conway said.

The vote has caused a backlash among Democrats, who say it's hypocritical given that Trump was elected vowing to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington.

The language approved Monday night, authored by Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., would prevent staff from making public statements independent of the House Ethics Committee and prevents it from investigating anonymous tips. A senior GOP aide said that's all ""because members are sick of having their name dragged through the mud based on partisan sometimes anonymous accusations.""

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was speaker when the OCE was created, criticized the decision in a statement.

""Republicans claim they want to 'drain the swamp,' but the night before the new Congress gets sworn in, the House GOP has eliminated the only independent ethics oversight of their actions,"" she wrote. ""Evidently, ethics are the first casualty of the new Republican Congress.""

In a statement, Goodlatte said his rules change would ""strengthen"" the OCE and improve due process rights for those subject to ethical investigations.

King faced bipartisan criticism after telling The New York Times in an interview published last week, ""White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?”

King had been a member of the House Judiciary, Agriculture and Small Business committees. He had also served as chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice in the last Congress, and could have stood to serve as its ranking member under the Democratic majority.

The move by GOP leaders severely hamstrings King's ability to wield influence as a member of Congress. The Agriculture Committee in particular is considered a prime spot for lawmakers like King who represent states with agricultural industries.

""We will not be seating Steve King on any committees in the 116th Congress,"" McCarthy told reporters.

“Leader McCarthy’s decision to remove me from committees is a political decision that ignores the truth,"" King said in a statement.

Democrats released the bill the day after the Trump administration said it wanted the entire health care law thrown out by the courts , underscoring the striking divide between the two parties on an issue at the top of voters ’ minds .
The new legislation sticks to policies that should win immediate support from the entire Democratic caucus . House Democrats are taking a slower approach on Medicare buy-ins and single-payer Medicare-for-all , soliciting information from the Congressional Budget Office and planning to hold hearings later this year . But these proposals , largely carried over from an earlier bill by Reps. Frank Pallone ( D-NJ ) , Richard Neal ( D-MA ) , and Bobby Scott ( D-VA ) , were the ones they had ready to go .
“ This is about very immediately answering the promises our members made in the campaign to lower health care costs , ” a senior Democratic aide told me . “ This isn ’ t the end of stuff we ’ re going to do on health care , in any regard . ”
The Democratic bill is a smorgasbord of provisions to expand health care and undo the Trump administration ’ s regulatory actions to weaken the ACA :
It expands the tax credits available under the law , both reducing costs for lower-income families and expanding eligibility so middle-class Americans can receive federal assistance .
It creates a national reinsurance program to offset high medical bills for insurers and thereby keep premium increases in check .

Under the Democratic bill , they would pay no more than 2 percent . For a family making 300 percent of the poverty level , they currently have to pay 10 percent of income on premiums ; they ’ d have to pay no more than 7 percent under the Democratic proposal .

Democrats released the bill the day after the Trump administration said it wanted the entire health care law thrown out by the courts, underscoring the striking divide between the two parties on an issue at the top of voters’ minds.

The new legislation sticks to policies that should win immediate support from the entire Democratic caucus. House Democrats are taking a slower approach on Medicare buy-ins and single-payer Medicare-for-all, soliciting information from the Congressional Budget Office and planning to hold hearings later this year. But these proposals, largely carried over from an earlier bill by Reps. Frank Pallone (D-NJ), Richard Neal (D-MA), and Bobby Scott (D-VA), were the ones they had ready to go.

“This is about very immediately answering the promises our members made in the campaign to lower health care costs,” a senior Democratic aide told me. “This isn’t the end of stuff we’re going to do on health care, in any regard.”

The Democratic bill is a smorgasbord of provisions to expand health care and undo the Trump administration’s regulatory actions to weaken the ACA:

It expands the tax credits available under the law, both reducing costs for lower-income families and expanding eligibility so middle-class Americans can receive federal assistance.

It creates a national reinsurance program to offset high medical bills for insurers and thereby keep premium increases in check.

It rolls back Trump actions expanding skimpier health insurance plans, giving states the freedom to undermine the law’s benefits requirements, and cutting enrollment outreach funding.

Democrats will likely not pass the bill as a singular package, according to the senior aide, but wanted to give their members one bill that they could cite as evidence of fulfilling their campaign promises. Instead, they expect to try to pass individual provisions one at a time, in order to force Republicans to take multiple votes. Following the midterm campaign that proved health care is a winning issue for Democrats, they want to keep up the pressure on the GOP.

“It gives us multiple opportunities to sharpen the contrast with Republicans,” the aide said.

You could think of this bill as the lowest common denominator for House Democrats, the minimum they would propose to do to counter Trump and start expanding health coverage again.

The Democratic plan to strengthen Obamacare, briefly explained

In terms of actually providing health coverage to more people, the most important provision in the Democratic plan is the expansion of Obamacare’s premium tax credits. The bill both increases the subsidies for lower-income people who already qualify for aid and extends eligibility for federal assistance to people with higher incomes who are locked out currently.

Here is an example for the first group: Currently, people making 150 percent of the federal poverty level ($18,000 for an individual, $31,000 for a family of three) have to pay up to 4 percent of their income on health insurance purchased through Obamacare. Under the Democratic bill, they would pay no more than 2 percent. For a family making 300 percent of the poverty level, they currently have to pay 10 percent of income on premiums; they’d have to pay no more than 7 percent under the Democratic proposal.

But even more crucially, the Democratic proposal removes Obamacare’s existing limits on who is eligible for tax subsidies. Right now, people making more than 400 percent of the poverty level ($48,500 for one person, $83,000 for a family of three) don’t qualify for any federal assistance.

That population has borne the full brunt of premium increases in recent years. The number of people purchasing Obamacare-compliant coverage who don’t receive subsidies has shrunk dramatically — from nearly 7 million in 2016 to about 4 million in 2018 — suggesting that for many of those people, coverage has become unaffordable.

So the new legislation would make premium tax credits available to everyone, capping payments on insurance premiums at 8.5 percent of their income.

The rest of the bill is a string of more technical provisions: creating a national reinsurance program, fixing the so-called “family glitch” that barred some families from accessing tax subsidies, and, importantly, reversing the Trump administration’s regulatory agenda. The Democratic bill rolls back or otherwise curtails Trump’s expansion of short-term insurance plans not required to meet the ACA’s protections for preexisting conditions. It also requires the administration to spend federal money on enrollment outreach, after Trump officials cut that budget dramatically over the past two years.

The new bill, unlike its predecessor, does not restore the cost-sharing payments to health insurers that Trump cut off. In a quirky and wonky twist of fate, Trump’s decision to end those payments has actually led to many people receiving more robust federal aid. To offset the loss of the payments, insurers hiked premiums only on certain plans, the ones the feds used to calculate the size of people’s tax subsidy. That gave people a bigger tax subsidy, allowing them to afford better coverage for either the same cost or even less.

If the Trump administration tries to block what states and health insurers have done to bolster the subsidies, then Democrats would look at passing a bill to restore the cost-sharing payments. But they aren’t worrying about it for now.

Democrats are taking their time on more ambitious health care plans

Notably missing from the Democratic bill is a public option or Medicare buy-in, the introduction of a government health care plan to compete with the private insurance offerings of the ACA’s marketplaces.

And, of course, some targeted provisions to bolster Obamacare are a far cry from the single-payer Medicare-for-all plan that is energizing the left these days.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has sounded skeptical notes about single-payer and urged Democrats to focus on strengthening Obamacare, their winning message in the midterms, so this new bill doesn’t come as a surprise. Leadership is taking a more deliberate approach to their party’s more ambitious health care ideas, where there is not yet a consensus within the ideologically diverse Democratic majority.

“This doesn’t displace a discussion about a public option, a Medicare buy-in, Medicare-for-all,” the senior Democratic aide told me.

House Democrats are planning to hold hearings on Medicare-for-all and these other ideas later this year. They have asked the Congressional Budget Office for a bunch of information about how those plans could be designed and how much they would cost.

The next two years will serve as an information-gathering exercise as Democrats debate how far they want to go in expanding health coverage to more Americans. In the meantime, they are laying out more targeted proposals to strengthen Obamacare and to beat back the Trump administration’s assault on the current health care law.

That was the core of the party’s message in the 2018 midterms, and that is where the consensus lies. “It’s more like near-term versus longer-term,” as the Democratic aide put it: Right now, Democrats are focusing on helping the ACA. Then they will turn their ideas to the next stage of health care reform.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives approved a GOP-backed student loan bill Thursday to address an impending July 1 interest rate hike on subsidized Stafford college loans by tying future interest rates to the market instead of allowing Washington to determine the rate.

The bill was approved on party lines, 221-198. Senate Democrats oppose the bill and the White House issued a veto threat on Wednesday, so its prospects are dim. Democrats want to extend current rates for two more years to allow more time to find a permanent fix.

However, if Congress doesn't act, Stafford loan rates will double from 3.4% to 6.8% this summer. About 7 million college students benefit from Stafford loans.

""We need a long-term solution to get us out of these annual, bi-annual, semi-annual political battles,"" said Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John Kline, R-Minn. ""We want to help students and we want to give them certainty and we want them not to have to rely on the whims of politicians here.""

The House Republicans' proposal would tie loan rates to the interest rate on a 10-year Treasury note, plus 2.5 percentage points, with a cap that would prevent the interest rate on Stafford loans from rising above 8.5%. President Obama's budget called for setting the rate at slightly less than 1 percentage point above the Treasury note rate.

The GOP plan would also reset the loan rate for all borrowers every year based on market fluctuations, while under Obama's proposal, any borrower's initial loan rate would remain fixed for the life of the loan. The president is also seeking more flexibility for students to repay their loans.

Republicans say market-based loan rates will take Washington politics out of the interest-rate equation. Congress has the power to determine federal loan rates. The current 3.4% rate was set by Democrats in 2007, and was expected to return to 6.8% over a gradual period. Congress extended it for an additional year in 2012, during the height of the presidential campaign under political pressure from Obama.

Democrats compare the plan to predatory adjustable rate mortgage practices that helped fuel the housing collapse during the financial crisis. ""We just saw that history in America.

Ryan announced Wednesday that he ’ ll retire from the House at the end of this year , ending a two-decade career in Congress and igniting more soul-searching for a GOP already bracing for a rough round of midterm elections in November .
He told colleagues of his decision at the weekly House GOP meeting , and then made the announcement public at a press conference later in the morning .
Mr. Ryan said he couldn ’ t stomach the time away from his family .
“ If I am here for one more term , my kids will only have ever known me as a weekend dad . I just can ’ t let that happen . So I will be setting new priorities in my life , ” he said .
Mr. Ryan added , though , that he plans to be an active lame-duck speaker : “ I ’ m not done yet . I intend to run through the tape . ”
And he said his decision had little to do with politics , predicting the GOP will hold the House in November no matter what .
“ We have a great record to run on , great economy , great accomplishments , more to do , ” Mr. Ryan said .
Rumors of his departure had been circulating for months , and he and his aides had repeatedly denied them .
Several lawmakers are likely to compete to succeed him , including the No . 2 House Republican , Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , and the No . 3 Republican , Whip Steve Scalise .
Mr. Ryan has been speaker for a little over two years , and has overseen a turbulent time , facing down conservative rebellions and securing a large tax cut , but failing to repeal Obamacare .
His goal of rewriting the federal budget to bring more accountability to social spending programs has also stumbled in the face of opposition even from within his own party .
And after serving as a prominent critic of President Trump at times during the 2016 campaign , he has become the president ’ s most effective ally on Capitol Hill , helping push the White House agenda .
“ Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man , and while he will not be seeking re-election , he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question . We are with you Paul ! ” Mr. Trump tweeted after the news broke .
Democrats said they hoped that Mr. Ryan , free from having to face voters , will now turn on Mr. Trump and his colleagues .
“ With his newfound political freedom , I hope the Speaker uses his remaining time in Congress to break free from the hard-right factions of his caucus that have kept Congress from getting real things done , ” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat .
Republicans , though , said they didn ’ t expect anything to change in Mr. Ryan , and doubted a lame-duck speaker would be a hindrance .
“ We ’ re going to continue to rally behind him , ” said Rep. Kevin Brady , Texas Republican , who took over as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee after Mr. Ryan gave up the post to ascend to speaker .
Mr. Brady said the announcement was a “ tough day ” for Republicans , but they knew Mr. Ryan wasn ’ t going to be a career congressman .
“ I think the main reason for this is his family , ” Mr. Brady said . “ He ’ s never been a lifer . ”
Mr. Ryan faced a tougher-than-usual election fight back home in Wisconsin this year , where several Democrats are battling to face him — and raising plenty of cash from liberal activists who saw ousting Mr. Ryan as the best way to send a signal to President Trump .
Kyle Kondik , of the University of Virginia ’ s Center for Politics , told The ███ the announcement gives Democrats a much better shot of picking up the seat , which Mr. Ryan has held since 1999 .
Mr. Ryan faced a challenge for the seat from Paul Nehlen , a man with white supremacist ties who the state party severed ties with in 2018 . His Twitter account was also suspended for anti-Semitism .
Mr. Ryan told big donors in private conversations early on in the Trump presidency that he was concerned about the GOP ’ s ability to defend the House and the picture has not gotten any rosier since .
GOP leaders were already slated to gather with Mr. Trump at the White House for dinner Wednesday night .","Speaker Paul D.

“If I am here for one more term, my kids will only have ever known me as a weekend dad. I just can’t let that happen. So I will be setting new priorities in my life,” he said.

Mr. Ryan added, though, that he plans to be an active lame-duck speaker: “I’m not done yet. I intend to run through the tape.”

And he said his decision had little to do with politics, predicting the GOP will hold the House in November no matter what.

“We have a great record to run on, great economy, great accomplishments, more to do,” Mr. Ryan said.

Rumors of his departure had been circulating for months, and he and his aides had repeatedly denied them.

Several lawmakers are likely to compete to succeed him, including the No. 2 House Republican, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and the No. 3 Republican, Whip Steve Scalise.

Mr. Ryan has been speaker for a little over two years, and has overseen a turbulent time, facing down conservative rebellions and securing a large tax cut, but failing to repeal Obamacare.

His goal of rewriting the federal budget to bring more accountability to social spending programs has also stumbled in the face of opposition even from within his own party.

And after serving as a prominent critic of President Trump at times during the 2016 campaign, he has become the president’s most effective ally on Capitol Hill, helping push the White House agenda.

“Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. We are with you Paul!” Mr. Trump tweeted after the news broke.

Democrats said they hoped that Mr. Ryan, free from having to face voters, will now turn on Mr. Trump and his colleagues.

“With his newfound political freedom, I hope the Speaker uses his remaining time in Congress to break free from the hard-right factions of his caucus that have kept Congress from getting real things done,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat.

Republicans, though, said they didn’t expect anything to change in Mr. Ryan, and doubted a lame-duck speaker would be a hindrance.

“We’re going to continue to rally behind him,” said Rep. Kevin Brady, Texas Republican, who took over as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee after Mr. Ryan gave up the post to ascend to speaker.

Mr. Brady said the announcement was a “tough day” for Republicans, but they knew Mr. Ryan wasn’t going to be a career congressman.

“I think the main reason for this is his family,” Mr. Brady said. “He’s never been a lifer.”

Mr. Ryan faced a tougher-than-usual election fight back home in Wisconsin this year, where several Democrats are battling to face him — and raising plenty of cash from liberal activists who saw ousting Mr. Ryan as the best way to send a signal to President Trump.

Kyle Kondik, of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, told The Washington Times the announcement gives Democrats a much better shot of picking up the seat, which Mr. Ryan has held since 1999.

“WI-1 will be a Toss-up,” Mr. Kondik said.

Mr. Ryan faced a challenge for the seat from Paul Nehlen, a man with white supremacist ties who the state party severed ties with in 2018. His Twitter account was also suspended for anti-Semitism.

Mr. Ryan told big donors in private conversations early on in the Trump presidency that he was concerned about the GOP’s ability to defend the House and the picture has not gotten any rosier since.

GOP leaders were already slated to gather with Mr. Trump at the White House for dinner Wednesday night.

Miller, David Sherfinski","House Democrats , fresh off massive election losses , say the problem is they didn ’ t make a bold enough case for tax increases and wealth transfer to the poor . They rectified that Monday with a speech by Rep. Chris Van Hollen proposing tax increases on the wealthy with the money going straight to tax cuts for the poor and middle class .
The plan uses tax laws to encourage employee wage increases , reduce tax breaks for Wall Street and slap another fee on financial transactions . The government would dole out $ 1,000 tax credits for most workers and increase a slew of other tax credits for poor and middle-class families .
“ This is a plan to grow the paychecks of all , not just the wealth of a few . This proposal attacks the chronic problem of stagnant middle-class incomes from both directions . It promotes bigger paychecks and lets workers keep more of what they earn , ” Mr. Van Hollen , the ranking member on the House Budget Committee , said in a speech announcing the plan at the Center for American Progress , a liberal think tank in Washington .
The Maryland Democrat said the proposal would restore balance to a tax code that “ is now skewed in favor of people who make money off of money and against those who make money off of work . ”
The plan built upon the liberal populism that dominates the Democratic agenda for confronting a Republican-controlled Congress , such as the push to raise the minimum wage and reducing student loan debt . But it went further by offering workers a direct cash payment .
The package of tax measures is all but dead on arrival in Congress . Instead , the document will become the tip of the spear for Democrats taking on the Republican majority and for the party ’ s White House run next year .
The proposal , which Mr. Van Hollen called an “ action plan , ” included :
⦁ A $ 1,000 “ paycheck bonus tax credit ” for every worker making less than $ 100,000 a year or a $ 2,000 credit for every couple filing joint returns who earn less than $ 200,000 a year .
⦁ A “ saver ’ s bonus ” of $ 250 each year for individuals who put at least $ 500 of their paycheck bonus tax credits or earned income tax credits into tax-preferred savings accounts .
⦁ The CEO-Employee Paycheck Fairness Act that bars big corporations from claiming tax deductions for CEO and other corporate compensation over $ 1 million unless their workers are getting paycheck increases that reflect increases in worker productivity and the cost of living .
⦁ Updating the child and dependent care tax credit by raising the amount of eligible expenses , indexing the caps for inflation and making the credit refundable .
⦁ A “ second-earner tax deduction ” that would increase the take-home pay of two-earner families with 20 percent tax deductions for second earners with dependents on up to $ 60,000 of their income .
“ We can pay for these new tax benefits for working Americans by changing the ways our current tax code is rigged in favor of those who make money off of money , and against those who make money from work , ” Mr. Van Hollen said .
He said the cost would be covered with two measures , curbing tax breaks for the financial services industry and imposing a small fee on Wall Street transactions .
The proposal was cheered from the left , including AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka , who credited Mr. Van Hollen with bringing “ bold ideas to the forefront . ”
“ Working people want not only to hear what leaders think about raising wages and income inequality , but what they ’ ll do about it . Rep. Van Hollen is doing exactly that , ” he said .
House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price , Georgia Republican , said that repairing the tax code shouldn ’ t be about redistributing wealth .
“ We welcome our Democrat colleagues to the conversation about how we can fix our broken tax code and improve the financial security of American families . But Washington shouldn ’ t be in the business of picking winners and losers in the economy , ” he said in a statement . “ We should focus on fundamental tax reform that builds a foundation for job creation and economic growth . ”
In a separate speech , Mr. Price outlined a conservative agenda that focuses on combating federal debt and reining in expensive entitlement programs such as Medicare .
Mr. Price signaled that a top priority for Republicans would be to build off of the budget proposal by Rep. Paul Ryan , Wisconsin Republican and the party ’ s 2012 vice-presidential nominee , that would transition Medicare into a voucher-type program for future retirees .
He said one of the most important things the Budget Committee can do is to “ normalize ” the debate about issues such as federal entitlement programs .
“ Four years ago , nobody would have given us a prayer — a prayer — to be able to lay out a solution to save and strengthen and secure Medicare and thought that we would be able to sustain the onslaught coming from the other side , ” he said . “ We worked and we worked and we worked and we convinced our colleagues and convinced our friends and moved forward … with a positive solution — so positive that the Romney-Ryan team in 2012 on that proposal won the senior vote in this country . ”

But by Monday , Democrats were reacting to a new crisis within the Border Patrol agency : Facebook posts by current and former agents who mocked dead migrants — including the recent photo of a drowned father and daughter — and referred to Ocasio-Cortez and other Latina Democrats as “ hoes ” ahead of their trip to a Border Patrol facility . The Facebook group was initially reported by ProPublica .
Members of the group posted multiple illustrations of Ocasio-Cortez in suggestive positions , including one that depicting President Donald Trump .

us_house,The Hill,1,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/416564-historic-class-storms-capitol,Historic class storms Capitol,2018-11-14,,"The most diverse Congress in history is descending on the Capitol , with newly elected lawmakers arriving in Washington , D.C. , to meet their future colleagues and get acclimated to their new environment .
Next year ’ s Congress will include a record number of women , while the incoming freshman class will also boast a number of firsts : The first two Native American women . The first Somali-American lawmaker . The first two Muslim women . The first Palestinian-American woman .
“ It ’ s thrilling , absolutely thrilling to see just the energy around this election cycle , and so many terrific women coming to Congress , ” Rep.-elect Madeleine Dean ( D-Pa. ) said outside a Courtyard by Marriott hotel on Tuesday , where new member orientation is being held this week . “ I ’ m just honored to be a part of it . ”
“ I ’ m so excited , ” added Rep.-elect Deb Haaland ( N.M. ) , one of the two Native American women set to join the Democratic ranks next year .
The legislative body will more closely resemble the makeup of the United States , though its overall composition will still tilt white and male compared to the general population .
Many of the new Democrats are young and progressive , underscoring the generational and ideological divisions that are likely to pull at the conference over the next two years .
That dynamic was on full display Tuesday , when Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-N.Y. ) , a rising star on the left , made a splash on her first day of freshman orientation by joining more than 100 youth protesters outside of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiOvernight Health Care : Trump officials making changes to drug pricing proposal | House panel advances flavored e-cig ban | Senators press FDA tobacco chief on vaping ban Speaker Pelosi , it 's time to throw American innovators a lifeline Why Americans must tune in to the Trump impeachment hearings MORE ’ s ( D-Calif. ) office to demand action on climate change .
“ This is not about me , this is not about the dynamics of any personality , ” the 29-year-old Latina , who toppled veteran Rep. Joseph Crowley in the New York Democratic primary , told reporters . “ This is about uplifting the voice and the message of the fact we need a green new deal . ”
“ We are here to back [ Pelosi ] up in pushing for 100 percent renewable energy , ” Ocasio-Cortez added . “ This is an encouragement of her . ”
Some of the activists who organized the event were less positive .
After noting a United Nations report that found time is running out to tackle climate change , Justice Democrats Executive Director Alexandra Rojas said in a statement that “ Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Party leadership are reviving stale , so-called ‘ bipartisan ’ ideas that get nowhere near the scale of the crisis . ”
Pelosi ’ s office blasted out a statement applauding the enthusiastic protests and reiterating her plan to reinstate a select committee on climate change — a move the groups have described as toothless .
“ We welcome the presence of these activists , and we strongly urge the Capitol Police to allow them to continue to organize and participate in our democracy , ” Pelosi said .
The demonstration pointed to the internal pressures Democratic leaders are likely to feel from liberals in their caucus , who firmly believe progressivism enabled their party to take back the House majority .
The caucus elected is not only younger and more diverse , but also reflects a wide range of ideology . Along with Ocasio-Cortez , a liberal star with more than 1 million Twitter followers , it includes Abigail Spanberger , an ex-CIA operative who defeated Rep. Dave Brat ( R-Va. ) in a swing district , and Angie Craig , a former medical technology executive who won a seat in the Minneapolis suburbs . None of them are committing to backing Pelosi for Speaker .
All of these new members are among the female candidates who made historic gains on Election Day , helping to deliver the House majority to Democrats .
At least 129 women were elected to serve in Congress next year — up from 112 this current session , according to Quorum , a legislative tracking company . That includes 35 new women in the House and three in the Senate .
Yet even after the “ Year of the Woman , ” women will only make up 24 percent of Congress , which is far less than the overall population , which is about 50 percent female .
And the gender gap between Democrats and Republicans is set to widen even further , with the GOP on track to lose 10 of its female lawmakers , or nearly half .
Still , the influx of Democratic women could influence the congressional agenda next year as a number of female candidates campaigned on policies like equal pay , paid family leave and overhauling sexual assault rules .
The new Congress is also set to be more racially diverse than the current one , adding nine new Hispanic members and eight new black lawmakers to its ranks , according to Quorum .
Among the fresh faces who will flood the Capitol hallways next year are Haaland and Rep.-elect Sharice Davids ( D-Kan. ) , who will become the first two Native American women to serve in Congress .
The pair has met before but they linked up again for coffee following new member orientation on Tuesday .

Next year’s Congress will include a record number of women, while the incoming freshman class will also boast a number of firsts: The first two Native American women. The first Somali-American lawmaker. The first two Muslim women. The first Palestinian-American woman.

“It’s thrilling, absolutely thrilling to see just the energy around this election cycle, and so many terrific women coming to Congress,” Rep.-elect Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.) said outside a Courtyard by Marriott hotel on Tuesday, where new member orientation is being held this week. “I’m just honored to be a part of it.”

“I’m so excited,” added Rep.-elect Deb Haaland (N.M.), one of the two Native American women set to join the Democratic ranks next year.

The legislative body will more closely resemble the makeup of the United States, though its overall composition will still tilt white and male compared to the general population.

Many of the new Democrats are young and progressive, underscoring the generational and ideological divisions that are likely to pull at the conference over the next two years.

That dynamic was on full display Tuesday, when Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a rising star on the left, made a splash on her first day of freshman orientation by joining more than 100 youth protesters outside of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiOvernight Health Care: Trump officials making changes to drug pricing proposal | House panel advances flavored e-cig ban | Senators press FDA tobacco chief on vaping ban Speaker Pelosi, it's time to throw American innovators a lifeline Why Americans must tune in to the Trump impeachment hearings MORE’s (D-Calif.) office to demand action on climate change.

“This is not about me, this is not about the dynamics of any personality,” the 29-year-old Latina, who toppled veteran Rep. Joseph Crowley in the New York Democratic primary, told reporters. “This is about uplifting the voice and the message of the fact we need a green new deal.”

“We are here to back [Pelosi] up in pushing for 100 percent renewable energy,” Ocasio-Cortez added. “This is an encouragement of her.”

Some of the activists who organized the event were less positive.

After noting a United Nations report that found time is running out to tackle climate change, Justice Democrats Executive Director Alexandra Rojas said in a statement that “Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Party leadership are reviving stale, so-called ‘bipartisan’ ideas that get nowhere near the scale of the crisis.”

Pelosi’s office blasted out a statement applauding the enthusiastic protests and reiterating her plan to reinstate a select committee on climate change — a move the groups have described as toothless.

“We welcome the presence of these activists, and we strongly urge the Capitol Police to allow them to continue to organize and participate in our democracy,” Pelosi said.

The demonstration pointed to the internal pressures Democratic leaders are likely to feel from liberals in their caucus, who firmly believe progressivism enabled their party to take back the House majority.

The caucus elected is not only younger and more diverse, but also reflects a wide range of ideology. Along with Ocasio-Cortez, a liberal star with more than 1 million Twitter followers, it includes Abigail Spanberger, an ex-CIA operative who defeated Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) in a swing district, and Angie Craig, a former medical technology executive who won a seat in the Minneapolis suburbs. None of them are committing to backing Pelosi for Speaker.

All of these new members are among the female candidates who made historic gains on Election Day, helping to deliver the House majority to Democrats.

At least 129 women were elected to serve in Congress next year — up from 112 this current session, according to Quorum, a legislative tracking company. That includes 35 new women in the House and three in the Senate.

Yet even after the “Year of the Woman,” women will only make up 24 percent of Congress, which is far less than the overall population, which is about 50 percent female.

And the gender gap between Democrats and Republicans is set to widen even further, with the GOP on track to lose 10 of its female lawmakers, or nearly half.

Still, the influx of Democratic women could influence the congressional agenda next year as a number of female candidates campaigned on policies like equal pay, paid family leave and overhauling sexual assault rules.

The new Congress is also set to be more racially diverse than the current one, adding nine new Hispanic members and eight new black lawmakers to its ranks, according to Quorum.

Among the fresh faces who will flood the Capitol hallways next year are Haaland and Rep.-elect Sharice Davids (D-Kan.), who will become the first two Native American women to serve in Congress.

The pair has met before but they linked up again for coffee following new member orientation on Tuesday.

“We’re going to get together and start our sisterhood,” Haaland told reporters.

Meanwhile, Democrats Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota became the first Muslim women elected to Congress. Tlaib, a Palestinian-American, is replacing former Rep. John Conyers John James ConyersThe Hill's 12:30 Report: Dems release first transcripts from impeachment probe witnesses Hispanic Caucus dedicates Day of the Dead altar to migrants who died in US custody Today On Rising: The media beclowns themselves on Baghdadi MORE Jr. (D-Mich.), who resigned late last year in the face of sexual harassment allegations.

Omar, who is poised to become the first Somali-American representative, lamented that only minority candidates are asked how they were able to win over majority-white districts.

“I just want to say, in a new era, where we are focused on talking about what’s at stake for the people that we represent, I hope that kind of question is one that we never ask,” Omar said at a Congressional Progressive Caucus press conference on Monday. “The same way that I hope we never continuously talk about the ‘firsts.’ ”

Other history-makers include Boston City Councilor Ayanna Pressley (D), who will become the first black woman to represent Massachusetts.

Ocasio-Cortez documented her orientation — which involved a reception for new members and a tour of the Capitol — on Instagram, even posting a picture with the caption “squad” with Tlaib, Omar and Pressley.

How did we get here?

A little history. The truth is that while most Americans had no idea what the Freedom Caucus was until a few weeks ago when it became the official opposition to the Obamacare replacement plan, this group has quietly existed for a while. Two years ago, the most conservative members of the House – myself included – banded together to force leadership to give conservatives a seat at the table when negotiating major legislation. Our goal was to advance the most conservative agenda possible in Congress and give a voice to our constituents who felt that they did not have one. Until this year, we faced a president who opposed everything we stood for, and a leadership that excluded us. This year, that changed.

From start to finish, Speaker Ryan has gone out of his way to be inclusive, and President Trump literally brought us to the table, listening to our concerns, agreeing to some of the group’s demands, and changing the bill to be more conservative. The caucus asked for major concessions, and the bill was changed to include some of them. At a meeting at the White House, the president even agreed to change what is considered Essential Health Benefits by amending the bill to allow states to make that decision. But the goalpost kept moving further and further down the field. It became clear to me that no matter what was included and changed, the answer would still be no. That’s why I left the Freedom Caucus even though I agree with them on most issues and consider them my friends. The bill wasn’t perfect – no piece of legislation is – but it was absolutely far better than Obamacare. Like it or not, the reality of the makeup of the House and Senate is that if you demand a purist repeal of Obamacare, it will die on the floor. This was our chance to make meaningful change.

The Freedom Caucus served as a check on a liberal administration and former House leadership that repeatedly compromised with Democrats. Times have changed. Republicans – mostly conservatives – control it all now. It is our time to lead. It is our time to unify and deliver on the promises that we made for years. Those calling for otherwise have been in Washington long enough to know that you do not get everything you want in any bill.

We can no longer allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. The American Health Care Act included major conservative reforms.

I want to be part of the conservative majority that delivers solutions. Americans voted for solutions. Americans voted for help to make their lives easier and more affordable. We must give them the solutions they demand, that they deserve, and that we promised.

Speaker John Boehner thinks he’s learned from his mistakes.

After his secret debt negotiations last year with President Barack Obama sparked a sharp round of blowback from conservatives, his leadership and members of his House Republican Conference, Boehner has launched a carefully choreographed campaign on the high-stakes fiscal cliff talks.

The new strategy was unveiled Wednesday in the Rayburn Room of the Capitol. But before that, just hours after Mitt Romney lost his bid for the White House, Boehner sent a copy of his 11-minute speech to Rep. Paul Ryan, sure to be a conservative power center in the House Republican Conference. His leadership team got a peek as well.

“This is where I’m going,” Boehner told his leadership colleagues, according to sources familiar with the conversation. The message — there should be no surprises what he’s aiming for.

Boehner’s speech — there were 17 versions of it before the final draft — was read Wednesday from a teleprompter, almost unheard of for the off-the-cuff Boehner.

Every word seemed carefully chosen. Boehner quoted from the Bible, mentioned former Speaker Tip O’Neill’s famous tax compromise with Ronald Reagan and pleaded with Obama to lead.

Boehner sounds like a man ready to make a deal, but he has an excruciating negotiating task in finding something that somehow passes muster with an invigorated second-term Democratic president, a reinforced Senate Democratic majority and a conservative House majority.

Boehner said he was prepared to raise new revenue for the government — but not increase tax rates — as long as the White House would agree to entitlement reform. Republicans were “ready to be led,” Boehner said, attempting to shift the burden for what comes next squarely onto Obama’s shoulders.

Boehner’s and Obama’s 2011 talks over the $4 trillion “grand bargain” collapsed under the weight of mutual suspicion and distrust. Both sides blamed each other for the failure.

Now, Obama’s win has changed all of that. Taxes are set to jump on all Americans Jan. 1, providing a hard backstop for a deal. There is a new urgency among Republicans to reach some agreement with Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

Boehner thinks he has more room to maneuver with his own colleagues, including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who aides excruciatingly note is on the same page as the No. 1. He has laid out his principles in public. In the summer of 2011, Boehner was negotiating with a president up for reelection, a House filled with red-hot firebrands and a leadership team dragged down by internal staff warfare. This time, his party has suffered an electoral beat down and Obama has run his last campaign.

Boehner seems to have given up on repealing Obamacare — the birth moment for the tea party movement that propelled him into the speaker’s chair in 2010. He told ABC News on Thursday that “the election changes that” and “Obamacare is the law of the land.” His staff later softened that stance.",www.politico.com,left,2R526wCpZGwpXAGN
us_house,CNN - Editorial,0,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/24/politics/donald-trump-nancy-pelosi-government-shutdown/index.html,OPINION: Pelosi claims win over Trump in State of the Union showdown,2019-01-24,Analysis Stephen Collinson,"The House speaker , fortified by brutal polling for Donald Trump , refuses to provide the President an easy way out of his own political box as the government shutdown sparked by his demand for a border wall drags into a 34th day .
In his latest skirmish with Pelosi , Trump effectively admitted defeat late Wednesday and conceded that he would not be able to give his State of the Union address until after the shutdown ends . Earlier in the day , he had publicly thrown down a gauntlet and tried to force the speaker to back down over her refusal to let next Tuesday 's showpiece speech take place in the House chamber .
Pelosi 's victory came ahead of a pair of Senate votes due to take place on Thursday on dueling Republican and Democratic plans designed to end the shutdown . Neither is likely to break the deadlock , and may simply underline that Trump 's hopes of a win remain slim .
The President is trying hard to reshape a political battlefield that is stacked against him , as sources suggest he is increasingly mystified that his tactics have not turned the tables on Democrats . Throughout his life , in business and in politics , Trump has leveraged his domineering personality , flair for showmanship and an unshakable self-belief that often defies the facts of a situation to get his way .
But he is finding in the new political context of divided Washington against an experienced adversary that his force of will and talent for engineering televised spectacles are not moving the political needle .
After Pelosi accepted his dare Wednesday and canceled his State of the Union address , Trump lashed out but failed to come up with an effective response .
`` She 's afraid of the truth and the super left Democrats , the radical Democrats , '' the President said at the White House while teasing an alternative plan for the address .
But later , the President announced on Twitter that he had shelved an idea that would have done more to showcase his diminished political standing than to damage the Democratic leadership of the House .
`` I am not looking for an .... alternative venue for the SOTU Address because there is no venue that can compete with the history , tradition and importance of the House Chamber . I look forward to giving a 'great ' State of the Union Address in the near future ! '' Trump tweeted .
Trump did not specifically rule out some kind of political event next Tuesday .
CNN 's Kaitlan Collins reported that White House officials were caught off guard with Pelosi 's swift , decisive response . Her move left the President looking outmatched and out of answers when his bluster was returned with interest .
It 's looking more and more like the President misjudged the politics of the shutdown or is perhaps so trapped in his West Wing and media bubble that he 's not getting an accurate fix on his worsening political position .
Little that he does -- an Oval Office address , a trip to the border , a weekend offer that was swiftly rejected by Democrats -- seems to improve his position .
Polls show that a majority of the public still solidly blames Trump for the shutdown and are opposed to his border wall -- 71 % in a new CBS poll said it 's not worth the shutdown .
The spectacle of the President and the speaker squabbling over a speech meant to highlight national unity , was hardly in keeping with the dignity of either of their offices . Pelosi 's claim that the shutdown meant the Capitol could not be secured is also debatable .
It could take a few days to see whether Pelosi 's move would make her look `` petty '' as Trump 's counselor Kellyanne Conway had predicted .
Trump former economic adviser Stephen Moore said on CNN that Pelosi 's move was a `` seventh-grade '' maneuver and was motivated by a desire to prevent a repeat of what was widely reviewed as a strong State of the Union address by the President last year .
But Pelosi 's hardball tactics amounted to a literal example of how she is using the constitutional mechanism of government to constrain and frustrate Trump and a reminder of the importance of the Democratic midterm election victory .
She has deprived Trump of a chance to make his best case to Americans on the shutdown in a spotlight he loves . The pageantry of the State of the Union gives a president a symbolic advantage and filter free access to tens of millions of viewers . Trump could have used a prime-time stage to weave a narrative about his presidency as a whole , to stress the strength of the economy and what he regards as the success of his nuclear diplomacy with North Korea .
The risk for Pelosi is that her strategy will turn off voters who are wary of overreach by the new Democratic majority or that she could appear as much to blame as Trump for the Washington tomfoolery .
So far though , she 's on firm political ground . The CBS News poll on Tuesday suggested that Trump 's position is deteriorating . In a finding that must be especially galling for the master of the art of the deal , 47 % of those asked thought that the speaker was doing a better job handling shutdown talks , compared to 35 % for the President .
A CNN Poll of Polls shows the President 's job approval down to 37 % , down from 41 % in November and December , after a month in which news about the shutdown has drowned out most other political activity . But the President , true to his life 's mantra , is showing no sign of giving up and believes that Americans will eventually come round to his argument that a border wall is critical to national security .
`` Ultimately the American people will have their way , because they want to see no crime . They want to see what we 're doing , '' he said .
People who were with Trump on Wednesday see no sign at all that he is willing to `` cave '' in the shutdown . But CNN 's Pamela Brown cited a White House official who says the President keeps asking aides `` why are we getting all the blame ? ''
The official said Trump believes he is taking all the hits but is the only one at the negotiating table making concessions .
It 's not easy to see how the President can turn things around quickly . At this point his best hope might be that he can simply wait out Democrats , as the pain worsens for government workers lining up at food banks , going without medicines and calling in sick because they ca n't afford gas .
But that scenario would likely damage him as much as his rivals .
A GOP source told CNN 's Dana Bash that Trump was again considering executive actions , short of declaring a national emergency , to go around Congress and build a wall that is critical to his political base .
While the President could have used the drawing power of his office to attract attention for any replacement speech , it would , as he said , lack the impact of a formal State of the Union address . An alternative event might have also posed questions for television networks that covered Trump 's Oval Office address several weeks ago and did n't get much news in exchange for the airtime .
A speech in a campaign rally setting would only have stressed the fact that , as is so often the case in his presidency , he was talking only to his own political supporters , rather than the entire nation .
And the fact that the President would have been forced to find somewhere else to give the annual address would only have underlined that the state of the union is such that he can not even take his place in the House to give the speech .
There 's nothing that says , however , that the speech has to take place in January , or even at all . The Constitution states that the President shall `` from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient . ''
Donna Hoffman , a professor of political science at the University of Northern Iowa , co-author of a book about the evolution of the State of the Union , suggested before Trump 's late night tweets that the President would be better off waiting .
`` If I was someone advising President Trump I might say , as a matter of fact , wait until the government has reopened because the speaker at that point wo n't really have a reason not to invite him , '' said Hoffman .
`` And then he would still have the trappings , he would be the center again and then ... whatever the result of the shutdown debacle has been he could frame that however he wants to , '' she said .","The House speaker, fortified by brutal polling for Donald Trump, refuses to provide the President an easy way out of his own political box as the government shutdown sparked by his demand for a border wall drags into a 34th day.

Trump former economic adviser Stephen Moore said on CNN that Pelosi's move was a ""seventh-grade"" maneuver and was motivated by a desire to prevent a repeat of what was widely reviewed as a strong State of the Union address by the President last year.

But Pelosi's hardball tactics amounted to a literal example of how she is using the constitutional mechanism of government to constrain and frustrate Trump and a reminder of the importance of the Democratic midterm election victory.

She has deprived Trump of a chance to make his best case to Americans on the shutdown in a spotlight he loves. The pageantry of the State of the Union gives a president a symbolic advantage and filter free access to tens of millions of viewers. Trump could have used a prime-time stage to weave a narrative about his presidency as a whole, to stress the strength of the economy and what he regards as the success of his nuclear diplomacy with North Korea.

The risk for Pelosi is that her strategy will turn off voters who are wary of overreach by the new Democratic majority or that she could appear as much to blame as Trump for the Washington tomfoolery.

So far though, she's on firm political ground. The CBS News poll on Tuesday suggested that Trump's position is deteriorating. In a finding that must be especially galling for the master of the art of the deal, 47% of those asked thought that the speaker was doing a better job handling shutdown talks, compared to 35% for the President.

A CNN Poll of Polls shows the President's job approval down to 37%, down from 41% in November and December, after a month in which news about the shutdown has drowned out most other political activity. But the President, true to his life's mantra, is showing no sign of giving up and believes that Americans will eventually come round to his argument that a border wall is critical to national security.

""Ultimately the American people will have their way, because they want to see no crime. They want to see what we're doing,"" he said.

People who were with Trump on Wednesday see no sign at all that he is willing to ""cave"" in the shutdown. But CNN's Pamela Brown cited a White House official who says the President keeps asking aides ""why are we getting all the blame?""

The official said Trump believes he is taking all the hits but is the only one at the negotiating table making concessions.

A replacement State of the Union?

It's not easy to see how the President can turn things around quickly. At this point his best hope might be that he can simply wait out Democrats, as the pain worsens for government workers lining up at food banks, going without medicines and calling in sick because they can't afford gas.

But that scenario would likely damage him as much as his rivals.

A GOP source told CNN's Dana Bash that Trump was again considering executive actions, short of declaring a national emergency, to go around Congress and build a wall that is critical to his political base.

While the President could have used the drawing power of his office to attract attention for any replacement speech, it would, as he said, lack the impact of a formal State of the Union address. An alternative event might have also posed questions for television networks that covered Trump's Oval Office address several weeks ago and didn't get much news in exchange for the airtime.

A speech in a campaign rally setting would only have stressed the fact that, as is so often the case in his presidency, he was talking only to his own political supporters, rather than the entire nation.

And the fact that the President would have been forced to find somewhere else to give the annual address would only have underlined that the state of the union is such that he cannot even take his place in the House to give the speech.

There's nothing that says, however, that the speech has to take place in January, or even at all. The Constitution states that the President shall ""from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.""

Donna Hoffman, a professor of political science at the University of Northern Iowa, co-author of a book about the evolution of the State of the Union, suggested before Trump's late night tweets that the President would be better off waiting.

""If I was someone advising President Trump I might say, as a matter of fact, wait until the government has reopened because the speaker at that point won't really have a reason not to invite him,"" said Hoffman.

""And then he would still have the trappings, he would be the center again and then ... whatever the result of the shutdown debacle has been he could frame that however he wants to,"" she said.",www.cnn.com,left,ewzgP1yEdqL6V2cm

Further helping Mr. Boehner , at least for now , is the sense that he is no longer forced to look constantly over his shoulder , fearing a counterproductive move by Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia , the majority leader who has spent much of the past two years quietly maneuvering around Mr. Boehner .
Mr. Cantor signed on this week to Mr. Boehner ’ s package including $ 800 billion in new revenue , putting him squarely on the same page with the speaker . Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin , the chairman of the Budget Committee and recent vice-presidential candidate whom many of the most conservative members look to for cues , also signed on .
That proposal , along with the speaker ’ s approval of a decision to strip plum committee assignments from four members who consistently voted against the leadership , has brought great consternation from conservative groups and influential conservatives outside the House . But Mr. Boehner and the majority of his members seem willing to ignore the outcry .
Then there is the not-small matter of fund-raising : Mr. Boehner , who on Wednesday spoke briefly by phone with Mr. Obama about the budget standoff , raised nearly $ 100 million for Republican House candidates this election cycle , including incumbents , further securing good will .
The dynamic may shift if some members , especially those from very conservative regions , begin to chafe against any deal they feel gives too much ground to Democrats . But for now , Mr. Boehner ’ s stronger hand is a significant shift from previous periods of negotiations , from the first battle over a short-term spending agreement to a fight over the payroll tax to the battles last year over the debt ceiling that led to the current crisis .

“ Our members understand the serious issues this country faces , ” Mr. Boehner said Wednesday , when asked about the shift in his conference . “ They understand that we ’ ve got to solve this problem , and we will . ”
Several Republicans said Wednesday that the combination of the onerous nature of the potential tax increases and spending cuts and the realities of the recent election combined to bolster Mr. Boehner ’ s support .
“ I think the presidential election has something to do with it , ” said Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois . “ We understand that we ’ re going to have to deal with Obama for four more years . Also , there is an understanding that this is a very serious situation . ”
Over the last two years , many conservative members , buoyed by a group of freshmen who constantly moved the bar for Mr. Boehner on budget negotiations , seemed to drive much of the House agenda , assuming that a Republican would occupy the White House next year .
But with Mitt Romney ’ s and Mr. Ryan ’ s White House dreams dashed , Mr. Boehner resumes the role of the titular head of his party here , and many members realize they have little choice left but to support him .
“ He is the de facto negotiator for the party , ” said Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina , who along with other lawmakers from his state has given Mr. Boehner headaches in the past . “ Perhaps I am practicing the grace that comes from watching someone try to do what I myself can not do . ”
Further , many members saw some of their loudest oppositional colleagues marginalized or voted out of office , like Representative Joe Walsh of Illinois . In turn , members who have previously supported Mr. Boehner without comment are beginning to raise their voices .
“ I think many of us who were being quiet two summers ago are going to call it for what it is , ” said Representative Pat Tiberi , Republican of Ohio . It is Mr. Obama , not Mr. Boehner , he said , who should be the focus of Republican ire . Mr. Tiberi was at once resigned and hopeful .
“ I don ’ t think we have much leverage , to be honest , ” he said . But , he added , “ This is a rare opportunity to get something done . ”","“I want to be a strong advocate and say that I am with the speaker,” said Representative Scott Rigell of Virginia , a House freshman. “I am with the leadership.”

Further helping Mr. Boehner, at least for now, is the sense that he is no longer forced to look constantly over his shoulder, fearing a counterproductive move by Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader who has spent much of the past two years quietly maneuvering around Mr. Boehner.

Mr. Cantor signed on this week to Mr. Boehner’s package including $800 billion in new revenue, putting him squarely on the same page with the speaker. Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin , the chairman of the Budget Committee and recent vice-presidential candidate whom many of the most conservative members look to for cues, also signed on.

That proposal, along with the speaker’s approval of a decision to strip plum committee assignments from four members who consistently voted against the leadership, has brought great consternation from conservative groups and influential conservatives outside the House. But Mr. Boehner and the majority of his members seem willing to ignore the outcry.

Then there is the not-small matter of fund-raising: Mr. Boehner, who on Wednesday spoke briefly by phone with Mr. Obama about the budget standoff, raised nearly $100 million for Republican House candidates this election cycle, including incumbents, further securing good will.

The dynamic may shift if some members, especially those from very conservative regions, begin to chafe against any deal they feel gives too much ground to Democrats. But for now, Mr. Boehner’s stronger hand is a significant shift from previous periods of negotiations, from the first battle over a short-term spending agreement to a fight over the payroll tax to the battles last year over the debt ceiling that led to the current crisis.

Two days after Trump tweeted that four Democratic freshmen should “ go back ” to their home countries — though all are citizens and three were born in the U.S.A. — Democrats muscled the resolution through the chamber by 240-187 over strong GOP opposition . The rebuke was an embarrassing one for Trump , and he had appealed to GOP lawmakers not to go along , but there were four Republican votes for the resolution .
The measure carries no legal repercussions for the president and the vote was highly partisan , unlikely to cost him with his die-hard conservative base .
Before the showdown roll call , Trump characteristically plunged forward with time-tested insults . He accused his four outspoken critics of “ spewing some of the most vile , hateful and disgusting things ever said by a politician ” and added , “ If you hate our Country , or if you are not happy here , you can leave ! ” — echoing taunts long unleashed against political dissidents rather than opposing parties ’ lawmakers .
The president was joined by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and other top Republicans in trying to redirect the focus from Trump ’ s original tweets , which for three days have consumed Washington and drawn widespread condemnation . Instead , they tried playing offense by accusing the four congresswomen — among the Democrats ’ most left-leaning members and ardent Trump critics — of socialism , an accusation that ’ s already a central theme of the GOP ’ s 2020 presidential and congressional campaigns .
Even after two-and-a-half years of Trump ’ s turbulent governing style , the spectacle of a president futilely laboring to head off a House vote essentially proclaiming him to be a racist was extraordinary .
Underscoring the stakes , Republicans formally objected after Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said during a floor speech that Trump ’ s tweets were “ racist. ” Led by Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia , Republicans moved to have her words stricken from the record , a rare procedural rebuke .
After a delay exceeding 90 minutes , No . 2 House Democrat Steny Hoyer of Maryland ruled that Pelosi had indeed violated a House rule against characterizing an action as racist . Hoyer was presiding after Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri stormed away from the presiding officer ’ s chair , lamenting , “ We want to just fight , ” which he apparently aimed at Republicans . Despite Hoyer ’ s ruling , Democrats flexed their muscle and the House voted afterward by party-line to leave Pelosi ’ s words intact in the record .
Some rank-and-file GOP lawmakers have agreed that Trump ’ s words were racist , but on Tuesday party leaders insisted they were not and accused Democrats of using the resulting tumult to score political points . Among the few voices of restraint , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Trump wasn ’ t racist , but he also called on leaders “ from the president to the speaker to the freshman members of the House ” to attack ideas , not the people who espouse them .
“ There ’ s been a consensus that political rhetoric has gotten way , way heated across the political spectrum , ” said the Republican leader from Kentucky , breaking his own two days of silence on Trump ’ s attacks .
Hours earlier , Trump tweeted , “ Those Tweets were NOT Racist . I don ’ t have a Racist bone in my body ! ” He wrote that House Republicans should “ not show ‘ weakness ’ ” by agreeing to a resolution he labeled “ a Democrat con game . ”
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York , one of Trump ’ s four targets , returned his fire .
“ You ’ re right , Mr. President - you don ’ t have a racist bone in your body . You have a racist mind in your head and a racist heart in your chest , ” she tweeted .
The four-page Democratic resolution said the House “ strongly condemns President Donald Trump ’ s racist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color. ” It said Trump ’ s slights “ do not belong in Congress or in the United States of America . ”
All but goading Republicans , the resolution included a full page of remarks by President Ronald Reagan , who is revered by the GOP . Reagan said in 1989 that if the U.S. shut its doors to newcomers , “ our leadership in the world would soon be lost . ”
Republican leaders lobbied GOP lawmakers hard to oppose the resolution .
McCarthy called the measure “ all politics , ” and No . 3 House GOP leader Liz Cheney of Wyoming said the four Democrats “ are wrong when they attempt to impose the fraud of socialism on the American people . ”
The showdown came after years of Democrats bristling over anti-immigrant and racially incendiary pronouncements by Trump . Those include his kicking off his presidential campaign by proclaiming many Mexican migrants to be criminals and asserting there were “ fine people ” on both sides at a 2017 neo-Nazis rally in Charlottesville , Virginia , that turned deadly .
And the strong words in Washington come as actions are underway elsewhere : The administration has begun coast-to-coast raids targeting migrants in the U.S. illegally and has newly restricted access to the U.S. by asylum seekers .
Trump ’ s criticism was aimed at four freshman Democrats who have garnered attention since their arrival in January for their outspoken liberal views and thinly veiled distaste for Trump : Ocasio-Cortez and Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota , Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan . All were born in the U.S. except for Omar , who came to the U.S. as a child after fleeing Somalia with her family .
The four have been in an increasingly personal clash with Democratic Speaker Pelosi , too , over how assertively the House should be in trying to restrain Trump ’ s ability to curb immigration . But if anything , Trump ’ s tweets have served to ease some of that tension , with Pelosi telling Democrats at a closed-door meeting Tuesday , “ We are offended by what he said about our sisters , ” according to an aide in the room who described the private meeting on condition of anonymity .

The four rebellious freshmen joined Rep. Steven Cohen of Tennessee and a handful of others who wanted the House to vote on a harsher censure of Trump ’ s tweets . And Rep. Al Green of Texas was trying to force a House vote soon on whether to impeach Trump — a move he ’ s tried in the past but lost , earning opposition from most Democrats .
At the Senate Republicans ’ weekly lunch Tuesday , Trump ’ s tweets came up and some lawmakers were finding the situation irksome , participants said . Many want the 2020 campaigns to focus on progressive Democrats ’ demands for government-provided health care , abolishing the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and other hard-left policies .

Trey Gowdy , R-S.C. , tapped a veteran of Capitol Hill and the K Street lobbying world as majority staff director of the controversial panel , amid indications that opponents – both of the new staff director and of the committee ’ s mandate – are ramping up their efforts .
To lead the Republican majority staff , Gowdy selected Philip Kiko , a key aide to Rep. James Sensenbrenner , R-Wis. , when the latter served as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , and more recently a registered lobbyist for the Smith-Free Group , a K Street lobbying firm with a diverse roster of clients .
House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , swiftly welcomed Gowdy ’ s choice , calling Kiko “ a man of unquestioned integrity with a record of distinguished service ” in and out of Congress . “ His appointment today is further proof of Chairman Gowdy ’ s commitment to an investigation that is serious , fact-based , and professional , ” Boehner said in a statement , adding : “ There is no better person to help lead this effort than Phil . ”
However , emails obtained by Fox News show that some conservatives are unhappy with Kiko ’ s appointment , chiefly because of his recent lobbying activities . Emails circulating among a large group of conservative lawyers and former Capitol Hill staffers late Thursday , after Kiko ’ s selection became known , included sharp criticism of Kiko for having represented the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights ( LCCHR ) , among other clients .
In response to the criticism , Kiko told Fox News late Friday , `` I understand my job is to find the facts through a fair process . ''
Conservative activist Barbara Ledeen , a former top aide at the Senate Republican Conference , kicked off the email thread with an alert about Kiko ’ s selection and links to websites showing that the former general counsel to the House Judiciary Committee had lobbied for ACLU and LCCHR .
The links steered readers to , among other websites , freerepublic.com , a conservative chat room , where some writers had previously expressed displeasure with Kiko ’ s lobbying activities , including a reference to him as “ a self-described conservative. ” One writer reminded readers that LCCHR lists among its member organizations ACLU , People for the American Way , the Service Employees International Union , and the Southern Poverty Law Center .
Within hours of Ledeen ’ s otherwise neutral email – and among an elite email readership that numbered in the dozens and included prominent conservative intellectuals and activists like Alfred Regnery , C. Boyden Gray , Gary Bauer , Leonard Leo , Marjorie Dannenfelser , and David Addington – a defense of Kiko was mounted .
Makan Delrahim , a former deputy assistant attorney general in the administration of President George W. Bush , replied to Ledeen to say that he had worked closely with Kiko on the Patriot Act and other issues and to vouch for Kiko ’ s conservative credentials .
“ He is a solid R and more importantly a solid conservative , “ Delrahim wrote to the group . “ He is professional and had a reputation of being procedurally fair and thus respected by the Dems . I do n't know about his or his firm 's work for the far left groups…But one thing I am hopeful for is that his reputation for being fair and his tenure on House Judiciary will at least lessen the ability of [ D ] emocrats to dismiss the work of the committee as a political exercise , though they will still do that… ”
Larry Hart , director of government relations for the American Conservative Union , seconded Delrahim ’ s opinion to the group : “ In addition to being a solid conservative , Phil will not blink under the tremendous pressure the media fueled by the White House will put on this committee . ”
Others chimed in along similar lines . But Hans von Spakovsky , the senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation who formerly served on the Federal Election Commission under Bush , was unconvinced .
“ Perhaps someone can explain [ Kiko ’ s ] pushing the proposed Voting Rights Act amendment that would reimpose [ Attorney General Eric ] Holder 's control over elections in key Southern states and give the AG greatly expanded authority to intervene in almost any election dispute including election contests , ” von Spakovsky emailed the group on Friday .
“ The bill he is lobbying in favor of is in essence the wish list for every radical group from MALDEF [ the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund ] to the Brennan Center . ”
Federal records show Kiko ’ s lobbying clients have also included Time Warner Cable , the Biotechnology Industry Organization , and the Financial Services Roundtable , among many others .
At the same time , Washington lawyer and lobbyist Lanny Davis has announced that he will lead a “ truth squad ” on the work of the Benghazi committee . The former lawyer for President Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal – who has since served as a Fox News contributor and a lobbyist for foreign leaders with dubious human rights records – told WMAL radio hosts Larry O ’ Connor and Brian Wilson on Thursday that he intends to stand outside the door when the Benghazi panel holds its hearings , responding in real time to what he perceived as any Republican distortions about the terrorist attacks that killed four Americans , including the U.S. ambassador to Libya , in Benghazi on the night of September 11 , 2012 .
Davis disclosed that his efforts will be aided by Correct The Record , an advocacy group funded by the American Bridge 21st Century PAC , itself a super-PAC founded by liberal activist David Brock and funded in part by billionaire investor George Soros .

us_house,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/mar/7/anti-semitism-within-americas-gates/,Anti-Semitism within America's gates,2019-03-07,Cheryl K. Chumley,"Freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar , a Democrat Muslim representing Minnesota , has generated quite a controversy for suggesting that America ’ s historical support for Israel is tantamount to “ allegiance ” to a foreign nation and for previous remarks that she ’ s made regarding the Jewish people .
And rightly so . Her remarks ought not be taken lightly .
Just as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her socialist principles warn of a shocking , trending direction of America ’ s domestic politics , Omar ’ s statements serve as a harbinger of what could be coming down the pike for U.S. foreign policy .
What starts as subtlety can soon enough become rooted and sown .
Omar , in 2012 , tweeted “ Israel has hypnotized the world , may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel . ”
Last month , she tweeted that America ’ s traditional and long-standing support for Israel was “ all about the Benjamins ” — meaning , pro-Israel politicians in Congress were simply doing the bidding , blindly , of the Israeli lobbyists on Capitol Hill .
Then just recently , she referred to her fellow Democratic congressional colleague , Rep. Rashida Tlaib , another Muslim , and spoke of the unfairness of assumptions that “ everything we say about Israel ” must be “ anti-Semitic ” simply “ because we are Muslim . ”
And she finished with this : “ So for me , I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country . ”
Omar didn ’ t say “ Israel ” — but that ’ s what she meant .
And it ’ s problematic for two reasons : First off , supporting a nation financially and politically is not the same as rendering allegiance . Second off ? As Democrat Rep. Nita Lowey tweeted : “ Throughout history , Jews have been accused of dual loyalty , leading to discrimination and violence , which is why these accusations are so hurtful . ”
The House , under Speaker Nancy Pelosi , answered the calls of outrage against Omar ’ s latest by preparing a resolution condemning anti-Semitism — but without mentioning Omar by name . Why the cowardice ? Regardless , leftists are still rallying to Omar ’ s defense .
Linda Sarsour , co-leader of the Women ’ s March — who ’ s been soundly criticized for her own anti-Semitic ties and remarks — slammed Pelosi on Facebook for even suggesting a resolution .
“ Nancy is a typical white feminist upholding the patriarchy doing the dirty work of powerful white men , ” Sarsour wrote . “ God forbid the men are upset — no worries , Nancy to the rescue to stroke their egos . ”
Tlaib , in a tweet , complained Omar was “ being targeted just like many civil rights icons before us who spoke out about oppressive policies . ”
Ocasio-Cortez scolded in her own tweet that “ ‘ calling out ’ is one of the measures of last resort , not 1st or 2nd resort , ” and suggested House leadership was guilty of imposing an unfair punishment .
“ One of the things that is hurtful about the extent to which reprimand is sought of Ilhan is that no one seeks this level of reprimand when members make statements about Latinx + other communities , ” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted .
Meanwhile , look around . Anti-Semitism has been surfacing with alarming frequency at select spots around the nation .

Freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Democrat Muslim representing Minnesota, has generated quite a controversy for suggesting that America’s historical support for Israel is tantamount to “allegiance” to a foreign nation and for previous remarks that she’s made regarding the Jewish people.

And rightly so. Her remarks ought not be taken lightly.

Just as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her socialist principles warn of a shocking, trending direction of America’s domestic politics, Omar’s statements serve as a harbinger of what could be coming down the pike for U.S. foreign policy.

What starts as subtlety can soon enough become rooted and sown.

Omar, in 2012, tweeted “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.”

Last month, she tweeted that America’s traditional and long-standing support for Israel was “all about the Benjamins” — meaning, pro-Israel politicians in Congress were simply doing the bidding, blindly, of the Israeli lobbyists on Capitol Hill.

Then just recently, she referred to her fellow Democratic congressional colleague, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, another Muslim, and spoke of the unfairness of assumptions that “everything we say about Israel” must be “anti-Semitic” simply “because we are Muslim.”

And she finished with this: “So for me, I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.”

Omar didn’t say “Israel” — but that’s what she meant.

And it’s problematic for two reasons: First off, supporting a nation financially and politically is not the same as rendering allegiance. Second off? As Democrat Rep. Nita Lowey tweeted: “Throughout history, Jews have been accused of dual loyalty, leading to discrimination and violence, which is why these accusations are so hurtful.”

Yep. There’s that old anti-Semitism seeping in again.

It’s the response of others that’s even more concerning.

The House, under Speaker Nancy Pelosi, answered the calls of outrage against Omar’s latest by preparing a resolution condemning anti-Semitism — but without mentioning Omar by name. Why the cowardice? Regardless, leftists are still rallying to Omar’s defense.

Linda Sarsour, co-leader of the Women’s March — who’s been soundly criticized for her own anti-Semitic ties and remarks — slammed Pelosi on Facebook for even suggesting a resolution.

“Nancy is a typical white feminist upholding the patriarchy doing the dirty work of powerful white men,” Sarsour wrote. “God forbid the men are upset — no worries, Nancy to the rescue to stroke their egos.”

Tlaib, in a tweet, complained Omar was “being targeted just like many civil rights icons before us who spoke out about oppressive policies.”

Ocasio-Cortez scolded in her own tweet that “‘calling out’ is one of the measures of last resort, not 1st or 2nd resort,” and suggested House leadership was guilty of imposing an unfair punishment.

“One of the things that is hurtful about the extent to which reprimand is sought of Ilhan is that no one seeks this level of reprimand when members make statements about Latinx + other communities,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.

Meanwhile, look around. Anti-Semitism has been surfacing with alarming frequency at select spots around the nation.

“Anti-Semitic incidents surge on college campuses after Pittsburgh synagogue shooting,” Inside Higher Ed reported in December.

“Left-Wing Anti-Semitism: The Greatest Campus Threat Is Ignored by the SPLC,” FRC.org recently reported, about the Southern Poverty Law Center’s failure to adequately address the 1,700-plus reported anti-Semitic incidents on college campuses between 2015 and 2017.

And the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights said it has secured, in the last 13 years, “250 U.S. victories” with its Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign — the movement, commonly called BDS, that outright bars business dealings with companies tied to Israel.

Watch carefully, America.

First comes the talk, subtle, on the tongue of a serpent.

Then comes the action.

Finally comes the change in U.S. policy — and eventually, mass acceptance of what once was unthinkable.

Nipping Omar in the bud is not only crucial to preserving America’s long-standing relationship with Israel. It’s also crucial to making clear that America will never become a nation that tolerates anti-Semitism in word or deed — that America will always shut the gates firmly on anti-Semitism, in all its shapes and forms.

Two witnesses seen as crucial to the case against President Trump in the impeachment inquiry testified Wednesday .

Taylor testified that Sondland explained to him that Trump was a businessman and that a businessman expected something in return when writing a check . Taylor said he did n't think that made sense , because Ukraine did n't owe Trump anything .

Two witnesses seen as crucial to the case against President Trump in the impeachment inquiry testified Wednesday.

Much of what was said by acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor and George Kent, the State Department's top official on Ukraine policy, was previously known from their lengthy depositions released last week.

But there were some new things — and several moments that stood out. Here are seven:

1. A new detail from a new witness emerges

Taylor revealed that in the past week, a member of his staff shared some new information with him about a call between President Trump and European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland that tied Trump to an effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate former vice president and current presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

""Following the call with President Trump,"" Taylor said, ""the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of (Joe) Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for.""

Multiple congressional sources identified David Holmes as the aide to Taylor. Holmes is scheduled to testify in a closed-door session on Friday.

It's unclear whether he would also be called to testify in an open session.

2. Trump felt he was wronged and Ukraine owed him

On President Trump's now-infamous call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump said, ""[T]he United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily ...""

""There was a feeling by President Trump,"" Taylor said, ""that he had a feeling of having been wronged by the Ukrainians, and so this was something that he thought they owed him to fix that wrong.""

3. The controversy about the Bidens

Kent noted that during the Obama administration, he raised concerns about the potential perception of a conflict of interest of Hunter Biden serving on the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, while his father, Joe Biden, was handling Ukraine policy as vice president. He said nothing was done about it.

He added that the president's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was ""looking to dig up political dirt on a political rival in the next election cycle"" in Ukraine.

Taylor agreed with Kent's assessment.

4. ""You're their star witness?""

One of President Trump's chief defenders Wednesday was Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.

He argued that neither Taylor nor Kent had firsthand knowledge of many of their allegations and, therefore, had less credibility. Jordan dismissed Taylor this way:

""You weren't on the call, were you? ... You didn't listen in on President Trump's call, President Zelenskiy? ... You never talked with Chief of Staff Mulvaney. ... You never met the president. ...

5. GOP raises Ukrainian suspicions, corruption

Taking center stage were the staff counsels, the Democrats' Daniel Goldman and Republicans' Steve Castor.

""Now Mr. Kent, corruption in Ukraine is endemic, correct?"" Castor asked.

""That's correct,"" Kent replied.

""And it affects the courts, the prosecutors, and there have historically been problems with all the prosecutors in Ukraine, correct?"" Castor added.

Castor tried to establish that Ukrainian corruption is rampant, so it would make sense that President Trump would want that looked into. And he also tried to raise suspicions around Ukrainians who said not-so-nice things about candidate Trump.

As Taylor explained to California Rep. Devin Nunes, the House Intelligence Committee's ranking member, Trump said during his presidential campaign that perhaps Crimea should be recognized as Russian.

""That sentiment is amazingly inflammatory to all Ukrainians,"" Taylor said.

6. Summing up the GOP rebuttal

New York Rep. Elise Stefanik summed up the GOP rebuttal as to why Trump should not be impeached by making two points:

""For the millions of Americans viewing today,"" she said, ""the two most important facts are the following:

""No. 1, Ukraine received the aid.

""No. 2, there was, in fact, no investigation into Biden.""

Can't see the video? Click here.

Jordan and others laid out why it would be valid for Trump to ask about the things he asked Zelenskiy to look into because:

1. Various Ukrainians did have problems with Trump (planting the seed that it's possible that Ukrainians had some role in 2016 election interference).

2. The head of Burisma was seen by many U.S. and international officials as corrupt, so it's a valid request to ask for an investigation, especially in a country known for corruption.

The U.S. intelligence community has assessed, and the Mueller report affirmed, that it was, in fact, the Russians who interfered with the 2016 elections, not Ukrainians. Kent also pushed back on the idea that Ukraine interfered.

""To my knowledge, there is no factual basis, no,"" he said.

Republicans also argued that Taylor and Kent's testimonies were based on hearsay, and that, in the end, Trump favored more robust military aid to Ukraine than President Obama.

7. Leaving a seat open for President Trump

Republicans complained on several occasions during Wednesday's testimony that they'd like to see the whistleblower testify, going so far as to unsuccessfully raise a procedural motion to bring the whistleblower before the committee.

""There's one witness they won't bring in front of us,"" Jordan said, ""they won't bring in front of the American people. That's the guy who started it all — the whistleblower.""

Where the facts stand in the Trump-Ukraine scandal

The impeachment inquiry has reached a point where relatively few of the underlying facts are disputed. Extensive witness testimony and documents have clarified the following:

Very soon after Ukraine elected a new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in April 2019, Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani began urging Zelensky’s team to launch certain investigations Trump wanted.

Some Trump administration officials became involved in this effort, too. Specifically, they demanded investigations into Burisma (a Ukrainian gas company that Joe Biden’s son Hunter sat on the board of) and into purported Ukrainian interference with the 2016 US election.

When Trump talked to Zelensky on the phone on July 25, he brought up both investigations specifically and urged Zelensky to talk to Giuliani and Attorney General Bill Barr about them.

The Ukrainians were seeking a White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky. Trump officials told them that they wouldn’t get it unless they committed to those investigations: a quid pro quo.

Around the same time, Trump was holding up nearly $400 million in military assistance Congress had approved for Ukraine’s government. Ambassador Sondland has admitted telling the Ukrainians that they likely wouldn’t get the aid unless they placated Trump by publicly committing to the investigations. The aid, however, was let through just before this scandal broke into public view.

We’re still lacking some facts about the military aid holdup and release (because the key officials involved, like acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Adviser John Bolton have refused to testify). Still, the question of whether a quid pro quo was presented to the Ukrainians is no longer in doubt. In fact, two were — first, a White House meeting in exchange for investigations, and then, releasing military aid in exchange for investigations.

Meanwhile, Trump’s team is still trying to downplay the extent of the president’s involvement in all this — arguing that it was limited to what he said on just one phone call. But more information keeps coming out suggesting he was personally involved in what his aides and allies were doing all along.

What the witnesses will talk about this week

Nine separate witnesses are expected to testify this week. Some were more involved in the scandal than others — and some may be more eager to defend Trump politically than others.

For instance, three of the approved witnesses — Kurt Volker, Tim Morrison, and David Hale — were actually requested by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. (The GOP requested a longer list, but Democrats only approved those they deemed most relevant to the inquiry).

None of these witnesses will get Trump off the hook, exactly — in fact, Morrison’s testimony can be read as quite damning for Trump, and Volker turned over a plethora of text messages that have been crucial evidence for Democrats. But Republicans who heard their closed-door testimony evidently concluded they’d each by politically helpful in some way.

Another witness — Gordon Sondland — has also seemed to be trying gamely to protect Trump in his testimony so far, often in ways that strain credulity. For instance, he has argued that the quid pro quo push came relatively late and that he didn’t even realize it was about the Bidens, he has tried to put the blame for it on Giuliani, and he has repeatedly failed to “recall” any personal involvement from Trump in it.

But after Sondland went in to give his initial deposition, other witnesses told the impeachment investigators a very different story. They recalled that Sondland was heavily involved in demanding investigations from the Ukrainians, and that he repeatedly claimed to have talked with Trump about the topic and to be carrying out Trump’s wishes.

One new witness, Kyiv-based State Department official David Holmes, came forward just recently to reveal that he saw Sondland call President Trump while they were in a restaurant together. Holmes said he could hear Trump ask about “investigations,” that Sondland assured him the Ukrainians would play ball, and that Sondland said after the call that Trump only really cared about Ukraine for the purposes of investigating Biden.

Holmes was a late addition to Democrats’ hearing lineup, and will appear Thursday. The other witnesses called by Democrats include, as mentioned, Fiona Hill and Alexander Vindman (National Security Council officials who were deeply concerned by the push for investigations), Laura Cooper (a Defense Department official who struggled to learn why the White House was blocking aid to Ukraine), and Jennifer Williams (a State Department official detailed to Vice President Mike Pence’s staff).",www.vox.com,left,tjwuuZNtDniB6Go2
us_house,Fox Online News,2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-press-for-whistleblower-testimony-and-for-answers-on-a-hearing-delay,"Republicans press for whistleblower testimony, and for answers on a hearing delay",,Gregg Re,"Just hours after dozens of House Republicans stormed a closed-door deposition in a secure area and disrupted Democrats ' impeachment inquiry , House Oversight Committee ranking member Jim Jordan kept the pressure on Democrats by pushing for more transparency -- including public testimony from the whistleblower at the center of the probe .
In an initial letter to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff on Wednesday , Jordan -- joined by House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes and Foreign Affairs Committee ranking member Michael McCaul -- called for the whistleblower to come out of hiding , so that his or her `` sources and credibility '' can be `` fully assessed . ''
The committee chairs noted that Schiff had previously promised that the whistleblower would provide `` unfiltered '' testimony `` very soon '' concerning an Aug. 12 complaint .
But , the Republicans charged , Schiff abruptly `` reversed course '' after reports of the whistleblower 's potential political bias emerged , along with evidence that Democratic congressional committee staff had spoken to the whistleblower before the complaint was filed .
The Republicans asserted that evidence has also emerged that `` contradicts '' the claims in the whistleblower 's initial complaint , including that the Ukrainian president has said he felt no `` pressure '' during a July call with President Trump to investigate 2020 Dem front-runner Joe Biden , his son Hunter and Biden business interests in Ukraine .
Multiple apparent inconsistencies in the whistleblower 's complaint , including the whistleblower 's erroneous claim that Trump had asked Ukrainians to hand over a server , have previously prompted Republicans to demand more information on the person 's sources .

In an initial letter to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff on Wednesday, Jordan -- joined by House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes and Foreign Affairs Committee ranking member Michael McCaul -- called for the whistleblower to come out of hiding, so that his or her ""sources and credibility"" can be ""fully assessed.""

The committee chairs noted that Schiff had previously promised that the whistleblower would provide ""unfiltered"" testimony ""very soon"" concerning an Aug. 12 complaint.

But, the Republicans charged, Schiff abruptly ""reversed course"" after reports of the whistleblower's potential political bias emerged, along with evidence that Democratic congressional committee staff had spoken to the whistleblower before the complaint was filed.

READ THE REPUBLICANS' LETTER TO SCHIFF

The Republicans asserted that evidence has also emerged that ""contradicts"" the claims in the whistleblower's initial complaint, including that the Ukrainian president has said he felt no ""pressure"" during a July call with President Trump to investigate 2020 Dem front-runner Joe Biden, his son Hunter and Biden business interests in Ukraine.

Multiple apparent inconsistencies in the whistleblower's complaint, including the whistleblower's erroneous claim that Trump had asked Ukrainians to hand over a server, have previously prompted Republicans to demand more information on the person's sources.

The lawmakers further demanded testimony from any sources the whistleblower relied upon to draft the complaint, which contained only secondhand information.

The Republicans emphasized that they lack co-equal subpoena power with majority Democrats -- a key one-sided limitation that the White House has cited in explaining why it will not cooperate with the Democrats' probe.

GOP STORMS THE SCIF

House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., claimed that Schiff ""fled with the testifying witness"" when roughly 50 Republicans, including several not on one of those three committees, went ""face-to-face and demand access to ongoing impeachment proceedings.""

But his adversaries on the far right want to discredit his campaign before it even begins — and they ’ re using Ryan ’ s extensive pro-immigration record as their key weapon .
From his days battling a restrictive California immigration ballot measure in the early 1990s , to his quiet efforts the past two years to help build GOP consensus for immigration reform , Ryan has a lengthy history of pushing for an overhaul that runs counter to the most conservative wings of his own party .
There will be a “ major intraparty battle over immigration if Paul comes forward , ” predicted Rep. Steve King ( R-Iowa ) , a well-known immigration hard-liner , in an interview this week . “ And a majority of the conference is on my side of this argument . ”
No matter who ultimately succeeds outgoing Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) , there is a near-zero chance that Congress will take up comprehensive immigration changes during the remainder of President Barack Obama 's administration . But Ryan ’ s business-centric approach in favor of boosting legal immigration and letting undocumented immigrants “ get right with the law ” are anathema to the far right who believe Ryan is no different than Boehner himself , who has fruitlessly tried since 2012 to persuade House Republicans to pass reforms .
Indeed , Ryan ’ s track record on immigration runs at least two decades deep . And during Congress ' failed attempt at comprehensive reform the past two years , Ryan wielded significant influence behind the scenes — from keeping tabs on closed-door House negotiations to meeting privately with Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) , a key leader in the Senate on an immigration overhaul .
Schumer and Ryan shared a similar goal — sweeping changes to the nation ’ s immigration laws — and the two men struck up a casual relationship over at least five secret talks in Schumer ’ s hideaway at the Capitol to discuss how to get immigration reform done during the 113th Congress .
The two influential lawmakers never negotiated actual policy — Ryan would shut down any such talk . But he assured Schumer the House was working on an immigration package that would be done in their own fashion . Schumer , in turn , would insist Senate Democrats — then in the majority — would have to be part of the conversation , since no bill would get to Obama without their backing .
“ He thought it was in the economic interest of America ” to do immigration reform , said a person with close knowledge of the discussions between Ryan and Schumer .
Ryan is not even officially in the race for speaker , and is only grudgingly considering the option . And during those long-ago immigration conversations with Schumer , Ryan would remark that he would never want Boehner ’ s job , the person with knowledge of the talks said .
But now , Ryan ’ s immigration stances are drawing fire from conservatives both on and off Capitol Hill . For instance , King said he would not support Ryan for speaker , noting that he has long opposed leadership candidates who are “ pro-amnesty ” and that he is still backing Rep. Daniel Webster ( R-Fla. ) to take charge of the House . Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks , another House Republican who holds hard-line views on immigration , shared similar sentiments , telling Fox News earlier this week that he would need assurances from Ryan he would not push for immigration reform if he were to become speaker .
Once the Ryan-for-speaker boomlet took flight in earnest last week , conservative talk show host Mark Levin tweeted : “ NOT SO FAST ! Paul Ryan an amnesty advocate , along with his buddy Luis Gutierrez . ”
And advocacy groups pushing for more restrictive immigration policies already are fretting over a prospective Speaker Ryan , pointing to his two decades of policy work aimed at bringing more legal immigrants into the United States .
There are other conservative grievances against Ryan , to be sure . Hard-right opponents of Ryan have pointed to his dealings with Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington to craft a two-year budget deal that boosted some government spending . Ryan voted for the $ 700 billion bank bailout at the height of the 2008 financial crisis , and he is an unabashed promoter of free trade .
But immigration , in the eyes of some hard-liners , is where Ryan has committed his gravest political sins .
Ryan ’ s interest in the issue began in the early 1990s , when he was a young staffer working under former Rep. Jack Kemp ( R-N.Y. ) at the conservative think tank Empower America . There , the men worked to whip up opposition to Proposition 187 , a controversial 1994 ballot measure in California that would deny key public benefits to immigrants here illegally .
The measure passed , but was ultimately never enacted due to court challenges . And the GOP ’ s advocacy of Proposition 187 has been widely blamed for damaging the party ’ s standing with California Latinos — a message Ryan repeated in a 2013 interview , where he recounted his efforts to kill the measure .
Both Ryan and Kemp — a well-known pro-immigration Republican — were concerned that Proposition 187 would “ make it so that Latino voters would not hear the other messages of empowerment , ” Ryan said during the interview with EWTN , a Catholic television network .
In 1995 , Ryan became legislative director to then-Kansas Rep. Sam Brownback , another Republican who has a long history on immigration reform . A Hill battle over immigration flared anew in 1996 , when the GOP-led Congress began considering a far-reaching measure targeting both legal and illegal immigration .
Working under Brownback , Ryan was one of the masterminds behind a series of “ Dear Colleague ” letters from the Kansas Republican , and former Reps. Howard Berman ( D-Calif. ) and Dick Chrysler ( R-Mich. ) that warned against a restrictive immigration bill , from then-Sen. Alan Simpson ( R-Wyo . ) and Rep. Lamar Smith ( R-Texas ) , who remains one of the staunchest foes of immigration in the House .
`` Smith was getting a free ride because he knew immigration law so much better than most of the other members , '' Ryan said in a 1996 interview with Wired magazine . `` Once people learned what was actually in the bill , we were able to peel them off , one by one . ''
Anti-immigration proponents also blame Ryan and his allies for an amendment from Brownback , Berman and Chrysler that killed provisions in the 1996 restrictive immigration measure to dramatically reduce the number of legal immigrants allowed into the United States . The amendment passed , 238-183 .
“ He has always worked for the crony capitalists on immigration , ” said Roy Beck , the president of Numbers USA , which works to limit immigration into the United States . “ He was a young guy [ during the 1990s fight ] . But that was the ideology he learned . ”
The politics of immigration ebbed and flowed during Ryan ’ s years on Capitol Hill , and Ryan has taken some hard-line positions , too . He voted in favor of an illegal immigration crackdown bill in 2005 from Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner , a fellow Wisconsin Republican — legislation that bolstered both interior enforcement policies and border security provisions but triggered a wave of demonstrations nationwide protesting the bill .
But that same year , Ryan endorsed legislation from Rep. Luis Gutierrez ( D-Ill. ) , and then-Arizona GOP Reps. Jim Kolbe and Jeff Flake ( now a senator ) — a complete overhaul of the immigration system that would legalize undocumented immigrants , and was backed by Sens . Ted Kennedy ( D-Mass . ) and John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) in the Senate .
Ryan “ was a co-sponsor of the bill that Gutierrez was in favor of , ” said Mark Krikorian , executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies , which favors stricter migration policies . “ For me , that tells you everything . ”
Gutierrez saw an opportunity to revive the ties with Ryan over immigration in late 2012 , when the liberal Illinois Democrat and outspoken immigration advocate approached the Republican vice-presidential nominee , who had just come off a stinging national electoral loss , at the House gym . The two men — who had bonded over their mutual Catholic faith , one aide said — would later jointly appear at pro-immigration events in Chicago , where Ryan would press the economic case for reform .
In addition to that public effort , Ryan was involved behind the scenes . He was never part of a bipartisan gang of House negotiators who ultimately failed to come up with a comprehensive bill in 2013 . But Ryan still gave help when needed , like when the group needed help with some budgetary impacts of policies they were considering .
Later , in 2014 , Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart ( R-Fla. ) was the public face of the House GOP push on immigration for much of the early part of the year . Meanwhile , Ryan was a quiet partner as the Florida Republican worked assiduously on a bill — and Ryan was ready to defend the measure publicly after it was released .
But in June 2014 , then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor ( R-Va. ) lost in a stunning primary election that was blamed in part due to Cantor ’ s tentative support for immigration reform . Private support from GOP lawmakers for Diaz-Balart ’ s effort , which at one point got soft commitments from at least 120 House Republicans , evaporated .
And Ryan , talking with Schumer once again , made it clear the chances of doing immigration reform in the House after Cantor ’ s loss were gone . According to the person with knowledge of the discussions , Ryan told Schumer that he didn ’ t have any “ juice ” to push House Republicans on immigration after Cantor ’ s defeat .
In this new Congress , Ryan has thrown himself into his new position as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , a dream job for him . As immigration reform fell off Congress ’ radar this year , Ryan has said little on the issue .
