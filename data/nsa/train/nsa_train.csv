Development of a U.S. counterattack for cyberterrorism that could do more harm than good was one of the final events that drove Edward Snowden to leak government secrets, the former National Security Agency contractor tells Wired magazine.

Snowden, photographed for the story clutching an American flag, said the MonsterMind program was designed to detect a foreign cyberattack and keep it from entering the country. But it also would automatically fire back. The problem, he said, is malware can be routed through an innocent third-party country.

""These attacks can be spoofed,"" he told Wired. ""You could have someone sitting in China, for example, making it appear that one of these attacks is originating in Russia. And then we end up shooting back at a Russian hospital. What happens next?""

Snowden, 31, also told the magazine he hopes to return to the U.S. someday.

""I told the government I'd volunteer for prison, as long as it served the right purpose,"" he said. ""I care more about the country than what happens to me. But we can't allow the law to become a political weapon or agree to scare people away from standing up for their rights, no matter how good the deal. I'm not going to be part of that.""

Snowden was a contractor for Booz Allen Hamilton when he leaked details of U.S. surveillance programs to The Guardian and The Washington Post. The first reports were published in June 2013, setting off an immediate global firestorm. Snowden, who was in hiding in Hong Kong at the time, fled to Moscow where he still lives.

His impact had staying power.

President Obama promised to scale back surveillance of American citizens. Germany ordered the CIA station chief out of the country. The Guardian and Post won the Pulitzer prize for public service for their coverage.

Snowden previously expressed interest in returning to the United States, but said he feared an unjust trial on charges of espionage and theft of government property could result in a lengthy prison sentence. He remains adamant that what he did was for the good of the country.

MonsterMind for example, he told Wired, could accidentally start a war. And it's the ultimate threat to privacy because it requires the NSA to gain access to virtually all private communications coming in from overseas.

""The argument is that the only way we can identify these malicious traffic flows and respond to them is if we're analyzing all traffic flows,"" he said. ""And if we're analyzing all traffic flows, that means we have to be intercepting all traffic flows. That means violating the Fourth Amendment, seizing private communications without a warrant, without probable cause or even a suspicion of wrongdoing. For everyone, all the time.""

It's an example of the breadth of NSA surveillance, he said. And everybody forgot about or simple ignored the rules.

""You get exposed to a little bit of evil, a little bit of rule-breaking, a little bit of dishonesty, a little bit of deceptiveness, a little bit of disservice to the public interest, and you can brush it off, you can come to justify it,"" Snowden told Wired. ""But if you do that, it creates a slippery slope that just increases over time. And by the time you've been in 15 years, 20 years, 25 years, you've seen it all and it doesn't shock you.

What counterterrorism tools does the U.S. lose?

The government loses authorities under three Patriot Act provisions.

The biggest and most controversial is the government's sweeping powers under Section 215 that allow the NSA to collect telephone metadata on millions of Americans and store that data for five years. That is, for the time being, gone.

Law enforcement officials also won't be allowed to get a roving wiretap to track terror suspects who frequently change communications devices, like phones. Instead, they will need to get individual warrants for each new device.

So those tools are now completely gone?

Not exactly.

FBI and NSA officials are allowed to continue using Section 215 and the roving wiretap provision in investigations they began before the June 1 expiration date.

Any new investigations will have to go without the roving wiretaps and the ability to petition the secret FISA court for warrants to seize business records, like telephone metadata, in terrorism cases.

The process of winding down that program was ongoing last week, and the NSA was slated to cut off its connections to telecommunications companies starting at 4 p.m. ET Sunday.

Why is it such a long process?

Officials said the government began ""winding down"" the bulk data collection program during the week leading up to the deadline.

A U.S. administration official who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information said ""taking down the system"" involves shutting off inputs between telecom companies and U.S. intelligence, ""bringing down servers"" and configuring ""our monitoring software"" to keep officials from accessing any data at telecommunication companies.

""We lock the system down so that there is no chance that data comes or data could be accessed during that time frame,"" the official said.

And the Department of Justice spent last week communicating the potential changes to its authority to collect data to telecommunications companies, according to a Justice Department official and a telecommunications company official familiar with the process.

The Justice Department official pointed to ""legal and technical processes that need to occur"" for the program to shut down.

So could America be less safe?

Attorney General Loretta Lynch said last week the United States would face a ""serious lapse"" in national security.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said in a statement on Friday the United States ""would lose entirely an important capability that helps us identify potential U.S. based associates of foreign terrorists.""

But opponents aren't convinced. Instead, they're determined not to let fears over national security trump civil liberties and privacy concerns.

""Allowing the provisions of the Patriot Act to sunset wouldn't affect the government's ability to conduct targeted investigations or combat terrorism,"" the ACLU said. ""The government has numerous other tools, including administrative and grand jury subpoenas, which would enable it to gather necessary information.""

What are the facts on the expiring capabilities?

As it stands, several official review boards -- including a presidential review group and a government privacy oversight board -- found that the bulk metadata collection program was not essential to thwarting a single terror plot.

The Obama administration endorses the plan under the USA Freedom Act to transform that program.

The roving wiretaps provision that can be used in terrorism cases is used less than 100 times per year, but officials could be in a bind when it comes to new investigations.

Authorities could still obtain standard wiretaps on a suspected terrorists' phone, but a new phone requires a new warrant.

Justice Department spokesman Marc Raimondi said the top-secret nature of the investigations make even that a challenge.

""When we're chasing a terrorist or a spy, almost everything we have is highly, highly classified. Normal courts are not set up to handle that,"" he said.

He says he just wanted the public to know what the government was doing. ""Even if you're not doing anything wrong, you're being watched and recorded,"" he said.

The top-secret documents revealed that senior American leaders, including three presidents, knew the Vietnam War was an unwinnable, tragic quagmire. Further, they showed that the government had lied to Congress and the public about the progress of the war. Ellsberg surrendered to authorities and was charged as a spy. During his trial, the court learned that President Richard Nixon's administration had embarked on a campaign to discredit Ellsberg, illegally wiretapping him and breaking into his psychiatrist's office. All charges against him were dropped. Since then he has lived a relatively quiet life as a respected author and lecturer.

Peter Buxtun, who worked for the Public Health Service, relayed information about the Tuskegee syphilis experiment to a reporter in 1972, which halted the 40-year study. His testimony at congressional hearings led to an overhaul of the Health, Education and Welfare rules concerning work with human subjects.

The stories sparked a congressional investigation that eventually led to President Nixon's resignation in 1974. The Post won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage.

The Justice Department recommended major reforms but also criticized Whitehurst for ""overstated and incendiary"" allegations. He also faced disciplinary action for refusing to cooperate with an investigation into how some of his allegations were leaked to a magazine.

The letter accused the bureau of deliberately undermining requests to look into Zacarias Moussaoui , the only person convicted in the United States of playing a role in the attacks. She testified in front of Congress and the 9/11 Commission about the FBI's mishandling of information.

Douglas Rushkoff : Will Snowden be recognized for his heroism in disclosing mass surveillance ?
He credits Snowden with revealing how technology is eroding human freedom
Rushkoff : Snowden disengaged to consider the impact of what he was helping build
When I was a kid , I remember a guy named Daniel Ellsberg leaking some classified documents to the New York Times about the Vietnam War called `` the Pentagon Papers . ''
When the whistle-blower finally stood trial for espionage , my parents were n't quite sure how to feel . But when Richard Nixon 's crew was revealed to have been conducting illegal wiretaps in an effort to discredit the former intelligence contractor , well , they were outraged and decided Ellsberg was a hero . So did the judge and most of America .
I wonder whether Ed Snowden , the 29-year-old Booz Allen Hamilton employee behind last week 's series of leaks about National Security Agency surveillance on the American public , will be rewarded with the same admiration . You 'd think we would be even more outraged by what he uncovered than we were by the surveillance of Ellsberg . After all , it 's not just one lone loose cannon being wiretapped here , it 's all of us being monitored .
Snowden has not uncovered a human conspiracy here but the workings of the machine itself . And it 's a machine that really does require some human intervention .
In the coming months , I expect a campaign to be waged against this young man that will make the one against Ellsberg look like child 's play . His enemies have the full force of the machine -- every e-mail he 's written and every phone call he 's made -- to use against him . This wo n't be pretty . But before we decide that Snowden was smiling too much in his videotaped interview with The Guardian , earned too much money or somehow betrayed his lovely girlfriend in Hawaii in a personal vendetta against his former bosses at the intelligence agencies , let 's take just a moment to consider his particularly human act of heroism .
There are dozens , if not hundreds , of government employees and contractors who have long been aware of the NSA 's total surveillance effort .
As a digital technology writer , I have had more than one former student and colleague tell me about digital switchers they have serviced through which calls and data are diverted to government servers or the big data algorithms they 've written to be used on our e-mails by intelligence agencies . I always begged them to write about it or to let me do so while protecting their identities . They refused to come forward and believed my efforts to shield them would be futile . `` I do n't want to lose my security clearance . Or my freedom , '' one told me .

Snowden was willing to take those risks and , I daresay , more .
Yet it was n't just fear keeping people from talking about the growing cybersurveillance state but a sense of inevitability . This is just how technology evolves , at least when it 's uncontested . Everyone knows , or should know , that everything we type on our computers or say into our cell phones is being disseminated throughout the datasphere . And most of it is recorded and parsed by big data servers . Why do you think Gmail and Facebook are free ? You think they 're corporate gifts ? We pay with our data .
In such an environment , it 's hard to come down too hard on government intelligence officers who want to get in on this action .
Our leaders are suffering from what I call `` present shock '' : the overwhelming assault of multiple threats from everywhere at the same time , amplified by technology of all sorts .

Douglas Rushkoff: Will Snowden be recognized for his heroism in disclosing mass surveillance?

He credits Snowden with revealing how technology is eroding human freedom

Rushkoff: Snowden disengaged to consider the impact of what he was helping build

When I was a kid, I remember a guy named Daniel Ellsberg leaking some classified documents to the New York Times about the Vietnam War called ""the Pentagon Papers.""

When the whistle-blower finally stood trial for espionage, my parents weren't quite sure how to feel. But when Richard Nixon's crew was revealed to have been conducting illegal wiretaps in an effort to discredit the former intelligence contractor, well, they were outraged and decided Ellsberg was a hero. So did the judge and most of America.

I wonder whether Ed Snowden , the 29-year-old Booz Allen Hamilton employee behind last week's series of leaks about National Security Agency surveillance on the American public, will be rewarded with the same admiration. You'd think we would be even more outraged by what he uncovered than we were by the surveillance of Ellsberg. After all, it's not just one lone loose cannon being wiretapped here, it's all of us being monitored.

Snowden has not uncovered a human conspiracy here but the workings of the machine itself. And it's a machine that really does require some human intervention.

Douglas Rushkoff

In the coming months, I expect a campaign to be waged against this young man that will make the one against Ellsberg look like child's play. His enemies have the full force of the machine -- every e-mail he's written and every phone call he's made -- to use against him. This won't be pretty. But before we decide that Snowden was smiling too much in his videotaped interview with The Guardian, earned too much money or somehow betrayed his lovely girlfriend in Hawaii in a personal vendetta against his former bosses at the intelligence agencies, let's take just a moment to consider his particularly human act of heroism.

There are dozens, if not hundreds, of government employees and contractors who have long been aware of the NSA's total surveillance effort.

As a digital technology writer, I have had more than one former student and colleague tell me about digital switchers they have serviced through which calls and data are diverted to government servers or the big data algorithms they've written to be used on our e-mails by intelligence agencies. I always begged them to write about it or to let me do so while protecting their identities. They refused to come forward and believed my efforts to shield them would be futile. ""I don't want to lose my security clearance. Or my freedom,"" one told me.

Snowden was willing to take those risks and, I daresay, more.

Yet it wasn't just fear keeping people from talking about the growing cybersurveillance state but a sense of inevitability. This is just how technology evolves, at least when it's uncontested. Everyone knows, or should know, that everything we type on our computers or say into our cell phones is being disseminated throughout the datasphere. And most of it is recorded and parsed by big data servers. Why do you think Gmail and Facebook are free? You think they're corporate gifts? We pay with our data.

In such an environment, it's hard to come down too hard on government intelligence officers who want to get in on this action.

Our leaders are suffering from what I call ""present shock"": the overwhelming assault of multiple threats from everywhere at the same time, amplified by technology of all sorts. Terrorists have unprecedented access to weapons of mass destruction and work through decentralized networks around the clock. As data-gathering tools emerge with ever-increasing ability to keep tabs on the world's communications, how can an overburdened intelligence agency choose otherwise than to exploit their potential?

The rush to employ technology has become automatic.

We all know the feeling of surrendering to the embedded biases of our devices. We let our cell phones ping us every time there's an incoming message and check our e-mail even when we'd best pay attention to what's going on around us in the real world. We text while driving. Likewise, without conscious restraint, government agencies can't help but let the growing power of big data draw them into ever more invasive forms of surveillance on a population whose members simply must include those who intend harm on the rest. This is just how everything runs when it's left on ""default"" settings.

Yet if we let the evolution of our machines dictate the evolution of our policy, the only possible result is what Snowden calls ""turnkey tyranny.""

As I have argued in other contexts, the best weapon against the paralysis of technologically induced present shock is human intervention. Just as we the people stood against the structural tyranny of an overreaching monarchy, it is we the people who must stand against the structural tyranny of runaway technology.

Snowden is a hero because he realized that our very humanity was being compromised by the blind implementation of machines in the name of making us safe. Unlike those around him, who were too absorbed in their task to reflect on their actions and pause in their pursuit of digital omniscience, Snowden allowed himself to be ""disturbed"" by what he was doing.

More in the midst of technology than most of us will ever be, Snowden disengaged for long enough to be human and to consider the impact of what he was helping build. He pressed pause.

Thank heavens our intelligence agencies are staffed by people like Snowden, not robots. People can still think.

WikiLeaks says NSA leaker Edward Snowden has not yet formally accepted asylum in Venezuela, quashing a brief but tantalizing tip from a Russian lawmaker that Snowden had decided where he plans to go from Moscow.

WikiLeaks, which has provided logistical help for Snowden since he fled the United States, issued its statement in a tweet.

It was responding to an earlier tweet in Russian sent -- then quickly deleted -- by Alexei Pushkov, the head of the Russian parliament's foreign affairs committee.

Later Tuesday, WikiLeaks issued a cryptic tweet stating that on Wednesday ""the first phase of Edward Snowden's 'Flight of Liberty' campaign will be launched. Follow for further details.""

WikiLeaks, a website that has compiled an archive of classified files on the inner-workings of some governments, has spoken on behalf of the 30-year-old former National Security Agency contractor several times over the issue of political asylum.

Pushkov, who has played an unofficial role for the Kremlin on the Snowden affair, quickly followed his deletion with a second tweet saying that his source was an 18-hour-old report by the Russian TV news program Vesti 24 and advised readers to ""contact them about this question.""

In the end, it was left up to WikiLeaks to clean up the messaging mess by stating flatly that Snowden had not made up his mind about Venezuela, and reminding readers that the lawmaker had deleted his original tweet.

Snowden, who revealed details of a U.S. intelligence program to monitor Internet activity, came to Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on June 23 from Hong Kong and was believed to be headed for Cuba. But he did not board that flight and has not been seen publicly since. He is widely believed to still be in the airport's transit zone.

Venezuelan Foreign Minister Elias Jaua said Saturday his country hadn't yet been in contact with Snowden, who has been unable to travel further because the U.S. annulled his passport.

For Snowden to leave for South America, he would need for Venezuela to issue him travel documents and he would need to find a way to get there. The only direct commercial flight from Moscow stops in Havana, Cuba.

The Moscow-Havana flight goes over Europe and the U.S., which could cause complications. Some European countries refused to allow Bolivian President Evo Morales to fly through their airspace on his way home from Moscow last week because of suspicions that Snowden was on his plane.

The presidents of Bolivia and Nicaragua also said over the weekend that Snowden was welcome in their countries.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday that Russia has not notified the United States about any Snowden departure, and it appears that Tuesday's flap was due to an errant tweet.

""We have no information regarding that,"" Carney said.

Carney said the administration wants Snowden to return to the United States, ""where he is wanted on felony charges,"" and that message has been communicated to Russia and other nations that might be willing to receive Snowden.

The Obama administration sent an extradition request to Iceland's foreign ministry last week, WikiLeaks said, citing an Icelandic news report. Iceland, where WikiLeaks has operated, is among about 30 countries Snowden has applied to for asylum.

A WikiLeaks spokesman said the preemptive move highlighted the ""unprecedented severity"" and ""pressure and intimidation"" that the United States has placed on ""friendly countries"" in the Snowden case.

Rep. John Conyers of Michigan , the Judiciary Committee 's ranking Democrat , said , `` It 's my fear that we are on the verge of becoming a surveillance state . ''
In defending the programs , Mueller called attention to the run-up to the 2001 terrorist attacks , saying that if the controversial surveillance efforts had been in place back then , they might have uncovered the hijackers ' plot . The 9/11 Commission found that among the major U.S. failures before the attack was that agencies did n't share information they already had about suspected terrorists with the FBI .

""It's clear he attempted to go places he was not authorized to go,"" within the classified systems, Rogers said. He called Snowden ""a fairly low-level individual, but because of his position in the IT system had access to certain pieces of information that, candidly, he did not understand, or had the full scope of what these programs where, who decided on his own he was going to release this information.""

FBI Director Robert Mueller defended the programs in testimony to Congress on Thursday. In what is likely his final appearance as FBI director before the House Judiciary Committee, Mueller said that terrorists track leaked information ""very, very closely"" and that because of leaks ""we lose our ability to get their communications"" and ""we are exceptionally vulnerable.""

Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the Judiciary Committee's ranking Democrat, said, ""It's my fear that we are on the verge of becoming a surveillance state.""

In defending the programs, Mueller called attention to the run-up to the 2001 terrorist attacks, saying that if the controversial surveillance efforts had been in place back then, they might have uncovered the hijackers' plot. The 9/11 Commission found that among the major U.S. failures before the attack was that agencies didn't share information they already had about suspected terrorists with the FBI.

""If we had had this program, that opportunity would have been there,"" Mueller said.

""I am not persuaded that that makes it OK to collect every call,"" Conyers replied.

`` We simply disagree with the board 's analysis on the legality of the program , '' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said .
He was responding to a scathing report from The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board ( PCLOB ) , which said the program ran afoul of the law on several fronts .
`` The ... bulk telephone records program lacks a viable legal foundation , '' the board 's report said , adding that it raises `` serious threats to privacy and civil liberties '' and has `` only limited value . '' The report , further , said the NSA should `` purge '' the files .
The president did not go nearly as far when he called last week for ending government control of phone data collected from hundreds of millions of Americans .
Carney claimed the president , in his address last week , did `` directly derive '' some of his ideas from the board 's draft recommendations . But he made clear that Obama does not see eye to eye with them on the legitimacy of mass phone record collection .
`` The administration believes that the program is lawful , '' he said .
Nevertheless , the findings could be used as leverage in federal lawsuits against NSA spying . The report concluded that the NSA collection raises `` constitutional concerns '' with regard to U.S. citizens ' rights of speech , association and privacy .
`` The connections revealed by the extensive database of telephone records gathered under the program will necessarily include relationships established among individuals and groups for political , religious , and other expressive purposes , '' it said . `` Compelled disclosure to the government of information revealing these associations can have a chilling effect on the exercise of First Amendment rights . ''
The panel added that the program `` implicates constitutional concerns under the First and Fourth Amendments . ''
The recommendations are sure to meet resistance in Washington . House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers , R-Mich. , who has been a staunch defender of the NSA , voiced dismay at the report 's findings .
`` I am disappointed that three members of the Board decided to step well beyond their policy and oversight role and conducted a legal review of a program that has been thoroughly reviewed , '' he said in a statement , noting that federal judges have found the program to be legal dozens of times .
The report also rejected claims that the program was necessary to cover up a gap in intelligence arising from a failure to detect Al Qaeda members in the United States prior to the Sept. 11 , 2001 terror attacks . U.S. officials had claimed that the phone data collection program would have made clear that terrorist Khalid al-Mihdhar was calling a safehouse in Yemen from a San Diego address .
`` The failure to identify Mihdhar 's presence in the United States stemmed primarily from a lack of information sharing among federal agencies , not of a lack of surveillance capabilities , '' the report said . `` This was a failure to connect the dots , not a failure to connect enough dots . ''
The board 's recommendations go well beyond the reforms ordered by Obama in a major speech last Friday , in which he said that the phone records database would no longer be held by the NSA . Obama also tightened restrictions on gathering and accessing phone data , but did not recommend the program 's end .
The PCLOB recommendations also are more sweeping than reforms proposed by another panel of experts . That panel , the Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies , advised Obama in December to restrict phone surveillance to limited court-ordered sweeps .
Along with its call for ending bulk phone surveillance , the oversight board report outlined 11 other recommendations on surveillance policy , calling for more government transparency and other reforms aimed at bolstering civil liberties and privacy protections . The board called for special attorneys to provide independent views in some proceedings before the secret spy court -- as opposed to Obama 's plan for a panel of experts that would participate at times . The board also urged the administration to provide the public with clear explanations of the legal authority behind any surveillance affecting Americans .
Legal opinions and documents `` describing the government 's legal analysis should be made public so there can be a free and open debate regarding the law 's scope , '' the board said . Both the Bush and Obama administrations have been criticized by civil liberties advocates and by tech industry officials for failing to provide clear public explanations of the decision-making behind their surveillance policies .
While the oversight board found consensus in some of its recommendations for transparency , its members were sharply divided when it came to the surveillance programs and their judicial oversight .
Two members , former Bush administration Justice Department lawyers Rachel Brand and Elisebeth Collins Cook , defended the bulk phone sweeps and said they were too valuable to shut down .
`` I am concerned about the detrimental effect this superfluous second-guessing can have on our national security agencies and their staff , '' said Brand , who as a Justice lawyer defended USA Patriot Act legislation that provided the NSA with its authority to make the bulk phone collections .
But the oversight board 's three other members -- executive director David Medine , former federal judge Patricia Wald and civil liberties advocate James Dempsey -- held firm for broad changes .
`` When the government collects all of a person 's telephone records , storing them for five years in a government database that is subjected to high-speed digital searching and analysis , the privacy implications go far beyond what can be revealed by the metadata of a single telephone call , '' the majority wrote .
The oversight board was created at the urging of the independent commission on the 9/11 attacks as a key organizational reform needed to balance counterterrorism policy with civil liberties concerns . The board functioned fitfully for several years , often short on members because of Congress ' inaction . It finally won legislative approval last year for all five members and staff and took on its study of the NSA programs at the urging of Obama and congressional leaders .","The White House on Thursday disputed the findings of an independent review board that said the National Security Agency's mass data collection program is illegal and should be ended, indicating the administration would not be taking that advice.

A quirk of judicial history means Mr. Snowden could be safe from any US attempt to extradite him “ for months if not years , ” according to one of the former British colony ’ s top legal experts , Simon Young .
Though it is unlikely Snowden would be able to spend the rest of his life in Hong Kong , he will be able to use the protections afforded by Hong Kong ’ s judicial system , which is independent of the Chinese government .
If Snowden chooses to ask for political asylum , says Professor Young , head of the Centre for Comparative and Public Law at Hong Kong University , “ he is going nowhere ” in the foreseeable future . A recent appeals court ruling , he explains , means that “ the government can not return anyone who claims that he will be persecuted ” in the country he came from .
That is because Hong Kong ’ s asylum law is “ a black hole , ” Young says . In the wake of the court ruling last March , the government can not continue simply to follow rulings by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees on the merits of an asylum claimant ’ s case , as it has always done until now .
The Court of Final Appeal ruled that the government must independently determine the validity of asylum claims , but the authorities have devised no system for doing so . Legislation setting up such a system would take “ months if not years , ” says Young , and any administrative plan the government instituted before a law was passed would be subject to challenge in the courts .
“ Short of a criminal group getting to him , I think he is safe here , ” Young adds .
Snowden told The Guardian in an interview published Sunday that he had flown to Hong Kong on May 20 , because “ they have a spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent . ”
The Guardian also said he believed Hong Kong was “ one of the few places in the world that both could and would resist the dictates of the US government . ”
The United States and Hong Kong signed an extradition treaty in 1996 , shortly before Hong Kong was returned to Chinese sovereignty . Article 6 provides that “ a fugitive offender shall not be surrendered if the offence of which that person is accused or was convicted is an offence of a political character . ”
If the US government does indict Snowden , and then asks the Hong Kong government to extradite him , the Chief Executive might refuse on the grounds of another clause in the treaty allowing him not to surrender a fugitive if doing so might implicate “ the defense , foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy ” of the Chinese government in Beijing .
“ Hong Kong will have to take instructions from Beijing on this , ” predicts Michael Davis , a Politics professor at Hong Kong University . “ And I can not see how Beijing benefits from tweaking the US ” by refusing an extradition request .
Should Beijing and the Hong Kong government agree to an extradition , however , it would be subject to judicial approval , and Snowden could decide to argue in court that he leaked information about NSA spying programs for political reasons , portraying any crime of which he might be accused as “ an offence of a political character . ”

Edward Snowden 's hopes of finding asylum from U.S. prosecution on espionage charges appeared to dim Tuesday as country after country denied his request or said he would have to find a way to travel to their territory to apply .
While Bolivia and Venezuela seemed supportive , 11 of the 21 countries he 's applied to , including Ecuador and Iceland , have said they ca n't consider his request until he shows up at one of their embassies or on their borders . Three -- Brazil , India and Poland -- have denied the request outright .
And Bolivia said Tuesday the plane carrying its president , Evo Morales , was denied permission to land for refueling in either France or Portugal because of `` unfounded '' rumors that Snowden was aboard . Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca told Bolivian television that the jet made an emergency landing in the Austrian capital of Vienna and that Bolivia wanted an explanation from Paris and Lisbon .
`` We do n't know who has come up with this huge lie , '' Choquehuanca said , adding , `` We would like to let the international community know that the rights of aerial traffic for Bolivia have been violated . ''
Morales had been in Russia , where he told the Russia Today news network that he would be willing to consider asylum for Snowden . And Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro , also in Moscow for a tribute to his late predecessor , Hugo Chavez , said Snowden deserves protection , not prosecution .

Maduro said Snowden 's decision to leak details of American surveillance programs were `` a warning signal to the world , '' according to statement from the president 's office .
`` He 's now being persecuted and you have to wonder , why is he being persecuted ? '' Maduro asked . `` How many missiles has Snowden launched against innocent peoples around the world ? Has Snowden planted bombs that killed ( people ) ... What crimes has he committed against humanity ? ''
But as of Tuesday evening , it did not appear that either country had made a firm offer of asylum , or any way for him to leave Moscow 's Sheremetyevo International Airport . Snowden had already withdrawn his asylum request with Russian authorities after President Vladimir Putin said he would have to `` stop his work aimed at harming our American partners '' if he wanted to stay in the country .
That appeared to leave him in much the same pickle he 's been in since he left Hong Kong last month for Moscow . Russian authorities say he remains in the airport transit area -- technically a free man , but unable to travel after the United States revoked his passport .
Neither WikiLeaks nor Snowden has commented on the rejections . The group released a statement attributed to Snowden late Monday in which he blasted the Obama administration for trying to block his efforts to seek refuge .
`` These are the old , bad tools of political aggression , '' Snowden said . `` Their purpose is to frighten , not me , but those who would come after me . '' But he added , `` I am unbowed in my convictions and impressed at the efforts taken by so many . ''
In Monday 's statement , Snowden criticized the Obama administration for yanking his passport once criminal charges were filed , `` leaving me a stateless person . '' But he said the administration is n't afraid of people like him or others accused of disclosing U.S. secrets .
`` No , the Obama administration is afraid of you , '' he said . `` It is afraid of an informed , angry public demanding the constitutional government it was promised -- and it should be . ''
The United States has been pressing countries to refuse Snowden entry and hand him over to face espionage charges . His disclosures about widespread U.S. surveillance of telephones and Internet users in the United States and abroad -- based largely on documents he has acknowledged taking while an National Security Agency contractor in Hawaii -- have created a political storm at home and diplomatic headaches overseas for President Barack Obama .
On Monday , Obama had to defend U.S. intelligence practices after fresh reports about alleged U.S. surveillance of European Commission offices in the United States and Europe , as well as surveillance at diplomatic facilities in the United States .
The German news magazine Der Spiegel reported Sunday that information from Snowden detailed NSA bugging of European Union offices in Washington and New York , as well as an `` electronic eavesdropping operation '' that tapped into an EU building in Brussels , Belgium .
The reports generated a furor among European leaders , who demanded the United States come clean about the surveillance . Some , including French President Francois Hollande , said ending any such surveillance would be necessary before European leaders would be willing to start negotiations on a trans-Atlantic free trade agreement championed by Obama .
Asked at a news conference in Tanzania about the latest leaks involving Snowden , Obama said he needed more information on the specific programs cited in the Der Spiegel report , but made clear such spying was commonplace .
`` I guarantee you that in European capitals , there are people who are interested in , if not what I had for breakfast , at least what my talking points might be should I end up meeting with their leaders , '' Obama said . `` That is how intelligence services operate . ''
In addition to Snowden 's earlier applications to Ecuador , Russia and Iceland , WikiLeaks on Sunday submitted applications to 18 countries on Snowden 's behalf : Austria , Bolivia , Brazil , China , Cuba , Finland , France , Germany , India , Ireland , Italy , the Netherlands , Nicaragua , Norway , Poland , Spain , Switzerland and Venezuela .
The organization said that the documents it had submitted for the latest asylum requests `` outline the risks of persecution Mr. Snowden faces in the United States . ''
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa told the British newspaper The Guardian that the American fugitive would have to reach Ecuadorian territory for his request to be considered .
`` Are we responsible for getting him to Ecuador ? It 's not logical , '' he told The Guardian , one of the recipients of Snowden 's leaks . `` The country that has to give him a safe conduct document is Russia . ''
He added that the decision to issue Snowden temporary travel documents that allowed him to leave Hong Kong was `` a mistake on our part , '' The Guardian reported .
Over the weekend , Correa said Vice President Joe Biden asked Ecuador to reject Snowden 's request .
Obama said Monday that Snowden had traveled to Russia without a valid passport or legal papers and that he hoped that Moscow would handle the case as it would any other travel-related matter .
Here 's a rundown of what countries are saying about Snowden 's asylum requests :
• Austria : His request is not valid , because applicants must be in Austria and submit their applications in person .
• Bolivia : Despite WikiLeaks ' statement , Morales , the Bolivian president , said Bolivia has not received a request for asylum on Snowden 's behalf , Itar-Tass reported .

According to Finnish legislation , it is not possible to leave an asylum application outside the Finnish territory . ''
• France : Hollande , the French president , said he has `` not received any particular demands from Mr. Snowden , '' according to French television reports .
• Germany : Asylum requests must be made from within the country , but an Interior Ministry spokesman also said `` the German right of residence principally entails the possibility of acceptance from abroad , if this seems necessary for international legal or urgent humanitarian reasons , or for the ensuring of political interests of the federal republic of Germany . This needs to be examined thoroughly in the case of Mr . Snowden . ''
• Iceland : Officials have said asylum seekers need to be in Icelandic territory in order to apply .
• India : Ministry of External Affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said Tuesday that India will deny the request .
• Ireland : The Irish Justice Ministry declined to confirm whether it had received a request on Snowden 's behalf , but said Irish law requires that applicants reach the country 's borders before a request can be considered .

• The Netherlands : Snowden would need to be in Holland to formally request shelter , a spokesman for the Dutch state secretary said Tuesday .

Napolitano","Last week , Justin Amash , the two-term libertarian Republican congressman from Michigan , joined with John Conyers , the 25-term liberal Democratic congressman from the same state , to offer an amendment to legislation funding the National Security Agency ( NSA ) . If enacted , the Amash-Conyers amendment would have forced the government ’ s domestic spies when seeking search warrants to capture Americans ’ phone calls , texts and emails first to identify their targets and produce evidence of their terror-related activities before a judge may issue a warrant . The support they garnered had a surprising result that stunned the Washington establishment .
The final vote , in which the Amash-Conyers amendment was defeated by 205 to 217 , was delayed for a few hours by the House Republican leadership , which opposed the measure . The Republican leadership team , in conjunction with President Obama and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , needed more time for arm-twisting so as to avoid a humiliating loss .
But the House rank-and-file did succeed in sending a message to the big-government types in both parties : Nearly half of the House of Representatives has had enough of government spying and then lying about it , and understands that spying on every American simply can not withstand minimal legal scrutiny or basic constitutional analysis .
The president is deeply into this and no doubt wishes he wasn ’ t . He now says he welcomed the debate in the House on whether his spies can have all they want from us or whether they are subject to constitutional requirements for their warrants . Surely he knows that the Supreme Court has ruled consistently since the time of the Civil War that the government is always subject to the Constitution , wherever it goes and whatever it does .
As basic as that sounds , it is not a universally held belief among the power elites . Gen. James Clapper , the current boss of all domestic spies , obviously lied when he testified under oath to a Senate committee recently that the government was not accumulating massive amounts of data about tens or hundreds of millions of Americans .
Gen. Keith Alexander , the head of the NSA , materially misled a House committee when he was asked under oath whether the NSA has the “ ability ” to listen to phone calls and he stated it lacks the “ authority ” to do so . Right off the bat , we can see that these senior spies do not feel bound by the laws prohibiting perjury and the misleading of Congress .
Congress itself has legislatively attempted to amend the Constitution , knowing that the supreme law of the land can only be amended by three-quarters of the states . The Constitution requires probable cause of criminal activity to be presented to a judge as a precondition of the judge issuing a search warrant . It also requires that the warrant particularly describe the place to be searched or the person or thing to be seized .
Yet , Congress told the secret FISA court that it can avoid the Constitution and issue a warrant to any spy looking for the phone calls and electronic communications of anyone in America , without probable cause , without naming the persons whose records are sought and without describing the place to be searched . Secrecy-smitten judges , whose clerks are NSA agents and who are not permitted to keep copies of their own rulings , have gone along with this .
Obama , who did not want a national debate on all this before Edward Snowden blew the whistle on it , has backed off of his earlier claims that the feds are not reading emails or listening to phone calls .
He has done this , no doubt , in light of unrefuted statements by Snowden and other NSA whistleblowers to the effect that federal spies can , with the press of a computer key , read emails and hear phone calls .
Only after the Snowden revelations did Obama welcome the `` debate '' in the House . That debate , in which more than half of his own party rejected his spying , lasted precisely 24 minutes .
How can a deliberative body of 434 current members debate an issue as monumental as whether the government is bound by the Constitution when it seeks out terrorists in just 24 minutes ?
Apparently , the House Republican leadership that established the absurd 24-minute rule feared a serious and meaningful public discussion in which its authoritarian impulses would need to confront the Constitution its members swore to uphold . In that 24-minute time span , millions -- millions -- of Americans ’ phone calls and emails were swept into the NSA ’ s supercomputers in defiance of the Constitution .
There is a political wildfire burning in the land , and we should all be grateful to Snowden for igniting it . The fire eventually will consume the political derelictions of those who have abandoned their oaths to uphold the Constitution so they can sound tough back home .
The Amash-Conyers amendment would have required the feds to tell the court the name of the person whose communications they seek and the evidence they have against that person -- just as the Constitution requires . And it would have prohibited the NSA dragnets the Constitution obviously was written to prevent .
Instead we have the almost unimaginable prospect and the nearly unthinkable reality of the feds claiming that they can legally put every person in America under their privacy-invading scrutiny in order to catch a few dozen evil ones -- most of whom were entrapped by the FBI in the first place and never posed a serious danger to the public or the nation .
Would we all be safer if the feds could knock down any door they wished and arrest any person they chose ? Who would want to live in such a society ? What value is the Constitution if those in whose hands we have reposed it for safekeeping are afraid to do so ?
I expect that the Amash-Conyers amendment will be back on the floor of the House soon .

The Amash-Conyers amendment would have required the feds to tell the court the name of the person whose communications they seek and the evidence they have against that person -- just as the Constitution requires. And it would have prohibited the NSA dragnets the Constitution obviously was written to prevent.

Instead we have the almost unimaginable prospect and the nearly unthinkable reality of the feds claiming that they can legally put every person in America under their privacy-invading scrutiny in order to catch a few dozen evil ones -- most of whom were entrapped by the FBI in the first place and never posed a serious danger to the public or the nation.

Would we all be safer if the feds could knock down any door they wished and arrest any person they chose? Who would want to live in such a society? What value is the Constitution if those in whose hands we have reposed it for safekeeping are afraid to do so?

I expect that the Amash-Conyers amendment will be back on the floor of the House soon. When it is, who will have the courage to preserve, protect and defend personal liberty in a free society?",www.foxnews.com,right,d0QlNMYZ1kfCSB91

US District Judge Richard Leon issued the temporary restraining order on Monday after concluding that the once-secret NSA intelligence-gathering mission almost certainly violates privacy guarantees of the Fourth Amendment .
In an abundance of caution , Judge Leon stayed his order pending an expected appeal by the government .
But the judge added : “ I hereby give the Government fair notice that should my ruling be upheld , this order will go into effect forthwith . ”
The ruling comes at a relatively early stage of a civil lawsuit charging the government with violating the US Constitution and the bounds of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
The plaintiffs had asked the judge to temporarily order the government to stop its intelligence collection effort during the litigation . For the judge to issue such a temporary injunction , he must find a “ significant likelihood ” that the plaintiffs will ultimately win their case after it has been fully briefed and argued .
Although the case has only been presented in preliminary form at this stage , Judge Leon left little doubt about how he was inclined to rule later on the merits of the case .
“ I can not imagine a more indiscriminate and arbitrary invasion than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval , ” Leon wrote in a 68-page opinion .
“ Surely , such a program infringes on that degree of privacy that the Founders enshrined in the Fourth Amendment , ” he said .
“ Indeed , I have little doubt that the author of our Constitution , James Madison , who cautioned us to beware ‘ the abridgement of freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachment by those in power , ’ would be aghast , ” the judge wrote .
The lawsuit was among several suits filed in June following unauthorized disclosures about US government surveillance programs by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden .
Two of the suits were filed by Larry Klayman , an attorney and founder of the public interest group , Freedom Watch , and Charles Strange , the father of an NSA cryptologist who was killed in Afghanistan when his helicopter was shot down .
Judge Leon ’ s ruling focuses on the constitutional question of whether the secret collection of telephone metadata violates privacy protections of the Fourth Amendment .
He noted that the framers of the Constitution sought to protect the people , their houses , papers , and effects from “ unreasonable searches and seizures , ” particularly general warrants that authorized British authorities to search an entire house for incriminating evidence .
The Fourth Amendment requires a more focused search that is allowed only after authorities have convinced a neutral judge there is good reason to suspect wrongdoing .
In contrast , Leon said , the metadata collection program operates without any individualized suspicion of wrongdoing that might justify the search and storage of personal metadata .
“ The threshold issue … is whether plaintiffs have a reasonable expectation of privacy that is violated when the Government indiscriminately collects their telephony metadata along with the metadata of hundreds of millions of other citizens without any particularized suspicion of wrongdoing , retains all of that metadata for five years , and then queries , analyzes , and investigates that data without prior judicial approval of the investigative targets , ” Leon wrote .
Government lawyers maintain that American citizens have no expectation that information about their telephone usage will remain private . Once they make a phone call , the electronic signals released into the system belong to the system and are no longer private , they argue .
“ I believe that bulk telephony metadata collection and analysis almost certainly does violate a reasonable expectation of privacy , ” he said .
The judge said the government was relying on a Supreme Court precedent involving outdated surveillance methods .
“ Thirty-four years ago , when people wanted to send ‘ text messages , ’ they wrote letters and attached postage stamps , ” he said .
In 2013 , he noted , people have an entirely different relationship with phones . “ This rapid and monumental shift towards a cell phone-centric culture means that the metadata from each person ’ s phone reflects a wealth of detail about their familial , political , professional , religious , and sexual associations , ” he wrote .
“ Records that once would have revealed a few scattered tiles of information about a person now reveal an entire mosaic – a vibrant and constantly updating picture of the person ’ s life , ” the judge said .
“ Judge Leon ’ s ruling gives Fourth Amendment case law a long overdue update , ” said Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice .

Jameel Jaffer , deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union , said the judge exposed the government ’ s legal justification of the data collection as inadequate and out of date .

NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander says data mining helped prevent terrorism

Leaked documents to newspapers revealed the NSA surveillance programs

Phone records obtained by the government through a secret surveillance program disclosed last week helped to prevent ""dozens"" of terrorist acts, the director of the National Security Agency told a Senate hearing on Wednesday.

Army Gen. Keith Alexander provided the most detailed account so far from a government official of the program in which the agency collects phone records that then can be accessed under federal court permission to investigate suspected terrorists.

The scope of the secret program -- potentially involving phone records of every American -- set off a political firestorm when details emerged with publication of a leaked document.

Further leaks revealed other secret programs that collect computer activity and other information.

Not limiting their activities to the earthly realm , American and British spies have infiltrated the fantasy worlds of World of Warcraft and Second Life , conducting surveillance and scooping up data in the online games played by millions of people across the globe , according to newly disclosed classified documents .
Fearing that terrorist or criminal networks could use the games to communicate secretly , move money or plot attacks , the documents show , intelligence operatives have entered terrain populated by digital avatars that include elves , gnomes and supermodels .
The spies have created make-believe characters to snoop and to try to recruit informers , while also collecting data and contents of communications between players , according to the documents , disclosed by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden . Because militants often rely on features common to video games — fake identities , voice and text chats , a way to conduct financial transactions — American and British intelligence agencies worried that they might be operating there , according to the papers .
Takeaways : How Spy Agencies Operate In Virtual Worlds GATHERING INTELLIGENCE : U.S. and British intelligence agencies — including the Central Intelligence Agency , Defense intelligence agency and Britain ’ s Government Communications Headquarters — have operated in virtual worlds and gaming communities to snoop and try to recruit informants . For example , according to Snowden documents , the U.S. has conducted spy operations in Second Life ( pictured ) , where players create human avatars to socialize , buy and sell goods and explore exotic virtual destinations . ( Second Life image via Linden Lab ) MINING PLAYER DATA : The NSA and GCHQ have collected data or player communications from World of Warcraft , Second Life and the XBox Live system , raising questions about the legality of virtual surveillance . One document reveals that while GCHQ was testing its ability to spy on Second Life , the agency vacuumed up three days ’ worth of Second Life chat , instant message and financial transaction data — totaling 176,677 lines of data . ( World of Warcraft image via Blizzard ) GAMING THREATS : The virtual surveillance dates back to at least 2008 , after the NSA and intelligence agencies began to worry that terrorist groups would use games to communicate an plot real attacks . At an intelligence conference that year , researchers outlined a fictitious scenario where terrorists took to World of Warcraft to plot an attack on the White House , but there is little evidence that terror groups view the games as safe havens . ( Image via researcher Dwight Toavs ) MARKETING INTEL CAREERS : At least one spy agency , Britain ’ s GCHQ , purchased advertising in Microsoft 's XBox Live system to recruit gamers for careers for her majesty ’ s government . The in-game video ad features cinematic graphics , a James Bond-esque agent and a series of would-be terrorist plots . Watch the GCHQ video . RESEARCHING REAL-WORLD ENTITIES : In a three-year project starting in 2009 , an intelligence research office awarded several multi-million dollar contracts to study how player 's identities in virtual worlds might be linked to their real-world identities . One team produced a study of World of Warcraft finding “ younger players and male players preferring competitive , hack-and-slash activities , and older and female players preferring non-combat activities . '' ( Image via Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity ) next Slideshow : prev
Online games might seem innocuous , a top-secret 2008 NSA document warned , but they had the potential to be a “ target-rich communication network ” allowing intelligence suspects “ a way to hide in plain sight. ” Virtual games “ are an opportunity ! , ” another 2008 NSA document declared .
But for all their enthusiasm — so many CIA , FBI and Pentagon spies were hunting around in Second Life , the document noted , that a “ deconfliction ” group was needed to avoid collisions — the intelligence agencies may have inflated the threat .
The documents do not cite any counterterrorism successes from the effort , and former American intelligence officials , current and former gaming company employees and outside experts said in interviews that they knew of little evidence that terrorist groups viewed the games as havens to communicate and plot operations .
Games “ are built and operated by companies looking to make money , so the players ’ identity and activity is tracked , ” said Peter W. Singer of the Brookings Institution , an author of “ Cybersecurity and Cyberwar : What Everyone Needs to Know. ” “ For terror groups looking to keep their communications secret , there are far more effective and easier ways to do so than putting on a troll avatar . ”
The surveillance , which also included Microsoft ’ s Xbox Live , could raise privacy concerns . It is not clear exactly how the agencies got access to gamers ’ data or communications , how many players may have been monitored or whether Americans ’ communications or activities were captured .
One American company , the maker of World of Warcraft , said that neither the NSA nor its British counterpart , the Government Communications Headquarters , had gotten permission to gather intelligence in its game . Many players are Americans , who can be targeted for surveillance only with approval from the nation ’ s secret intelligence court . The spy agencies , though , face far fewer restrictions on collecting certain data or communications overseas .
`` We are unaware of any surveillance taking place , '' said a spokesman for Blizzard Entertainment , based in Irvine , Calif. , which makes World of Warcraft . `` If it was , it would have been done without our knowledge or permission . ''
A spokeswoman for Microsoft declined to comment . Philip Rosedale , the founder of Second Life and a former chief executive officer of Linden Lab , the game ’ s maker , declined to comment on the spying revelations . Current Linden executives did not respond to requests for comment .
A Government Communications Headquarters spokesman would neither confirm nor deny any involvement by that agency in gaming surveillance , but said that its work is conducted under “ a strict legal and policy framework ” with rigorous oversight . An NSA spokeswoman declined to comment .
Intelligence and law enforcement officials became interested in games after some became enormously popular , drawing tens of millions of people worldwide , from preteens to retirees . The games rely on lifelike graphics , virtual currencies and the ability to speak to other players in real time . Some gamers merge the virtual and real worlds by spending long hours playing and making close online friends .
In World of Warcraft , players share the same fantasy universe — walking around and killing computer-controlled monsters or the avatars of other players , including elves , animals or creatures known as orcs . In Second Life , players create customized human avatars that can resemble themselves or take on other personas — supermodels and bodybuilders are popular — who can socialize , buy and sell virtual goods , and go places like beaches , cities , art galleries and strip clubs . In Microsoft ’ s Xbox Live service , subscribers connect online in games that can involve activities like playing soccer or shooting at each other in space .
According to American officials and documents that Mr. Snowden provided to The Guardian , which shared them with The New York Times and ███ , spy agencies grew worried that terrorist groups might take to the virtual worlds to establish safe communications channels .
In 2007 , as the NSA and other intelligence agencies were beginning to explore virtual games , NSA officials met with the chief technology officer for the manufacturer of Second Life , the San Francisco-based Linden Lab . The executive , Cory Ondrejka , was a former Navy officer who had worked at the NSA with a top-secret security clearance .
He visited the agency ’ s headquarters at Fort Meade , Md. , in May 2007 to speak to staff members over a brown bag lunch , according to an internal agency announcement . “ Second Life has proven that virtual worlds of social networking are a reality : come hear Cory tell you why ! ” said the announcement . It added that virtual worlds gave the government the opportunity “ to understand the motivation , context and consequent behaviors of non-Americans through observation , without leaving U.S. soil . ”
Ondrejka , now the director of mobile engineering at Facebook , said through a representative that the NSA presentation was similar to others he gave in that period , and declined to comment further .
Even with spies already monitoring games , the NSA thought it needed to step up the effort .
“ The Sigint Enterprise needs to begin taking action now to plan for collection , processing , presentation and analysis of these communications , ” said one April 2008 NSA document , referring to “ signals intelligence. ” The document added , “ With a few exceptions , NSA can ’ t even recognize the traffic , ” meaning that the agency could not distinguish gaming data from other Internet traffic .
By the end of 2008 , according to one document , the British spy agency , known as GCHQ , had set up its “ first operational deployment into Second Life ” and had helped the police in London in cracking down on a crime ring that had moved into virtual worlds to sell stolen credit card information . The British spies running the effort , which was code-named “ Operation Galician , ” were aided by an informer using a digital avatar “ who helpfully volunteered information on the target group ’ s latest activities . ”
Though the games might appear to be unregulated digital bazaars , the companies running them reserve the right to police the communications of players and store the chat dialogues in servers that can be searched later . The transactions conducted with the virtual money common in the games , used in World of Warcraft to buy weapons and potions to slay monsters , are also monitored by the companies to prevent illicit financial dealings .
In the 2008 NSA document , titled “ Exploiting Terrorist Use of Games & Virtual Environments , ” the agency said that “ terrorist target selectors ” — which could be a computer ’ s Internet Protocol address or an email account — “ have been found associated with Xbox Live , Second Life , World of Warcraft ” and other games . But that document does not present evidence that terrorists were participating in the games .
Still , the intelligence agencies found other benefits in infiltrating these online worlds . According to the minutes of a January 2009 meeting , GCHQ ’ s “ network gaming exploitation team ” had identified engineers , embassy drivers , scientists and other foreign intelligence operatives to be World of Warcraft players — potential targets for recruitment as agents .
At Menwith Hill , a Royal Air Force base in the Yorkshire countryside that the NSA has long used as an outpost to intercept global communications , American and British intelligence operatives started an effort in 2008 to begin collecting data from World of Warcraft .
One NSA document said that the World of Warcraft monitoring “ continues to uncover potential Sigint value by identifying accounts , characters and guilds related to Islamic extremist groups , nuclear proliferation and arms dealing. ” In other words , targets of interest appeared to be playing the fantasy game , though the document does not indicate that they were doing so for any nefarious purposes . A British document from later that year said that GCHQ had “ successfully been able to get the discussions between different game players on Xbox Live . ”
By 2009 , the collection was extensive . One document says that while GCHQ was testing its ability to spy on Second Life in real time , British intelligence officers vacuumed up three days ’ worth of Second Life chat , instant message and financial transaction data , totaling 176,677 lines of data , which included the content of the communications .
For their part , players have openly worried that the NSA might be watching them .
In one World of Warcraft discussion thread , begun just days after the first Snowden revelations appeared in the news media in June , a human death knight with the user name “ Crrassus ” asked whether the NSA might be reading game chat logs .
“ If they ever read these forums , ” wrote a goblin priest with the user name “ Diaya , ” “ they would realize they were wasting ” their time .
Even before the American government began spying in virtual worlds , the Pentagon had identified the potential intelligence value of video games . The Pentagon ’ s Special Operations Command in 2006 and 2007 worked with several foreign companies — including an obscure digital media business based in Prague — to build games that could be downloaded to mobile phones , according to people involved in the effort . They said the games , which were not identified as creations of the Pentagon , were then used as vehicles for intelligence agencies to collect information about the users .

Eager to cash in on the government ’ s growing interest in virtual worlds , several large private contractors have spent years pitching their services to American intelligence agencies . In one 66-page document from 2007 , part of the cache released by Mr. Snowden , the contracting giant SAIC promoted its ability to support “ intelligence collection in the game space , ” and warned that online games could be used by militant groups to recruit followers and could provide “ terrorist organizations with a powerful platform to reach core target audiences . ”
It is unclear whether SAIC received a contract based on this proposal , but one former SAIC employee said that the company at one point had a lucrative contract with the CIA for work that included monitoring the Internet for militant activity . An SAIC spokeswoman declined to comment .
In spring 2009 , academics and defense contractors gathered at the Marriott at Washington Dulles International Airport to present proposals for a government study about how players ’ behavior in a game like World of Warcraft might be linked to their real-world identities . “ We were told it was highly likely that persons of interest were using virtual spaces to communicate or coordinate , ” said Dmitri Williams , a professor at the University of Southern California who received grant money as part of the program .
After the conference , both SAIC and Lockheed Martin won contracts worth several million dollars , administered by an office within the intelligence community that finances research projects .
It is not clear how useful such research might be . A group at the Palo Alto Research Center , for example , produced a government-funded study of World of Warcraft that found “ younger players and male players preferring competitive , hack-and-slash activities , and older and female players preferring noncombat activities , ” such as exploring the virtual world . A group from the nonprofit SRI International , meanwhile , found that players under age 18 often used all capital letters both in chat messages and in their avatar names .
Those involved in the project were told little by their government patrons . According to Nick Yee , a Palo Alto researcher who worked on the effort , “ We were specifically asked not to speculate on the government ’ s motivations and goals . ”

Not limiting their activities to the earthly realm, American and British spies have infiltrated the fantasy worlds of World of Warcraft and Second Life, conducting surveillance and scooping up data in the online games played by millions of people across the globe, according to newly disclosed classified documents.

Fearing that terrorist or criminal networks could use the games to communicate secretly, move money or plot attacks, the documents show, intelligence operatives have entered terrain populated by digital avatars that include elves, gnomes and supermodels.

The spies have created make-believe characters to snoop and to try to recruit informers, while also collecting data and contents of communications between players, according to the documents, disclosed by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden. Because militants often rely on features common to video games — fake identities, voice and text chats, a way to conduct financial transactions — American and British intelligence agencies worried that they might be operating there, according to the papers.

Takeaways: How Spy Agencies Operate In Virtual Worlds GATHERING INTELLIGENCE: U.S. and British intelligence agencies — including the Central Intelligence Agency, Defense intelligence agency and Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters — have operated in virtual worlds and gaming communities to snoop and try to recruit informants. For example, according to Snowden documents, the U.S. has conducted spy operations in Second Life (pictured), where players create human avatars to socialize, buy and sell goods and explore exotic virtual destinations.

One document reveals that while GCHQ was testing its ability to spy on Second Life, the agency vacuumed up three days’ worth of Second Life chat, instant message and financial transaction data — totaling 176,677 lines of data. (World of Warcraft image via Blizzard) GAMING THREATS: The virtual surveillance dates back to at least 2008, after the NSA and intelligence agencies began to worry that terrorist groups would use games to communicate an plot real attacks. At an intelligence conference that year, researchers outlined a fictitious scenario where terrorists took to World of Warcraft to plot an attack on the White House, but there is little evidence that terror groups view the games as safe havens.

The in-game video ad features cinematic graphics, a James Bond-esque agent and a series of would-be terrorist plots. Watch the GCHQ video. RESEARCHING REAL-WORLD ENTITIES: In a three-year project starting in 2009, an intelligence research office awarded several multi-million dollar contracts to study how player's identities in virtual worlds might be linked to their real-world identities. One team produced a study of World of Warcraft finding “younger players and male players preferring competitive, hack-and-slash activities, and older and female players preferring non-combat activities.""

Games “are built and operated by companies looking to make money, so the players’ identity and activity is tracked,” said Peter W. Singer of the Brookings Institution, an author of “Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know.” “For terror groups looking to keep their communications secret, there are far more effective and easier ways to do so than putting on a troll avatar.”

A Government Communications Headquarters spokesman would neither confirm nor deny any involvement by that agency in gaming surveillance, but said that its work is conducted under “a strict legal and policy framework” with rigorous oversight. An NSA spokeswoman declined to comment.

Intelligence and law enforcement officials became interested in games after some became enormously popular, drawing tens of millions of people worldwide, from preteens to retirees. The games rely on lifelike graphics, virtual currencies and the ability to speak to other players in real time. Some gamers merge the virtual and real worlds by spending long hours playing and making close online friends.

In World of Warcraft, players share the same fantasy universe — walking around and killing computer-controlled monsters or the avatars of other players, including elves, animals or creatures known as orcs.

Deibert : While cyberspace may be global , its infrastructure most definitely is not
He says much of global Internet traffic flows through networks controlled by the U.S .
Deibert : U.S. needs to rethink the global implications of its domestic surveillance policies
In 2011 , I was on a panel , organized by the security company RSA , with two retired National Security Agency directors , Michael Hayden and Kenneth Minihan . During the course of our debate , I raised concerns , as the only non-American on the panel , that their plans and preferences for having the NSA secure cyberspace for the rest of us were not exactly reassuring . To this , Minihan replied that I should not describe myself as `` Canadian '' but rather `` North American . ''
As jarring as his response was , the fact of the matter is when it comes to communications , he 's right . Practically speaking , there is no border separating Canadian from U.S. telecommunications -- though that 's not true the other way around . Primarily , this one-way dependence is a product of history and economics . Canadians ' communications are inextricably connected to networks south of the border and subject to the laws and practices of the U.S. over which we , as foreigners , have no say or control .
For American citizens , the recent NSA scandal has touched off soul-searching discussions about the legality of mass surveillance programs , whether they violate the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution , and whether proper oversight and accountability exist to protect American citizens ' rights .
Indeed , with respect to the case of PRISM , NSA 's secret set of tools used to collect data about overseas Internet communications , some argue the program actually enhances those safeguards for Americans -- because it appears that collection of company data was segregated in such a way to limit the collection to `` foreign citizens . '' As reassuring as this may be for Americans , for the rest of us non-Americans who enjoy our Gmail , Google Docs , and Facebook accounts , it 's definitely unsettling : We 're all fair game .
While cyberspace may be global , its infrastructure most definitely is not .
For example , a huge proportion of global Internet traffic flows through networks controlled by the United States , simply because eight of 15 global tier 1 telecommunications companies are American -- companies like AT & T , CenturyLink , XO Communications and , significantly , Verizon .
The social media services that many of us take for granted are also mostly provided by giants headquartered in the United States , like Google , Facebook , Yahoo ! and Twitter . All of these companies are subject to U.S. law , including the provisions of the U.S. Patriot Act , no matter where their services are offered or their servers located . Having the world 's Internet traffic routed through the U.S. and having those companies under its jurisdiction give U.S. national security agencies an enormous home-field advantage that few other countries enjoy .
But there are unintended consequences of the NSA scandal that will undermine U.S. foreign policy interests -- in particular , the `` Internet Freedom '' agenda espoused by the U.S. State Department and its allies .

The revelations that have emerged will undoubtedly trigger a reaction abroad as policymakers and ordinary users realize the huge disadvantages of their dependence on U.S.-controlled networks in social media , cloud computing , and telecommunications , and of the formidable resources that are deployed by U.S. national security agencies to mine and monitor those networks .
For example , in 2012 , Norwegian lawmakers debated a ban on the use by public officials of Google 's and Microsoft 's cloud computing services . Although shelved temporarily , this type of debate will almost certainly be resurrected and spread throughout Europe and other regions as the full scope of U.S.-based `` foreign directed '' wiretapping and metadata collection sinks in .
Already we can see regional traffic to the United States from Asia , Africa and even Latin America gradually declining , a trend that is almost certainly going to accelerate as those regions ramp up regional network exchange points and local services to minimize dependence on networks under U.S. control
Many of the countries in the Southern Hemisphere are failed or fragile states ; many of them are authoritarian or autocratic regimes . No doubt the elites in those regimes will use the excuse of security to adopt more stringent state controls over the Internet in their jurisdictions and support local versions of popular social media companies over which they can exact their own nationalized controls -- a trend that began prior to the NSA revelations but which now has additional rhetorical support .
In the age of Big Data , the revelations about NSA 's intelligence-gathering programs touched many nerves . The issue of surveillance wo n't go away , and Americans will need to figure out the appropriate safeguards for liberty in their democracy . It 's an important debate , but one that does n't include us `` foreigners '' that now make up the vast majority of the Internet users . Americans would do well to consider the international implications of their domestic policies before they come home to bite them .","Story highlights Ronald Deibert: For non-Americans, NSA's massive surveillance is unsettling

During the course of our debate, I raised concerns, as the only non-American on the panel, that their plans and preferences for having the NSA secure cyberspace for the rest of us were not exactly reassuring. To this, Minihan replied that I should not describe myself as ""Canadian"" but rather ""North American.""

As jarring as his response was, the fact of the matter is when it comes to communications, he's right. Practically speaking, there is no border separating Canadian from U.S. telecommunications -- though that's not true the other way around. Primarily, this one-way dependence is a product of history and economics. Canadians' communications are inextricably connected to networks south of the border and subject to the laws and practices of the U.S. over which we, as foreigners, have no say or control.

For American citizens, the recent NSA scandal has touched off soul-searching discussions about the legality of mass surveillance programs, whether they violate the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, and whether proper oversight and accountability exist to protect American citizens' rights.

Ronald Deibert

Indeed, with respect to the case of PRISM, NSA's secret set of tools used to collect data about overseas Internet communications, some argue the program actually enhances those safeguards for Americans -- because it appears that collection of company data was segregated in such a way to limit the collection to ""foreign citizens."" As reassuring as this may be for Americans, for the rest of us non-Americans who enjoy our Gmail, Google Docs, and Facebook accounts, it's definitely unsettling: We're all fair game.

While cyberspace may be global, its infrastructure most definitely is not.

For example, a huge proportion of global Internet traffic flows through networks controlled by the United States, simply because eight of 15 global tier 1 telecommunications companies are American -- companies like AT&T, CenturyLink, XO Communications and, significantly, Verizon.

The social media services that many of us take for granted are also mostly provided by giants headquartered in the United States, like Google, Facebook, Yahoo! and Twitter. All of these companies are subject to U.S. law, including the provisions of the U.S. Patriot Act, no matter where their services are offered or their servers located. Having the world's Internet traffic routed through the U.S. and having those companies under its jurisdiction give U.S. national security agencies an enormous home-field advantage that few other countries enjoy.

But there are unintended consequences of the NSA scandal that will undermine U.S. foreign policy interests -- in particular, the ""Internet Freedom"" agenda espoused by the U.S. State Department and its allies.

The revelations that have emerged will undoubtedly trigger a reaction abroad as policymakers and ordinary users realize the huge disadvantages of their dependence on U.S.-controlled networks in social media, cloud computing, and telecommunications, and of the formidable resources that are deployed by U.S. national security agencies to mine and monitor those networks.

For example, in 2012, Norwegian lawmakers debated a ban on the use by public officials of Google's and Microsoft's cloud computing services. Although shelved temporarily, this type of debate will almost certainly be resurrected and spread throughout Europe and other regions as the full scope of U.S.-based ""foreign directed"" wiretapping and metadata collection sinks in.

Already we can see regional traffic to the United States from Asia, Africa and even Latin America gradually declining, a trend that is almost certainly going to accelerate as those regions ramp up regional network exchange points and local services to minimize dependence on networks under U.S. control

Many of the countries in the Southern Hemisphere are failed or fragile states; many of them are authoritarian or autocratic regimes. No doubt the elites in those regimes will use the excuse of security to adopt more stringent state controls over the Internet in their jurisdictions and support local versions of popular social media companies over which they can exact their own nationalized controls -- a trend that began prior to the NSA revelations but which now has additional rhetorical support.

In the age of Big Data, the revelations about NSA's intelligence-gathering programs touched many nerves. The issue of surveillance won't go away, and Americans will need to figure out the appropriate safeguards for liberty in their democracy. It's an important debate, but one that doesn't include us ""foreigners"" that now make up the vast majority of the Internet users. Americans would do well to consider the international implications of their domestic policies before they come home to bite them.",www.cnn.com,left,Yxvx8e9p0NWIgmFe

“So tomorrow, I will force the expiration of the NSA illegal spy program,” Paul said.

Because of the nature of the Senate rules, Paul can force the expiration of the PATRIOT Act, which he has vowed on the campaign trail to repeal as president because he contends it invades Americans’ privacy rights.

In a rare Sunday session, McConnell, sources said, appears likely to move the USA Freedom Act, despite his opposition to how the bill overhauls the National Security Agency’s bulk data collection program. That’s because McConnell has little other choice given the vast support within Congress for the bill.

But Paul argues that bill actually expands the PATRIOT Act and he’s threatening to prevent the Senate from moving to final passage Sunday. He can likely prevent the bill from passing until at least Thursday, three days after the expiration of a law many argue is central to the nation’s security.

Here’s Paul statement to POLITICO in full:

“I have fought for several years now to end the illegal spying of the NSA on ordinary Americans. The callous use of general warrants and the disregard for the Bill of Rights must end. Forcing us to choose between our rights and our safety is a false choice and we are better than that as a nation and as a people. “That’s why two years ago, I sued the NSA. It’s why I proposed the Fourth Amendment Protection Act.

“Then, last week, I further blocked the extension of these powers and the Senate adjourned for recess rather than stay and debate them. “Tomorrow, we will come back with just hours left before the NSA illegal spying powers expire. “Let me be clear: I acknowledge the need for a robust intelligence agency and for a vigilant national security.

“I believe we must fight terrorism, and I believe we must stand strong against our enemies.

“But we do not need to give up who we are to defeat them. In fact, we must not.

“There has to be another way. We must find it together.

“So tomorrow, I will force the expiration of the NSA illegal spy program.

“I am ready and willing to start the debate on how we fight terrorism without giving up our liberty.”

“Sometimes when the problem is big enough, you just have to start over. The tax code and our regulatory burdens are two good examples.”

“Fighting against unconditional, illegal powers that take away our rights, taken by previous Congresses and administrations is just as important.”

“I do not do this to obstruct. I do it to build something better, more effective, more lasting, and more cognizant of who we are as Americans.”

A team of surveillance experts on Wednesday delivered preliminary recommendations to the White House on whether and how to amend U.S. spying policies.

President Obama appointed the Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technology, as it is officially known, as part of his response to global outrage over secret American surveillance programs. The panel's task is to advise the administration on how best to balance security needs against privacy concerns.

The group briefed National Security Adviser Susan Rice, counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco and other staff from the National Security Council at the White House, according to NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. This was an oral presentation, with the final written report due by Dec. 15. Parts of the group's final conclusions will be made public, while the full report will remain classified.

Obama has said he will rely on these recommendations to chart a new path forward for U.S. spying policy. But the president evolved to reach that position, gradually adjusting his response over five months of steady leaks from former defense contractor Edward Snowden.

The spying programs disclosed since June have touched on American people, major companies, world leaders and foreign citizens. The first big story revealed that the National Security Agency was collecting data from Verizon customers in the U.S.

Back then, the White House reaction amounted to: Move along, there's nothing to see here.

""The last thing they'd be doing is taking programs like this to listen to somebody's phone calls,"" Obama said of the National Security Agency in his first public comments about the leaks.

Obama insisted that cyberspies were not abusing their authority. Rather, he said, they were simply doing everything in their power to stop the next terrorist attack.

""They cherish our Constitution,"" he insisted.

'Legitimate Concerns'

At every turn, White House aides insisted that spying programs have oversight and checks from judges, lawmakers and officials within the executive branch.

In Senegal, almost a month after the first revelations came out, Obama said: ""We are trying to declassify as much as possible so the American people and our international partners feel confidence about how we operate in this regard.""

The implication was, ""If we could declassify all of this, you would realize that we're not doing anything wrong."" But some people with access to the classified information were not reassured.

Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who sits on the Intelligence Committee, said in July, ""From my vantage point, reading those documents that are classified, these violations are more serious than have been stated by the intelligence community and, in my view, are very troubling.""

New revelations kept coming, almost weekly. Often one had nothing to do with another, which left the White House struggling to find the right response. It didn't help that some revelations disclosed programs of which even senior White House aides were unaware.

In late summer, Obama's talking points started to change. He told CNN in August, ""I think there are legitimate concerns people have that technology's moving so quick that at some point does the technology outpace the laws that are in place and the protections that are in place, and do some of these systems end up being like a loaded gun out there that somebody at some future point could abuse?""

The defensiveness was giving way to self-examination.

Later that month, Obama appointed the Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technology to look over all of America's spying programs and make recommendations about what should change.

Transformation Complete

And as summer turned to fall, the drip of secrets continued. Foreign allies were in the cross hairs, as it came out that the U.S. had been eavesdropping on world leaders in Latin America and Europe.

In September, Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff, gave a blistering attack at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

""Meddling in such a manner in the life and affairs of other countries is a breach of international law, and as such it is an affront to the principles that should otherwise govern relations among countries — especially among friendly nations,"" she said in her speech to world leaders.

And in October, German Chancellor Angela Merkel responded to reports that the U.S. had bugged her personal cellphone, saying, ""I've made it clear in discussions with America's president in regards to the NSA that friends spying on each other is not acceptable.""

By that point, the transformation of White House talking points was complete, from ""Nothing is wrong"" to ""Something will change.""

One White House aide says this is because the spying stories themselves had changed, from a focus on programs to a focus on targets. ""We will obviously continue to defend the capabilities and programs and our need for them, while finding it necessary to review how they're being used,"" the adviser said.

In an interview with Fusion TV in October, Obama reflected his present-day position: ""What we've seen over the last several years is their capacities continue to develop and expand, and that's why I'm initiating now a review to make sure that what they're able to do doesn't necessarily mean what they should be doing.""

Looking back on the past five months, one senior White House official said, ""We were answering the question in front of us, without knowing what the full landscape was. If we'd known the full range from the beginning, we might have said something different.""

But the story is still not over.

The official said that a computer searches the data for the identifying keywords or other “ selectors ” and stores those that match so that human analysts could later examine them . The remaining communications , the official said , are deleted ; the entire process takes “ a small number of seconds , ” and the system has no ability to perform “ retrospective searching . ”
The official said the keyword and other terms were “ very precise ” to minimize the number of innocent American communications that were flagged by the program . At the same time , the official acknowledged that there had been times when changes by telecommunications providers or in the technology had led to inadvertent overcollection . The N.S.A . monitors for these problems , fixes them and reports such incidents to its overseers in the government , the official said .
The disclosure sheds additional light on statements intelligence officials have made recently , reassuring the public that they do not “ target ” Americans for surveillance without warrants .
At a House Intelligence Committee oversight hearing in June , for example , a lawmaker pressed the deputy director of the N.S.A. , John Inglis , to say whether the agency listened to the phone calls or read the e-mails and text messages of American citizens . Mr. Inglis replied , “ We do not target the content of U.S. person communications without a specific warrant anywhere on the earth . ”
Timothy Edgar , a former intelligence official in the Bush and Obama administrations , said that the rule concerning collection “ about ” a person targeted for surveillance rather than directed at that person had provoked significant internal discussion .
“ There is an ambiguity in the law about what it means to ‘ target ’ someone , ” Mr. Edgar , now a visiting professor at Brown , said . “ You can never intentionally target someone inside the United States . Those are the words we were looking at . We were most concerned about making sure the procedures only target communications that have one party outside the United States . ”","Computer scientists said that it would be difficult to systematically search the contents of the communications without first gathering nearly all cross-border text-based data; fiber-optic networks work by breaking messages into tiny packets that flow at the speed of light over different pathways to their shared destination, so they would need to be captured and reassembled.

The official said the keyword and other terms were “very precise” to minimize the number of innocent American communications that were flagged by the program. At the same time, the official acknowledged that there had been times when changes by telecommunications providers or in the technology had led to inadvertent overcollection. The N.S.A. monitors for these problems, fixes them and reports such incidents to its overseers in the government, the official said.

The disclosure sheds additional light on statements intelligence officials have made recently, reassuring the public that they do not “target” Americans for surveillance without warrants.

At a House Intelligence Committee oversight hearing in June, for example, a lawmaker pressed the deputy director of the N.S.A., John Inglis, to say whether the agency listened to the phone calls or read the e-mails and text messages of American citizens. Mr. Inglis replied, “We do not target the content of U.S. person communications without a specific warrant anywhere on the earth.”

Timothy Edgar, a former intelligence official in the Bush and Obama administrations, said that the rule concerning collection “about” a person targeted for surveillance rather than directed at that person had provoked significant internal discussion.

“There is an ambiguity in the law about what it means to ‘target’ someone,” Mr. Edgar, now a visiting professor at Brown, said. “You can never intentionally target someone inside the United States. Those are the words we were looking at. We were most concerned about making sure the procedures only target communications that have one party outside the United States.”",www.nytimes.com,left,Ksgm93ePR8zmVX4R

Sens . Rand Paul and Ted Cruz lauded the decision as a win for Americans ' personal freedoms , and though Clinton did n't weigh in specifically on the decision , she did suggest her support with a tweet endorsing an NSA reform bill .
But the other two 2016 contenders in the Senate — Sens . Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham — expressed opposition to the move . The split in the Senate is likely to complicate the upcoming effort to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act , which authorizes such surveillance programs and expires at the end of the month .

The e-mail program was halted in 2011 , though it appears possible that the same data is now gathered in some other way .
The documents show that America ’ s phone and Internet companies grew leery of N.S.A . demands as the years passed after 9/11 , fearing that customers might be angry to find out their records were shared with the government . More and more , the companies ’ lawyers insisted on legal orders to compel them to comply .
So the N.S.A . came up with a solution : store the data itself . That is evidently what gave birth to a vast data storage center that the N.S.A . is building in Utah , exploiting the declining cost of storage and the advance of sophisticated search software .
Those huge databases were once called “ bit buckets ” in the industry — collections of electronic bits waiting to be sifted . “ They park stuff in storage in the hopes that they will eventually have time to get to it , ” said James Lewis , a cyberexpert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , “ or that they ’ ll find something that they need to go back and look for in the masses of data. ” But , he added , “ most of it sits and is never looked at by anyone . ”
Indeed , an obscure passage in one of the Snowden documents — rules for collecting Internet data that the Obama administration wrote in secret in 2009 and that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court approved — suggested that the government was concerned about its ability to process all the data it was collecting . So it got the court to approve an exception allowing the government to hold on to that information if it could not keep up . The rules said that “ the communications that may be retained ” for up to five years “ include electronic communications acquired because of the limitation on the N.S.A. ’ s ability to filter communications . ”
As one private expert who sometimes advises the N.S.A . on this technology put it : “ This means that if you can ’ t desalinate all the seawater at once , you get to hold on to the ocean until you figure it out . ”","The agency began amassing databases of “metadata” — logs of all telephone calls collected from the major carriers and similar data on e-mail traffic.

The documents show that America’s phone and Internet companies grew leery of N.S.A. demands as the years passed after 9/11, fearing that customers might be angry to find out their records were shared with the government. More and more, the companies’ lawyers insisted on legal orders to compel them to comply.

So the N.S.A. came up with a solution: store the data itself. That is evidently what gave birth to a vast data storage center that the N.S.A. is building in Utah, exploiting the declining cost of storage and the advance of sophisticated search software.

Those huge databases were once called “bit buckets” in the industry — collections of electronic bits waiting to be sifted. “They park stuff in storage in the hopes that they will eventually have time to get to it,” said James Lewis, a cyberexpert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, “or that they’ll find something that they need to go back and look for in the masses of data.” But, he added, “most of it sits and is never looked at by anyone.”

Indeed, an obscure passage in one of the Snowden documents — rules for collecting Internet data that the Obama administration wrote in secret in 2009 and that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court approved — suggested that the government was concerned about its ability to process all the data it was collecting. So it got the court to approve an exception allowing the government to hold on to that information if it could not keep up. The rules said that “the communications that may be retained” for up to five years “include electronic communications acquired because of the limitation on the N.S.A.’s ability to filter communications.”

As one private expert who sometimes advises the N.S.A. on this technology put it: “This means that if you can’t desalinate all the seawater at once, you get to hold on to the ocean until you figure it out.”",www.nytimes.com,left,Jvlpi3IQ2qkayp5s

Former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, pointing to new curbs by Congress on electronic surveillance, says he sees a ""profound"" change in public opinion on the issue since he leaked details of NSA intelligence gathering two years ago.

Snowden, 31, also a former Central Intelligence Agency officer, was an NSA contractor when he provided information on such programs to The Guardian and The Washington Post. The first reports were published in June 2013, setting off an immediate global firestorm.

Snowden, who was in hiding in Hong Kong at the time, fled to Moscow. Facing charges of violating the Espionage Act and theft of government property, he stayed in Russia after the U.S. revoked his passport. Now he works in IT in Moscow and consults for several U.S. companies.

From his self-imposed exile, Snowden writes in a op-ed column Saturday for The New York Times that politicians in 2013 ""raced to condemn our efforts as un-American, even treasonous.""

He said he feared that when he met with three journalists to reveal the NSA documents that the public would react with indifference or cynicism.

""Two years on, the difference is profound,"" he writes in the Times. ""In a single month, the NSA's invasive call-tracking program was declared unlawful by the courts and disowned by Congress. After a White House-appointed oversight board investigation found that this program had not stopped a single terrorist attack, even the president who once defended its propriety and criticized its disclosure has now ordered it terminated.""

""This,"" writes Snowden, ""is the power of an informed public.""

On Tuesday, the Senate overwhelmingly voted to end the NSA's controversial bulk collection of the phone data of millions of Americans with no ties to terrorism.

Unlike the Patriot Act, which was allowed to expire, phone companies — not the NSA — will retain the data, and the intelligence agency can obtain information about targeted individuals only with permission from a federal court.

Snowden called ending the move a ""historic victory for the rights of every citizen, but it is only the latest of a change in global awareness.""

At the turning of the millennium, he said, few people imagined that citizens of developed democracies ""would soon be required to defend the concept of an open society against their own leaders.""

""Yet the balance of power is beginning to shift,"" he writes. ""We are witnessing the emergence of a post-terror generation, one that rejects a worldview defined by a singular tragedy.""

nsa,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/aug/21/documents-show-nsa-overreach-in-data-collection/,Documents show NSA overreach in data collection,2013-08-21,Shaun Waterman,"The Obama administration , under pressure from continued NSA leaks , declassified documents Wednesday showing the agency scooped up tens of thousands of emails and other online communications from Americans beginning in 2008 that it wasn ’ t allowed to target , and was told to stop by the secret court that oversees the program .
Officials briefed reporters on the documents before releasing them as the Obama administration struggles to defend NSA domestic snooping in the face of growing national opposition and especially on Capitol Hill , where lawmakers argue the administration has misled them about the extent of the programs and the scope of abuses .
The documents , described on condition of anonymity by senior officials in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , relate to a “ compliance violation , ” which officials characterized as a technicality that ought not to provoke any privacy concerns .
“ It was a technological issue that could not be avoided , rather than overreach by the NSA , ” said one official on a conference call organized by the office ’ s public affairs director .
Nonetheless , some lawmakers and privacy advocates responded angrily , saying the declassification was too little , too late .
• Three opinions from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court which oversees the programs .
• Procedures used by the NSA to protect the privacy of Americans when reporting foreign intelligence communications involving them .
• A white paper about the program , prepared for Congress in 2011 .
• A semi-annual compliance report to Congress from the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence identifying the violation .
The compliance violation involved the mass collection of “ upstream ” Internet communications — the vacuuming and copying of vast swaths of data directly from the fiber optic cables through which it traverses the Internet .
The data , once copied , can then be queried by NSA analysts looking for email “ from , to or about , ” the foreign target of a counterterrorism or foreign intelligence surveillance operation overseas , the officials said . Because the targets are foreigners outside of the United States , neither U.S. law nor the Constitution offers them any protection and NSA , like all other intelligence agencies , has broad authorities to spy on them .
But the searches often pull in messages from , to or about U.S. citizens as well — an email mentioning or copied to the foreign target of any surveillance can lawfully be pulled out of the data and examined , although special rules apply to its handling . This is known as incidental collection and is allowed by the law that authorizes the upstream collection program .
The special rules are called “ minimization procedures ” and are designed to protect , as far as possible , the privacy of Americans whose communications are swept up in warrantless surveillance of foreign targets . Their names may not be included in intelligence reports , for example , unless necessary to understand the information being reported .
But , the officials said , because of the way email moves across the Internet from the provider ’ s servers to the user ’ s computer , it was not technically possible to separate the communications that could lawfully be incidentally collected because they involved a legitimate foreign target overseas . As a result , some of the gathered email “ might prove to be wholly domestic , ” said one official , and therefore not subject to collection without a warrant . This is known as inadvertent collection .
“ The NSA has knowingly acquired tens of thousands of wholly domestic communications under section 702 even though this law was specifically written to prohibit the warrantless acquisition of wholly domestic communications , ” said Sen. Ron Wyden , Oregon Democrat and member of the intelligence committee .
For their part , officials insist that Congress was kept fully apprised of the program that scooped up the email and has since renewed the law that authorized it .","The Obama administration, under pressure from continued NSA leaks, declassified documents Wednesday showing the agency scooped up tens of thousands of emails and other online communications from Americans beginning in 2008 that it wasn’t allowed to target, and was told to stop by the secret court that oversees the program.

Officials briefed reporters on the documents before releasing them as the Obama administration struggles to defend NSA domestic snooping in the face of growing national opposition and especially on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers argue the administration has misled them about the extent of the programs and the scope of abuses.

The documents, described on condition of anonymity by senior officials in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, relate to a “compliance violation,” which officials characterized as a technicality that ought not to provoke any privacy concerns.

“It was a technological issue that could not be avoided, rather than overreach by the NSA,” said one official on a conference call organized by the office’s public affairs director.

Nonetheless, some lawmakers and privacy advocates responded angrily, saying the declassification was too little, too late.

The documents declassified Wednesday include:

• Three opinions from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court which oversees the programs.

• Procedures used by the NSA to protect the privacy of Americans when reporting foreign intelligence communications involving them.

• A white paper about the program, prepared for Congress in 2011.

• A semi-annual compliance report to Congress from the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence identifying the violation.

The compliance violation involved the mass collection of “upstream” Internet communications — the vacuuming and copying of vast swaths of data directly from the fiber optic cables through which it traverses the Internet.

The data, once copied, can then be queried by NSA analysts looking for email “from, to or about,” the foreign target of a counterterrorism or foreign intelligence surveillance operation overseas, the officials said. Because the targets are foreigners outside of the United States, neither U.S. law nor the Constitution offers them any protection and NSA, like all other intelligence agencies, has broad authorities to spy on them.

But the searches often pull in messages from, to or about U.S. citizens as well — an email mentioning or copied to the foreign target of any surveillance can lawfully be pulled out of the data and examined, although special rules apply to its handling. This is known as incidental collection and is allowed by the law that authorizes the upstream collection program.

The special rules are called “minimization procedures” and are designed to protect, as far as possible, the privacy of Americans whose communications are swept up in warrantless surveillance of foreign targets. Their names may not be included in intelligence reports, for example, unless necessary to understand the information being reported.

But, the officials said, because of the way email moves across the Internet from the provider’s servers to the user’s computer, it was not technically possible to separate the communications that could lawfully be incidentally collected because they involved a legitimate foreign target overseas. As a result, some of the gathered email “might prove to be wholly domestic,” said one official, and therefore not subject to collection without a warrant. This is known as inadvertent collection.

“The NSA has knowingly acquired tens of thousands of wholly domestic communications under section 702 even though this law was specifically written to prohibit the warrantless acquisition of wholly domestic communications,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, Oregon Democrat and member of the intelligence committee.

For their part, officials insist that Congress was kept fully apprised of the program that scooped up the email and has since renewed the law that authorized it.

NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander also told Fox News last year that the agency does not `` hold data on U.S . citizens . ''
But the Guardian newspaper reported late Wednesday that the administration has been collecting the phone records of millions of U.S. customers of Verizon under a top secret court order .
The order , a copy of which apparently was obtained by The Guardian , reportedly was granted by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on April 25 and is good until July 19 .
It requires Verizon , one of the nation 's largest telecommunications companies , on an `` ongoing , daily basis '' to give the NSA information on all telephone calls in its systems , both within the U.S. and between the U.S. and other countries .

It has to do with possible illegal activities involving the NSA and DEA . As you know , the NSA ’ s job is to focus outside the US , not inside , and primarily on enemies of the United States , not it ’ s citizens :
Eight Democratic senators and congressmen have asked Attorney General Eric Holder to answer questions about a Reuters report that the National Security Agency supplies the Drug Enforcement Administration with intelligence information used to make non-terrorism cases against American citizens . The August report revealed that a secretive DEA unit passes the NSA information to agents in the field , including those from the Internal Revenue Service , the FBI and Homeland Security , with instructions to never disclose the original source , even in court . In most cases , the NSA tips involve drugs , money laundering and organized crime , not terrorism . Five Democrats in the Senate and three senior Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee submitted questions to Holder about the NSA-DEA relationship , joining two prominent Republicans who have expressed concerns . The matter will be discussed during classified briefings scheduled for September , Republican and Democratic aides said . “ These allegations raise serious concerns that gaps in the policy and law are allowing overreach by the federal government ’ s intelligence gathering apparatus , ” wrote the senators – Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin , Ron Wyden of Oregon , Tom Udall of New Mexico , Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Sherrod Brown of Ohio .
Why , other than the fact that the NSA has no charter or permission to pass its information about American citizens on to other agencies , is this important ?
The Reuters reports cited internal documents that show how DEA ’ s Special Operations Division funnels information from overseas NSA intercepts , domestic wiretaps , informants and a large DEA database of telephone records to authorities nationwide to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans . The documents show that agents have been trained to conceal how such investigations truly begin – to “ recreate ” the investigative trail to effectively cover up the original source of the information , raising questions about whether exculpatory information might be withheld from defendants at trial . The internal documents describe the process of recreating the evidence trail to omit any reference to the Special Operations Division as “ parallel construction. ” For example , agents said in interviews , they act as if a drug investigation began with a traffic stop for speeding or a broken taillight , instead of a tip passed from the NSA . An IRS document describes a similar process for tax agency investigators .
Emphasis mine . So not only is passing such information to these agencies unauthorized , the government then instructs its agents on how to lie about the source of their information ( a lie of omission ) . And , of course , it is also legitimate to ask whether or not exculpatory evidence could also have been available but not passed to these agencies .
Is this really the type government we want ? One that spies on us , intercepts our electronic messages and phone calls and uses them secretly by passing what should be private to various other government agencies and then lies about it ? Peggy Noonan addresses those questions quite directly today :
If the citizens of the United States don ’ t put up a halting hand , the government can ’ t be expected to . It is in the nature of security professionals to always want more , and since their mission is worthy they ’ re less likely to have constitutional qualms , to dwell on such abstractions as abuse of the Fourth Amendment and the impact of that abuse on the First . If you assume all the information that can and will be gleaned will be confined to NSA and national security purposes , you are not sufficiently imaginative or informed . If you believe the information will never be used wrongly or recklessly , you are touchingly innocent . If you assume you can trust the administration on this issue you are not following the bouncing ball , from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper , who told Congress under oath the NSA didn ’ t gather “ any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans ” ( he later had to apologize ) to President Obama , who told Jay Leno : “ We don ’ t have a domestic program. ” What we do have , the president said , is “ some mechanism that can track a phone number or an email address that is connected to a terrorist attack. ” Oh , we have more than that . Almost every politician in America lives in fear of one big thing : a terrorist attack they can later be accused of not having done everything to stop . And so they ’ ll do anything . They are looking to preserve their political viability and historical standing . We , as citizens , must keep other things in mind , such as the rights we are born with as Americans , one of which is privacy .
Lord Acton nailed it when he said “ Power corrupts … ” . We ’ re currently in the midst of watching exactly that happen to an even greater degree than in the past . If you give government power , it will do everything it can to expand that power – whether legitimately or illegitimately . It is the nature of the beast . And we have to put up a hand to stop it .
If you ’ re wondering why the Tea Party is characterized in such nasty ways by the establishment of both parties , it is because it does indeed attempt to put up a hand to stop these sorts of abuses and remove power from the abusers . They threaten the very base of power the political establishment has worked so hard to build over the years .","This has been in the news recently and now it is getting some Congressional attention.

The Reuters reports cited internal documents that show how DEA’s Special Operations Division funnels information from overseas NSA intercepts, domestic wiretaps, informants and a large DEA database of telephone records to authorities nationwide to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans. The documents show that agents have been trained to conceal how such investigations truly begin – to “recreate” the investigative trail to effectively cover up the original source of the information, raising questions about whether exculpatory information might be withheld from defendants at trial. The internal documents describe the process of recreating the evidence trail to omit any reference to the Special Operations Division as “parallel construction.” For example, agents said in interviews, they act as if a drug investigation began with a traffic stop for speeding or a broken taillight, instead of a tip passed from the NSA. An IRS document describes a similar process for tax agency investigators.

Emphasis mine. So not only is passing such information to these agencies unauthorized, the government then instructs its agents on how to lie about the source of their information (a lie of omission). And, of course, it is also legitimate to ask whether or not exculpatory evidence could also have been available but not passed to these agencies.

Is this really the type government we want? One that spies on us, intercepts our electronic messages and phone calls and uses them secretly by passing what should be private to various other government agencies and then lies about it? Peggy Noonan addresses those questions quite directly today:

If the citizens of the United States don’t put up a halting hand, the government can’t be expected to. It is in the nature of security professionals to always want more, and since their mission is worthy they’re less likely to have constitutional qualms, to dwell on such abstractions as abuse of the Fourth Amendment and the impact of that abuse on the First. If you assume all the information that can and will be gleaned will be confined to NSA and national security purposes, you are not sufficiently imaginative or informed. If you believe the information will never be used wrongly or recklessly, you are touchingly innocent. If you assume you can trust the administration on this issue you are not following the bouncing ball, from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who told Congress under oath the NSA didn’t gather “any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans” (he later had to apologize) to President Obama, who told Jay Leno: “We don’t have a domestic program.” What we do have, the president said, is “some mechanism that can track a phone number or an email address that is connected to a terrorist attack.” Oh, we have more than that. Almost every politician in America lives in fear of one big thing: a terrorist attack they can later be accused of not having done everything to stop. And so they’ll do anything. They are looking to preserve their political viability and historical standing. We, as citizens, must keep other things in mind, such as the rights we are born with as Americans, one of which is privacy.

Lord Acton nailed it when he said “Power corrupts …”. We’re currently in the midst of watching exactly that happen to an even greater degree than in the past. If you give government power, it will do everything it can to expand that power – whether legitimately or illegitimately. It is the nature of the beast. And we have to put up a hand to stop it.

If you’re wondering why the Tea Party is characterized in such nasty ways by the establishment of both parties, it is because it does indeed attempt to put up a hand to stop these sorts of abuses and remove power from the abusers. They threaten the very base of power the political establishment has worked so hard to build over the years.

Rand Paul relinquished the Senate floor late Wednesday night , ending his `` filibuster '' over National Security Agency surveillance programs authorized under the Patriot Act .
Paul , R-Kentucky , ran through several binders of material over the course of his marathon protest , and also got some help from 10 fellow senators -- three Republicans and seven Democrats .
Sens . Ron Wyden , D-Oregon , and Mike Lee , R-Utah , were the biggest boons to Paul 's efforts , joining Paul on the Senate floor several times to give the Kentucky Republican a chance to catch his breath -- and often grab a sip of water and pop a candy in his mouth . And one of Paul 's rivals for the Republican presidential nomination , Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , also ended up helping Paul 's efforts late in the night .
`` There comes a time in the history of nations when fear and complacency allow power to accumulate and liberty and privacy to suffer . That time is now and I will not let the Patriot Act , the most unpatriotic of acts , go unchallenged , '' Paul said at the opening of his remarks , and those who joined him on the Senate floor shared his concerns and stressed the need to reform the Patriot Act .
The Senate is considering whether to reauthorize or reform a crucial section of that law that gives the government sweeping powers to collect phone metadata on millions of Americans in an effort to thwart terrorist plots . The House last week overwhelmingly approved a bill to reform that law .
The NSA 's bulk collection program expires at midnight on June 1 , and the Department of Justice warned in a memo shared by a GOP aide on Wednesday that the agency will have to begin preparing a week before the expiration date for a potential lapse in the law .
Paul 's talk-a-thon Wednesday came more than two years after his nearly 13-hour filibuster in 2013 , which was widely anticipated and brought him national attention for delaying the confirmation of CIA chief John Brennan to draw attention to U.S. drone policies .
But his speech Wednesday was n't technically a filibuster because intricate Senate rules required him to stop talking by early Thursday afternoon for an unrelated vote .
Still , Paul 's office insists it was a filibuster , saying Paul prevented lawmakers from taking action to reauthorize the Patriot Act while he had the floor .
`` Sen. Paul will speak until he can no longer speak , '' spokeswoman Jillian Lane said Wednesday .
Paul began speaking at about 1:20 p.m . ET . More than two hours later , Wyden , Paul 's Democratic partner-in-crime on stopping the NSA 's domestic surveillance programs , joined him on the floor to aid the effort .
I 've just taken the senate floor to begin a filibuster of the Patriot Act renewal . It 's time to end the NSA spying ! — Dr. Rand Paul ( @ RandPaul ) May 20 , 2015
Paul slammed Congress for not scheduling enough time to debate whether to reform the Patriot Act and to debate the merits of NSA surveillance .
`` At the very least we should debate , we should debate whether or not we are going to relinquish our rights or whether or not we are going to have a full and able debate over whether or not we can live within the constitution or whether or not we have to go around the constitution , '' Paul said on the floor .
And as his voice waned in the 10th hour of his time on the floor , Paul again emphasized the need for an open and `` honest '' debate about the Patriot Act and domestic surveillance .
And he again hammered home the need for Congress to uphold the Constitution as it takes action on the Patriot Act .
`` There is absolutely no excuse -- no excuse not to debate this , no excuse not to vote on a sufficient amount of amendments to try to make this better , to try to make the bulk collection of records go away . It 's what the American people want , it 's what the Constitution demands , '' Paul said .
The debate over NSA reform has pitted Republican leadership in the House and Senate against each other .
House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul , R-Texas , on Wednesday lamented that ongoing deadlock , slamming GOP leaders for failing so far to broker a deal to keep key provisions of the Patriot Act alive .
`` We go dark -- in a high threat environment , that 's a very dangerous thing to do , that 's dangerous politics , '' McCaul told reporters Wednesday . `` I 'm disappointed that we 're not able to work this out and now we 're going to do this ping pong game and play politics with national security . ''
And McCaul added that Paul 's `` filibuster '' drove home his point about the dangers of politics interfering with national security .
Paul and Wyden both talked up the amendments during Wednesday 's so-called filibuster that they are proposing to add to the USA Freedom Act , a reform bill the House overwhelmingly passed last week . Paul and Wyden are pushing for additional reforms not included in the measure , a compromise bill between reform advocates in the House and House Republican leadership .
Wyden added to Paul 's lambasting of the NSA 's bulk data collection programs and also slammed national security hawks in Congress who have repeatedly held back reforms , Wyden alleged .
`` They wait until the very last minute , '' Wyden said . `` They wait until the last minute and then they say , 'Oh my goodness it is a dangerous world we 've got to continue this program the way it is ! ' ''
And Lee , who is the chief Republican sponsor of the USA Freedom Act , also joined Paul on the Senate floor , promoting his bill and slamming a dysfunctional Congress that he said is n't serving the American people well on surveillance and other issues .
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , Paul 's fellow Kentucky senator , is staunchly opposed to NSA reforms , but said he would allow a vote on the legislation .
Passage on that bill is anything but certain though , with some senators supportive of moderate reforms hoping to weaken the bill , while others , like Paul and Wyden , want the bill to do more .
Paul voted against allowing debate on a previous version of the USA Freedom Act last year , saying it did not go far enough .
`` The people do n't want the bulk collection of their records . And if we were listening we 'd hear that , '' Paul said .

The Kentucky Republican was also using his `` filibuster '' as an opportunity to rally his supporters and raise money for his presidential campaign .
While Paul was speaking on the Senate floor Wednesday , his campaign sent an email to supporters asking for donations to support his presidential ambitions .
And his marathon session on the floor also jolted his supporters , who posted photos of themselves watching Paul 's speech throughout the ten and a half hours , using the hashtag # StandwithRand that had emerged during Paul 's famed 2013 filibuster .
Paul also slammed President Barack Obama for refusing to end the program through executive order , despite saying he opposes the bulk data collection program .
`` He has every power to stop it , and yet the president does nothing , '' Paul said of Obama .
Paul repeatedly drew on the Founding Fathers as he laid out his arguments why the government should not be allowed to collect troves of information on innocent Americans in the name of counterterrorism .
`` If government were comprised of angels , we would n't need restrictions , we would n't need laws , '' Paul said quoting James Madison . He later quoted Ben Franklin as well .
But Paul , a libertarian-leaning conservative , had his own words as well , insisting that Americans should always be wary of the government and increasing government power .
`` Anytime you give power to government , they love it , and they will accumulate more , '' he said . `` They will not live within the confines of power unless you watch them .

I know Big Data now in NSA computers probably includes my phone calls. (I hope it’s just time, duration, location and recipients, not my words, too, but I’m not sure.)

I know the snooping may be unnecessary. Government’s claim that it prevents terror is weak: Officials say a terrorist was caught, but New York City police say he was caught via other methods.

I’m skeptical about the very claim that any terribly important “secrets” are held by unhappy 29-year-olds and 4.8 million other people (that’s how many Americans hold security clearance for classified material).

So it’s invasive, probably illegal and maybe useless. I ought to be very angry. But I’m not. Why?

I need to keep thinking about this issue, but for now, two reasons:

1. Terrorists do want to murder us. If the NSA is halfway competent, Big Data should help detect plots.

2. My electronic privacy has already been utterly shredded by Google, Amazon, YouTube and so on.

They know with whom I talk, what interests me and how much time I spend doing this or that. They creep me out with targeted ads. How did they know I want that?! Oh, right ... I spent an hour searching ...

Then I go outside in New York City, where 16 cameras record me on my way to work.

Greedy lawyers can subpoena my private records. My employer has a right to read my emails.

My privacy is already blown.

I’m angrier about other things Big Government does in the name of keeping me safe: forcing me to wear safety gear, limiting where I may go, stripping me at airports, forcing me to pay $2,300 for more military than we need.

Actually, $2,300 is the average Americans pay for our military. I pay more. The total for all of us is more than $700 billon a year, which is, as Chris Preble of the Cato Institute pointed out on my Fox Business show, ""Stossel,"" “more than we spent at the peak of the Cold War … fighting the Soviet Union.”

The danger was greater then, when we had a nuclear Soviet Union threatening to “bury us.”

Much of America’s defense spending goes to defend our allies in Europe and Asia. They spend less because we spend more.

“We are suckers,” said Preble. “I don’t blame them. If I were in their situation, if someone else was offering to pay for my security, I’d let them do it.”

And it’s not clear that we do what we do efficiently. The U.S. Department of Defense is prone to the same sorts of inefficiency that plagues other parts of government. The department’s brownie recipe is 26 pages long.

Military officials say Al Qaeda has been weakened. Iran (someday) may build a nuclear bomb, but we managed to deter China and Russia when they had thousands.

Some people want the U.S. military to police the world: Contain China, transform failed states, chase terrorists, train foreign militaries, protect sea lanes, protect oil supplies, stop genocide, protect refugees, maintain bases in allied countries, police our southern border, stop drug trafficking and spread good through humanitarian missions. The list is endless, which is the problem.

The U.S. military can’t be everywhere. And we can’t hand the government unlimited power and unlimited money every time a potential crisis looms.

He stresses that , per the law , U.S. citizens and people in U.S. ca n't be targeted
Washington Post , Guardian report U.S. agencies tapped the servers of tech giants
Facebook , Apple , others say they do n't allow direct access to their servers
America 's top intelligence official on Thursday night challenged news reports claiming Facebook posts , Gmail messages and more have been intercepted for years in a vast data-mining operation , saying the reports `` contain numerous inaccuracies . ''
The Guardian , a British newspaper , and the Washington Post reported Thursday that U.S. intelligence agencies had access to the central servers of nine of the country 's biggest technology firms including Microsoft , Apple , Google , Yahoo and Facebook .
The Post reported the program -- called PRISM -- underwent `` exponential growth '' since its founding in 2007 . In fact , the newspaper said the program has become the leading source of raw material for the National Security Agency , the secretive U.S. intelligence operation that monitors electronic communications .
Yet several tech giants whose servers were reportedly ensnared in the program denied any knowledge of it Thursday .
And James Clapper , the director of national intelligence , questioned the Guardian and Post articles in a statement Thursday night .
He referred to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which he noted was recently reauthorized by Congress -- one of the bodies , along with the executive branch and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , with oversight over aspects of intelligence gathering .
Section 702 , Clapper added , `` is designed to facilitate the acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning non-U.S. persons located outside the United States . ''
`` It can not be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen , any other U.S. person , or anyone located within the United States , '' he said in his statement .
While he made no mention of data mining , Clapper did defend the American intelligence effort generally , saying , `` Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable foreign intelligence information we collect , and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats . ''
Clapper also called out the person or people behind `` the unauthorized disclosure of information about this important and entirely legal program , '' saying such apparent leaks are `` reprehensible and risks important protections for the security of Americans . ''
The Post reported that its reporters had been provided a detailed briefing presentation document on the PRISM program .
The program has been running since 2007 and has undergone `` exponential growth '' since then , the Post reported . It is now the leading source of raw material for the National Security Agency , the secretive U.S. intelligence operation that monitors electronic communications .
According to a briefing slide published by the Guardian , PRISM began with data from Microsoft in 2007 . The program began collecting data from Yahoo in 2008 and from Google , Facebook and the message system PalTalk in 2009 . YouTube became a source in 2010 , Skype and AOL in 2011 and Apple in late 2012 , the slide claims .
The NSA declined to comment , but several companies -- many of them using similar language -- denied Thursday any knowledge of such a program .
Microsoft , for instance , said in a statement it only provides user data when legally required and for specific accounts -- adding that `` if the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data we do n't participate in it . ''
Jodi Seth , a spokeswoman for Facebook , said the social media giant works to `` carefully scrutinize any ... request for compliance '' and does not give government agencies `` direct access '' to its servers .
Apple spokesman Steve Dowling offered a similar response -- saying Apple hands over information only when a government agency gets a court order . Dowling added that his company has never heard of PRISM .
`` We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law , and we review all such requests carefully , '' a Google spokesman said in response to the stories . `` From time to time , people allege that we have created a government 'back door ' into our systems , but Google does not have a 'back door ' for the government to access private user data . ''
Even with these denials and Clapper 's defense , President Barack Obama 's administration has come under growing scrutiny in recent days over his record on balancing citizens ' right to privacy and the government 's efforts to combat terrorism .
That includes news , first reported on Wednesday by the Guardian and commented on by U.S. politicians , that the FBI and National Security Agency have been collecting the phone records of millions of Americans -- specifically Verizon customers and perhaps others -- over a several year period .
Days after taking office in 2009 , Obama vowed , `` Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency . '' But on Thursday , the left-leaning Huffington Post conflated Obama with his predecessor George W. Bush while a New York Times editorial said `` the administration has now lost all credibility '' when it comes to overreaching in the name of fighting terrorism .
`` Mr. Obama is proving the truism that the executive branch will use any power it is given and very likely abuse it , '' the Times ' editorial said .","Story highlights Director of national intelligence says the reports have ""numerous inaccuracies""

And James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, questioned the Guardian and Post articles in a statement Thursday night.

He referred to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which he noted was recently reauthorized by Congress -- one of the bodies, along with the executive branch and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, with oversight over aspects of intelligence gathering.

Section 702, Clapper added, ""is designed to facilitate the acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning non-U.S. persons located outside the United States.""

""It cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen, any other U.S. person, or anyone located within the United States,"" he said in his statement.

While he made no mention of data mining, Clapper did defend the American intelligence effort generally, saying, ""Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable foreign intelligence information we collect, and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats.""

Clapper also called out the person or people behind ""the unauthorized disclosure of information about this important and entirely legal program,"" saying such apparent leaks are ""reprehensible and risks important protections for the security of Americans.""

The Post reported that its reporters had been provided a detailed briefing presentation document on the PRISM program.

The program has been running since 2007 and has undergone ""exponential growth"" since then, the Post reported. It is now the leading source of raw material for the National Security Agency, the secretive U.S. intelligence operation that monitors electronic communications.

According to a briefing slide published by the Guardian, PRISM began with data from Microsoft in 2007. The program began collecting data from Yahoo in 2008 and from Google, Facebook and the message system PalTalk in 2009. YouTube became a source in 2010, Skype and AOL in 2011 and Apple in late 2012, the slide claims.

The NSA declined to comment, but several companies -- many of them using similar language -- denied Thursday any knowledge of such a program.

Microsoft, for instance, said in a statement it only provides user data when legally required and for specific accounts -- adding that ""if the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data we don't participate in it.""

Jodi Seth, a spokeswoman for Facebook, said the social media giant works to ""carefully scrutinize any ... request for compliance"" and does not give government agencies ""direct access"" to its servers.

Apple spokesman Steve Dowling offered a similar response -- saying Apple hands over information only when a government agency gets a court order. Dowling added that his company has never heard of PRISM.

""We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law, and we review all such requests carefully,"" a Google spokesman said in response to the stories. ""From time to time, people allege that we have created a government 'back door' into our systems, but Google does not have a 'back door' for the government to access private user data.""

Even with these denials and Clapper's defense, President Barack Obama's administration has come under growing scrutiny in recent days over his record on balancing citizens' right to privacy and the government's efforts to combat terrorism.

That includes news, first reported on Wednesday by the Guardian and commented on by U.S. politicians, that the FBI and National Security Agency have been collecting the phone records of millions of Americans -- specifically Verizon customers and perhaps others -- over a several year period.

Days after taking office in 2009, Obama vowed , ""Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency."" But on Thursday, the left-leaning Huffington Post conflated Obama with his predecessor George W. Bush while a New York Times editorial said ""the administration has now lost all credibility"" when it comes to overreaching in the name of fighting terrorism.

""Mr. Obama is proving the truism that the executive branch will use any power it is given and very likely abuse it,"" the Times' editorial said.",www.cnn.com,left,ZFDV1HNDbP84qkBo

District Court Judge Richard J. Leon ’ s groundbreaking decision marks the first time a court has ruled against the program . It puts him in conflict with the secret court that usually oversees clandestine operations and has approved the collection of records on most phone calls made in the U.S .
But Judge Leon said James Madison , chief architect of the Bill of Rights , would be “ aghast ” at what the government is doing .
“ I can not imagine a more ‘ indiscriminate ’ and ‘ arbitrary invasion ’ than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen , ” the judge wrote in a 68-page opinion . “ Surely , such a program infringes on ‘ that degree of privacy ’ that the Founders enshrined in the Fourth Amendment . ”
The judge didn ’ t overturn the entire program but instead told the government to stop collecting and retaining the phone records of two plaintiffs who sued to challenge the NSA .
Judge Leon also stayed his own ruling to give the government a chance to file an appeal , saying he realized the big national security interests at stake .
Andrew C. Ames , a spokesman for the Justice Department , said attorneys were reviewing the ruling , though he would not comment on the next step .
“ We believe the program is constitutional , as previous judges have found , ” Mr. Ames said .
Under the program , the National Security Agency collects the telephone numbers , times and durations of phone calls made in the U.S. and stores the data for five years . The government says it looks only into the phone metadata when it suspects someone could be involved in terrorism .
The phone records program , whose existence was leaked by former government contractor Edward Snowden this year , has become a major issue in Washington , where Mr. Obama is desperately trying to preserve it against bipartisan attacks in Congress .
Mr. Snowden issued a statement through Glenn Greenwald , a reporter whose stories exposed the program , saying he was convinced the program wouldn ’ t survive a court challenge .
“ Today , a secret program authorized by a secret court was , when exposed to the light of day , found to violate Americans ’ rights . It is the first of many , ” he said .
The ruling likely will strengthen critics ’ argument , particularly because Judge Leon was appointed by a Republican president to the federal district court in Washington .
“ This is not a left-wing liberal judge . This is one of Bush ’ s first appointees to the D.C. district . That ’ s a testament to where we are . I think it speaks volumes that [ Judge Leon ] wrote that opinion , ” said Carl Tobias , a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law .
Indeed , those on both the political right and left praised Judge Leon ’ s decision .
“ The NSA is out of control and operating in an unconstitutional manner , ” said Sen. Bernard Sanders , Vermont independent . “ Today ’ s ruling is an important first step toward reining in this agency , but we must go further . ”
Some of those lawmakers have introduced a bill to cancel the Patriot Act powers that the government claims .
But the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence this year cleared a bill that would put the NSA program on firm legal footing , requiring more reports but not curtailing any of the basic operations .
Judge Leon ’ s ruling appears to conflict with a 1970s-era Supreme Court precedent that found broad government records collection powers , but Judge Leon said that earlier ruling didn ’ t envision the scope of today ’ s technology .
“ The question in this case can more properly be styled as follows : When do present-day circumstances — the evolution in the government ’ s surveillance capabilities , citizens ’ phone habits , and the relationship between the NSA and telecom companies — become so thoroughly unlike those considered by the Supreme Court 34 years ago that a precedent like Smith simply does not apply ? ” the judge wrote . “ The answer , unfortunately for the government , is now . ”
Another secret court set up by Congress has repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of the program , though in those instances there was no plaintiff to challenge the NSA .
In the case before Judge Leon , lawyer Larry Klayman argued that he and a co-plaintiff were being targeted unfairly . Mr. Klayman accused the government of sending false text messages from his phone .
Government attorneys argued that Judge Leon shouldn ’ t even be able to hear Mr. Klayman ’ s case because the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court upheld the NSA program . The government also said that since the workings of the program are still classified , Mr. Klayman couldn ’ t prove his records were collected .
Judge Leon said he is convinced from the government ’ s own arguments that it is collecting “ plaintiff ’ s metadata — indeed everyone ’ s metadata . ”

What is the NSA's mission?

The National Security Agency is the U.S. government's primary eavesdropping agency. It intercepts, decodes, and analyzes foreign communications — such as emails, telephone calls, and other ""signals intelligence."" The Fort Meade, Md.–based agency, which has an annual budget of about $10 billion and employs some 40,000 people, has long carried out this mission in the shadows. But a series of leaks by former agency contractor Edward Snowden has revealed the stunning scale of its global surveillance operation. It's now known that the NSA scoops up and stores billions of internet communications and cellphone records from the U.S. and around the world every day, which can then be studied by the agency's legion of code breakers, data miners, and counterterrorism specialists. When President Obama receives his daily intelligence briefing, ""at least 75 percent"" comes from the NSA's cyberspies, said Mike McConnell, director of national intelligence under President George W. Bush.

Why was the NSA created?

It was set up by President Truman in 1952 to consolidate the military's jumble of code-breaking operations into a single, powerful agency capable of cracking the Soviet Union's communications. The NSA, whose existence remained classified for decades, quickly became the intelligence community's crown jewel. It ringed the USSR with 100-foot-tall, 1,000-foot-wide antennas that intercepted wireless signals as they bounced between the earth and the ionosphere. It stationed spy ships in the seas, and sent reconnaissance planes and satellites into the skies. Very quickly, the sheer volume of information harvested by the NSA dwarfed the ""human intelligence"" gathered by CIA agents in the field. ""The CIA is good at stealing a memo off a prime minister's desk,"" said one former NSA director. ""They're not much good at anything else.""

Were the NSA's intercepts useful?

At times, enormously so. The NSA was the first agency to spot Soviet missiles in Cuba in 1962. It provided advance warning of China's first nuclear bomb test in 1964, and its monitoring of Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev's limousine telephone gave American negotiators crucial inside information during arms limitation talks in 1972. But NSA intercepts also led to some colossal blunders. In August 1964, the agency reported that U.S. destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin had been attacked by North Vietnamese boats twice in three days. But the second attack, used by President Johnson to justify an escalation of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, never occurred. The NSA had overheard North Vietnamese radio operators discussing the first battle, and misinterpreted it as a live combat report. ""It was one of the greatest intelligence mistakes in history,"" said Matthew Aid, author of the NSA history The Secret Sentry.

Does the agency spy domestically?

Yes, though these efforts are sometimes of dubious legality. From the '50s to the early '70s, the NSA operated a program called ""Shamrock"" that saw U.S. telegram companies hand over up to 150,000 messages a month — including many telegrams from ordinary Americans — which agency analysts studied for evidence of Soviet spying. Under Presidents Johnson and Nixon, the NSA worked with the FBI and CIA to monitor the communications of civil rights leaders and anti-war protesters, including Martin Luther King Jr. and Jane Fonda, as well as members of Congress. The exposure of those programs by Idaho Sen. Frank Church led Congress to enact the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 1978, which created a secret court to hear warrant requests from intelligence services.

How did 9/11 change the agency?

The attacks forced the NSA to adapt to the digital age. After Sept. 11, 2001, embarrassed the nation's intelligence community, NSA officials launched a massive effort to capture, store, and analyze emails, texts, and online chats and videos used by terrorist networks. ""They took on a new mission that required sifting vast amounts of data to find a few important signals,"" said Stewart Baker, a former senior Homeland Security official. The NSA ordered America's largest telecom firms and internet service providers to hand over raw data as it transited their networks. It tapped directly into the fiber-optic cables that constitute the internet's nervous system, and recruited scores of Silicon Valley experts — including Max Kelly, Facebook's former chief security officer — to help it navigate the new digital landscape.

How much data is collected?

The agency says it ""touches"" 1.6 percent of all traffic being carried on the internet — about 29.2 petabytes of communication data a day. That's the equivalent of collecting all the text held in the Library of Congress 2,990 times every day. Intelligence officials argue that these intercepts have provided crucial insights into Iran's nuclear weapons program, aided the U.S. military's operations in Iraq and Libya, and helped disrupt dozens of potential terrorist attacks around the world. But some former employees claim the NSA's ability to collect data is now outpacing its ability to analyze it. ""Despite all this collection, the NSA missed the Boston bombing, the underwear bomber, and the Times Square bomber,"" said James Bamford, a historian of the NSA. ""The problem is the bigger you build the haystack, the harder it is to find the needle.""

The NSA's hard drive

The NSA has mastered the art of collecting vast amounts of communications data. It now has somewhere to store it. Last year, the agency opened a $1.7 billion data center in the Utah desert, which houses 100,000 square feet of high-performance servers. The computers use 65 megawatts of electricity — about the same as a small city — and generate so much heat that they require 1.5 million gallons of cooling water a day.
