Edward Snowden has been called a “traitor” and accused of “treason” for his leaks of some of the nation’s top secrets.

But is there a case for the T-words?

Story Continued Below

Treason is a crime so old that it’s the only one specifically defined in the U.S. Constitution, but legal experts suggest it’s a charge that Snowden will most likely never face. And “traitor” seems to fit better in the world of Benedict Arnold and dueling pistols than in today’s sea of electronic surveillance and top secret security clearances.

Constitutionally, treason is defined as “whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere.”

That’s a tough sell in Snowden’s case, legal experts say.

“I do not believe it is treason,” said George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley. “There is nothing to suggest that his motivation was to assist our enemies or a foreign power.”

A more obvious set of charges for the former Booz Allen Hamilton analyst’s leak of secrets from the National Security Agency would include illegal disclosure of classified information and unauthorized removal and retention of classified information, Turley added.

Bradley Manning, the Army private accused of leaking classified information to WikiLeaks, was charged with “aiding the enemy,” among other charges, but not with treason.

If convicted in his court-martial, now under way in Fort Meade in Maryland — headquarters of the sprawling NSA — he could face life in prison.

There are a number of specific conditions that have to be met for a leaker like Snowden to have committed treason, said John Harrison, a University of Virginia law professor who specializes in constitutional law and history.

“Unless the potential defendant is someone who engaged in hostilities, … the question is whether he adhered to the U.S.’s enemies and gave them aid and comfort, which, in turn, depends on who is an enemy,” Harrison said. If the enemy is considered to be a member of Al Qaeda, it opens up all sorts of other questions about the definition of enemy that are still murky in current law.

Harrison clarified, however, that treason isn’t an impossible charge for Snowden.

“If you think that one, Al Qaeda and similar groups are the enemy for purposes of treason; two, his actions assisted them in operations against the U.S.; and three, that was his intention,” Harrison said, “then the argument that it was treason is pretty good.”

House Speaker John Boehner, for one, called Snowden a “traitor” Tuesday on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” adding that his disclosure of information puts Americans’ lives at risk and violates the law.",www.politico.com,left,B7ocIpH65goBmWWC

The White House says it is ""extremely disappointed"" in Russia's decision to grant a temporary one-year asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden.

Snowden left Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport on Thursday after spending more than a month holed up in its transit center. Anatoly Kucherena, a Russian lawyer who has been advising the former U.S. intelligence contractor, told Russian media that Snowden's whereabouts are being kept secret for security reasons.

The Obama administration's displeasure was clear:

""We are extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step despite our clear lawful requests in public and private to have Mr. Snowden expelled to the U.S. to face the charges against him,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney says. ""Mr. Snowden is not a whistleblower.

Update at 9:20 a.m. ET: Possible Conditions To Asylum?

Snowden arrived at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport from Hong Kong more than a month ago, after news media published a trove of secret U.S. documents supplied by the former National Security Agency contractor.

The White House is ""extremely disappointed"" by the action, says Press Secretary Jay Carney.

Snowden's Russian adviser, Anatoly Kucherena, ""has told reporters that he passed along documents to Edward Snowden allowing him to enter Russian soil,"" NPR's Corey Flintoff reports from Moscow. ""Kucherena and sources at Sheremetyevo Airport say Snowden has left the airport.""

Snowden has been granted asylum for a period of at least one year.

Earlier Thursday, WikiLeaks tweeted, ""Edward Snowden has successfully acquired refugee status in Russia and will shortly leave the airport.""

Christie Still Strong

Sounds like the pundits are a lot more exercised over the George Washington Bridge imbroglio than ordinary folks.

“Nearly 70 percent of Americans say the bridge-closure scandal engulfing Chris Christie has not changed their opinion about the New Jersey governor, according to a new NBC News/Marist poll. In addition, 44 percent of respondents believe he’s telling the truth about his knowledge of the events surrounding the controversy.

The 25-2 vote signaled that Republicans and Democrats in the House won ’ t accept a full renewal of the Patriot Act , whose key data-collection powers are slated to expire at the end of May . That puts a dent in the hopes of Senate Republicans , including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , who has argued the government needs the snooping powers to keep the country safe .
Opposing Mr. McConnell is House Speaker John A. Boehner , who said Thursday he is backing the reform bill that cleared the Judiciary Committee and now heads to the full House floor for a vote .
“ It ’ s not everything I want , but I think it ’ s a solid agreement , ” Mr. Boehner said .
The legislation would prevent the federal government from indiscriminately collecting and storing Americans ’ data , and would also impose more transparency on the secret court that oversees intelligence collection . In a move to gain support of some hawks , the bill also imposes raised prison sentences on those convicted of providing material support to terrorists .
Known as the USA Freedom Act , it was designed to rewrite the Patriot Act ’ s Section 215 , which authorizes the government to collect records from private businesses .
The most prominent use has been the National Security Agency ’ s program to scoop up and store five years ’ worth of records of the numbers , times and durations of phone calls made within the U.S . The NSA insists it only probes the records when it believes a number is associated with a terrorism investigation .
But the program , revealed by former government contractor Edward Snowden , left many Americans uncomfortable , and efforts to rein in the collection have been going on for two years .
“ The bill ends bulk collection . It ends secret laws . And it increases transparency of our intelligence community , ” said Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. , Wisconsin Republican and the author of the original Patriot Act , who says he ’ s been stunned by the way the Bush and Obama administrations used it to justify collecting data on every American ’ s phone calls .
It ’ s very similar to a bill that passed the full House overwhelmingly last year , also with bipartisan support .
Another version foundered in the Senate , though , after Mr. McConnell led a filibuster to block it during a lame-duck session of Congress late last year . The Kentucky Republican argues that the government needs the powers to combat terrorist threats .

The two “ No ” votes on the bill came from Rep. Ted Poe , Texas Republican , and Rep. Jim Jordan , Ohio Republican .","The House Judiciary Committee put the NSA’s phone-snooping program on the path to being scrapped Thursday when a bipartisan majority voted for major reforms to the Patriot Act.

The 25-2 vote signaled that Republicans and Democrats in the House won’t accept a full renewal of the Patriot Act, whose key data-collection powers are slated to expire at the end of May. That puts a dent in the hopes of Senate Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has argued the government needs the snooping powers to keep the country safe.

Opposing Mr. McConnell is House Speaker John A. Boehner, who said Thursday he is backing the reform bill that cleared the Judiciary Committee and now heads to the full House floor for a vote.

“It’s not everything I want, but I think it’s a solid agreement,” Mr. Boehner said.

The legislation would prevent the federal government from indiscriminately collecting and storing Americans’ data, and would also impose more transparency on the secret court that oversees intelligence collection. In a move to gain support of some hawks, the bill also imposes raised prison sentences on those convicted of providing material support to terrorists.

Known as the USA Freedom Act, it was designed to rewrite the Patriot Act’s Section 215, which authorizes the government to collect records from private businesses.

The most prominent use has been the National Security Agency’s program to scoop up and store five years’ worth of records of the numbers, times and durations of phone calls made within the U.S. The NSA insists it only probes the records when it believes a number is associated with a terrorism investigation.

But the program, revealed by former government contractor Edward Snowden, left many Americans uncomfortable, and efforts to rein in the collection have been going on for two years.

“The bill ends bulk collection. It ends secret laws. And it increases transparency of our intelligence community,” said Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Wisconsin Republican and the author of the original Patriot Act, who says he’s been stunned by the way the Bush and Obama administrations used it to justify collecting data on every American’s phone calls.

It’s very similar to a bill that passed the full House overwhelmingly last year, also with bipartisan support.

Another version foundered in the Senate, though, after Mr. McConnell led a filibuster to block it during a lame-duck session of Congress late last year. The Kentucky Republican argues that the government needs the powers to combat terrorist threats.

Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, the top two leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee said Thursday that the widespread monitoring of Verizon phone calls made in the United States has been going on for years, and that Congress is regularly briefed on it.

Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) also defended the National Security Agency’s request to the company for all the metadata about phone calls made within and from the United States.

“As far as I know, this is the exact three-month renewal of what has been in place for the past seven years,” Feinstein said. “This renewal is carried out by the [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court] under the business records section of the Patriot Act. Therefore it is lawful. It has been briefed to Congress.”

Chambliss said the report in the Guardian Wednesday was “nothing new.”

“This has been going on for seven years,” he said. “…every member of the United States Senate has been advised of this. To my knowledge there has not been any citizen who has registered a complaint. It has proved meritorious because we have collected significant information on bad guys, but only on bad guys, over the years.”

The Obama administration is defending the program, arguing that the policy is a vital tool in monitoring terrorists and has the approval of “all three branches of government,” according to a senior administration official.

“On its face, the order reprinted in the article does not allow the government to listen in on anyone’s telephone calls,” said the official, who asked not to be named. “The information acquired does not include the content of any communications or the name of any subscriber. It relates exclusively to metadata, such as a telephone number or the length of a call.”

However, Obama, speaking at the Justice Department, did not say the program would end -- only that the information collected would no longer be held by the NSA.

Obama did not offer his own plan for where the NSA phone records should be moved and said instead he would call on the attorney general and members of the intelligence community to recommend a transfer point by March 28 – when the collection program comes up for reauthorization.

The president’s directive also requires intelligence agencies to obtain approval from a FISA court – a secret U.S. court that governs surveillance of terrorist and foreign espionage targets - before accessing the records.

Obama’s directive follows the disclosure of the spy agency’s surveillance practices by former NSA contractor-turned-leaker Edward Snowden.

“While I am encouraged the president is addressing the NSA spying program because of pressure from Congress and the American people, I disappointed in the details,” Sen. Rand Paul, R-KY, said in a written statement.

Nevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller says significant policy questions still remain.

“I have concerns that requiring private companies to shoulder the burden for the NSA could simply shift privacy intrusions from the federal government to private companies,” he said. “Further discussions are needed in order to achieve a workable solution that protects Americans’ Fourth Amendment rights.”

Civil libertarians said Obama did not go far enough to protect privacy and prevent abuse.

Steven W. Hawkins, executive director of Amnesty International USA, said, ""President Obama's surveillance adjustments will be remembered as music on the Titanic unless his administration adopts deeper reforms.""

""Shifting the storage of information does not address the fundamental problem: the collection of mass personal data in the first place,"" Hawkins said in a statement.

There appeared to be some initial confusion about Congress' role in authorizing any changes. An administration official said Obama could codify the data transfer through an executive order, while some congressional aides said legislation would be required.

Congress would have to approve a proposal from the president that would establish a panel of outside attorneys who would consult with the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on new legal issues that arise. The White House says the panel would advocate for privacy and civil liberties as the court weighed requests for accessing the phone records.

Obama also announced tighter restrictions on spying on international leaders.

“The heads of state and government with whom we work closely, and on whose cooperation we depend, should feel confident that we are treating them as real partners,” Obama said. “The changes I've ordered do just that.”

Documents released by Snowden revealed that the U.S. was monitoring the communications of several foreign leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The revelations outraged Merkel as well as other leaders, and U.S. officials say the disclosures have damaged Obama's relations around the world.

Obama also said the government could no longer request data beyond two people away from the terrorist target.

He also said that ‘dozens’ of foreign leaders would be safe from NSA surveillance techniques but did not offer that protection to their advisers.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he would introduce legislation to create a special Senate committee to examine the issues and exercise congressional oversight.

""Recent disclosures of these activities and practices have caused grave damage to the United States,"" McCain said in a statement. ""They have harmed our relations with friends and allies and harmed our ability to combat threats to the United States. It is more important than ever for Congress to exercise effective oversight and, where necessary, to enact legislation to address these issues which are vital to American national security.""

After all , it fits the narrative of Big Government run amok , fueled lately by revelations that the Justice Department has been accessing reporters ’ phone records and the Internal Revenue Service has been subjecting tea party groups to extra scrutiny .
But since Wednesday night , when the British newspaper The Guardian posted the story , the flood of reactions from political players demonstrates both bipartisan support for and bipartisan opposition to the classified program . Instead , the split in opinion is centered more on where to draw the line between defending national security and protecting civil liberties .
Even though plenty of liberals are unhappy with the Obama administration over this and other actions taken in the name of national security ( see drone strikes abroad ) , they are hardly ready to abandon him . And across the political landscape , the continuing threat of terrorism is likely to mitigate any damage to the president ’ s job approval .
On Thursday , a key Republican came to the government ’ s defense over the “ phone snooping ” story . Rep. Mike Rogers ( R ) of Michigan , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , told reporters that the National Security Agency ( NSA ) program was instrumental recently in preventing a “ significant ” terrorism attack .
“ Within the last few years , this program was used to stop a terrorist attack in the United States , ” Congressman Rogers said . “ We know that . It ’ s important . It fills in a little seam that we have . ”
The White House has also been defending the program , calling it a “ critical tool . ”
“ Information of the sort described in the Guardian article has been a critical tool in protecting the nation from terrorist threats to the United States , as it allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities , particularly people located inside the United States , ” a senior administration official said in a statement Thursday morning .
Still , speaking to reporters Thursday afternoon on Air Force One , White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that privacy tradeoffs come into play when national security is at stake . And he said President Obama “ welcomes ” discussion of that balance .
The Guardian on Wednesday published an article revealing a government program requiring Verizon on an “ ongoing , daily basis ” to give the NSA information on all telephone calls in its systems , both within the United States and between the US and abroad . Accompanying the article was a top secret court order laying out the requirement . Verizon must provide “ metadata ” – such as phone numbers involved and duration of calls – but not the content of calls .
The order , granted by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , known as a FISA court , was granted on April 25 and ends on July 19 . Since the Guardian story broke , members of congressional intelligence committees have made clear that such an order has been in place for years , and that other phone companies face the same requirement . The program is authorized under Section 215 of the Patriot Act , the broad antiterrorism legislation that was signed into law right after 9/11 .
Still , plenty of political figures and groups from across the political spectrum – from former Vice President Al Gore to tea party groups -- have expressed outrage over the program .
`` In the digital era , privacy must be a priority . Is it just me , or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous ? '' the Democratic ex-vice president tweeted late Wednesday .
From the other end of the political spectrum , Mitt Kibbe , president of the tea party group Freedomworks , channeled populist outrage in his reaction .
“ We are witnessing the arrogance of the political elite , ” Mr. Kibbe said in a statement . “ The government feels it is entitled to know the minutiae of the lives of private citizens regardless of whether they are suspected or charged with a crime . ”
How or whether this latest revelation will affect Mr. Obama ’ s public support opinion is an open question . If nothing else , it has once again knocked the president off-message , on a day when he is in North Carolina talking education .

After the recent stories about the Justice Department and the IRS , Obama ’ s job approval rating has drifted downward , though it is not clear those two stories are the cause . An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday showed that 55 percent of Americans believe the IRS ’ s targeting actions raise doubts about the Obama administration ’ s honesty and integrity . But only 33 percent said Obama was “ totally ” or “ mainly ” responsible .
One thing is clear after the publication of the Guardian story : The Obama administration now has another leak of classified information to investigate . And the author of that story , Glenn Greenwald , should not be surprised to find his own phone records now subject to review by the Justice Department .","At first blush, the news report about the US government tracking data from Verizon about millions of phone calls, in the name of protecting national security, looks to be potentially explosive and politically damaging.

“Information of the sort described in the Guardian article has been a critical tool in protecting the nation from terrorist threats to the United States, as it allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities, particularly people located inside the United States,” a senior administration official said in a statement Thursday morning.

Still, speaking to reporters Thursday afternoon on Air Force One, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that privacy tradeoffs come into play when national security is at stake. And he said President Obama “welcomes” discussion of that balance.

The Guardian on Wednesday published an article revealing a government program requiring Verizon on an “ongoing, daily basis” to give the NSA information on all telephone calls in its systems, both within the United States and between the US and abroad. Accompanying the article was a top secret court order laying out the requirement. Verizon must provide “metadata” – such as phone numbers involved and duration of calls – but not the content of calls.

The order, granted by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, known as a FISA court, was granted on April 25 and ends on July 19. Since the Guardian story broke, members of congressional intelligence committees have made clear that such an order has been in place for years, and that other phone companies face the same requirement. The program is authorized under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, the broad antiterrorism legislation that was signed into law right after 9/11.

Still, plenty of political figures and groups from across the political spectrum – from former Vice President Al Gore to tea party groups -- have expressed outrage over the program.

""In the digital era, privacy must be a priority. Is it just me, or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous?"" the Democratic ex-vice president tweeted late Wednesday.

From the other end of the political spectrum, Mitt Kibbe, president of the tea party group Freedomworks, channeled populist outrage in his reaction.

“We are witnessing the arrogance of the political elite,” Mr. Kibbe said in a statement. “The government feels it is entitled to know the minutiae of the lives of private citizens regardless of whether they are suspected or charged with a crime.”

How or whether this latest revelation will affect Mr. Obama’s public support opinion is an open question. If nothing else, it has once again knocked the president off-message, on a day when he is in North Carolina talking education.

After the recent stories about the Justice Department and the IRS, Obama’s job approval rating has drifted downward, though it is not clear those two stories are the cause. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday showed that 55 percent of Americans believe the IRS’s targeting actions raise doubts about the Obama administration’s honesty and integrity. But only 33 percent said Obama was “totally” or “mainly” responsible.

One thing is clear after the publication of the Guardian story: The Obama administration now has another leak of classified information to investigate. And the author of that story, Glenn Greenwald, should not be surprised to find his own phone records now subject to review by the Justice Department.",www.csmonitor.com,center,Hq2xFZM1QSU1aS66

Edward Snowden isn't yet allowed to step outside the Moscow airport where he's been holed up for weeks, despite reports to the contrary, his Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, said Wednesday.

The former National Security Agency contractor, who admitted last month to revealing sweeping U.S. electronic surveillance programs to the news media, left Hong Kong for Moscow on June 23. Since then, he's been unable to leave the airport's transit area because the United States revoked his passport.

NSA surveillance programs brought to public light by Edward Snowden leaks
Intelligence official says problem was technological ; was not a case of `` overeager '' spying
The Obama administration on Wednesday declassified opinions from a secret court that oversees government surveillance showing the National Security Agency was broadly collecting domestic Internet communications of Americans and misrepresenting the scope of that effort to the court .
The three opinions include one from October 2011 by U.S. District Judge John Bates , who scolded government lawyers that the NSA had , for the third time in less than three years , belatedly acknowledged it was collecting more data than it was legally allowed to .
`` NSA acquires valuable information through its upstream collection , but not without substantial intrusions on Fourth Amendment protected interests , '' Bates wrote .
The focus of the opinion was the government 's admission that for three years , under its authority to monitor foreign communications , it had been collecting information beyond what it gets from Internet service providers , and included data that was entirely domestic .
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court estimated the mistaken collection of domestic data , including e-mails and other Internet activity of Americans , totaled 58,000 communications a year .

Opinions showed that the NSA was misrepresenting its effort to the special anti-terror court

NSA surveillance programs brought to public light by Edward Snowden leaks

Intelligence official says problem was technological; was not a case of ""overeager"" spying

The Obama administration on Wednesday declassified opinions from a secret court that oversees government surveillance showing the National Security Agency was broadly collecting domestic Internet communications of Americans and misrepresenting the scope of that effort to the court.

The three opinions include one from October 2011 by U.S. District Judge John Bates, who scolded government lawyers that the NSA had, for the third time in less than three years, belatedly acknowledged it was collecting more data than it was legally allowed to.

""NSA acquires valuable information through its upstream collection, but not without substantial intrusions on Fourth Amendment protected interests,"" Bates wrote.

The focus of the opinion was the government's admission that for three years, under its authority to monitor foreign communications, it had been collecting information beyond what it gets from Internet service providers, and included data that was entirely domestic.

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court estimated the mistaken collection of domestic data, including e-mails and other Internet activity of Americans, totaled 58,000 communications a year.

The administration also released documents provided to Congress to persuade lawmakers to reauthorize its surveillance authorities.

The agency has come under pressure from lawmakers of both parties over the sweeping nature of its secret data collection, most recently surveillance that captures telephone metadata related to communications to and from the United States.

That program and the one addressed in the document release on Wednesday were brought to public light through leaks to media outlets by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who fled the United States and is now in Russia under temporary asylum. He faces espionage charges.

Their exposure also has generated concern from privacy groups and libertarians.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, who has proposed legislation aimed at reforming certain provisions of the Patriot Act related to the FISA Court, welcomed the newest development.

""Today's release of documents by the Director of National Intelligence begins to appropriately draw back the curtain on the secret law of government surveillance, and they also underscore the need for increased oversight and stronger protections for Americans' privacy,"" he said in a statement.

The NSA is supposed to be targeting foreign communications, such as e-mail addresses it believes relate to foreign intelligence, that have to do with potential terrorism investigations.

The NSA said it made mistakes because of the way data was collected. It couldn't separate information that was entirely domestic.

Obama argued insistently that the outrage many Americans and foreigners have expressed over U.S. surveillance practices is largely misplaced, but went on to declare that the U.S. will take a series of major — even unprecedented — steps to overhaul the way it gathers information on telephone calls and internet communications at home and abroad.

“We cannot unilaterally disarm our intelligence agencies,” the president declared, as he unveiled what an aide described as “very significant reforms” to the practices he defended.

Here are POLITICO’s takeways from Obama’s long-awaited speech:

Proposing a big change, but not how to get there

The most attention-grabbing announcement in Obama’s address was his call to end the NSA’s collection of information on vast numbers of phone calls made to, from or within the U.S.

But his description of what the U.S. should do instead actually left the future shape of the government’s phone-call-tracking efforts even murkier than it was before. Obama mentioned two widely-discussed possibilities — having individual phone companies keep the call data or forming a consortium that would pool the data. But he also added a new option: using other intelligence agency abilities to try to run down leads now traced through the so-called 215 program.

Adding to the muddle: Obama expressed such significant misgivings about the key alternatives that it seemed doubtful he’ll adopt them.

“Relying solely on the records of multiple providers, for example, could require companies to alter their procedures in ways that raise new privacy concerns,” Obama said. “On the other hand, any third party maintaining a single, consolidated database would be carrying out what is essentially a government function but with more expense, more legal ambiguity, potentially less accountability — all of which would have a doubtful impact on increasing public confidence that their privacy is being protected.”

Some intelligence experts said reconstructing the current system in the private sector will be somewhere between difficult and impossible.

“I don’t think they’re going to figure out a way to keep it as well as its kept at NSA in all dimensions: privacy, accuracy, aglity, breadth and depth,” said former NSA director Michael Hayden.

Hayden also questioned the stopgap reform the president said he’d institute: vowing to go to a court before searching the data.

“I am really taken aback by requirement to go the court before you query the data,” he said. “That just feels like 9/10 to me.”

“The president was stronger on principle than prescription,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.)

The vagueness also left some reform advocates suggesting Obama wasn’t really ending the controversial program, but just changing hands. Obama aides resisted the notion that he was punting on the key issues.

Obama spent much of the speech mounting an aggressive defense of the NSA and of the righteousness of the use of surveillance.

“In an extraordinarily difficult job — one in which actions are second-guessed, success is unreported, and failure can be catastrophic — the men and women of the intelligence community, including the NSA, consistently follow protocols designed to protect the privacy of ordinary people,” he declared. “What sustains those who work at NSA and our other intelligence agencies through all these pressures is the knowledge that their professionalism and dedication play a central role in the defense of our nation.”

Ex-official: U.S. may move quickly to bring charges against Snowden, request extradition

House members from both political parties Tuesday raised concerns and tough questions for administration officials who briefed the entire chamber on the government's recently revealed top secret surveillance programs.

While Peter King, a Republican member of the House Homeland Security Committee, complimented the briefing team, some of his colleagues said some questions remain unanswered.

""I was very impressed by it,"" said King, of New York. ""I thought they laid out all the protections (which) are there, and I support what they are doing.""

But Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, said the briefing ""raises plenty of more questions that all members I'm sure are going to be asking.""

Senior officials from the Justice Department, FBI, National Security Agency and Office of the Director of National Intelligence attended the closed meeting for all House members, not just those who are in leadership posts or on the Intelligence Committee.

He says he just wanted the public to know what the government was doing. ""Even if you're not doing anything wrong, you're being watched and recorded,"" he said. Snowden has been granted temporary asylum in Russia after initially fleeing to Hong Kong. He has been charged with three felony counts, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act, over the leaks. Hide Caption 1 of 15 Photos: Notable leakers and whistle-blowers Military analyst Daniel Ellsberg leaked the 7,000-page Pentagon Papers in 1971. The top-secret documents revealed that senior American leaders, including three presidents, knew the Vietnam War was an unwinnable, tragic quagmire. Further, they showed that the government had lied to Congress and the public about the progress of the war. Ellsberg surrendered to authorities and was charged as a spy. During his trial, the court learned that President Richard Nixon's administration had embarked on a campaign to discredit Ellsberg, illegally wiretapping him and breaking into his psychiatrist's office. All charges against him were dropped. Since then he has lived a relatively quiet life as a respected author and lecturer. Hide Caption 2 of 15 Photos: Notable leakers and whistle-blowers Starting in 1932, the U.S. Public Health Service studied untreated syphilis in black men who thought they were getting free health care. The patients weren't told of their affliction or sufficiently treated. Peter Buxtun, who worked for the Public Health Service, relayed information about the Tuskegee syphilis experiment to a reporter in 1972, which halted the 40-year study. His testimony at congressional hearings led to an overhaul of the Health, Education and Welfare rules concerning work with human subjects. A class-action lawsuit was settled out-of-court for $10 million, with the U.S. government promising free medical care to survivors and their families. Here, participants talk with a study coordinator. Hide Caption 3 of 15 Photos: Notable leakers and whistle-blowers In 2005, retired deputy FBI director Mark Felt revealed himself to be the whistle-blower ""Deep Throat"" in the Watergate scandal. He anonymously assisted Washington Post reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward with many of their stories about the Nixon administration's cover-up after the June 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters. The stories sparked a congressional investigation that eventually led to President Nixon's resignation in 1974. The Post won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage. Felt was convicted on unrelated conspiracy charges in 1980 and eventually pardoned by President Ronald Reagan before slipping into obscurity for the next quarter-century. He died in 2008 at age 95.

He claimed that Brown & Williamson knowingly used additives that were carcinogenic and addictive and spent millions covering it up. He also testified in a landmark case in Mississippi that resulted in a $246 billion settlement from the tobacco industry. Wigand has received public recognition for his actions and continues to crusade against Big Tobacco. He was portrayed by Russell Crowe in the 1999 film "" The Insider .""

His efforts eventually led to a 1997 investigation that found lab agents produced inaccurate and scientifically flawed testimony in major cases, including the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center bombings. The Justice Department recommended major reforms but also criticized Whitehurst for ""overstated and incendiary"" allegations. He also faced disciplinary action for refusing to cooperate with an investigation into how some of his allegations were leaked to a magazine. After a yearlong paid suspension he left the bureau in 1998 with a settlement worth more than $1.16 million.

The letter accused the bureau of deliberately undermining requests to look into Zacarias Moussaoui , the only person convicted in the United States of playing a role in the attacks. She testified in front of Congress and the 9/11 Commission about the FBI's mishandling of information.

More than 4,000 Enron employees lost their jobs, and many also lost their life savings, when the energy giant declared bankruptcy in 2001. Investors lost billions of dollars.

Darby eventually alerted the U.S. military command, triggering an investigation and global outrage when the scandal came to light in 2004. Graner was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his part in the abuse. He was released in 2011 after serving 6½ years of his sentence.

Details on millions of American phone calls . Records of e-mails , texts , video chats and more from overseas . And pulsing beneath it all , a worrying concern there 's more to the government 's surveillance programs than what 's been acknowledged .
All the revelations about U.S. surveillance programs in recent days have put the government on the defensive , set privacy advocates howling for reform and left millions of Americans somewhere in the middle , wondering what the news means to them and what , if anything , they should do about it .
The man at the top says they should just relax .
`` Nobody is listening to your telephone calls , '' President Barack Obama said Friday as he tried to reassure Americans who have had to digest a dizzying array of revelations in the past few days . Among them :
-- U.S. intelligence agencies are , in fact , collecting details on just about every telephone call placed each day in the United States , U.S. officials confirmed . And they 've been doing it for seven years , a senator added .

-- They 're also monitoring the online activities of at least some overseas customers of Google , Microsoft , Yahoo , Apple and other providers of popular online services .
-- And they may be scooping up credit card data , as well , The Wall Street Journal reported Friday , citing people familiar with the operations of the National Security Agency .
U.S. officials say the phone-call data is n't looked at unless investigators sense a tie to terror , and only then on the authority of a judge . And officials say analysts are forbidden from slurping up the Internet activity of American citizens or residents , even when they travel overseas .
The Wall Street Journal said it was n't clear whether the credit card monitoring was a continuing program or a one-off , and did n't say what analysts did with the information .
Analysts say such information can be analyzed using powerful computers and sophisticated software to detect personal habits and links among groups of people , and to build detailed dossiers on the activities of everyday people .
The government says it is not doing that , but privacy activists say even the limited amount of data collection U.S. officials have acknowledged poses huge threats .
`` The problem is its massive surveillance , '' said author James Bamford , who has written extensively about NSA surveillance programs . `` We went through this problem with the Bush administration , warrantless eavesdropping . It was an outrage that government can turn the surveillance on average citizens without any suspicion whatsoever . ''
`` And here , this is an enormous increase in that , '' he said on CNN 's `` Erin Burnett OutFront '' on Thursday . `` This is communications that are local . These are n't even international communications at all . These are communications from people speaking to their neighbors , people that are under no suspicion whatsoever . ''
The American Civil Liberties Union described the programs as `` beyond Orwellian . ''
And the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which has been fighting the government over surveillance programs for years , is urging a full-scale investigation with an eye toward stopping the surveillance programs for good and reining in U.S. intelligence agencies with new laws and a demand for public oversight .
`` The revelations not only confirmed what EFF has long alleged , they went even further and honestly , we 're still reeling , '' the privacy organization said Friday on its blog .
The revelations began Wednesday , when a British newspaper , the Guardian , published a top secret order from an intelligence court that required Verizon Business Network Services to give telephone records detailing the time , location and telephone numbers involved in domestic calls from April 25 to July 19 .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation and other analysts said similar orders undoubtedly are in effect for other companies .
The order does n't allow authorities to listen in on the calls .
National Intelligence Director James Clapper , who denied during a March 12 congressional hearing that the government was engaged in mass data-collection practices involving Americans , blasted the Guardian report , saying it `` omits key information '' regarding `` safeguards that protect privacy and civil liberties . ''
He said the program operates within the law , respects Americans ' privacy and is crucial to preventing attacks . Most of the records are never looked at , and those that are can be reviewed only with judicial approval , he said .
`` The collection is broad in scope because more narrow collection would limit our ability to screen for and identify terrorism-related communications . Acquiring this information allows us to make connections related to terrorist activities over time , '' he said .
Clapper said both Congress and courts have reviewed and authorized the law .
But several congressional critics have complained that the government has made significant use of broad interpretations made in secret by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , the judicial body charged with overseeing the government 's use of the law .
`` These reports are deeply concerning and raise questions about whether our constitutional rights are secure , '' Patriot Act co-author Rep. James Sensenbrenner wrote in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder .
Sensenbrenner , a Wisconsin Republican , said he was `` extremely disturbed by what appears to be an overbroad interpretation of the act . ''
A day after the initial Guardian report on the Verizon court order , the Guardian and the Washington Post published reports alleging the NSA is able to tap into data held by some of the world 's biggest online services companies as it hunts for terrorists .
The program , which the newspapers said is called PRISM , reportedly allows NSA analysts access to computers at Microsoft , Google and other companies to extract details of customer activities , including `` audio and video chats , photographs , e-mails , documents '' and other materials , The Post reported .
The Post reported PRISM , founded in 2007 , has become the leading source of raw material for the NSA .
Clapper did not directly confirm the program 's existence but acknowledged that the Post and Guardian stories `` refer to collection of communications pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act . ''
That section of the law authorizes intelligence agencies to collect information on non-U.S. residents as part of efforts to gather foreign intelligence .
He said the program can not be used to target anyone inside the United States or U.S. citizens anywhere in the world and includes `` extensive procedures , specifically approved by the court , to ensure that only non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. are targeted , and that minimize the acquisition , retention and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about U.S . persons . ''
`` Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable foreign intelligence information we collect and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats , '' Clapper said Thursday .
`` The unauthorized disclosure of information about this important and entirely legal program is reprehensible and risks important protections for the security of Americans , '' he said .
While the Post initially reported that the companies `` knowingly participate '' in the program , it later updated the online version of its story to remove that contention .
In its stead , the newspaper described a classified report indicating that NSA analysts were allowed to send `` content tasking instructions directly to equipment installed at company-controlled locations . ''
AT & T , Verizon and Comcast declined to comment on the report Friday . Time Warner said it was unfamiliar with PRISM .
Microsoft said Thursday that it does n't participate in any national security data gathering program . Facebook and Google said they do not give government agencies direct access to their servers .
And Apple spokesman Steve Dowling said his company has never heard of the program .
While controversial to some , the programs also have plenty of backers . Obama noted that Congress has repeatedly endorsed the programs on a bipartisan basis .
Conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham , a Republican from South Carolina , and Sen. Dianne Feinstein , a California liberal , both believe the methods are necessary to prevent terrorism .
`` Terrorists will come after us if they can , '' Feinstein said , `` and the only thing that we have to deter this is good intelligence to understand that a plot has been hatched and to get there before they get to us . ''
Graham said that as a Verizon customer , `` it does n't bother me one bit for the National Security Agency to have my phone number . ''
After the 2001 terrorist attacks , President George W. Bush 's administration authorized the NSA to conduct wireless surveillance of international phone calls that included at least one person believed to be an al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist .
Another Bush-era program , the `` total information awareness '' program , would have combined vast government databases into a data-mining effort to look for suspicious patterns revealing potential criminal or terrorist activity . It was official dropped amid intense outcry from civil libertarians .
Also , in 2003 , a former AT & T technician made a splash when he alleged that the telecom was routing all Internet traffic into a special NSA-controlled room in San Francisco .
Last year , Bamford wrote in Wired magazine about a huge data center being built for the NSA in Utah . Officials have officially labeled the center as part of the nation 's effort to fight cyberattacks , but the Wired article , citing former NSA officials and others , said it was part of a huge surveillance program that would take in and analyze untold amounts of data .
The reports have increased scrutiny of Obama 's record on balancing citizens ' right to privacy and the government 's efforts to combat terrorism .
Days after taking office in 2009 , Obama vowed , `` Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency . '' But on Thursday , the left-leaning Huffington Post on its home page conflated an image of Obama with one of his predecessor , Bush , in a move to criticize the secret surveillance both administrations have been accused of .
A New York Times editorial said `` the administration has now lost all credibility '' when it comes to overreaching in the name of fighting terrorism .
Obama said Friday that he entered office skeptical of the programs . But after thoroughly vetting them and adding additional safeguards -- which he did not identify -- Obama said he concluded they were worthwhile .
`` My assessment and my team 's assessment was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks , '' he said . `` And the modest encroachments on privacy that are involved in getting phone numbers or duration without a name attached and without looking at content , that on net it was worth us doing . ''
Obama said he welcomed debate on the issue , but said some compromises are going to be necessary , no matter what .

The report , based on secret NSA documents leaked by former contractor Edward Snowden , appears to show the agency has used weak restrictions on its overseas activities to exploit major U.S. companies ' data to a far greater extent than realized .
Previously reported programs included those that allowed easy searches of Google 's , Yahoo 's and other Internet giants ' material based on court orders . But since the interception in the newly disclosed effort , code named MUSCULAR , occurs outside the United States , there is no oversight by the secret intelligence court .
The Post said the operation gained access to a cable or switch that relayed the traffic through an unnamed telecommunications provider .
`` We are outraged at the lengths to which the government seems to have gone to intercept data from our private fiber networks , and it underscores the need for urgent reform , '' said Google chief legal officer David Drummond . Google said it had not been aware of the program , although it recently began speeding its efforts to encrypt internal traffic .
Like other companies , Google and Yahoo constantly send data over leased and shared or exclusive international fiber-optic telecommunication lines as they synchronize information .
The newly disclosed program , operated jointly with the United Kingdom 's Government Communications Headquarters , or GCHQ , amassed 181 million records in one recent 30-day span , according to one document reported by the Post . It could not be learned how much of that included material from U.S. residents , how the agency redacted data on them or how much of the information was retained .
An NSA spokesperson said in a statement the suggestion in the Post article that the agency relies on a presidential order on foreign intelligence gathering to skirt domestic restrictions imposed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and other laws `` is not true . ''
`` The assertion that we collect vast quantities of U.S. persons ' data from this type of collection is also not true , '' the statement said . `` NSA is a foreign intelligence agency . And we 're focused on discovering and developing intelligence about valid foreign intelligence targets only . ''
Asked at an event in Washington about the latest report , NSA Director General Keith Alexander said that he had not read it but that the agency did not have unfettered access to the U.S. companies ' servers .

Lee, Sigal Samuel, Terry Nguyen, Rebecca Jennings, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz, Theodore Schleifer","Recent debates over US government spying have focused on one specific program : the National Security Agency 's bulk collection of Americans ' telephone records — and the Patriot Act provision that supplied the program 's legal justification . From that perspective , the partial expiration of the Patriot Act a week ago and the subsequent passage of surveillance reform legislation might seem like a decisive victory against mass surveillance .
But the surveillance debate is actually a lot bigger than the phone records program and the Patriot Act . The NSA has other spying programs with other legal foundations . And the USA Freedom Act , which President Obama signed on Tuesday , does n't do anything to rein them in .
On Friday , I talked to John Napier Tye , a former State Department official who resigned last year over what he regards as unconstitutional surveillance by the US federal government . He sees the USA Freedom Act as `` a small step in the right direction , '' but he 's hoping the next step will be a broader debate about other ways the US government spies on innocent Americans .
Tye says the most intrusive NSA programs are based on an obscure executive order
Most people have heard about the Patriot Act , which was signed just weeks after the 9/11 attacks , and was reformed this week by the USA Freedom Act . But Tye argues the real action is elsewhere .
`` You have to keep in mind that most NSA collection on Americans was not under the Patriot Act . It was under other legal authorities . And none of that surveillance is affected by this new law , '' he says . `` When you think about all the collection that the NSA has been doing on Americans , a small percentage — 5 or 10 percent , maybe less — was under the Patriot Act . ''
Tye points to two other sources of authority for government spying . One is the 2008 FISA Amendments Act , which is the legal basis for a controversial NSA program called PRISM that collects private data from major internet companies like Google and Facebook . The other is Executive Order 12333 , a Reagan-era directive that has become the basis for a lot of NSA spying .
Tye says that EO 12333 is `` an executive order , it 's not a statute . It was never passed by Congress . It was originally issued by President Reagan in 1981 and has been amended several times since then — including by George W . Bush . ''
A huge amount of our data is collected : Gmails and Yahoo messages , Facebook messages , Apple iMessages
EO 12333 `` gives a very broad grant of authority to intelligence agencies to do all kinds of things , '' Tye says . `` There 's one section in there that allows the NSA to collect data on US persons as part of a lawful foreign intelligence investigation . That provision is being used to collect a huge amount of Americans ' communications and data . ''
When the government collects information overseas , it is n't bound by most US surveillance laws . The NSA has reserved the right to `` incidentally '' collect Americans ' private communications overseas so long as Americans are not the target of a particular surveillance effort . But Tye argues that this is a huge loophole in practice .
`` I do n't think most Americans understand that almost all of their internet and phone data is either stored on backup servers overseas or transits outside of our borders , '' he says . `` A huge amount of our data is collected under this authority outside the borders of the US — Gmails and Yahoo messages , Facebook messages , Apple iMessages , Twitter , every service you can think of . ''
Tye was briefed on NSA spying after the Snowden disclosures
Tye says he has firsthand knowledge of the extent of NSA spying programs . That 's because he was an official in the State Department 's Bureau of Democracy , Human Rights , and Labor in 2013 when Edward Snowden 's revelations became public .
`` My jobs was internet freedom , promoting free and open internet around the world , '' Tye says . `` When the Snowden leaks happened in June of 2013 , I was not surprised . I knew that a lot of stuff had been happening . I knew that a lot of surveillance was going on that no one knew about . And it did n't surprise me that this was finally front-page news . ''
Congress should take a more active role in overseeing executive branch activity
Tye says that after the Snowden leaks , `` part of my job was to help develop responses to initiatives within the UN Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly by Germany , Brazil , and other countries that were very concerned with online privacy . To be able to properly negotiate those efforts , I was briefed on the scope of US intelligence practices . In two different classified briefings , one in the fall of 2013 and one in the first part of 2014 , I learned about activities under 12333 . ''
Tye believed these programs were unconstitutional and began filing complaints inside the government about them . He met with the intelligence committees in both the House and the Senate and filed complaints with the inspectors general of both the State Department and the National Security Agency . He says none of them were very interested in the issue .
So last summer , Tye quit his job and went public with his concerns in an op-ed for the Washington Post . He says he ran the op-ed through government censors to make sure it did n't disclose any classified information . Tye has spent the last year at the public interest group Avaaz and is now starting his own law firm that will focus on civil rights and human rights issues .
Tye would like President Obama to unilaterally revise Executive Order 12333 to better protect the privacy of Americans . If Obama does n't , Tye would like Congress to hold hearings on the issue . `` I think that Congress should take a more active role in overseeing executive branch activity under 12333 , '' Tye says . `` Congress should hold hearings and find out what protections really exist for Americans and how much our data is being collected . ''
He also favors reforms to the FISA Amendments Act , which was passed by Congress in 2008 . Whereas some provisions of the Patriot Act were set to expire this year — and have now been renewed until 2019 — the FISA Amendments Act is permanent . The most controversial part of the FISA Amendments Act is Section 702 , which allows warrantless surveillance to collect Americans ' communications so long as the target is a foreigner located overseas .
`` Under Section 702 , the NSA is collecting a lot of stuff inside the United States that 's nominally targeting foreigners but in fact is scooping up innocent communications from hundreds of millions of Americans , '' Tye says . Even worse , `` the FBI has access to that database and can search it for domestic criminal reasons . So the purpose of the law nominally was to allow the NSA to conduct foreign intelligence investigations . But as it 's currently being used , the FBI is using this data for domestic criminal investigations . The protections that we normally want in place for domestic criminal investigations are not necessarily there .

Some say the program is key to fighting terrorism and includes oversight
The program was used to stop `` terrorist plots '' on U.S. soil , Sen. Feinstein says
Critics say it 's overreach , with Al Gore calling it `` obscenely outrageous ''
That 's the question politicians in Washington , and millions of citizens around the United States , asked Thursday thanks to a jolting report suggesting the government has been collecting millions of Americans ' phone records .
FBI Direct Robert Mueller will be asked about the matter -- revealed after a British newspaper , the Guardian , published a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) court order that applied to phone data from Verizon -- when he appears next week before the House Judiciary Committee . The panel 's chairman Bob Goodlatte , R-Virginia , issued a statement Thursday saying he was `` very concerned that the Department of Justice may have abused the intent of the law , and we will investigate . ''
The report will also be the subject of an upcoming classified briefing by Attorney General Eric Holder to the Senate Appropriations Committee . Its chairman , Sen. Barbara Mikulski , is calling for a similar closed-door briefing for the entire U.S. Senate .
When she read the news Thursday morning , the Maryland Democrat said , `` It was like , 'Oh , God , not one more thing ... where we 're trying to protect America and then it looks like we 're spying . ' ''
An author of the Patriot Act -- the legislation used to justify the program -- added he is `` extremely disturbed by what appears to be an overbroad interpretation of the act . ''
`` These reports are deeply concerning and raise questions about whether our constitutional rights are secure , '' Rep. James Sensenbrenner , R-Wisconsin , wrote in a letter to Holder .
But not everyone in the nation 's capital is outraged or even concerned . Some say the real travesty would be if the program , which they describe as valuable , is halted .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein , chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said the Guardian story refers to a `` three-month renewal of what has been the case for the past seven years '' -- so that while the uproar may be new , the program is not . In that time , it 's helped to disrupt `` terrorist plots '' on U.S. soil , she said .
`` It is lawful , '' the California Democrat insisted . `` It has been briefed by Congress . ''
Rep. Mike Rogers ( R-Michigan ) and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger ( D-Maryland ) , two key members of the House Intelligence Committee , both stressed that `` this important collection tool does not allow the government to eavesdrop '' and that it is routinely reviewed by Congress .
White House spokesman Josh Earnest also made those points , adding President Barack Obama `` put in place a stronger regime of oversight '' when he took office . He further stressed the importance of ensuring `` we have the tools we need to confront the threat posted by terrorists ( and to ) protect the homeland . ''
JUST WATCHED Report : U.S. phone records go to the NSA Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Report : U.S. phone records go to the NSA 01:56
`` That is his top priority , '' Earnest said of domestic security . `` But ... we need to balance that priority with the need to protect civil liberties and constitutional rights of American people . And that is the subject of a worthy debate . ''
In 2006 , it was reported the National Security Agency was secretly collecting telephone records in an effort to root out terror plots .
`` Verizon 's wireless and wireline companies did not provide to NSA customer records or call data , local or otherwise , '' the company said at the time
Like the FBI and the NSA , Verizon declined comment to the media Thursday on the Guardian report . But company Vice President Randy Milch , in a note to employees , did say the newspaper 's story may spur the company to respond in defiance of a promise of secrecy .
The newspaper published the four-page , top-secret government order requiring `` originating and terminating '' phone numbers plus the location , time and duration of calls from the communications giant . It lets the FBI and NSA to obtain the records from April 25 to July 19 .
The order applies to Verizon Business Network Services , an operation not described on the company 's website . Its scope was not immediately clear , though the Guardian claimed `` millions of U.S. customers of Verizon '' were affected by the collection of information `` regardless of whether they are suspected of wrongdoing . ''
In his letter to Verizon employees , Milch said that his company would not provide the contents of any communications `` or the name , address or financial information of a subscriber or customer . ''
An Obama administration official said any such order would relate `` exclusively to metadata , such as a telephone number or the length of a call . ''
This kind of information `` allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities , '' the unnamed official said in a statement to media .
Controversy over the Guardian report comes as the White House fends off privacy complaints on other fronts as well . The administration is under fire following revelations the Justice Department seized two months of phone records from Associated Press reporters and editors -- something done as part of an investigation into leaks of classified information .
Plus , the Washington Post and the Guardian reported that U.S. intelligence has a broad secret data mining program that allows access to central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies -- among them Microsoft , Yahoo , Google , Facebook and Apple -- to extract e-mail , photos and other private consumer communications .
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper challenged the Post and Guardian reports in a statement Thursday night , saying `` they contain numerous inaccuracies . '' Specifically , he emphasized the section of the law tied to that reported program `` can not be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen , any other U.S. person or anyone located within the United States . ''
In statements on that and reports about collecting phone data , Clapper also called out those behind the apparent leaks -- saying it `` will have an impact on the behavior of our adversaries and make it more difficult for us to understand their intentions . ''
Speaking specifically about collecting personal phone records , privacy advocates called the practice perilous and claimed it gives authorities access to information of many Americans who are n't terrorists . In fact , they might not necessarily be Verizon customers , and similar orders might also apply to other telecommunications companies .
`` There is no indication that this order to Verizon was unique or novel , '' said the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which fights to protect privacy .
`` It is very likely that business records orders like this exist for every major American telecommunication company , meaning that , if you make calls in the United States , the NSA has those records . And this has been going on for at least seven years , and probably longer . ''
The American Civil Liberties Union called it `` beyond Orwellian ( in allowing ) basic democratic rights ( to be ) surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies . ''
The Center for Constitutional Rights blasted it as `` the broadest surveillance order to ever had been issued : It requires no level of suspicion . ''
Many in President Barack Obama 's own party spoke forcefully against it as well .
Three Democratic representatives -- John Conyers of Michigan , Jerrold Nadler of New York and Robert Scott of Virginia -- said the program is `` highly problematic and reveals serious flaws in the scope and application of the '' Patriot Act .
`` ( The revelations ) confirm our fears -- that the law would be distorted to allow for ongoing , indiscriminate collection of data , '' they wrote .

Some say the program is key to fighting terrorism and includes oversight

The program was used to stop ""terrorist plots"" on U.S. soil, Sen. Feinstein says

Critics say it's overreach, with Al Gore calling it ""obscenely outrageous""

Frightening government overreach or valuable law enforcement tool?

That's the question politicians in Washington, and millions of citizens around the United States, asked Thursday thanks to a jolting report suggesting the government has been collecting millions of Americans' phone records.

FBI Direct Robert Mueller will be asked about the matter -- revealed after a British newspaper, the Guardian , published a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court order that applied to phone data from Verizon -- when he appears next week before the House Judiciary Committee. The panel's chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, issued a statement Thursday saying he was ""very concerned that the Department of Justice may have abused the intent of the law, and we will investigate.""

The report will also be the subject of an upcoming classified briefing by Attorney General Eric Holder to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Its chairman, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, is calling for a similar closed-door briefing for the entire U.S. Senate.

When she read the news Thursday morning, the Maryland Democrat said, ""It was like, 'Oh, God, not one more thing ... where we're trying to protect America and then it looks like we're spying.'""

An author of the Patriot Act -- the legislation used to justify the program -- added he is ""extremely disturbed by what appears to be an overbroad interpretation of the act.""

""These reports are deeply concerning and raise questions about whether our constitutional rights are secure,"" Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, wrote in a letter to Holder.

But not everyone in the nation's capital is outraged or even concerned. Some say the real travesty would be if the program, which they describe as valuable, is halted.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the Guardian story refers to a ""three-month renewal of what has been the case for the past seven years"" -- so that while the uproar may be new, the program is not. In that time, it's helped to disrupt ""terrorist plots"" on U.S. soil, she said.

""It is lawful,"" the California Democrat insisted. ""It has been briefed by Congress.""

Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Michigan) and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Maryland), two key members of the House Intelligence Committee, both stressed that ""this important collection tool does not allow the government to eavesdrop"" and that it is routinely reviewed by Congress.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest also made those points, adding President Barack Obama ""put in place a stronger regime of oversight"" when he took office. He further stressed the importance of ensuring ""we have the tools we need to confront the threat posted by terrorists (and to) protect the homeland.""

JUST WATCHED Report: U.S. phone records go to the NSA Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Report: U.S. phone records go to the NSA 01:56

""That is his top priority,"" Earnest said of domestic security. ""But ... we need to balance that priority with the need to protect civil liberties and constitutional rights of American people. And that is the subject of a worthy debate.""

What's been happening, and for how long?

In 2006, it was reported the National Security Agency was secretly collecting telephone records in an effort to root out terror plots.

""Verizon's wireless and wireline companies did not provide to NSA customer records or call data, local or otherwise,"" the company said at the time

Like the FBI and the NSA, Verizon declined comment to the media Thursday on the Guardian report. But company Vice President Randy Milch, in a note to employees, did say the newspaper's story may spur the company to respond in defiance of a promise of secrecy.

The newspaper published the four-page, top-secret government order requiring ""originating and terminating"" phone numbers plus the location, time and duration of calls from the communications giant. It lets the FBI and NSA to obtain the records from April 25 to July 19.

The order applies to Verizon Business Network Services, an operation not described on the company's website. Its scope was not immediately clear, though the Guardian claimed ""millions of U.S. customers of Verizon"" were affected by the collection of information ""regardless of whether they are suspected of wrongdoing.""

In his letter to Verizon employees, Milch said that his company would not provide the contents of any communications ""or the name, address or financial information of a subscriber or customer.""

An Obama administration official said any such order would relate ""exclusively to metadata, such as a telephone number or the length of a call.""

This kind of information ""allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities,"" the unnamed official said in a statement to media.

Controversy over the Guardian report comes as the White House fends off privacy complaints on other fronts as well. The administration is under fire following revelations the Justice Department seized two months of phone records from Associated Press reporters and editors -- something done as part of an investigation into leaks of classified information.

Plus, the Washington Post and the Guardian reported that U.S. intelligence has a broad secret data mining program that allows access to central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies -- among them Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook and Apple -- to extract e-mail, photos and other private consumer communications.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper challenged the Post and Guardian reports in a statement Thursday night, saying ""they contain numerous inaccuracies."" Specifically, he emphasized the section of the law tied to that reported program ""cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen, any other U.S. person or anyone located within the United States.""

In statements on that and reports about collecting phone data, Clapper also called out those behind the apparent leaks -- saying it ""will have an impact on the behavior of our adversaries and make it more difficult for us to understand their intentions.""

Speaking specifically about collecting personal phone records, privacy advocates called the practice perilous and claimed it gives authorities access to information of many Americans who aren't terrorists. In fact, they might not necessarily be Verizon customers, and similar orders might also apply to other telecommunications companies.

""There is no indication that this order to Verizon was unique or novel,"" said the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which fights to protect privacy.

""It is very likely that business records orders like this exist for every major American telecommunication company, meaning that, if you make calls in the United States, the NSA has those records. And this has been going on for at least seven years, and probably longer.""

Al Gore: 'Secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous'

This group is hardly alone.

The American Civil Liberties Union called it ""beyond Orwellian (in allowing) basic democratic rights (to be) surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies.""

The Center for Constitutional Rights blasted it as ""the broadest surveillance order to ever had been issued: It requires no level of suspicion.""

Many in President Barack Obama's own party spoke forcefully against it as well.

Three Democratic representatives -- John Conyers of Michigan, Jerrold Nadler of New York and Robert Scott of Virginia -- said the program is ""highly problematic and reveals serious flaws in the scope and application of the"" Patriot Act.

""(The revelations) confirm our fears -- that the law would be distorted to allow for ongoing, indiscriminate collection of data,"" they wrote.

Sen. Mark Udall, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, described the program as ""the kind of government overreach I've said Americans would find shocking.""

One of them: former Vice President Al Gore.

""Is it just me, or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous?"" the 2000 Democratic presidential nominee wrote on Twitter.

Senator says ending program would be 'catastrophic'

Opinions were also strong on the other side of the debate.

""Terrorists will come after us if they can, and the only thing that we have to deter this is good intelligence to understand that a plot has been hatched and to get there before they get to us,"" said Feinstein.

Her intelligence committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, concurred in stating the program has let authorities gather ""significant information on bad guys and only on bad guys over the years.""

Former FBI Assistant Director Tom Fuentes, a CNN contributor, said that if a phone number comes up that's linked to someone suspicious, they can go back and get information tied to that number.

While Snowden may be hoping for a life forever on the run, he’ll have to navigate a labyrinthine international legal system with little precedent for Americans accused of committing political crimes.

But for all the harm that government officials have warned of, legal experts expect that the charges he’d face would carry maximum penalties of 10 years apiece.

Snowden’s situation is different from that of Bradley Manning, the army private now on trial at Fort Meade, Md. Manning faces life imprisonment for the huge data dump he provided to WikiLeaks, but as a member of the military, he’s being tried via court-martial. And Snowden didn’t sell the secrets or give them to a foreign power, so he won’t be subject to the huge penalties of the espionage laws, as Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames were when they were caught spying.

The Justice Department can charge Snowden, indict him and leave the charge sitting out there — but to go beyond that, he would need to be brought back to U.S. soil.

Like many extradition treaties, the one between the United States and Hong Kong contains an exception for political crimes, a category Snowden’s admitted acts would almost certainly fall under. Even so, Hong Kong could decide simply to expel him without turning him over to American authorities.

nsa,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/19/orsi-no-greater-act-of-loyalty-to-the-constitution/,ORSI: No greater act of loyalty to the Constitution,2013-12-19,Michael P. Orsi,"On Monday , U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon declared that the bulk of the National Security Agency ’ s collection of Americans ’ telephone records is likely to violate the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution ’ s ban on unreasonable search .
Some legal experts contend that this may be the first step in a march to the Supreme Court . It may also be the beginning of the rehabilitation of Edward Snowden , the former NSA contractor who disclosed almost 200,000 classified documents to the press . Mr. Snowden has obtained limited asylum in Russia to avoid prosecution in the United States for espionage . In a recent statement , Mr. Snowden praised the ruling saying , “ I acted on my belief that the NSA ’ s mass-surveillance programs would not stand a constitutional challenge . ”
If this statement is true , the question must be asked : Should he have fled the United States ?
If he is truly a whistleblowing patriot , there would be no greater act of loyalty to the Constitution than to return and face a trial . Mr. Snowden would be granted every protection afforded by the law . The high-profile attention that this story has already garnered in the media would also guarantee an open discussion on the rights of citizens and the extent that the government can go to protect national security . By fleeing the United States in May , Mr. Snowden , the current face of the controversy , has deprived Americans of the opportunity for a much-needed national debate on these topics .
In a possible move to pre-empt this discussion , a White House advisory panel on Wednesday recommended to President Obama that the NSA no longer store the massive phone database . This may well indicate awareness of the public ’ s distrust of the government ’ s intrusion into their private lives . Tellingly , public opinion is now swinging in Mr. Snowden ’ s favor . The panel ’ s recommendation may be designed to prevent further restrictions on the intelligence community .
Some government officials have taken cover in the 1979 Supreme Court decision Smith v. Maryland , which held that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in non-content information held by a third party . Yet others contend that current technology can use phone data to reveal everything about a person ’ s life — from religious activities to personal health information . This being so , is it possible that the Supreme Court could overturn precedent ?
In 1954 , heightened public sensitivity to racial injustice caused the court to overturn Plessy v. Ferguson ( 1896 ) in Brown v. Board of Education , which recognized state-sponsored segregation as a violation of the 14th Amendment ’ s Equal Protection Clause . In 2012 , five justices in U.S. v. Jones , dealing with a GPS device used to track a suspected drug dealer , seemed open to this possibility . Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote , “ It may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to a third party. ” Accordingly , a possible Snowden v. NSA case may well lead to overturning Smith . It is doubtful that the affected government agencies would want to take this risk .
If indeed our privacy rights are being violated , as many contend they are , then action must be taken to stop the abuse .
Throughout history , those who have wished to protect civil rights have risked being punished for their violation of the law . They rightly believed that in the cause of justice , they were answerable to a higher authority or the natural law . They have also been willing to suffer the consequences of their actions to make things right .
The example of the recently deceased Nelson Mandela serves as a case in point . Although he could have easily escaped the clutches of the South African regime , he chose to spend 27 years in prison . His willingness to suffer for his belief that apartheid offended human dignity solidified national and international opinion against the government . Because of him , South Africans now enjoy full rights .
The same can be said of Martin Luther King . He never fled the police or tried to avoid jail . King ’ s willingness to suffer for the cause of justice helped to galvanize both black and white Americans to demand constitutionally guaranteed equal protection to all citizens .
While in jail , King wrote his now-famous “ Letter from a Birmingham Jail. ” In it , he acknowledged that some might see his “ nonviolent efforts as those of an extremist. ” He then weighed different arguments against his course of action and found them wanting .
Many may argue “ mutatis mutandis , ” or with the respective differences having been considered , Mr. Snowden ’ s leaking of classified information has risked national security and may perhaps have endangered American lives .

On Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon declared that the bulk of the National Security Agency’s collection of Americans’ telephone records is likely to violate the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution’s ban on unreasonable search.

Some legal experts contend that this may be the first step in a march to the Supreme Court. It may also be the beginning of the rehabilitation of Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who disclosed almost 200,000 classified documents to the press. Mr. Snowden has obtained limited asylum in Russia to avoid prosecution in the United States for espionage. In a recent statement, Mr. Snowden praised the ruling saying, “I acted on my belief that the NSA’s mass-surveillance programs would not stand a constitutional challenge.”

If this statement is true, the question must be asked: Should he have fled the United States?

If he is truly a whistleblowing patriot, there would be no greater act of loyalty to the Constitution than to return and face a trial. Mr. Snowden would be granted every protection afforded by the law. The high-profile attention that this story has already garnered in the media would also guarantee an open discussion on the rights of citizens and the extent that the government can go to protect national security. By fleeing the United States in May, Mr. Snowden, the current face of the controversy, has deprived Americans of the opportunity for a much-needed national debate on these topics.

In a possible move to pre-empt this discussion, a White House advisory panel on Wednesday recommended to President Obama that the NSA no longer store the massive phone database. This may well indicate awareness of the public’s distrust of the government’s intrusion into their private lives. Tellingly, public opinion is now swinging in Mr. Snowden’s favor. The panel’s recommendation may be designed to prevent further restrictions on the intelligence community.

Some government officials have taken cover in the 1979 Supreme Court decision Smith v. Maryland, which held that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in non-content information held by a third party. Yet others contend that current technology can use phone data to reveal everything about a person’s life — from religious activities to personal health information. This being so, is it possible that the Supreme Court could overturn precedent?

In 1954, heightened public sensitivity to racial injustice caused the court to overturn Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) in Brown v. Board of Education, which recognized state-sponsored segregation as a violation of the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. In 2012, five justices in U.S. v. Jones, dealing with a GPS device used to track a suspected drug dealer, seemed open to this possibility. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, “It may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to a third party.” Accordingly, a possible Snowden v. NSA case may well lead to overturning Smith. It is doubtful that the affected government agencies would want to take this risk.

If indeed our privacy rights are being violated, as many contend they are, then action must be taken to stop the abuse.

Throughout history, those who have wished to protect civil rights have risked being punished for their violation of the law. They rightly believed that in the cause of justice, they were answerable to a higher authority or the natural law. They have also been willing to suffer the consequences of their actions to make things right.

The example of the recently deceased Nelson Mandela serves as a case in point. Although he could have easily escaped the clutches of the South African regime, he chose to spend 27 years in prison. His willingness to suffer for his belief that apartheid offended human dignity solidified national and international opinion against the government. Because of him, South Africans now enjoy full rights.

The same can be said of Martin Luther King. He never fled the police or tried to avoid jail. King’s willingness to suffer for the cause of justice helped to galvanize both black and white Americans to demand constitutionally guaranteed equal protection to all citizens.

While in jail, King wrote his now-famous “Letter from a Birmingham Jail.” In it, he acknowledged that some might see his “nonviolent efforts as those of an extremist.” He then weighed different arguments against his course of action and found them wanting.

Many may argue “mutatis mutandis,” or with the respective differences having been considered, Mr. Snowden’s leaking of classified information has risked national security and may perhaps have endangered American lives. Yet there is no convincing evidence that this collection of data prevented a single attack.

Mandela and King have become international heroes in the cause of civil rights. Similarly, Mr. Snowden may still have the possibility of becoming a hero in the cause of freedom. However, he cannot do so by hiding behind the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, who himself limits the free flow of information and freedom of speech in his own country.

If, as he says, he reveres the Constitution, Mr. Snowden should return to the United States and stand trial. His witness is vital to the preservation of those rights for which our forefathers shed their blood.

The straightforward question has anything but a simple answer , especially for the government of a nation founded on inalienable rights to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
Monday 's news that the Obama administration is considering a military hit on an American terrorist raises anew the issue of what justifies such a step , according to both the law and the public conscience in an era of political , social and technological evolution .
`` America 's legitimate claim of self-defense can not be the end of the discussion , '' President Barack Obama said last year when he announced new guidelines on drone strikes that target enemies for killing . `` To say a military tactic is legal , or even effective , is not to say it is wise or moral in every instance . For the same human progress that gives us the technology to strike half a world away also demands the discipline to constrain that power -- or risk abusing it . ''
The American Civil Liberties Union contends the administration abuses its power , particularly when it comes to drone strikes that have targeted foreigners and in some cases , American citizens .
`` Even in the context of an armed conflict against an armed group , the government may use lethal force only against individuals who are directly participating in hostilities against the United States , '' the group says on its website . `` Regardless of the context , whenever the government uses lethal force , it must take all possible steps to avoid harming civilian bystanders . But these are not the standards that the executive branch is using . ''

Here are questions about what the government is doing , with explanation of why and arguments against :
1 ) What does targeted killing mean , and how widespread is it ?
After the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the United States , a traumatized nation responded with new laws that greatly expanded the government 's power to fight terrorism .
Wars were launched in Afghanistan and then Iraq , and the national intelligence system expanded to new capacity disclosed in last year 's classified leaks by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden .
Part of the expanded powers included legal authorization to target terrorists defined as enemies of the state -- people determined to be fighting a war against America .
The CIA and the military have used drones and covert missions to take out such targets , including drone strikes that killed U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaki , a wanted terrorist , and three other Americans .
Unofficial estimates based on reports by human rights groups and media accounts indicate the Obama administration has carried out hundreds of drone strikes that have killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of people , including terrorists and civilians , in an escalation of the practice started by the Bush administration .
Most have occurred in Afghanistan , but others have taken place in countries where no ground war was occurring including Yemen , where al-Awlaki and the two other Americans died in 2011 .
2 ) Is it legal for the government to target and kill people ?
In his May 2013 speech at the National Defense University , Obama proclaimed the practice completely legal .
`` Under domestic law , and international law , the United States is at war with al Qaeda , the Taliban , and their associated forces , '' he said . `` We are at war with an organization that right now would kill as many Americans as they could if we did not stop them first . So this is a just war -- a war waged proportionally , in last resort , and in self-defense . ''
Critics , however , say the government oversteps the legal boundaries of the Constitution and international law , particularly by making decisions on targeted killings in secret without going before any court .
`` The result is that the public remains in the dark about how exactly U.S. policy governing targeted killings is operating , under which legal authorities , and who exactly are its victims , '' said a letter to Obama in December from nine rights groups .
Hina Shamsi , who directs the ACLU 's National Security Project , told CNN that the Obama administration was `` fighting hard '' to prevent a judicial review of the strikes that killed al-Awlaki and the other Americans , including the terrorist 's 16-year-old son .
Until allegations in classified documents can be assessed in court , she said , the question of whether they amount to real evidence remains unanswered .
Shamsi called the U.S. actions `` one of the most extreme and dangerous forms of authority that the executive branch can claim -- the power to kill people based on vague and shifting legal standards , secret evidence and no judicial review even after the fact . ''
In 2010 , a federal judge in Washington noted the government would need permission from a federal court to wiretap al-Awlaki , but that no such court process existed in order to kill him .
Rejecting an effort by al-Awlaki 's father to block his son 's possible extrajudicial killing , U.S. District Judge John Bates called it `` somewhat unsettling '' that a president could -- for national security reasons -- make a unilateral decision to kill a U.S. citizen overseas and the decision would be `` judicially unreviewable . ''
3 ) Even if it is legal by the letter of the law , is it morally or politically right ?
Obama has insisted his responsibility as commander in chief to protect Americans from attack justified targeted killings like the drone strike on al-Awlaki .
In his speech last May , he rejected targeting an American citizen without what he called `` due process , '' meaning adherence to full legal procedures . Then he explained the reasoning for the al-Awlaki hit two years earlier , before the expanded policy guidelines he was announcing .
`` When a U.S. citizen goes abroad to wage war against America and is actively plotting to kill U.S. citizens , and when neither the United States , nor our partners are in a position to capture him before he carries out a plot , his citizenship should no more serve as a shield than a sniper shooting down on an innocent crowd should be protected from a SWAT team , '' Obama said , citing al-Awlaki by name .
`` I would have detained and prosecuted Awlaki if we captured him before he carried out a plot , but we could n't , '' Obama continued . `` And as President , I would have been derelict in my duty had I not authorized the strike that took him out . ''
Shamsi , who argued the ACLU 's federal court case seeking judicial review of the strikes on al-Awlaki and two other Americans , contended that the government has failed to adhere to the oversight it set up for targeted killings .
`` Policy restrictions are well and good , but the administration appears to have gone well beyond them based on the investigate reports of human rights organizations and media accounts , '' she said Monday .
Ever the politician , Obama argued forcefully last year that targeted killings were a necessary tool in the expanding battle against international terrorism .
`` Dozens of highly skilled al Qaeda commanders , trainers , bomb makers and operatives have been taken off the battlefield , '' he said . `` Plots have been disrupted that would have targeted international aviation , U.S. transit systems , European cities and our troops in Afghanistan . Simply put , these strikes have saved lives . ''
Critics , including congressional Republicans , argue the President 's anti-terrorism strategy , which in many ways extended programs and practices started after the 9/11 attacks under the Bush administration , have failed to effectively curtail al Qaeda .
Asked last week at a congressional hearing if al Qaeda was stronger or weaker today than before the 9/11 attacks , Director of National Intelligence James Clapper struggled to find an answer before conceding the terrorist network now was more widespread and therefore more difficult to combat .
At the same hearing , House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers argued that tighter restrictions on targeted killings announced by Obama in last year 's policy speech had weakened the government 's fight against terrorism .
`` Today , individuals who would have been previously removed from the battlefield by U.S. counter-terrorism operations for attacking or plotting to attack against U.S. interests remain free because of self-imposed red tape , '' the Michigan Republican said , adding that `` the President 's May 2013 policy changes for the U.S. targeted strikes are an utter and complete failure , and they leave Americans ' lives at risk . ''
However , the criticism by Rogers differs from Shamsi 's accusation that the administration fails to adhere to the stated policies of increased oversight and following due process . Rogers complained that the problem involved confusion over the U.S. policies .
To Obama , the need to take out war enemies supersedes the potential political fallout at home and abroad over drone strikes and other targeted killings .
He argued last year that doing nothing would invite `` far more civilian casualties '' by terrorists targeting U.S. cities as well as foreign strongholds in Yemen , Afghanistan , Somalia and elsewhere .
`` Remember that the terrorists we are after target civilians , and the death toll from their acts of terrorism against Muslims dwarfs any estimate of civilian casualties from drone strikes , '' he argued , saying that `` doing nothing is not an option . ''
Obama also contended the drone strikes were less risky than conventional weapons or `` boots on the ground '' in terms of collateral damage and broader political repercussions .
`` It is false to assert that putting boots on the ground is less likely to result in civilian deaths or less likely to create enemies in the Muslim world , '' he said , referring to unpopular U.S. military incidents of recent decades . `` The results would be more U.S. deaths , more Black Hawks down , more confrontations with local populations , and an inevitable mission creep in support of such raids that could easily escalate into new wars . ''
On the ground , though , drone strikes that kill civilians evoke rage and resentment against the United States that can breed more anti-American activism . To Shamsi , the threat also is to core American values back home .
`` There 's enough credible reporting about tragic wrongful killings and mistakes having been made , '' she told CNN . `` It helps neither the security of the United States nor the victims of its policies , because in the end , long-term national security depends on our real commitment to our laws and our values . ''","Story highlights Sources: the Obama administration is considering a strike on a U.S. terror suspect

Here are questions about what the government is doing, with explanation of why and arguments against:

1) What does targeted killing mean, and how widespread is it?

After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, a traumatized nation responded with new laws that greatly expanded the government's power to fight terrorism.

Wars were launched in Afghanistan and then Iraq, and the national intelligence system expanded to new capacity disclosed in last year's classified leaks by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.

Part of the expanded powers included legal authorization to target terrorists defined as enemies of the state -- people determined to be fighting a war against America.

The CIA and the military have used drones and covert missions to take out such targets, including drone strikes that killed U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaki, a wanted terrorist, and three other Americans.

Unofficial estimates based on reports by human rights groups and media accounts indicate the Obama administration has carried out hundreds of drone strikes that have killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of people, including terrorists and civilians, in an escalation of the practice started by the Bush administration.

Most have occurred in Afghanistan, but others have taken place in countries where no ground war was occurring including Yemen, where al-Awlaki and the two other Americans died in 2011.

2) Is it legal for the government to target and kill people?

In his May 2013 speech at the National Defense University, Obama proclaimed the practice completely legal.

""Under domestic law, and international law, the United States is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces,"" he said. ""We are at war with an organization that right now would kill as many Americans as they could if we did not stop them first. So this is a just war -- a war waged proportionally, in last resort, and in self-defense.""

Critics, however, say the government oversteps the legal boundaries of the Constitution and international law, particularly by making decisions on targeted killings in secret without going before any court.

""The result is that the public remains in the dark about how exactly U.S. policy governing targeted killings is operating, under which legal authorities, and who exactly are its victims,"" said a letter to Obama in December from nine rights groups.

Hina Shamsi, who directs the ACLU's National Security Project, told CNN that the Obama administration was ""fighting hard"" to prevent a judicial review of the strikes that killed al-Awlaki and the other Americans, including the terrorist's 16-year-old son.

Until allegations in classified documents can be assessed in court, she said, the question of whether they amount to real evidence remains unanswered.

Shamsi called the U.S. actions ""one of the most extreme and dangerous forms of authority that the executive branch can claim -- the power to kill people based on vague and shifting legal standards, secret evidence and no judicial review even after the fact.""

In 2010, a federal judge in Washington noted the government would need permission from a federal court to wiretap al-Awlaki, but that no such court process existed in order to kill him.

Rejecting an effort by al-Awlaki's father to block his son's possible extrajudicial killing, U.S. District Judge John Bates called it ""somewhat unsettling"" that a president could -- for national security reasons -- make a unilateral decision to kill a U.S. citizen overseas and the decision would be ""judicially unreviewable.""

3) Even if it is legal by the letter of the law, is it morally or politically right?

Obama has insisted his responsibility as commander in chief to protect Americans from attack justified targeted killings like the drone strike on al-Awlaki.

In his speech last May, he rejected targeting an American citizen without what he called ""due process,"" meaning adherence to full legal procedures. Then he explained the reasoning for the al-Awlaki hit two years earlier, before the expanded policy guidelines he was announcing.

""When a U.S. citizen goes abroad to wage war against America and is actively plotting to kill U.S. citizens, and when neither the United States, nor our partners are in a position to capture him before he carries out a plot, his citizenship should no more serve as a shield than a sniper shooting down on an innocent crowd should be protected from a SWAT team,"" Obama said, citing al-Awlaki by name.

""I would have detained and prosecuted Awlaki if we captured him before he carried out a plot, but we couldn't,"" Obama continued. ""And as President, I would have been derelict in my duty had I not authorized the strike that took him out.""

Shamsi, who argued the ACLU's federal court case seeking judicial review of the strikes on al-Awlaki and two other Americans, contended that the government has failed to adhere to the oversight it set up for targeted killings.

""Policy restrictions are well and good, but the administration appears to have gone well beyond them based on the investigate reports of human rights organizations and media accounts,"" she said Monday.

4) Does it work?

Ever the politician, Obama argued forcefully last year that targeted killings were a necessary tool in the expanding battle against international terrorism.

""Dozens of highly skilled al Qaeda commanders, trainers, bomb makers and operatives have been taken off the battlefield,"" he said. ""Plots have been disrupted that would have targeted international aviation, U.S. transit systems, European cities and our troops in Afghanistan. Simply put, these strikes have saved lives.""

Critics, including congressional Republicans, argue the President's anti-terrorism strategy, which in many ways extended programs and practices started after the 9/11 attacks under the Bush administration, have failed to effectively curtail al Qaeda.

Asked last week at a congressional hearing if al Qaeda was stronger or weaker today than before the 9/11 attacks, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper struggled to find an answer before conceding the terrorist network now was more widespread and therefore more difficult to combat.

At the same hearing, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers argued that tighter restrictions on targeted killings announced by Obama in last year's policy speech had weakened the government's fight against terrorism.

""Today, individuals who would have been previously removed from the battlefield by U.S. counter-terrorism operations for attacking or plotting to attack against U.S. interests remain free because of self-imposed red tape,"" the Michigan Republican said, adding that ""the President's May 2013 policy changes for the U.S. targeted strikes are an utter and complete failure, and they leave Americans' lives at risk.""

However, the criticism by Rogers differs from Shamsi's accusation that the administration fails to adhere to the stated policies of increased oversight and following due process. Rogers complained that the problem involved confusion over the U.S. policies.

5) Is it worth it?

To Obama, the need to take out war enemies supersedes the potential political fallout at home and abroad over drone strikes and other targeted killings.

He argued last year that doing nothing would invite ""far more civilian casualties"" by terrorists targeting U.S. cities as well as foreign strongholds in Yemen, Afghanistan, Somalia and elsewhere.

""Remember that the terrorists we are after target civilians, and the death toll from their acts of terrorism against Muslims dwarfs any estimate of civilian casualties from drone strikes,"" he argued, saying that ""doing nothing is not an option.""

Obama also contended the drone strikes were less risky than conventional weapons or ""boots on the ground"" in terms of collateral damage and broader political repercussions.

""It is false to assert that putting boots on the ground is less likely to result in civilian deaths or less likely to create enemies in the Muslim world,"" he said, referring to unpopular U.S. military incidents of recent decades. ""The results would be more U.S. deaths, more Black Hawks down, more confrontations with local populations, and an inevitable mission creep in support of such raids that could easily escalate into new wars.""

On the ground, though, drone strikes that kill civilians evoke rage and resentment against the United States that can breed more anti-American activism. To Shamsi, the threat also is to core American values back home.

""There's enough credible reporting about tragic wrongful killings and mistakes having been made,"" she told CNN. ""It helps neither the security of the United States nor the victims of its policies, because in the end, long-term national security depends on our real commitment to our laws and our values.""",www.cnn.com,left,dJ4lRr4aAi9P0x5a

According to Thursday 's Washington Post report , the court is not given all the information about every request for surveillance . And Obama has admitted that the programs needs review to assure Americans they are not violating civil liberties .
The most obvious misstatement came from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper when he told Sen. Ron Wyden at a March congressional hearing that the government is n't gathering information on Americans . Wyden , who has been a critic of the programs behind closed doors , was trying to get Clapper on the record .
Wyden asked Clapper whether the NSA collected `` any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans ? ''
Clapper : `` Not wittingly . There are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not wittingly . ''
The nation 's top spy later had to apologize in a letter to the Intelligence Committee . He admitted what he said was `` erroneous . '' He told NBC that what he said was the `` least untruthful '' answer .
4 . Alexander : NSA does n't have capability to 'flip the switch '
In testimony to a House committee on June 18 , Gen. Keith Alexander , the head of the NSA , had the following exchange with Rep. Mike Rogers , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a supporter of the data mining programs :
Rep. Mike Rogers : `` Does the NSA have the ability to listen to Americans ' phone calls or read their e-mails under these two programs ? ''
Gen. Keith Alexander : `` No , we do not have that authority , ''
Rogers : `` Does the technology exist at the NSA to flip a switch by some analyst to listen to Americans ' phone calls or read their e-mails ? ''
Rogers : `` So the technology does not exist for any individual or group of individuals at the NSA to flip a switch to listen to Americans ' phone calls or read their e-mails ? '' he repeated .
It has since become clear through subsequent leaks that the government does have temporary access to large amounts of the phone calls and e-mails sent in the United States . But the distinction that allowed Alexander to answer `` no '' is that analysts are supposed to obtain the OK from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court before doing so . That 's perhaps why he said they lacked the `` authority . ''
Subsequent leaks in July about a program called XKeyscore printed in the UK 's Guardian newspaper and in The New York Times suggested that the NSA collects nearly every phone call and e-mail . The idea is that the intelligence community is collecting the entire `` haystack '' of information that it can sift through later when it has some idea what needle it needs to find . Even if the analysts need court approval , the newer disclosures suggest the NSA has access to the content of communications , at least for a time .
Alexander also argued several times before Congress that information `` gathered from these programs provided government with critical leads to prevent over 50 potential terrorist events in more than 20 countries around the world . ''
But details of these plots have not been shared publicly .
Lawmakers who have been briefed on the plots have expressed skepticism . At a July 31 hearing , Sen. Patrick Leahy said by his estimation the NSA 's data showed the data collection had not foiled `` dozens or even several terrorist plots .

Ron Wyden at a March congressional hearing that the government isn't gathering information on Americans. Wyden, who has been a critic of the programs behind closed doors, was trying to get Clapper on the record.

Wyden asked Clapper whether the NSA collected ""any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?""

Clapper answered, ""No, sir.""

Wyden: ""It does not?""

Clapper: ""Not wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not wittingly.""

The nation's top spy later had to apologize in a letter to the Intelligence Committee. He admitted what he said was ""erroneous."" He told NBC that what he said was the ""least untruthful"" answer.

4. Alexander: NSA doesn't have capability to 'flip the switch'

In testimony to a House committee on June 18, Gen. Keith Alexander, the head of the NSA, had the following exchange with Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a supporter of the data mining programs:

Rep. Mike Rogers: ""Does the NSA have the ability to listen to Americans' phone calls or read their e-mails under these two programs?""

Gen. Keith Alexander: ""No, we do not have that authority,""

Rogers: ""Does the technology exist at the NSA to flip a switch by some analyst to listen to Americans' phone calls or read their e-mails?""

Alexander: ""No.""

Rogers: ""So the technology does not exist for any individual or group of individuals at the NSA to flip a switch to listen to Americans' phone calls or read their e-mails?"" he repeated.

Alexander: ""That is correct.""

It has since become clear through subsequent leaks that the government does have temporary access to large amounts of the phone calls and e-mails sent in the United States. But the distinction that allowed Alexander to answer ""no"" is that analysts are supposed to obtain the OK from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court before doing so. That's perhaps why he said they lacked the ""authority.""

Subsequent leaks in July about a program called XKeyscore printed in the UK's Guardian newspaper and in The New York Times suggested that the NSA collects nearly every phone call and e-mail. The idea is that the intelligence community is collecting the entire ""haystack"" of information that it can sift through later when it has some idea what needle it needs to find. Even if the analysts need court approval, the newer disclosures suggest the NSA has access to the content of communications, at least for a time.

5. Alexander: 50 plots thwarted

Alexander also argued several times before Congress that information ""gathered from these programs provided government with critical leads to prevent over 50 potential terrorist events in more than 20 countries around the world.""

But details of these plots have not been shared publicly.

Lawmakers who have been briefed on the plots have expressed skepticism. At a July 31 hearing, Sen. Patrick Leahy said by his estimation the NSA's data showed the data collection had not foiled ""dozens or even several terrorist plots.""",www.cnn.com,left,EWNkoFB194sgbwEk

NSA ruling fallout hits White House
In legal terms , a federal judge ’ s decision Monday questioning the constitutionality of the National Security Agency ’ s massive call-tracking program seems almost certain to have no practical significance .
In political terms , it comes at a critical time for the NSA and President Barack Obama .
U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon ’ s ruling that the NSA ’ s metadata program appears to violate the Fourth Amendment was issued just three days after a review group established by Obama delivered its report proposing more than 40 changes to the federal government ’ s surveillance programs .
Obama was initially expected to dig through the reform proposals before Christmas and announce which ones he would adopt . However , the White House now says that process won ’ t be complete until sometime next month .
The delay gives Leon ’ s decision time to resonate and gives surveillance skeptics more time to pressure Obama to endorse significant reforms after Edward Snowden ’ s revelations about NSA surveillance practices .
The ruling also underscores the awkwardness of a president who won office in part by railing against the national security state established by President George W. Bush trying to defend much of that establishment while maintaining his vow to restore civil liberties and bring an end to what seemed like a permanent war on terror .
Leon said his decision would not take effect while it is being appealed , which he said was inevitable . And with at least three other lawsuits related to the metadata program in the works , the issue seems highly likely to be resolved by the Supreme Court . But politically , Leon ’ s ruling could also create the impression that Obama is less concerned about privacy rights than a conservative judge appointed by Bush .
“ There have been hints of diversity of opinion in [ the interagency process ] , with some people in the White House more pro-privacy and others less so , ” said Michelle Richardson of the American Civil Liberties Union , which is pressing for an end to bulk data collection and for greater safeguards on surveillance . “ This is going to open up a whole new point in the debate … Hopefully , this will lead to more support for meaningful changes , ” she said .
Former National Security Agency Director Michael Hayden , a backer of the call-tracking program , also said the new court ruling could shift the balance in favor of more limits on the NSA ’ s work .
“ The arguments of those interested in preserving the validity and legitimacy of arguments about how [ Obama ] ran could get a little stronger inside government , ” Hayden said . “ They may administratively change the program . ”
Obama has already signaled his plans to impose greater limits on the NSA , but the contours of those changes have only been partially decided , White House officials say .
“ I ’ ll be proposing some self-restraint on the NSA . And … to initiate some reforms that can give people more confidence , ” Obama said earlier this month in an interview with MSNBC .
While Monday ’ s ruling may shift the internal administration debate in favor of more reforms , there ’ s no expectation Obama will completely halt the bulk collection of calling data from U.S. carriers . But he might endorse stricter limits on how long the data can be kept or propose other ways of storing the data than having the NSA hold it .
Among the surveillance doubters who might now have more impact : former Clinton White House Chief of Staff John Podesta , who ’ s set to begin work next month as a counselor to Obama . Podesta has been a longtime privacy advocate and has expressed sympathy with Leon ’ s conclusion that a 34-year-old Supreme Court precedent allowing police to trace a suspected criminals phone calls without a warrant does not authorize bulk collection of data on virtually every phone call made to , from or within the U.S .
“ Our smartphones with built-in GPS technology track our locations and our phone companies and Internet providers collect metadata on every call we make and every person we email . … Court decisions from the pre-Internet days suggest that the information we give away voluntarily to these companies can be obtained fairly easily by the government , ” Podesta told the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel in July . “ That legal rule may have made sense in an age before Facebook and iPhones , but we need a serious examination of whether it still makes sense today . ”
Podesta has also taken on the intelligence community before , singlehandedly waging a successful battle to defeat anti-leak legislation passed near the end of President Bill Clinton ’ s term in office . At Podesta ’ s urging , Clinton vetoed the intelligence bill containing the measure and it was later stripped out .
The White House referred questions about the impact of Leon ’ s ruling to the Justice Department , which said it was reviewing the decision and pointed to numerous orders from other judges re-authorizing the program .
Leon ’ s decision did buoy critics of the metadata program in Congress , but it remains doubtful that significant reforms will pass anytime soon . The controversial issue has been jettisoned from a defense bill expected to pass this week . And with most Republicans and some powerful Democrats like Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein of California strongly supportive of the program , prospects for major reforms in the Senate are murky at best .
Other events could dampen the impact of Leon ’ s decision . A contrary ruling in the coming days from one of the other courts considering lawsuits challenging the metadata program would buttress the administration ’ s argument that Leon ’ s ruling is an outlier .
U.S. District Court Judge William Pauley heard arguments last month on an American Civil Liberties Union suit filed in Manhattan . A decision on a motion for preliminary injunction in that case could come at any time . The other cases appear to be on slower tracks .
Leon ’ s opinion won ’ t dictate any of the future decisions , but judges usually refer to other rulings on the subject and either adopt the same reasoning or explain their reason for departing from it . Leon ’ s decision could also make judges with doubts about the program more willing to express those publicly .
At a minimum , the decision undercuts one of the pro-surveillance camp ’ s best talking points : that every judge who has considered the NSA metadata program has upheld it .
“ This is great , ” Richardson said of Leon ’ s ruling . “ One of the biggest things they ’ ve had going for them is to say the FISA Court has always signed off on this program . … It just can ’ t be overstated how important it is to have outside judges actually looking at these programs . ”","Leon's decision gives surveillance skeptics more time to pressure Obama for reforms. NSA ruling fallout hits White House

In legal terms, a federal judge’s decision Monday questioning the constitutionality of the National Security Agency’s massive call-tracking program seems almost certain to have no practical significance.

In political terms, it comes at a critical time for the NSA and President Barack Obama.

Story Continued Below

U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon’s ruling that the NSA’s metadata program appears to violate the Fourth Amendment was issued just three days after a review group established by Obama delivered its report proposing more than 40 changes to the federal government’s surveillance programs.

Obama was initially expected to dig through the reform proposals before Christmas and announce which ones he would adopt. However, the White House now says that process won’t be complete until sometime next month.

The delay gives Leon’s decision time to resonate and gives surveillance skeptics more time to pressure Obama to endorse significant reforms after Edward Snowden’s revelations about NSA surveillance practices.

The ruling also underscores the awkwardness of a president who won office in part by railing against the national security state established by President George W. Bush trying to defend much of that establishment while maintaining his vow to restore civil liberties and bring an end to what seemed like a permanent war on terror.

Leon said his decision would not take effect while it is being appealed, which he said was inevitable. And with at least three other lawsuits related to the metadata program in the works, the issue seems highly likely to be resolved by the Supreme Court. But politically, Leon’s ruling could also create the impression that Obama is less concerned about privacy rights than a conservative judge appointed by Bush.

“There have been hints of diversity of opinion in [the interagency process], with some people in the White House more pro-privacy and others less so,” said Michelle Richardson of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is pressing for an end to bulk data collection and for greater safeguards on surveillance. “This is going to open up a whole new point in the debate … Hopefully, this will lead to more support for meaningful changes,” she said.

Former National Security Agency Director Michael Hayden, a backer of the call-tracking program, also said the new court ruling could shift the balance in favor of more limits on the NSA’s work.

“The arguments of those interested in preserving the validity and legitimacy of arguments about how [Obama] ran could get a little stronger inside government,” Hayden said. “They may administratively change the program.”

Obama has already signaled his plans to impose greater limits on the NSA, but the contours of those changes have only been partially decided, White House officials say.

“I’ll be proposing some self-restraint on the NSA. And … to initiate some reforms that can give people more confidence, ” Obama said earlier this month in an interview with MSNBC.

While Monday’s ruling may shift the internal administration debate in favor of more reforms, there’s no expectation Obama will completely halt the bulk collection of calling data from U.S. carriers. But he might endorse stricter limits on how long the data can be kept or propose other ways of storing the data than having the NSA hold it.

Among the surveillance doubters who might now have more impact: former Clinton White House Chief of Staff John Podesta, who’s set to begin work next month as a counselor to Obama. Podesta has been a longtime privacy advocate and has expressed sympathy with Leon’s conclusion that a 34-year-old Supreme Court precedent allowing police to trace a suspected criminals phone calls without a warrant does not authorize bulk collection of data on virtually every phone call made to, from or within the U.S.

“Our smartphones with built-in GPS technology track our locations and our phone companies and Internet providers collect metadata on every call we make and every person we email. … Court decisions from the pre-Internet days suggest that the information we give away voluntarily to these companies can be obtained fairly easily by the government,” Podesta told the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel in July. “That legal rule may have made sense in an age before Facebook and iPhones, but we need a serious examination of whether it still makes sense today.”

( Also on POLITICO: NSA probe: Edward Snowden can still do damage)

Podesta has also taken on the intelligence community before, singlehandedly waging a successful battle to defeat anti-leak legislation passed near the end of President Bill Clinton’s term in office. At Podesta’s urging, Clinton vetoed the intelligence bill containing the measure and it was later stripped out.

The White House referred questions about the impact of Leon’s ruling to the Justice Department, which said it was reviewing the decision and pointed to numerous orders from other judges re-authorizing the program.

Leon’s decision did buoy critics of the metadata program in Congress, but it remains doubtful that significant reforms will pass anytime soon. The controversial issue has been jettisoned from a defense bill expected to pass this week. And with most Republicans and some powerful Democrats like Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein of California strongly supportive of the program, prospects for major reforms in the Senate are murky at best.

Other events could dampen the impact of Leon’s decision. A contrary ruling in the coming days from one of the other courts considering lawsuits challenging the metadata program would buttress the administration’s argument that Leon’s ruling is an outlier.

U.S. District Court Judge William Pauley heard arguments last month on an American Civil Liberties Union suit filed in Manhattan. A decision on a motion for preliminary injunction in that case could come at any time. The other cases appear to be on slower tracks.

Leon’s opinion won’t dictate any of the future decisions, but judges usually refer to other rulings on the subject and either adopt the same reasoning or explain their reason for departing from it. Leon’s decision could also make judges with doubts about the program more willing to express those publicly.

At a minimum, the decision undercuts one of the pro-surveillance camp’s best talking points: that every judge who has considered the NSA metadata program has upheld it.

“This is great,” Richardson said of Leon’s ruling. “One of the biggest things they’ve had going for them is to say the FISA Court has always signed off on this program. … It just can’t be overstated how important it is to have outside judges actually looking at these programs.”",www.politico.com,left,ektE3JsV6P93ZosM

At that meeting , Vice President Dick Cheney and Michael V.

The Bush administration took the TSP and augmented it in 2007 with Prism , a computer program geared to infiltrate social media servers and allow NSA analysts to access emails , chat rooms and the postings of people overseas deemed potential terrorism threats .

Beginning last month , numerous bills have been put forward to make the court more transparent and trustworthy . On Wednesday , a House Judiciary Hearing will examine how the federal government is running programs that were approved by the FISA ( Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ) court . Though some lawmakers have been sounding alarm bells about the court for a few years , current bipartisan interest in the court ’ s activities put the FISC ( Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ) at the center of possible congressional responses to Snowden ’ s leaks .
“ I think the public is extremely concerned about the metadata that is being collected , ” said Rep. Steve Cohen , D-Tenn. , who has put forward a proposal to reform the secret court . “ I think because of that massive concern , that because the Snowden situation has maintained itself in the news , ” questions about the court have not been as “ front-burner as they are now , ” Cohen said .
Civil liberties advocates also feel that the FISA court is where they are most likely to win reforms , particularly when it comes to increasing transparency . `` In terms of issues that have bipartisan support and are more likely than others to go forward , I would agree that this is one of those issues , ” said Sharon Bradford Franklin , a senior counsel at the Constitution Project , a nonpartisan legal research and advocacy group .
In response to abuses of the government ’ s spying powers , Congress created the FISC in the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to approve warrant applications for surveillance activities related to national security . For years , the court appeared to function just as Congress had intended , even though the process is one-sided : the government seeks approval for an operation , and there is no pushback from a counterparty to argue that the operation is overreaching . But in light of the recently leaked documents detailing the vast scope of the National Security Agency ’ s surveillance programs , members of Congress are beginning to question whether the secret court is acting as an effective check on the government ’ s spying operations . In fact , recent revelations show that the scope and functions of the court have vastly expanded in recent years .
Perhaps the greatest change at the FISC is that judges are no longer simply reviewing warrant applications for individual surveillance operations . Instead , FISA court judges are reviewing and approving what is called “ programmatic surveillance , ” the procedures the government intends to use to conduct broad surveillance operations over a significant period of time . This change was the result of the 2008 FISA Amendments Act ( FAA ) , which under Section 702 allowed the government to perform large-scale operations that needed to be authorized only on an annual basis .
Now that the judges are approving surveillance on a much greater scale , civil liberties advocates feel that the one-sided process at the court is insufficient . Last week , retired District Court Judge James Robertson , who served on the FISC for three years before resigning in protest over the Bush administration ’ s warrantless wiretap program in 2005 , said that the court needs an adversarial process to evaluate programmatic surveillance . Robertson made his comments at a public workshop of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board ( PCLOB ) , a government agency created to advise on civil liberties concerns . “ A judge needs to hear both sides of a case before deciding , '' he said . `` It 's quite common -- in fact it 's the norm -- to read one side 's brief or hear one side 's argument and think , hmm , that sounds right , until we read the other side . ''
Robertson ’ s proposal made headlines and will be a central piece of legislation forthcoming from Sen. Richard Blumenthal , D-Conn. , to reform the court . His bill will include “ a special advocate with the power and responsibility to ensure that privacy rights are considered in FISA court opinions , and an opportunity for civil society organizations to weigh in before the court issues a ruling that substantially alters the balance between liberty and security in federal policy , ” Blumenthal wrote in a Politico op-ed Monday .
Another proposal to change the structure of the court comes from Rep. Steve Cohen , D-Tenn. , whose bill would change the way judges are appointed , a reform also mentioned by Blumenthal . Currently , the 11 FISA court judges are appointed to seven-year terms by the chief justice of the Supreme Court -- a system that has resulted in judges appointed to the federal bench by Republican administrations now making up 10 of the 11 members . Cohen ’ s bill would give the chief justice three appointments , with the remaining eight divided among Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate in order to create a more ideologically diverse court . Cohen , who is a member of the House Judiciary Committee , said he intends to discuss his proposal at a FISA oversight hearing Wednesday morning .
Most of the reforms coming from Congress , including Blumenthal ’ s and Cohen ’ s proposals , take on the issue of transparency , which civil liberties advocates believe is a major concern , by seeking to declassify at least some of what goes on at the FISA court . A bipartisan bill from Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah takes on the issue of “ secret law , ” a reference to the fact that the FISC is reportedly issuing opinions that create a legal framework for the government ’ s surveillance programs and are not public . The result is that while the statutes passed by Congress are available to the public , how those statutes have been interpreted and used remains secret . According to a New York Times report , the FISC has interpreted acts of Congress to give the NSA broad new authorities in lengthy opinions that are hidden from the public .
It is unclear when the court began to issue these long opinions , but when Robertson was on the court , he said he was unaware that any such opinions were being written . “ This business about there being a whole body of long opinions that have been written , that surprised me , ” Robertson said at the PCLOB workshop . “ I didn ’ t know about them when I was on the court. ” Robertson declined to speculate on why the court began to issue longer opinions , but it does seem clear that this is a more recent development . Cohen ’ s proposal would require 60 percent of the 11 judges to agree in order to issue opinions when the entire court is considering a case .
To shed some light on this secret body of law , Merkley and Lee ’ s bill would require the attorney general to declassify significant FISC opinions that contain substantive legal interpretations , with exceptions for opinions that contain sensitive national security information . The bill has several co-sponsors in the Senate , including Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vt. , the chairman of the Judiciary Committee . Reps. Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , and Todd Rokita , R-Ind. , have introduced a companion bill in the House .
A second transparency proposal comes from Michigan Rep. John Conyers , the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee , and Michigan Republican Rep. Justin Amash , a sophomore congressman with libertarian leanings . In addition to reining in the collection of data on American citizens , the bill would require that FISA court opinions be shared with Congress and that summaries of the opinions be made public . In the wake of Snowden ’ s leaks , many members of Congress complained that they had not been aware of the scope of the NSA ’ s surveillance programs . The 41 co-sponsors of the bill , introduced last month , run the gamut from progressive Democrats to tea party Republicans .
At the PCLOB workshop last week , panelists made a number of other proposals to reform the FISC that have not made it into congressional proposals . One popular proposal was for the FISC to release statistics that could paint a broad picture of the kind of programs it was approving over time , without releasing anything specific to a particular case . Another popular proposal involved tightening restrictions on the use of data after it has been collected , so that the NSA would have to get a warrant to query databases that contain Americans ’ information . Retired Judge Patricia Wald , a member of the PCLOB and former chief justice on the D.C . Circuit Appeals Court , noted that FISA court judges “ are not technical people ” and wondered if they might benefit by having some sort of technical law clerk to help them understand the programs they are being asked to authorize .
The PCLOB will give Congress its own report on the NSA ’ s two major collection programs revealed by Snowden . Civil liberties activists hope that the board ’ s proposals will garner attention in Congress .
Rep. Cohen cautioned that major changes like the FISA reforms take time to gain support in Congress . “ It takes introducing an idea , the concept , so people think about it , ” after which an idea can begin to gain steam and ultimately become law , Cohen said . Right now , he added , “ this is the first stage . ”","Since former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed that the government is collecting a significant amount of data from American citizens, members of Congress have begun to look seriously at the secret court approving these surveillance activities.

Last week, retired District Court Judge James Robertson, who served on the FISC for three years before resigning in protest over the Bush administration’s warrantless wiretap program in 2005, said that the court needs an adversarial process to evaluate programmatic surveillance. Robertson made his comments at a public workshop of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), a government agency created to advise on civil liberties concerns. “A judge needs to hear both sides of a case before deciding,"" he said. ""It's quite common -- in fact it's the norm -- to read one side's brief or hear one side's argument and think, hmm, that sounds right, until we read the other side.""

Robertson’s proposal made headlines and will be a central piece of legislation forthcoming from Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., to reform the court. His bill will include “a special advocate with the power and responsibility to ensure that privacy rights are considered in FISA court opinions, and an opportunity for civil society organizations to weigh in before the court issues a ruling that substantially alters the balance between liberty and security in federal policy,” Blumenthal wrote in a Politico op-ed Monday.

Another proposal to change the structure of the court comes from Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., whose bill would change the way judges are appointed, a reform also mentioned by Blumenthal. Currently, the 11 FISA court judges are appointed to seven-year terms by the chief justice of the Supreme Court -- a system that has resulted in judges appointed to the federal bench by Republican administrations now making up 10 of the 11 members. Cohen’s bill would give the chief justice three appointments, with the remaining eight divided among Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate in order to create a more ideologically diverse court. Cohen, who is a member of the House Judiciary Committee, said he intends to discuss his proposal at a FISA oversight hearing Wednesday morning.

Most of the reforms coming from Congress, including Blumenthal’s and Cohen’s proposals, take on the issue of transparency, which civil liberties advocates believe is a major concern, by seeking to declassify at least some of what goes on at the FISA court. A bipartisan bill from Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah takes on the issue of “secret law,” a reference to the fact that the FISC is reportedly issuing opinions that create a legal framework for the government’s surveillance programs and are not public. The result is that while the statutes passed by Congress are available to the public, how those statutes have been interpreted and used remains secret. According to a New York Times report, the FISC has interpreted acts of Congress to give the NSA broad new authorities in lengthy opinions that are hidden from the public.

It is unclear when the court began to issue these long opinions, but when Robertson was on the court, he said he was unaware that any such opinions were being written. “This business about there being a whole body of long opinions that have been written, that surprised me,” Robertson said at the PCLOB workshop. “I didn’t know about them when I was on the court.” Robertson declined to speculate on why the court began to issue longer opinions, but it does seem clear that this is a more recent development. Cohen’s proposal would require 60 percent of the 11 judges to agree in order to issue opinions when the entire court is considering a case.

To shed some light on this secret body of law, Merkley and Lee’s bill would require the attorney general to declassify significant FISC opinions that contain substantive legal interpretations, with exceptions for opinions that contain sensitive national security information. The bill has several co-sponsors in the Senate, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Reps. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Todd Rokita, R-Ind., have introduced a companion bill in the House.

A second transparency proposal comes from Michigan Rep. John Conyers, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, and Michigan Republican Rep. Justin Amash, a sophomore congressman with libertarian leanings. In addition to reining in the collection of data on American citizens, the bill would require that FISA court opinions be shared with Congress and that summaries of the opinions be made public. In the wake of Snowden’s leaks, many members of Congress complained that they had not been aware of the scope of the NSA’s surveillance programs. The 41 co-sponsors of the bill, introduced last month, run the gamut from progressive Democrats to tea party Republicans.

At the PCLOB workshop last week, panelists made a number of other proposals to reform the FISC that have not made it into congressional proposals. One popular proposal was for the FISC to release statistics that could paint a broad picture of the kind of programs it was approving over time, without releasing anything specific to a particular case. Another popular proposal involved tightening restrictions on the use of data after it has been collected, so that the NSA would have to get a warrant to query databases that contain Americans’ information. Retired Judge Patricia Wald, a member of the PCLOB and former chief justice on the D.C. Circuit Appeals Court, noted that FISA court judges “are not technical people” and wondered if they might benefit by having some sort of technical law clerk to help them understand the programs they are being asked to authorize.

The PCLOB will give Congress its own report on the NSA’s two major collection programs revealed by Snowden. Civil liberties activists hope that the board’s proposals will garner attention in Congress.

Rep. Cohen cautioned that major changes like the FISA reforms take time to gain support in Congress. “It takes introducing an idea, the concept, so people think about it,” after which an idea can begin to gain steam and ultimately become law, Cohen said. Right now, he added, “this is the first stage.”",www.ibtimes.com,center,i0FY2abNZPGacYtH

Unable to get agreement on any extension, McConnell said the Senate will come back at 4 p.m. on May 31 to try again, beginning with a vote on the House bill. That gives lawmakers only a few hours to prevent the Patriot Act provisions from expiring.

The majority leader stressed that it's a dangerous time to allow the law to expire, given the threats overseas and attempted attacks here, and urged the Senate to act ""responsibly"" to protect the country, Henry reports.

The Justice Department has said the NSA would begin winding down collection of domestic phone records this week if the Senate failed to act, according to the Associated Press.",www.npr.org,center,O07jj8AIjdLVgcYH

(CNN) – Lawmakers who are now expressing outrage over the government’s surveillance of phone records and Internet activity should have paid closer attention when they were voting to reauthorize provisions in the Patriot Act, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said Sunday.

Reacting particularly to fellow Republican Sen. Rand Paul’s assertion this week the programs amount to an “assault on the Constitution,” McCain told CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley that members of Congress had not been left in the dark on what powers to government has in monitoring Americans.



“The Republican and Democrat chairs, and ... members of the Intelligence Committee have been very well briefed on these programs,” McCain said. “We passed the Patriot Act. We passed specific provisions of the act that allowed for this program to take place, to be enacted in operation. Now, if members of Congress did not know what they were voting on, then I think that that's their responsibility a lot more than it is the government's.”

Paul, a Kentucky Republican who enjoys support from a large bloc of libertarians, was elected to the Senate in 2010, years after the Patriot Act was first passed. However, the key provisions of the act that have been subject to scrutiny this week were reauthorized in the past two years.

In 2011, when Congress was debating the re-authorization of Section 215, Paul offered amendments that would have limited the government’s powers of surveillance.

Section 215 allows the FBI to apply to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court - FISA court - to issue orders granting the government access to any tangible items in foreign intelligence, international terrorism and clandestine intelligence cases. It’s the measure cited this week in a leaked document that revealed the Obama administration obtained a secret court order for phone records from Verizon.

Napolitano","In their continuous efforts to create the impression that the government is doing something to keep Americans safe , politicians in Washington have misled and lied to the public . They have violated their oaths to uphold the Constitution . They have created a false sense of security . And they have dispatched and re-dispatched 60,000 federal agents to intercept the telephone calls , text messages and emails of all Americans all the time .
In the process , while publicly claiming they only acquire identifying metadata -- the time , date , location , duration , telephone numbers and email addresses of communications -- they have in fact surreptitiously gained access to the content of these communications .
On June 1 , one of the three claimed legal authorities for all this , Section 215 of the Patriot Act , expired , as Congress was unable to agree on either its reinstitution or the enactment of a substitute . At the time that Section 215 was about to expire , President Obama , Attorney General Lynch and FBI Director Comey warned that the NSA ’ s computers would go dark and the American public would be at the mercy of our enemies . Their warnings were nonsense .
The NSA is a military entity that utilizes the services of military computer experts and agents , employs civilians , and hires companies that provide thousands of outside contractors . After nearly 14 years of spying on us -- all authorized by a secret court whose judges can not keep records of what they have ordered or discuss openly what they know -- the NSA now has computers and computer personnel physically located in the main switching offices of all telecom and Internet service providers in the United States . It has 24/7 access to the content of everyone ’ s telephone calls , emails and text messages .
The data amassed thereby is so vast that the government can not sift through it quickly or effectively enough to stop such notorious events as the Boston Marathon bombings , the Ft . Hood massacre and the attempted massacre last month outside of Dallas . The Justice Department acknowledged this last month when it revealed that all this spying has not succeeded in stopping any terrorist plots and has not aided any federal prosecutions of terrorism .
Then why do it ? Because the feds want to calm American nerves by giving the impression that they are doing something -- even though we know that they know that what they are doing fails to keep us safe . They are giving us a false impression . But they owe us the truth , not falsehoods designed to make themselves look like they are doing what they claim . Their spying has failed to enhance our safety .
It also has failed to protect our freedoms . The Constitution requires probable cause as a precondition for all search warrants . That is a level of evidence about the place to be searched or the person or thing to be seized sufficient to induce a judge to conclude that a crime probably has been committed . Without this probable cause requirement , nothing would stop the government from searching and seizing whatever it wants . Yet that is where we are today . The NSA ’ s unconstitutional standard of “ government need ” reinstitutes the general warrants -- search where you wish and seize what you find -- which the Fourth Amendment was written to prohibit .
Both the Patriot Act and the Freedom Act , the substitute law enacted by Congress , do away with the probable cause requirement . Both of those laws permit the FISA court to issue general warrants based on the government ’ s needs , rather than probable cause . It is the government-need standard , which is no standard at all , that has resulted in spying on all persons all the time .
When Section 215 of the Patriot Act expired , the NSA ’ s legal ( yet unconstitutional ) authority to spy did not . The propaganda that its computers were shut down is false . Section 702 of the FISA law and President Bush ’ s October 2001 executive order were and are still valid , and both have been interpreted to unleash the NSA .
Section 702 permits warrantless surveillance of Americans who speak with foreigners , and the NSA has gotten FISA warrants to intercept the calls of the folks to whom those Americans speak , to the sixth degree . That alone encompasses all persons in the United States . Bush ’ s executive order was given to all military intelligence agencies -- of which the NSA is but one . It instructed the military to intercept the calls and emails of whatever Americans it needs to listen in upon to enhance safety . That executive order still stands . This is why the hand wringing and false claims that the NSA computers went dark is untruthful . The computers violate our privacy and assault our liberty and fail to enhance our safety , but they are not dark .
Last week , one of the pro-spying politicians was clever , even cute , when he issued the one-liner : “ You can ’ t enjoy civil liberties from a coffin. ” His statement was a craven articulation of failure . The government ’ s job is to keep us free and safe . If it keeps us safe but not free , it has failed to do its job . Today it does neither . I suggest to him Patrick Henry on this : “ Give me liberty or give me death . ”","In their continuous efforts to create the impression that the government is doing something to keep Americans safe, politicians in Washington have misled and lied to the public.

Section 702 permits warrantless surveillance of Americans who speak with foreigners, and the NSA has gotten FISA warrants to intercept the calls of the folks to whom those Americans speak, to the sixth degree. That alone encompasses all persons in the United States. Bush’s executive order was given to all military intelligence agencies -- of which the NSA is but one. It instructed the military to intercept the calls and emails of whatever Americans it needs to listen in upon to enhance safety. That executive order still stands. This is why the hand wringing and false claims that the NSA computers went dark is untruthful. The computers violate our privacy and assault our liberty and fail to enhance our safety, but they are not dark.

Last week, one of the pro-spying politicians was clever, even cute, when he issued the one-liner: “You can’t enjoy civil liberties from a coffin.” His statement was a craven articulation of failure. The government’s job is to keep us free and safe. If it keeps us safe but not free, it has failed to do its job. Today it does neither. I suggest to him Patrick Henry on this: “Give me liberty or give me death.”

Officials in Germany and the European Union issued complaints Monday over two National Security Agency programs that target suspicious foreign messages — potentially including phone numbers , email , images , video and other online communications transmitted through U.S. providers . The chief British diplomat felt it necessary to try to assure Parliament that the spy programs do not encroach on U.K. privacy laws .
And in Washington , members of Congress said they will take a new look at ways to keep the U.S. safe from terror attacks without giving up privacy protections that critics charge are at risk with the government 's current authority to broadly sweep up personal communications .
`` There 's very little trust in the government , and that 's for good reason , '' said Rep. Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , who sits on the House Intelligence Committee . `` We 're our own worst enemy . ''
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told NBC that Snowden had responded in the `` least untruthful manner '' possible when he denied in congressional hearings last year that the NSA collected data on millions of Americans . Clapper also confirmed that Feinstein has asked for a review to `` refine these NSA processes and limit the exposure to Americans ' private communications '' and to report back in roughly one month .
A senior U.S. intelligence official said Monday there were no plans to scrap the programs that , despite the backlash , continue to receive widespread if cautious support within Congress . The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive security issue .
The programs were revealed last week by The Guardian and The Washington Post newspapers . National Intelligence Director James Clapper has taken the unusual step of declassifying some of the previously top-secret details to help the administration mount a public defense of the surveillance as a necessary step to protect Americans .
Sen. Angus King , I-Maine , who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee , said he was considering how Congress could limit the amount of data spy agencies seize from telephone and Internet companies — including restricting the information to be released only on an as-needed basis .
`` It 's a little unsettling to have this massive data in the government 's possession , '' King said .
In other developments , one of the reporters who exposed classified U.S. government surveillance programs reportedly leaked by a former government contractor said Tuesday he is planning on disclosing more `` significant revelations '' soon .
Glenn Greenwald of The Guardian told the Associated Press the paper is currently deciding when to release the next story based on information in documents reportedly given him by Snowden .
`` We are going to have a lot more significant revelations that have not yet been heard over the next several weeks and months , '' Greenwald said .
Greenwald claims `` dozens '' of stories can be generated from the documents , and that the Guardian plans to pursue all of them .
Snowden faces decades in jail for the disclosures if the U.S. can extradite him from Hong Kong , where he says he has taken refuge after saying his sole motive was to “ inform the public . ”
In a video that appeared on the Guardian ’ s website , Snowden said two NSA surveillance programs are wide open to abuse .
`` Any analyst at any time can target anyone . Any selector . Anywhere , '' Snowden said . `` I , sitting at my desk , had the authority to wiretap anyone , from you or your accountant to a federal judge to even the president if I had a personal e-mail . ''
Snowden said he was a former technical assistant for the CIA and a current employee of defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton , which released a statement Sunday confirming he had been a contractor with them in Hawaii for less than three months . Company officials have promised to work with investigators .
Snowden told the Guardian he believes the government could try to charge him with treason under the Espionage Act , but Mark Zaid , a national security attorney who represents whistle-blowers , told The Associated Press that that would require the government to prove he had intent to betray the United States . Snowden has said his “ sole motive ” was to inform the public and spur debate .
`` My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them , '' Snowden told the Guardian .
In a note accompanying the first set of documents he provided to the newspaper , Snowden wrote : `` I understand that I will be made to suffer for my actions , '' but `` I will be satisfied if the federation of secret law , unequal pardon and irresistible executive powers that rule the world that I love are revealed even for an instant . ''
Snowden told the Post he was not going to hide .
`` Allowing the U.S. government to intimidate its people with threats of retaliation for revealing wrongdoing is contrary to the public interest , '' he said in the interview published Sunday . Snowden said he would `` ask for asylum from any countries that believe in free speech and oppose the victimization of global privacy . ''
Snowden is now staying in Hong Kong and seeking asylum outside the United States , possibly in Iceland , The Guardian reports .
If the reports are accurate , Snowden could face many years in prison for releasing classified information if he is successfully extradited from Hong Kong or elsewhere .
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on Snowden 's disclosure , saying the issue has been referred to the Justice Department .
However , the agency said : `` Any person who has a security clearance knows that he or she has an obligation to protect classified information and abide by the law . ''
`` The Department of Justice is in the initial stages of an investigation into the unauthorized disclosure of classified information by an individual with authorized access , '' Justice Department spokeswoman Nanda Chitre said in a statement late Sunday .
New York Republican Rep. Peter King , chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterintelligence and Terrorism and a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence , said : `` If Edward Snowden did in fact leak the NSA data as he claims , the United States government must prosecute him to the fullest extent of the law and begin extradition proceedings at the earliest date . The United States must make it clear that no country should be granting this individual asylum . This is a matter of extraordinary consequence to American intelligence . ''
In a nearly 13-minute video that accompanied The Guardian story Sunday , Snowden says he has no intentions of hiding because he has done nothing wrong .
“ When you ’ re in positions of privileged access … . You recognize some of these things are actual abuses , ” Snowden said about his decision to be a whistle-blower . “ Over time , you feel compelled to talk about it . ”
The Guardian broke the story late Wednesday that the federal government was collecting phone call records from Verizon customers .
The Guardian and the Post followed with a series of reports about the calls being taken from other telecommunications companies and that the NSA and FBI have a Internet scouring program , code-named PRISM , that records Internet activities , all part of a post-9/11 effort to thwart terrorism .
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the Oval Office would not comment on Snowden before Monday .
Washington officials have acknowledged all branches of the federal government — Congress , the White House and federal courts — knew about the collection of data under the Patriot Act .
Still , the leaks have reopened the debate about privacy concerns versus heightened measure to protect against terrorist attacks . They also led the NSA to ask the Justice Department to conduct a criminal investigation .
Fox News confirmed the Obama administration took the first steps Saturday in a criminal investigation when officials filed a “ crimes report . ”
National Intelligence Director James Clapper has decried the leaks as reckless . And in the past days he has taken the rare step of declassifying some details about them to respond to media reports about counterterrorism techniques employed by the government .
“ Disclosing information about the specific methods the government uses to collect communications can obviously give our enemies a ‘ playbook ’ of how to avoid detection , ” Clapper said Saturday .
PRISM allows the federal government to tap directly into the servers of major U.S. Internet companies such as Google , Apple , Microsoft , Facebook and AOL , scooping out emails , video chats , instant messages and more to track foreign nationals who are suspected of terrorism or espionage .

Edward Snowden 's claim that as systems administrator for a defense contractor in Hawaii he had the authority `` to wiretap anyone , from you or your accountant to a federal judge to even the president , '' just is n't plausible , says a former national security lawyer at the Justice Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence .
On Morning Edition , NPR 's Steve Henn zeroed in on some of the things that Snowden , who has come forward to claim he 's behind the recent explosive leaks about surveillance programs run by the National Security Agency , has been heard saying in interviews with The Guardian .
Carrie Cordero , the former Justice and DNI lawyer , is now director of national securities studies at Georgetown University Law Center . She tells Steve that `` the notion that this individual has the authority to go ahead and ... 'wiretap ' people is just ridiculous . ''

NSA Leaker : ' I 'm Neither Traitor Nor Hero . I 'm An American '","Experts Doubt NSA Leaker's Claim About Wiretaps

From 'Morning Edition': Steve Henn reports on the plausibility of Edward Snowden's claims Listen

Edward Snowden's claim that as systems administrator for a defense contractor in Hawaii he had the authority ""to wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant to a federal judge to even the president,"" just isn't plausible, says a former national security lawyer at the Justice Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

On Morning Edition, NPR's Steve Henn zeroed in on some of the things that Snowden, who has come forward to claim he's behind the recent explosive leaks about surveillance programs run by the National Security Agency, has been heard saying in interviews with The Guardian.

Carrie Cordero, the former Justice and DNI lawyer, is now director of national securities studies at Georgetown University Law Center. She tells Steve that ""the notion that this individual has the authority to go ahead and ... 'wiretap' people is just ridiculous.""

Without discussing the details of how such surveillance programs work and the safeguards that are in place to protect privacy, Cordero says Snowden's claim ""does not resemble anything close to what I observed within the intelligence community.""

`` One of the most important responsibilities a senator has is oversight of the intelligence community , '' Wyden said . `` This job can not be done responsibly if senators are n't getting straight answers to direct questions . ''

On Saturday , Clapper told NBC News that he `` responded in what I thought was the most truthful , or least most untruthful , manner . ''
He told NBC that he had interpreted `` collection '' to mean actually examining the materials gathered by the NSA .
He had previously told the National Journal that he had meant that `` the NSA does not voyeuristically pore through U.S. citizens ' e-mails , '' but he did not mention e-mails at the hearing .

Hayden said he was surprised this kind of data would have been available to Snowden .

A federal law enforcement source told CNN on Monday that the government 's investigation will include searches of Snowden 's home and efforts to interview his girlfriend , relatives , co-workers and friends .
The official did not know if the FBI would attempt to contact Snowden overseas and ask if he would agree to a voluntary interview , or if the agency would wait until other evidence had been gathered .
While Snowden said he fled to Hong Kong in hopes of avoiding extradition , what 's next for him remains unclear .
Although Hong Kong is part of communist-ruled China , the former British colony has a separate system of government that allows a free press and tolerates political dissent .

Urgent: Should the NSA Spy on Americans? Vote Here Now

This vacuum-cleaner approach to data collection has rattled allies.

""The magnitude of the eavesdropping is what shocked us,"" former French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said in a radio interview. ""Let's be honest, we eavesdrop too. Everyone is listening to everyone else. But we don't have the same means as the United States, which makes us jealous.""

So where in the world isn't the NSA? That's one big question raised by the disclosures.

Diplomatic relations are built on trust. If America's credibility is in question, the U.S. will find it harder to maintain alliances, influence world opinion and maybe even close trade deals.

But spying among allies is not new.

Madeleine Albright, secretary of state during the Clinton administration, recalled being at the United Nations and having the French ambassador ask her why she said something in a private conversation apparently intercepted by the French.

The French government protested revelations this past week that the NSA had collected 70.3 million French-based telephone and electronic message records in a 30-day period.

Albright says Snowden's disclosures have hurt U.S. policymakers.

""A lot of the things that have come out, I think are specifically damaging because they are negotiating positions and a variety of ways that we have to go about business,"" Albright said at a conference hosted by the Center for American Progress in Washington.

""I think it has made life very difficult for Secretary Kerry. ... There has to be a set of private talks that, in fact, precede negotiations and I think it makes it very, very hard.""

The revelations could undercut Washington's effort to fight terrorism, says Kiron Skinner, director of the Center for International Relations and Politics at Carnegie Mellon University. The broad nature of NSA surveillance goes against the Obama administration's claim that much of U.S. espionage is carried out to combat terrorism, she said.

""If Washington undermines its own leadership or that of its allies, the collective ability of the West to combat terrorism will be compromised,"" Skinner said. ""Allied leaders will have no incentive to put their own militaries at risk if they cannot trust U.S. leadership.""

The administration asserts that the U.S. is amassing intelligence of the type gathered by all nations and that it's necessary to protect the U.S. and its allies against security threats.

Kerry discussed the NSA affair in Europe with French and Italian officials this past week.

Most governments have not retaliated, but some countries are pushing back.

Germany and France are demanding that the administration agree by year's end to new rules that could mean an end to reported American eavesdropping on foreign leaders, companies and innocent citizens.

Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff canceled her official state visit to the White House. She ordered measures aimed at greater Brazilian online independence and security after learning that the NSA intercepted her communications, hacked into the state-owned Petrobras oil company's network and spied on Brazilians.

Brazil says it is working with other countries to draft a U.N. General Assembly resolution that would guarantee people's privacy in electronic communications.

A European Parliament committee approved rules that would strengthen online privacy and outlaw the kind of data transfers the U.S. is using for its spying program.



Urgent: Should the NSA Spy on Americans? Vote Here Now

European lawmakers have called for the suspension of an agreement that grants U.S. authorities access to bank data needed for terrorism-related investigations.

Last-minute negotiations over the details of a congressional surveillance bill have resulted in restrictions around the National Security Agency ’ s massive repository of analysed call data .
Intense closed-door talks between lawmakers and Obama administration and intelligence officials that wrapped up Tuesday afternoon have finalised the language of the USA Freedom Act . The bill is expected to receive a vote on the House floor on Thursday .
The latest twist for the bill is an expanded provision that would require the government to “ promptly ” purge phone records that do not contain “ foreign intelligence information , ” effectively pruning irrelevant records from the NSA ’ s trees of analyzed phone data .
But several other changes to the bill , which civil libertarians already considered watered down after a series of legislative compromises , have cost it critical support from privacy groups ahead of Thursday ’ s vote .
Under the new provision , the government would have to “ adopt minimisation procedures that require the prompt destruction of all call detail records ” turned over by the telecoms firms “ that the government determines are not foreign intelligence information . ”
The government would ultimately have to “ destroy all call detail records produced under the order as prescribed by such procedures ” .
A previous version of that language tasked the government merely with destroying call records “ not later than five years after the production of such records , except for records that are relevant to an authorised investigation . ”
While several privacy protections within the USA Freedom Act have been diluted in recent weeks , several people familiar with the negotiations said they thought the new provision better protects privacy than the old one , as it represents the first known restriction on the NSA ’ s “ corporate store ” of analysed data .
The “ corporate store ” is the digital warehouse where the NSA stores all the US call records it has amassed when searching for connections to the target phone numbers it believes may be tied to specific terrorist groups . Until this year , data up to three “ hops ” from such a phone number was fit for inclusion in the store .
Once data is placed in the store , NSA analysts face virtually no restrictions on their ability to search through it .
“ NSA may apply the full range of Sigint [ signals intelligence ] analytic tradecraft ” to phone records placed in the store , according to a footnote in a Fisa court order declassified by the government last year . Searches through data placed in the corporate store can occur “ without the requirement ” that reasonable articulable suspicion of connection to wrongdoing exist ; nor is the NSA required to keep an “ auditable record ” of searches performed within the corporate store .
The amount of data contained within the corporate store is voluminous . A January report from the US government ’ s civil liberties watchdog estimated that the 300 searches of Americans ’ phone data the NSA said it performed in 2012 would yield “ records involving over 120m phone numbers ” in that year alone .
The watchdog , the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board , recommended that the NSA have to possess the same “ reasonable articulable suspicion ” to search data in the corporate store as it must to analyse phone records once collected .
Until now , the USA Freedom Act , increasingly the consensus bill for surveillance reforms , left the “ corporate store ” alone .
Under the bill , the government would no longer collect call records in bulk . But it would be permitted to acquire Americans ’ phone data when a judge certifies that there is reasonable articulable suspicion of a connection to terrorism or foreign espionage , and it can collect phone records from the contacts of the contacts – two “ hops ” – of the original person or phone account the government targets .
The new language would apparently restrict the NSA from retaining data on the contacts of the targets not believed to have a connection to foreign intelligence information – what surveillance observers sometimes refer to as the “ pizza guy ” problem , where the NSA amasses data on random and irrelevant people or accounts connected to targets .
But the language does not define key terms , such as how long a record can be withheld before its “ prompt ” destruction . Nor does it specify how the government will “ determine ” a call record is unrelated to foreign intelligence information if , as can occur with the corporate store today , NSA ’ s automated programs sift through the data .
`` Placing meaningful limits on the NSA 's use of this vast pool of data is crucial to protecting Americans ' privacy – and to any reform effort . Congress should not leave the NSA with a wide open backdoor to many of Americans ' call records via the corporate store , ” said Patrick Toomey , a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union , who has focused on the corporate store .
A deal on the corporate store restriction was easier to reach than over a different critical definition contained within the USA Freedom Act – one that defines the source of the records the government will be able to collect .
That category is a “ specific selection term. ” That is the root data from which the government must suspect of connection to terrorism or espionage to launch the collection of call records . Without possessing that term , the government can not collect obtain the call records at issue .
The version of the USA Freedom Act that cleared House committees earlier this month defined it simply as a term that “ uniquely describe [ s ] a person , entity , or account . ”
But the version that will head to the floor , at the Obama administration ’ s insistence , has broadened the definition , opening the door to broader data collection than the bill ’ s architect ’ s initially envisioned .
The bill now defines a “ specific selection term ” as “ a discrete term , such as a term specifically identifying a person , entity , account , or device , used by the government to limit the scope of the information or tangible things sought . ”
Sources familiar with the process said the government had pushed for an even broader definition .
Privacy groups had already watched with dismay as their favored bill gradually grew less restrictive on the NSA and its transparency requirements about what recipients of surveillance orders can disclose to their customers became weaker .

Enact new laws to end the NSA 's systematic collection of Americans ' phone metadata — which include details on telephone calls similar to a phone bill but not the content of conversations — and require the agency to get a federal court order to get that information either from the telephone company or from a newly designated `` private third party .

Pros : Would prevent the NSA from using the bulk data to go on data-mining `` fishing expeditions '' to discover possibly spurious connections between individuals and groups based on the details of their phone calls .

The connection could be significant , or maybe not .
Cons : Could slow down the government 's access to such data and hamper investigations . Also , an NSA analysis reportedly found `` significant costs to phone companies to retain the data . ''
Require the president and senior national security officials to sign off on any NSA eavesdropping on foreign leaders ' phone calls and emails .
Pros : Could help smooth the ruffled feathers of foreign leaders who 've been the target of such snooping , as revealed by the Snowden leaks , most famously German Chancellor Angela Merkel , whose cellphone was monitored by the NSA .
Cons : As a former senior intelligence official tells The Washington Post , the entire reason for U.S. intelligence agencies is to `` collect foreign intelligence without regard to the civil liberties of the targets , '' he says . `` It 's a dangerous road to go down to start worrying about the civil liberties and constitutional rights of people like the president of Pakistan or the senior military commander in Libya .

Require a `` judicial finding '' for all National Security Letters , or NSLs ( administrative subpoenas ) , before financial and phone records can be seized by the FBI .

A committee tasked by the White House with reviewing U.S. electronic surveillance has come up with 46 proposed changes to National Security Agency spying practices. Here are arguments for and against five recommendations that President Obama may take up in a speech announcing policy changes Friday:

Limit Access To Bulk Telephone Data

Enact new laws to end the NSA's systematic collection of Americans' phone metadata — which include details on telephone calls similar to a phone bill but not the content of conversations — and require the agency to get a federal court order to get that information either from the telephone company or from a newly designated ""private third party.""

Pros: Would prevent the NSA from using the bulk data to go on data-mining ""fishing expeditions"" to discover possibly spurious connections between individuals and groups based on the details of their phone calls. As some critics have pointed out, the search through mounds of metadata can be a bit like the game ""six degrees of separation"": A knows B, who knows C. The connection could be significant, or maybe not.

Cons: Could slow down the government's access to such data and hamper investigations. Also, an NSA analysis reportedly found ""significant costs to phone companies to retain the data.""

Privacy Safeguards For Foreign Leaders

Require the president and senior national security officials to sign off on any NSA eavesdropping on foreign leaders' phone calls and emails.

Pros: Could help smooth the ruffled feathers of foreign leaders who've been the target of such snooping, as revealed by the Snowden leaks, most famously German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose cellphone was monitored by the NSA.

Cons: As a former senior intelligence official tells The Washington Post, the entire reason for U.S. intelligence agencies is to ""collect foreign intelligence without regard to the civil liberties of the targets,"" he says. ""It's a dangerous road to go down to start worrying about the civil liberties and constitutional rights of people like the president of Pakistan or the senior military commander in Libya.""

Judicial Approval Of Seizure Of Financial And Phone Records

Require a ""judicial finding"" for all National Security Letters, or NSLs (administrative subpoenas), before financial and phone records can be seized by the FBI.

Pros: Greater protection against broad sweeps of such records by law enforcement. The American Civil Liberties Union says ""The FBI issues up to 50,000 of these a year in terrorism investigations, even for the records of people who are suspected of no wrongdoing.""

Cons: The extra step involved in obtaining vital information could slow down ""hot pursuit"" investigations, officials say, and back in 2008, the Justice Department's inspector general found that incidents of misuse were ""infrequent and unintentional,"" according to the Heritage Foundation.

Appoint Advocate To Safeguard Civil Liberties

Create a ""public interest advocate"" to appear before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court to represent civil liberties concerns.

Pros: Would keep intelligence services focused on preventing abuses of civil liberties, as well as the kinds of alleged overreach that has sparked the current debate over government's surveillance activities.

Cons: Judge John Bates, the former head of the FISA Court, says appointing such an advocate is ""unnecessary and could prove counterproductive in the vast majority of FISA matters."" Carrie Cordero, the director of national security studies and an adjunct law professor at Georgetown University, says she's ""concerned about the practical impact, over time, of an adversarial process, prior to collection, becoming a bureaucratic impediment to conducting needed foreign intelligence activities.""

Halt NSA Efforts To Crack Encryption

Halt NSA efforts to undermine secure encryption standards used by tech companies and businesses.

Pros: Would give Americans a reasonable expectation of privacy in their email and social media activities.

Cons: Being able to read email sent and received by the ""bad guys"" might prove key to heading off potential terrorist plots, intelligence officials contend.

We'll continue to sift through these documents and seek interpretations. If you find something in them that you think noteworthy, let us know in the comments. We'll update this post with more throughout the day.

Update at 1:31 p.m. ET. Exceptions For Technical Personnel:

One of the interesting passages in the FISC order is where it talks about exceptions for technical personnel. Essentially, the court says, the people who make this data searchable and usable are allowed to query it without having to adhere to the safeguards.

That said, any of the information queried is not allowed to be used for ""intelligence analysis purposes.""

The order marked `` Top Secret '' and issued by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court directs Verizon 's Business Network Services Inc and Verizon Business Services units to hand over electronic data including all calling records on an `` ongoing , daily basis '' until the order expires on July 19 , 2013 .
Signed by Judge Roger Vinson at the request of the FBI , the order covers each phone number dialed by all customers and location and routing data , along with the duration and frequency of the calls , but not the contents of the communications .
The disclosure comes as the Obama administration is already under fire on other privacy and First Amendment issues . In particular , it is being criticized for a search of Associated Press journalists ' calling records and the emails of a Fox television reporter in leak inquiries .
Officials at the White House and the NSA declined immediate comment . Verizon spokesman Ed McFadden declined to comment .
Verizon 's biggest rival , AT & T Inc , did not provide any immediate comment when asked if the government had made a similar request for its data .
`` That 's not the society we 've built in the United States , '' said Kurt Opsahl , an attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which is suing the NSA over surveillance inside the country . `` It 's not the society we set forth in the Constitution , and it 's not the society we should have . ''
The order expressly compels Verizon to turn over both international calling records and strictly domestic records , and it forbids disclosure of the order 's existence . It refers to mobile and landline numbers , though not explicitly to Verizon 's consumer business .
The order is the first concrete evidence that U.S. intelligence officials are continuing a broad campaign of domestic surveillance that began under President George W. Bush and caused great controversy when it was first exposed .
In 2005 , the New York Times reported that the NSA was wiretapping Americans without warrants on international calls . Los Angeles Times and USA Today later reported that the agency also had unchecked access to records on domestic calls .
In addition , a former AT & T technician , Mark Klein , said that a room accessible only with NSA clearance in the carrier 's main San Francisco hub received perfect copies of all transmissions .
Privacy lawsuits against the government are continuing , though cases filed against the phone carriers were dismissed after Congress passed a 2008 law immunizing the companies that complied with government requests . That law also allowed for broader information-seeking , though methods must be approved by the special court handling foreign intelligence matters .
The new order cites legal language from the 2001 U.S. Patriot Act , passed soon after the Sept. 11 attacks , that allows the FBI to seek an order to obtain `` any tangible thing , '' including business records , in pursuit of `` foreign intelligence information . ''

The order marked ""Top Secret"" and issued by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court directs Verizon's Business Network Services Inc and Verizon Business Services units to hand over electronic data including all calling records on an ""ongoing, daily basis"" until the order expires on July 19, 2013.

Signed by Judge Roger Vinson at the request of the FBI, the order covers each phone number dialed by all customers and location and routing data, along with the duration and frequency of the calls, but not the contents of the communications.

The disclosure comes as the Obama administration is already under fire on other privacy and First Amendment issues. In particular, it is being criticized for a search of Associated Press journalists' calling records and the emails of a Fox television reporter in leak inquiries.

Officials at the White House and the NSA declined immediate comment. Verizon spokesman Ed McFadden declined to comment.

Verizon's biggest rival, AT&T Inc, did not provide any immediate comment when asked if the government had made a similar request for its data.

""That's not the society we've built in the United States,"" said Kurt Opsahl, an attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is suing the NSA over surveillance inside the country. ""It's not the society we set forth in the Constitution, and it's not the society we should have.""

Mobile and landline numbers

The order expressly compels Verizon to turn over both international calling records and strictly domestic records, and it forbids disclosure of the order's existence. It refers to mobile and landline numbers, though not explicitly to Verizon's consumer business.

The order is the first concrete evidence that U.S. intelligence officials are continuing a broad campaign of domestic surveillance that began under President George W. Bush and caused great controversy when it was first exposed.

In 2005, the New York Times reported that the NSA was wiretapping Americans without warrants on international calls. Los Angeles Times and USA Today later reported that the agency also had unchecked access to records on domestic calls.

In addition, a former AT&T technician, Mark Klein, said that a room accessible only with NSA clearance in the carrier's main San Francisco hub received perfect copies of all transmissions.

Privacy lawsuits against the government are continuing, though cases filed against the phone carriers were dismissed after Congress passed a 2008 law immunizing the companies that complied with government requests. That law also allowed for broader information-seeking, though methods must be approved by the special court handling foreign intelligence matters.

The new order cites legal language from the 2001 U.S. Patriot Act, passed soon after the Sept. 11 attacks, that allows the FBI to seek an order to obtain ""any tangible thing,"" including business records, in pursuit of ""foreign intelligence information.""

President Obama says he welcomes a debate about the National Security Agency's surveillance programs. So far, there's not much sign of one happening, at least on Capitol Hill.

Leading members of Congress remain largely supportive of the effort to ""protect America,"" as some senators have characterized broad tracking of Internet and phone activity.

House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, called Edward Snowden, the source of leaks about the NSA activities, a ""traitor."" Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida congresswoman who is also the Democratic National Committee chair, called Snowden a coward who ""should be extradited, arrested and prosecuted.""

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said that members of Congress have had plenty of opportunities to learn about surveillance programs prior to the leak through briefings.

""Some large number of members of Congress would just as soon avoid that [debate about the government's legal authority],"" says Kate Martin, director of the Center for National Security Studies, which advocates for strong civil liberties protections. ""There's no doubt about that.""

Voices Of Concern

There have been some voices critical of the blanket authority the administration believes it has to track domestic communications.

""This changes the very character of American society and what it means to be an American,"" Democratic Rep. Rush Holt of New Jersey said in a statement. ""It is also a very wasteful, inefficient way to try to protect the safety of Americans.""

The ACLU on Tuesday filed a lawsuit, complaining that the phone tracking program violates both First Amendment rights to free speech and Fourth Amendment privacy rights.

A bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill Tuesday that would require disclosure of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court opinions or, when secrecy is necessary, at least summaries.

""We expect the disclosures about the ongoing surveillance programs over the past week will lead senators to rethink whether the opinions of this court should be kept secret,"" says Jamal Raad, spokesman for Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley.

A group of 13 senators on Wednesday called for a full investigation.

What Polls Suggest

A big question, says Aftergood, is whether there will be calls from the public to alter the NSA's methods, or at least demand greater oversight.

So far, public opinion polls have been mixed. A CBS News poll conducted June 9-10 showed that 58 percent disapprove of surveillance of ""ordinary Americans,"" although 75 percent approved of tracking terrorists.

Limited Public Reaction

In any event, the phones have not been ringing off the hook at congressional offices. Americans are not yet, at least, storming the Capitol in protest.

That means that Snowden's efforts to alert the public to the dangers of such wide surveillance could ultimately backfire, says Aftergood, a critic of the NSA programs.

Because of the extraordinary revelations last week by the Guardian, Congress and the American people now know that the Patriot Act is being used by the National Security Agency to collect the phone records of all Americans, every day. There’s no more debate about whether the government, and the military at that, is spying on us: only whether Congress is going to stop them.

Section 215 of the Patriot Act allows the government to obtain ‘any tangible thing’ relevant to an investigation. According to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, this authority has been used to collect all phone records in the U.S., even those of law-abiding citizens who have no connection to crime or terrorism whatsoever. The administration and a few members of Congress have confirmed and defended this practice as necessary to protect national security.

Story Continued Below

But there’s no reason to believe that the government’s collection efforts stop there. Last year, there were 212 of these Section 215 orders so the full extent of the NSA’s surveillance is still within the agency’s black box. Some news reports say that these programs include financial data and email records too. This is entirely possible given the breadth of Section 215. The program’s advocates claim that records do not implicate privacy and that the collection of “metadata” does not infringe on anyone’s rights.

Nothing could be farther from the truth.

These records reflect who you know, what you do, and where you go. Furthermore, if metadata wasn’t incredibly rich and revealing, the government wouldn’t be collecting them at a breakneck pace. As mathematician and former Sun Microsystems engineer Susan Landau told the New Yorker’s Jane Mayer, metadata is “much more intrusive than content.”

The days of closed-door briefings and secret court orders are over on Capitol Hill. Congress must force public disclosure about what information the government is collecting on us, and what is done with it. The status quo has gotten us mass domestic surveillance and it is untenable, particularly if we are to remain a free society resting upon a foundation of individual rights. Ceding oversight and decision-making to the Intelligence committees has resulted in secret hearings to learn about secret court orders that authorize secret spying on Americans. The leaked court order contains no sources or methods, and it is now clear that secrecy serves not national security but protecting decision makers from their employers, the American people.

Like metadata, the agency is apparently storing this for use later after a court order is obtained.The Times report says that the N.S.A. now considers facial images just as important as fingerprints and other identifiers in tracking suspected terrorists and other intelligence targets.Meanwhile, the agency has also used the images to perfect facial recognition technology. It has turned to new software to exploit the flood of images included in emails, text messages, social media, videoconferences and other communications, the N.S.A. documents reveal, according to the Times.""It's not just the traditional communications we're after: It's taking a full-arsenal approach that digitally exploits the clues a target leaves behind in their regular activities on the net to compile biographic and biometric information"" that can help ""implement precision targeting,"" noted a 2010 document obtained by the Times.An NSA spokesperson told The Times the agency is required to get a court order to collect imagery of U.S. citizens, however.""We would not be doing our job if we didn't seek ways to continuously improve the precision of signals intelligence activities — aiming to counteract the efforts of valid foreign intelligence targets to disguise themselves or conceal plans to harm the United States and its allies,"" said NSA spokeswoman Vanee M. Vines.The facial recognition effort of NSA was hinted at in previous reporting from The Guardian in February that revealed that Britain's GCHQ surveillance agency had collected millions of still webcam images from Yahoo users with a program called Optic Nerve.",www.newsmax.com,right,hebxnq9Lxr0OODnj

Venezuelan state media reports Venezuela has already offered asylum

The U.S. intelligence leaker has been holed up at the Moscow airport

Two weeks after arriving at Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport and essentially becoming a man without a country, Edward Snowden finally has some options.

A trio of left-leaning Latin American nations to varying degrees say they would welcome the U.S. intelligence leaker in their country. Venezuela and Bolivia have offered asylum to Snowden and Nicaragua is willing to consider it.

Bolivian President Evo Morales, who became part of the saga when his presidential plane was denied permission to enter the airspace of several European countries amid a rumor about Snowden, said his country is ""willing to give asylum."" A day earlier, Venezuelan state media reported that President Nicolas Maduro had offered Snowden asylum.

The reports came shortly after Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said he would grant Snowden asylum in his country ""if the circumstances permit.""

Wanted by the United States, Snowden had faced a string of rejections to asylum bids he placed to numerous countries. The Latin American countries were the first to respond in the positive.

The asylum offers could provide Snowden a chance to evade U.S. authorities, though it is unclear how he would get to Venezuela or the other countries.

Snowden's exit from Russia, however, would provide relief to authorities there, who appeared to grow weary of the American's presence at the airport.

Alexei Pushkov, head of the lower Russian legislative body DUMA, recommended Snowden leave the airport, where he has been holed up since June 23, when he arrived from Hong Kong.

""Sanctuary for Snowden in Venezuela would be the best solution,"" Pushkov tweeted Saturday. ""He can't live in at Sheremetyevo.""

Venezuela's foreign minister said Saturday that it has had no contact with Snowden since its asylum offer Friday, according to Reuters.

Meanwhile, an Icelandic lawmaker said Snowden would not get citizenship there, as he had requested, because Iceland's parliament refused to vote on an asylum proposal before ending its current session.

Birgitta Jonsdottir was among a handful of lawmakers who put forward a bill Thursday urging Parliament to process Snowden's request. She said Friday that the speaker of the house refused to put the bill on the agenda and the majority in parliament refused to allow a voice vote on it.

Bolivia's position on asylum follows outrage expressed by its president over his sidetracked trip from Russia to Bolivia this week.

Several European countries refused to allow Morales' plane through their airspace Tuesday because of suspicions Snowden was aboard . With no clear path home available, the flight crew made an emergency landing in Vienna, Austria, where authorities confirmed Snowden was not a passenger.

Bolivia's asylum offer is a ""fair protest"" to the incident, which involved Portugal, Italy, France and Spain, Morales said. Spain has said it did not restrict its airspace during that flight.

He put the blame squarely on the United States for the incident.

""Message to the Americans: The empire and its servants will never be able to intimidate or scare us,"" Morales told supporters at El Alto International Airport outside La Paz, where he arrived late Wednesday. ""European countries need to liberate themselves from the imperialism of the Americans.""

Morales said officials should analyze whether to shut the U.S. Embassy in his country.

For a decade, members of Washington’s political establishment have derided civil libertarians, mocking their warnings about the slow but dangerous creep of the Surveillance State. Sen. John McCain, one of Big Brother’s most vocal cheerleaders on Capitol Hill, recently referred to his colleagues who expressed concern about the Obama administration’s use of drones as “wacko birds.”

Yet with last week’s revelations of the National Security Agency’s widespread programs of virtually unlimited surveillance of American citizens, the birds have come home to roost. As I warned a decade ago when it was becoming clear that the government had no intention of relinquishing the power entrusted to it after Sept. 11, 2001, the day would come when routine, warrantless surveillance would be institutionalized. Welcome to yesterday.

In the years since I and some conservative colleagues, among them Grover Norquist and David Keene, first warned about the ramifications of Uncle Sam’s unquenchable thirst for data on American citizens, things have only worsened as technology has advanced. Rather than heed the warnings from privacy activists and a few members of Congress, President Obama and his Cabinet cohorts have expanded executive authority beyond all reasonable bounds, to surreptitiously and unlawfully spy on all citizens in order to “keep us safe.”

Not surprisingly, the Obama administration employs the same, boilerplate “national security” justification as its predecessor.

Mr. Obama said then, “This [Bush] administration acts like violating civil liberties is the way to enhance our security. It is not.” Apparently, it all depends on who is doing the violating.

To hold that the president has “inherent power” to secretly purloin, indefinitely store and analyze at will however much private data technology enables it to obtain from telephone and Internet communications by millions of law-abiding citizens effectively nullifies the Fourth Amendment. We indeed have come full circle back to the despised “general warrants” that King George’s agents employed as a means of controlling his Colonial subjects.

We now are “subjects” once again.

Before us lies irrefutable proof of this panoptic technology; within its unseen walls, everything from cellphone metadata to emails, video and voice chats, photos, stored data, file transfers, videoconferencing, and social-media activity are all hostage to the ever-open eye of Uncle Sam’s benign agents, implementing “Prism,” “Carnivore,” “Stellar Wind” or whatever clever acronym the bureaucrats concoct.

These government snoops and their masters clearly understand what Ayn Rand explained many decades ago: “When you take away a man’s privacy, you gain the power to control him absolutely.”

How Uncle Sam has gone about taking away our privacy is clever — not lawful, but clever.

Intelligence agencies, in securing a secret court order to conduct dragnet data-mining on millions of citizens, found their “authority” in a provision of the USA Patriot Act (the infamous Section 215) that never was intended for such purpose. By using this “business records” provision, the Obama administration also cleverly circumvents even the weak limitations on such eavesdropping contained in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

Whether Congress now wakes from its decadelong slumber and opposes these abuses of power remains to be seen. Ever since certain Patriot Act provisions first were subject to reauthorization in 2005 and 2006, Congress has routinely renewed them. Even today, high-ranking members of Congress, including Mr. Chambliss and his Senate colleague from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, glibly brush aside charges that the government is improperly gathering information to which it is neither entitled, nor is it necessary. For Mr. Chambliss, the fact that no citizen “has registered a complaint” about the supersecret surveillance program is evidence of its constitutionality. From Mr. Graham, we hear the childish refrain, “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.”

With such profound constitutional understanding as reflected in these statements, is it any wonder Americans hold Congress in such low regard?

Unfortunately, “we told you so” is of little solace if our representatives in Congress and our supposed constitutional guardians in the federal judiciary remain compliant in these unprecedented, massive invasions of our privacy by the executive branch.

`` We have no information to offer at the moment , '' a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry , Hua Chunying , said in response to a question about Snowden at a regular news briefing in Beijing on Thursday . She repeated the same answer to several follow-up questions .
Snowden , 29 , has rocked the Obama administration and U.S. intelligence community by providing documents to journalists revealing the existence of secret programs to collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and the Internet activity of overseas residents .
U.S. security officials homed in on Snowden after Britain 's Guardian newspaper informed the Obama administration that it was planning to publish articles based on documents it had obtained , a U.S. official said .

The reaction in mainland China , on the other hand , has been muted . State-run media outlets have covered the case cautiously , appearing to try to avoid focusing too much attention on some of the sensitive issues his disclosures have raised , such as government surveillance of citizens .
The Snowden story has also so far failed to make big waves among China 's tens of millions of highly active social media users .

The claims came just days after U.S. President Barack Obama pressed Chinese President Xi Jinping to address cyberattacks emanating from China that Obama described as `` direct theft of United States property . ''
Snowden 's allegations appear to give weight to claims by some Chinese government officials that the country has been a victim of similar hacking efforts coming from the United States .
His claims came as Gen. Keith Alexander , the National Security Agency chief , testified at a U.S. Senate hearing that the country 's cyberinfrastructure , including telephones and computer networks , is somewhat vulnerable to attack .
On a scale of one to 10 , `` our critical infrastructure 's preparedness to withstand a destructive cyberattack is about a three , based on my experience , '' he said .

Snowden has n't been charged , but he has told The Guardian that he expects the United States to try to prosecute him . He worked for the computer consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton until Monday , when he was fired after outing himself as the leaker .
Snowden told the South China Morning Post that he felt U.S. officials were pressuring his family and also accused them of `` trying to bully '' Hong Kong into extraditing him to prevent the release of more damaging information .
He vowed to resist extradition efforts if it comes to that , saying he `` would rather stay and fight the United States government in the courts , because I have faith in Hong Kong 's rule of law . ''

The U.S. hacks computers in China, the NSA leaker tells a newspaper

He revealed secret U.S. programs that collect data on phone and Internet activity

""We have no information to offer,"" a Chinese official says

China remained tight-lipped Thursday about its stance on NSA leaker Edward Snowden, who is believed to be holed up in a safe house somewhere in the semiautonomous territory of Hong Kong.

Snowden provided fresh fuel Wednesday for the controversy he has sparked, telling a Hong Kong newspaper that U.S. intelligence agents have been hacking networks around the world for years, including hundreds of computers in China.

In the interview with the South China Morning Post, he also said he plans to stay in Hong Kong to fight any attempt to force him to return to the United States because he has ""faith in Hong Kong's rule of law."" His comments come as the FBI is investigating his case.

His presence in the southern Chinese territory, which has a separate system of government from the mainland, has raised questions about how an effort by the U.S. government to extradite him would unfold and what role Beijing might play in the process.

But China's first official comment on the matter gave away no clues.

Snowden, 29, has rocked the Obama administration and U.S. intelligence community by providing documents to journalists revealing the existence of secret programs to collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and the Internet activity of overseas residents.

Differing reactions

U.S. security officials homed in on Snowden after Britain's Guardian newspaper informed the Obama administration that it was planning to publish articles based on documents it had obtained, a U.S. official said. Authorities then quickly tried to determine who might have access to such information, as well as what documents were downloaded and by whom.

Snowden -- who had taken leave from work at an NSA facility in Hawaii a few weeks before -- quickly came to their attention, said the official. Authorities were ""making progress"" toward pinpointing the source of the leaks when Snowden went public, said a second U.S. official. Both officials spoke to CNN on the condition that they not be identified.

There are ""no signs or indications"" that Snowden had accomplices or tried to sell secrets, this official said. Investigators think the leaker is still in Hong Kong and have a general sense of where he is in that Asian metropolis.

Snowden's case has become a hot issue in that coastal city, making local newspaper front pages, stirring legal debates and prompting plans for a rally in support of him over the weekend.

The reaction in mainland China, on the other hand, has been muted. State-run media outlets have covered the case cautiously, appearing to try to avoid focusing too much attention on some of the sensitive issues his disclosures have raised, such as government surveillance of citizens.

The Snowden story has also so far failed to make big waves among China's tens of millions of highly active social media users.

Some Chinese state media took the opportunity Thursday to highlight Snowden's comments to the South China Morning Post alleging that the U.S. government has hacked Chinese targets.

In recent years, the Global Times newspaper said in an editorial, ""the United States has always claimed itself to be a victim of Chinese hacking activities.

Hacking claims

Among some 61,000 reported targets of the National Security Agency, Snowden told the Hong Kong newspaper, are hundreds of computers in China.

U.S. officials have increasingly accused China of being the source of thousands of attacks on U.S. military and commercial networks. Beijing has denied such attacks.

The South China Morning Post said it had seen documents provided by Snowden but was unable to verify their authenticity. The newspaper also said it was unable to independently verify allegations of U.S. hacking of networks in Hong Kong and mainland China since 2009.

Snowden told the paper that some of the targets included the Chinese University of Hong Kong, public officials and students. The documents also ""point to hacking activity by the NSA against mainland targets,"" it reported.

More on the USA Freedom Act:

Purpose: To rein in the dragnet collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA) and other government agencies, increase transparency of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), provide businesses the ability to release information regarding FISA requests, and create an independent constitutional advocate to argue cases before the FISC.



End bulk collection of Americans’ communications records

• The USA Freedom Act ends bulk collection under Section 215 of the Patriot Act.

• The bill would strengthen the prohibition on ""reverse targeting"" of Americans—that is, targeting a foreigner with the goal of obtaining communications involving an American.

• The bill requires the government to more aggressively filter and discard information about Americans accidentally collected through PRISM and related programs.



Reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court

• The USA Freedom Act creates an Office of the Special Advocate (OSA) tasked with promoting privacy interests before the FISA court’s closed proceedings. The OSA will have the authority to appeal decisions of the FISA court.

• The bill creates new and more robust reporting requirements to ensure that Congress is aware of actions by the FISC and intelligence community as a whole.

• The bill would grant the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board subpoena authority to investigate issues related to privacy and national security.



Increase Transparency

• The USA Freedom Act would end secret laws by requiring the Attorney General to publicly disclose all FISC decisions issued after July 10, 2003 that contain a significant construction or interpretation of law.

• Under the bill, Internet and telecom companies would be allowed to publicly report an estimate of (1) the number of FISA orders and national security letters received, (2) the number of such orders and letters complied with, and (3) the number of users or accounts on whom information was demanded under the orders and letters.

• The bill would require the government to make annual or semiannual public reports estimating the total number of individuals and U.S. persons that were subject to FISA orders authorizing electronic surveillance, pen/trap devices, and access to business records.

• The USA Freedom Act adopts a single standard for Section 215 and NSL protection to ensure the Administration doesn’t use different authorities to support bulk collection. It also adds a sunset date to NSLs requiring that Congress reauthorize the government’s authority thereby ensuring proper congressional review.

( TRANSCRIPT: President Obama's remarks on NSA program)

The reforms are the most substantial public response by the White House to criticism at home and abroad over the scope of U.S. surveillance activities revealed in documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

Obama made the case that U.S. intelligence officials have not broken the law or spied on the calls or e-mails of “ordinary people.”

“In an extraordinarily difficult job, one in which actions are second-guessed, success is unreported, and failure can be catastrophic, the men and women of the intelligence community, including the NSA, consistently follow protocols designed to protect the privacy of ordinary people,” Obama said. “They are not abusing authorities in order to listen to your private phone calls, or read your emails.”

And yet Obama said the United States will not halt intelligence-gathering activities while the global threats remain. He said foreign governments — without naming any — continue trying to hack into U.S. government data. For this reason, Obama said, mobile phones are not allowed inside the White House Situation Room.

“We cannot unilaterally disarm our intelligence agencies,” Obama said. “We know that the intelligence services of other countries — including some who feign surprise over the Snowden disclosures — are constantly probing our government and private sector networks, and accelerating programs to listen to our conversations, intercept our emails, or compromise our systems.”

Obama’s proposal pushes in the direction of keeping the call data in the private sector: either with phone companies themselves or a third-party which would pool data from all companies. He also raised the possibility that other intelligence agency capabilities might be able to replace the program.

Obama asked Attorney General Eric Holder and intelligence officials to come up with a detailed plan by March 28 for how to maintain the government’s ability to tap into the calling data.

In the meantime, Obama said every government search of telecommunications data will require review by the FISA court. Until now, NSA personnel have been able to request the data based on a “reasonable, articulable suspicion” that phone numbers are tied to terrorist activity.

The president declared that the government will no longer access phone records more than two people removed from an individual officials are monitoring, down from three people removed under existing court orders.

The National Security Agency spent Friday on the defensive , after details got out about an internal audit that found the agency had broken privacy rules `` thousands of times each year '' since 2008 .

The May 2012 audit found 2,776 incidents of `` unauthorized collection , storage , access to or distribution of legally protected communications '' in the preceding 12 months , the Post reported in its story
`` Most were unintended . Many involved failures of due diligence or violations of standard operating procedure , '' said the Post article by reporter Barton Gellman . `` The most serious incidents included a violation of a court order and unauthorized use of data about more than 3,000 Americans and green-card holders . ''
Leahy was not the only lawmaker , nor the only member of President Barack Obama 's Democratic party , to call for more oversight and hearings .
`` Press reports that the National Security Agency broke privacy rules thousands of times per year and reportedly sought to shield required disclosure of privacy violations are extremely disturbing , '' said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi .
Pelosi called for `` rigorous oversight '' by Congress on the `` incidents of non-compliance . ''
Another Democrat from California , Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman Sen. Dianne Feinstein , told the Post in a statement late Thursday night that her committee `` can and should do more to independently verify that NSA 's operations are appropriate , and its reports of compliance incidents are accurate . ''
The Washington Post reported that most incidents involved unauthorized surveillance of Americans or foreign intelligence targets in the country . In one case , the NSA decided it did n't need to report the unintended surveillance .
In 2008 , a `` large number '' of calls placed from Washington were intercepted due to a programming error that confused the capitol 's 202 area code for 20 , the international dialing code for Egypt . The information came from a `` quality assurance '' review that was n't distributed to the NSA overnight staff , according to the Post .
Separately , an NSA new collection method went undiscovered by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for months . The court , which has authority over some of the agency 's operations , ruled it unconstitutional .
Responding to the Post 's story , the NSA said , `` A variety of factors can cause the numbers of incidents to trend up or down from one quarter to the next . ''
Factors can include implementation of new procedures , technology or software changes and expanded access .
`` The one constant across all of the quarters is a persistent , dedicated effort to identify incidents or risks of incidents at the earliest possible moment , implement mitigation measures wherever possible , and drive the numbers down , '' the agency said .
The agency released another statement Thursday night defending its programs .
`` NSA 's foreign intelligence collection activities are continually audited and overseen internally and externally , '' it said . `` When NSA makes a mistake in carrying out its foreign intelligence mission , the agency reports the issue internally and to federal overseers -- and aggressively gets to the bottom of it . ''
On Friday , DeLong said his agency `` detects and corrects mistakes '' as these occur and are identified , which stops them from being `` propagated . ''
`` The NSA has zero tolerance for misconduct , '' he said , noting that those who make repeated mistakes lose access to key databases .
Overall , DeLong insisted , the NSA carefully adheres to privacy protections .
White House spokesman Josh Earnest offered a similar statement Friday , saying the NSA compliance office 's review reflects its commitment to abiding by the law and protecting people 's privacy .
`` The documents demonstrate that the NSA is monitoring , detecting , addressing and reporting compliance incidents , '' Earnest said .
The man who leaked the audit to the Post , Snowden , stepped forward publicly in June to claim responsibility for leaking to the media that the NSA had secretly collected and stored millions of phone records from accounts in the United States . The agency also collected information from U.S. companies on the Internet activity of overseas residents , he said .
Snowden fled first to Hong Kong and then to Russia before Moscow granted him temporary asylum despite pressure from the Obama administration to return him to the United States to face charges .
He has been charged with three felony counts , including violations of the U.S . Espionage Act , for the leaks .
Although polling shows Americans harbor skepticism of the domestic surveillance programs Snowden revealed , a majority of Americans do n't approve of the actions he took and they think he , as an American citizen , should be brought to justice .
A CNN/ORC International survey released last month indicated that 52 % of the public disapproved of Snowden 's actions , while 44 % said they approved of the leaks . Fifty-four percent of those questioned in the poll said the government should attempt to bring Snowden back to the United States and prosecute him for his leaks .
As for the program Snowden revealed , there is a noticeable generational divide on the surveillance tactics , with younger Americans more likely to support Snowden than older Americans .","Story highlights White House: Audit shows NSA's efforts to find, address privacy violations

On Friday, DeLong said his agency ""detects and corrects mistakes"" as these occur and are identified, which stops them from being ""propagated.""

""The NSA has zero tolerance for misconduct,"" he said, noting that those who make repeated mistakes lose access to key databases.

Overall, DeLong insisted, the NSA carefully adheres to privacy protections.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest offered a similar statement Friday, saying the NSA compliance office's review reflects its commitment to abiding by the law and protecting people's privacy.

""The documents demonstrate that the NSA is monitoring, detecting, addressing and reporting compliance incidents,"" Earnest said.

The man who leaked the audit to the Post, Snowden, stepped forward publicly in June to claim responsibility for leaking to the media that the NSA had secretly collected and stored millions of phone records from accounts in the United States. The agency also collected information from U.S. companies on the Internet activity of overseas residents, he said.

Snowden fled first to Hong Kong and then to Russia before Moscow granted him temporary asylum despite pressure from the Obama administration to return him to the United States to face charges.

He has been charged with three felony counts, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act, for the leaks.

Although polling shows Americans harbor skepticism of the domestic surveillance programs Snowden revealed, a majority of Americans don't approve of the actions he took and they think he, as an American citizen, should be brought to justice.

A CNN/ORC International survey released last month indicated that 52% of the public disapproved of Snowden's actions, while 44% said they approved of the leaks. Fifty-four percent of those questioned in the poll said the government should attempt to bring Snowden back to the United States and prosecute him for his leaks.

As for the program Snowden revealed, there is a noticeable generational divide on the surveillance tactics, with younger Americans more likely to support Snowden than older Americans.",www.cnn.com,left,Wn7XvHobUPTyiXtm

Both Democrats and Republicans told top administration officials that they reject President Obama ’ s claim that the law allows the intelligence community to collect the phone numbers , time , date and duration of calls made by Americans , and they said Mr. Obama needs to change the way he is running the program if he wants to keep it intact .
Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. , the Wisconsin Republican who was chief author of the Patriot Act in 2001 , said Congress specifically tried to limit the law ’ s uses when it renewed the provisions under Section 215 of the act that allow the government to collect data from businesses without obtaining a warrant .
In that renewal Congress added in the word “ relevant ” to try to limit what the government was pursuing . But Mr. Sensenbrenner said the intelligence community has expanded , not limited , its data-gathering efforts after Congress tried to reel them in .
“ Section 215 expires at the end of 2015 and unless you realize you ’ ve got a problem , that is not going to be renewed . There are not the votes in the House to renew Section 215 , ” he said . “ It ’ s got to be changed and you have to change how you operate Section 215 . Otherwise , in a year or a year and a half , you ’ re not going to have it anymore . ”
Since former National Security Agency employee Edward Snowden last month leaked details of the program to capture what is called the metadata from all phone calls , the Obama administration has declassified more information and the president has said he wants the public and Congress to support the surveillance programs .
Wednesday ’ s hearing marked the first major debate in Congress since the program was revealed , and judging by lawmakers ’ reactions , Mr. Obama does not have their backing .
“ I don ’ t want to scream at you or yell at you , but , you know , we ’ ve got a lot of people across the country that would like to do that , ” said Rep. J. Randy Forbes , Virginia Republican .
The administration officials who testified did little to assuage concerns . Under questioning , they acknowledged that they had the technology to do things such as track ATM transactions .
The officials also said they could track the locations of cellphones on which they ’ re already gathering the metadata — though they said they have promised to come back to Congress for permission if they want to do that .
Lawmakers said they should have sought permission for the existing program , and some accused the administration of trying to hide it .
“ We were not trying to hide this program , ” said John Litt , general counsel for the office of the director of national intelligence .
He said administration officials are trying to determine whether they can provide Congress with the secret court opinions that underpin the program , as well as reports on how the data collection is performed and how it is used .
In a four-page letter to Mr. Sensenbrenner this week , Peter J. Kadzik , principal deputy assistant attorney general , laid out the administration ’ s chain of logic for why the program is justified . He said the government needs to collect all of the information at the front end , but they go digging through it only when they have a suspected terrorist they want to track down .
“ The bulk collection of telephony metadata — i.e . the collection of a large volume and high percentage of information about unrelated communications — is therefore necessary to identify the much smaller subset of terrorist-related telephony metadata records contained within the data , ” Mr. Kadzik wrote .
“ It also allows NSA to make connections related to terrorist activities over time and can assist counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities , including persons and activities in the United States , ” he wrote . “ Because the telephony metadata must be available in bulk to allow NSA to identify the records of terrorist communications , there are ‘ reasonable grounds to believe ’ that the data is relevant to an authorized investigation to protect against international terrorism , as Section 215 requires , even though most of the records in the dataset are not associated with terrorist activity . ”
In Wednesday ’ s hearing , the administration officials said they need to store the phone information because phone companies don ’ t keep the data for more than 18 months , and the intelligence community realized it wanted to be able to look for links within the data going back longer than that .
Under the terms of the program , phone companies turn over the data and the government stores it for five years . But officials said they can query the data to look for specific numbers only if they have a “ reasonable articulable suspicion ” that someone is involved with terrorism . At that point , they can check to see what phone numbers someone has been calling and develop information from there .
The officials said they involve all three branches of government by regularly briefing some congressional committees about the program , going through rigorous review within the executive branch and seeking approval for collecting the data from the special secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court every 90 days .
But members of Congress said they would prefer to see the judges have to sign off before anyone goes digging through all of the information , rather than leaving that decision to 22 employees at the NSA .

USA TODAY

President Obama picked an interesting date on which to give his speech about government surveillance powers -- and not just because it is wife Michelle's 50th birthday.

Friday -- Jan. 17 -- will also mark the 53rd anniversary of President Dwight Eisenhower's famous warning about the growing power of ""the military-industrial complex.""

Ike's 1961 speech, his farewell address after two terms in the White House, has echoed over most subsequent disputes over American power: Vietnam, Watergate, revelations of assassination plots and overthrows of other governments, Iran-Contra, the first Gulf War, the response to 9/11, the second Iraq war -- and disclosures over National Security Agency surveillance policies.

Obama gives a speech Friday on possible changes to NSA surveillance rules.

More than 50 years ago, Eisenhower -- who had led Allied forces to victory in Europe during World War II -- cited the United States' rise as a world power, including a massive standing army and thriving weapons businesses:

""This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence -- economic, political, even spiritual -- is felt in every city, every state house, every office of the federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society.

""In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.

""We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.""

Noting the Ike anniversary, Yahoo News writes:

""Obama rolled back some of the national security state upon taking office -- ending interrogation tactics widely regarded as torture, for instance -- while dramatically expanding drone strikes and embracing surveillance on an unprecedented scale.

""Fast-forward to 2014, and Obama still sounds like he wants to pursue a debate about where and how America strikes the balance between security and liberty.

""Half a year after Edward Snowden gave that perpetual tug-of-war fresh urgency and captured global headlines with leaks about the NSA's global operations, Obama's speech on Friday is expected to be far from the final word -- by design.""",www.usatoday.com,center,QVFO9Mi9hE7ErzNR

A $ 512.5 billion Pentagon appropriations bill cleared the House Wednesday evening after the leadership narrowly beat back efforts to curb the National Security Agency ’ s authority to collect private call records and metadata on telephone customers in the U.S .
The pivotal 217-205 vote was the first real test of political sentiment since former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents that revealed the secret program .
The compressed , often emotional debate badly split Republicans , many of whom had championed the PATRIOT Act in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington in 2001 .
“ Have 12 years gone by and our memories faded so badly that we forgot what happened on September 11 , ” asked House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers ( R-Mich. ) . But former House Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner ( R-Wis. ) , answered as bluntly : “ The time has come to stop and the way we do [ that ] is to approve this amendment . ”
Republicans broke 134-94 against the amendment , while Democrats split 111-82 in favor of the proposal .
The pattern among members fit no simple ideological or generational divide . But with the White House and NSA brass weighing in , both parties ’ top leaders—who enjoy more access to intelligence matters—tended to vote in opposition to the amendment .
As chairman , Rogers promised that he would come back and address privacy concerns when his panel writes its annual authorization for intelligence agencies this fall . For both he and his ranking Democrat , Maryland Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger , the narrowness of the vote was a jolting reminder of the emotions stirred by the issue .
It “ goes too far , too fast on the wrong legislative vehicle , ” Ruppersberger said of the proposed changes . But he conceded that new ways had to be found to address the concerns raised by members .
To try to siphon off this anger — and provide political cover for wavering lawmakers — the Intelligence panel effectively took over a second , less threatening amendment that had been crafted initially by Rep. Richard Nugent ( R-Fla. ) .

A $512.5 billion Pentagon appropriations bill cleared the House Wednesday evening after the leadership narrowly beat back efforts to curb the National Security Agency’s authority to collect private call records and metadata on telephone customers in the U.S.

The pivotal 217-205 vote was the first real test of political sentiment since former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents that revealed the secret program.

The compressed, often emotional debate badly split Republicans, many of whom had championed the PATRIOT Act in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington in 2001.

“Have 12 years gone by and our memories faded so badly that we forgot what happened on September 11,” asked House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.). But former House Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), answered as bluntly: “The time has come to stop and the way we do [that] is to approve this amendment.”

Republicans broke 134-94 against the amendment, while Democrats split 111-82 in favor of the proposal.

The pattern among members fit no simple ideological or generational divide. But with the White House and NSA brass weighing in, both parties’ top leaders—who enjoy more access to intelligence matters—tended to vote in opposition to the amendment.

As chairman, Rogers promised that he would come back and address privacy concerns when his panel writes its annual authorization for intelligence agencies this fall. For both he and his ranking Democrat, Maryland Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, the narrowness of the vote was a jolting reminder of the emotions stirred by the issue.

It “goes too far, too fast on the wrong legislative vehicle,” Ruppersberger said of the proposed changes. But he conceded that new ways had to be found to address the concerns raised by members.

To try to siphon off this anger — and provide political cover for wavering lawmakers — the Intelligence panel effectively took over a second, less threatening amendment that had been crafted initially by Rep. Richard Nugent (R-Fla.).

Nugent told POLITICO that he had abandoned the proposal because he didn’t think it achieved the purpose he wanted. But with the leadership’s blessing, Rep. Mike Pompeo, a member of the Intelligence Committee, brought it to a vote in his name, winning easily 409-12.

Critics contended it was a “fig leaf” and only restated current law. But it also gave members a vote to express their concerns without jeopardizing the NSA’s ability to continue as it has.

The underlying defense bill, approved 315-109, lacked the same drama as the NSA fight. But the two days of debate reflected a clear and growing impatience in Congress with the cost of U.S. entanglements overseas.

Lawmakers complained bitterly that assistance is still flowing to Afghanistan while civilian defense employees are being furloughed at home. Without even a recorded vote, Rep. Lee Terry (R-Neb.) won an amendment to cut $2.6 billion from Afghan aid to try to address this personnel problem.

In the Mideast, the Republican leadership successfully structured the debate to a point where the few amendments allowed will have limited impact.

The passions are real, especially regarding military aid to anti-government forces in Syria.

“We don’t know who is who among the Syrian rebel movement,” Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R-Neb.) told the House. “We do not have control over the Syrian battle place Americans must not be complicit in this killing field.”

But the confusion was also evident.

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), given a chance to offer an amendment on military relations with Egypt, spent most of his time on the floor clarifying what his language didn’t intend to do—not what it did.

“My amendment is to prevent the U.S, military from engaging in offensive operations in Egypt and to prevent the Defense Department from providing assistance to Egyptian paramilitary or terrorist groups,” Massie said finally. It passed on a voice vote.

If the government is indeed engaging in wholesale spying with practically no restrictions on what it can record and read -- something President Obama denies -- this is an affront to the constitution, and it demands action from Congress. And the breach of government secrets demands attention as well.

I was relieved to learn Wednesday that President Barack Obama canceled a planned summit meeting with Vladimir Putin. It was the right thing to do, given the Russian president’s recent bad behavior. But there’s much more the United States can and must do to help put Russia on the right track.

Almost eight months after this important law was passed, the Obama administration has made no apparent progress toward persuading Russia to implement reforms. For example, there has been no attempt to press the claims of American investors who lost more than $12 billion when Russia took over Yukos. It should come as no surprise that Russia’s respect for the rule of law has continued to plummet, with the recent show trial of opposition leader Alexei Navalny being only the latest example.

Our legislation, known as the Russia and Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012, included important human rights protections for Russians and a detailed agenda for improving protections for American investors in Russia. This includes strengthening protections for investors through negotiating a new bilateral investment treaty, pressing Russia to implement fully the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, and promoting the claims of U.S. investors in Yukos Oil Co., whom my firm, Covington & Burling, represents. The law also requires the administration to report on the results achieved in promoting the rule of law in Russia.

It is important that the U.S. government demonstrates that it will not stand for the arbitrary and unfair treatment of its own citizens and companies by the Russian regime.

Despite Russia’s disrespect for the rule of law, there is an opportunity for the U.S. to join Europeans and work with Russia on a reformist agenda to improve its climate for trade and investment. Putin himself has urged foreign investors to invest in Russia and acknowledged that Russia needs to tackle its corruption problem. But now, Putin needs to know that investment will not flow in significant amounts until investors have confidence that Russia will treat foreign investors fairly and make good on its commitments under international law.

Russia has an opportunity to show it understands when it hosts the G-20 Leaders’ Summit in St. Petersburg in September. Improving the climate for foreign investment and combatting corruption are central parts of the agenda. U.S. and European leaders should insist that Russia take concrete steps to improve the rule of law environment for business in Russia. A necessary first step would be to compensate fully U.S. and European investors who lost billions in the Yukos takeover. Compensating investors in Yukos would send the message that Putin is serious about encouraging foreign investment in Russia and willing to make the reforms necessary to make it happen.

I still believe that granting permanent normal trade relations to Russia was the right decision. Increased trade and cross-border investment is in all of our interests. But my Senate colleagues and I made clear that free trade and investment require respect for the rule of law and the rights of investors. We expected and required Obama to step up and press for the reforms that are necessary to make trade and investment work in Russia.

I am sorry to say that the administration so far has not been up to the task. The European Court of Human Rights is holding Russia accountable for violations of Khodorkovsky’s rights.

Snowden thought to be in Moscow airport, but few have seen him ",2013-07-01,Judson Berger,"He 's the man at the center of the world 's most intriguing bout of diplomatic wrangling . Yet few can claim to have seen him .
Edward Snowden , more than a week after fleeing Hong Kong , supposedly remains in the Moscow airport 's `` transit zone '' -- a place that to the rest of the world may seem more like the twilight zone with every passing day .
Reporters swarmed the airport last week after Russian officials said the infamous NSA leaker was still there , while claiming he technically was not on their territory and refusing to get involved in his case .
But to the media , the most-wanted leaker in the world was invisible , nowhere to be found . Even Snowden 's father , Lonnie Snowden , is still trying to establish a `` direct communications link '' with his son , his dad 's attorney Bruce Fein told Fox News on Monday .
Ian Phillips , the Associated Press Eastern Europe news director who spent 21 hours in the Moscow transit zone last week in an unsuccessful attempt to find Snowden , told FoxNews.com his best bet is that Snowden is holed up in the Novotel -- a bizarre hotel that has one wing jutting into the international transit zone . That 's where Phillips stayed last Thursday and Friday , to no avail .
But really , Phillips said , `` there are many places he can be . ''
WikiLeaks , which is helping Snowden and claims to have an adviser traveling with him , could shed light Monday on where Snowden is spending his time and how he was able to avoid prying eyes .
The group said on its Twitter page that on Monday , `` we will issue several important announcements during the day . '' Hours later , reports surfaced that the WikiLeaks adviser traveling with Snowden has submitted a request for political asylum to Russia . There were no further details about his current whereabouts .
WikiLeaks Julian Assange was typically cagey during a Sunday show interview about Snowden 's circumstances .
`` The situation now with Edward Snowden is a very sensitive one . It 's a matter of international diplomatic negotiations , '' he said .
Last week , after Snowden landed in Moscow , Assange only would say that Snowden and the WikiLeaks adviser are `` healthy and safe . ''
Speculation swirls about where Snowden may be spending his time , though U.S. officials still say they believe he 's at the Moscow airport -- somewhere .
Russian news reports claimed last week he was at a hotel in the terminal itself . But The Associated Press sent a reporter to the transit zone last week and could find no sign of Snowden at the on-site hotel , the Air Express , or any worker who would confirm he was staying there .
The AP reporter claimed to have entered the transit zone -- a sprawling area comprising several terminals , as well as the usual mix of duty-free shops and other stores -- last Wednesday in search of Snowden . While finding no trace of Snowden , the AP noted that aside from the hotel , there are a number of small rooms where someone could potentially hide .
Snowden was not found , though , in any of the VIP lounge areas .
The AP then sent Phillips to the Novotel on Thursday . Phillips described an `` Orwellian '' experience there , and on Monday recounted his visit to FoxNews.com .
He said he arrived last week with the understanding `` it was a long shot . '' He took a bus and `` walked in a free man into the lobby of what looked like a fantastic hotel . ''
But then , Phillips said , `` a guard came and said , 'come with me . ' ''
Phillips was taken to the old wing of the hotel where travelers with no visas -- like Snowden -- are kept under tight security .
He tried to call the other rooms and hang out in the corridor , in hopes of stealing a glance at Snowden . No luck . Any further movement was prohibited .
`` I walked out the first night and the guard jumped up as if to say 'what are you doing , ' '' Phillips said . `` I think we expected a bit more freedom to roam . ''
At the same time , he said that if Snowden is in the transit zone , there 's a `` fairly good chance '' he 's at the Novotel , given how secure it is .
With Russia , and now Ecuador , trying to distance itself from Snowden 's case , it 's unclear who has actually had face-to-face contact with him besides the WikiLeaks adviser .
Fein , the attorney for Snowden 's father , told Fox News that the family is currently trying to get information to Edward Snowden so he can make an informed decision about what legal options are available .

`` He 's an adult . He has to chart his own destiny , and his father 's not going to dictate that , '' Fein said .","He's the man at the center of the world's most intriguing bout of diplomatic wrangling. Yet few can claim to have seen him.

Edward Snowden, more than a week after fleeing Hong Kong, supposedly remains in the Moscow airport's ""transit zone"" -- a place that to the rest of the world may seem more like the twilight zone with every passing day.

Reporters swarmed the airport last week after Russian officials said the infamous NSA leaker was still there, while claiming he technically was not on their territory and refusing to get involved in his case.

But to the media, the most-wanted leaker in the world was invisible, nowhere to be found. Even Snowden's father, Lonnie Snowden, is still trying to establish a ""direct communications link"" with his son, his dad's attorney Bruce Fein told Fox News on Monday.

Ian Phillips, the Associated Press Eastern Europe news director who spent 21 hours in the Moscow transit zone last week in an unsuccessful attempt to find Snowden, told FoxNews.com his best bet is that Snowden is holed up in the Novotel -- a bizarre hotel that has one wing jutting into the international transit zone. That's where Phillips stayed last Thursday and Friday, to no avail.

But really, Phillips said, ""there are many places he can be.""

""Who knows,"" he concluded.

WikiLeaks, which is helping Snowden and claims to have an adviser traveling with him, could shed light Monday on where Snowden is spending his time and how he was able to avoid prying eyes.

The group said on its Twitter page that on Monday, ""we will issue several important announcements during the day."" Hours later, reports surfaced that the WikiLeaks adviser traveling with Snowden has submitted a request for political asylum to Russia. There were no further details about his current whereabouts.

WikiLeaks Julian Assange was typically cagey during a Sunday show interview about Snowden's circumstances.

""The situation now with Edward Snowden is a very sensitive one. It's a matter of international diplomatic negotiations,"" he said.

Last week, after Snowden landed in Moscow, Assange only would say that Snowden and the WikiLeaks adviser are ""healthy and safe.""

Speculation swirls about where Snowden may be spending his time, though U.S. officials still say they believe he's at the Moscow airport -- somewhere.

Russian news reports claimed last week he was at a hotel in the terminal itself. But The Associated Press sent a reporter to the transit zone last week and could find no sign of Snowden at the on-site hotel, the Air Express, or any worker who would confirm he was staying there.

The AP reporter claimed to have entered the transit zone -- a sprawling area comprising several terminals, as well as the usual mix of duty-free shops and other stores -- last Wednesday in search of Snowden. While finding no trace of Snowden, the AP noted that aside from the hotel, there are a number of small rooms where someone could potentially hide.

Snowden was not found, though, in any of the VIP lounge areas.

The AP then sent Phillips to the Novotel on Thursday. Phillips described an ""Orwellian"" experience there, and on Monday recounted his visit to FoxNews.com.

He said he arrived last week with the understanding ""it was a long shot."" He took a bus and ""walked in a free man into the lobby of what looked like a fantastic hotel.""

But then, Phillips said, ""a guard came and said, 'come with me.'""

Phillips was taken to the old wing of the hotel where travelers with no visas -- like Snowden -- are kept under tight security.

He tried to call the other rooms and hang out in the corridor, in hopes of stealing a glance at Snowden. No luck. Any further movement was prohibited.

""I walked out the first night and the guard jumped up as if to say 'what are you doing,'"" Phillips said. ""I think we expected a bit more freedom to roam.""

At the same time, he said that if Snowden is in the transit zone, there's a ""fairly good chance"" he's at the Novotel, given how secure it is.

With Russia, and now Ecuador, trying to distance itself from Snowden's case, it's unclear who has actually had face-to-face contact with him besides the WikiLeaks adviser.

Fein, the attorney for Snowden's father, told Fox News that the family is currently trying to get information to Edward Snowden so he can make an informed decision about what legal options are available.

The father last week sent a letter to the Justice Department in hopes of securing a few key conditions for Snowden to return. He asked that Snowden not be detained before trial, not be subject to a gag order and have a trial in a venue of his choosing.

But Fein clarified to Fox News that these are not ""ultimatums"" and that the father is also respecting his son's wishes.

The National Security Agency is working to build a supercomputer that could break almost all encryption worldwide, according to the latest revelation from documents provided by Edward Snowden.

But the spy agency is apparently far from achieving a breakthrough in creating a ""cryptologically useful quantum computer,"" The Washington Post writes in a report Thursday. The effort is centered at a laboratory in College Park, Md.

Labs sponsored by the European Union and the Swiss government are also pursing this scientific holy grail.

""The E.U. and Switzerland have made significant advances over the last decade and have caught up to the U.S. in quantum computing technology,"" Seth Lloyd, professor of quantum mechanical engineering at MIT, told the Post.

If achieved, such a computer could unlock the encryption that protects data held by and transactions with banks, credit card companies, retailers, brokerages, governments and health care providers.

Here's the Post's explanation of quantum computing:

While a classical computer, however fast, must do one calculation at a time, a quantum computer can sometimes avoid having to make calculations that are unnecessary to solving a problem. That allows it to home in on the correct answer much more quickly and efficiently.

Quantum computing is so difficult to attain because of the fragile nature of such computers. In theory, the building blocks of such a computer might include individual atoms, photons or electrons. To maintain the quantum nature of the computer, these particles would need to be carefully isolated from their external environments.

One file file provided by former NSA contractor Snowden shows that the agency expected to have created some basic building blocks — called quibits — by the end of September. The agency reported achieving ""dynamical decoupling and complete quantum control on two semiconductor qubits.""

But to universally break cryptography, a supercomputer would need hundreds or thousands of quibits.

""That's a great step, but it's a pretty small step on the road to building a large-scale quantum computer,"" Lloyd of MIT told the Post.

Two other newspapers that have published findings based on thousands of classified documents — the New York Times and Guardian — editorialized Wednesday that Snowden is a whistle-blower who should be granted clemency rather then be prosecuted for leaking the files. He has been living in Russia, which granted him temporary asylum after he fled Hawaii and later Hong Kong.",www.usatoday.com,center,Uarsuh32INy0mqo8

On Tuesday the company pushed back against the layers of secrecy surrounding the agency 's alleged blanket snooping on American citizens .
“ We were as shocked about those revelations as anyone , ” Drummond told Fox News , in an interview with Fox News ' Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge .
On Tuesday the Internet giant wrote on its official blog that it had sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder and the FBI Director Robert Mueller , asking the agencies to allow Google to release more information about the national security orders it had received .
Google 's request comes days after the government publicly acknowledged that secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) requests had been sent to Internet companies regarding their users ' activity .
“ A serious misperception has been created in the wake of the disclosures around the Verizon national security order , around phone records as well as the disclosures about the so-called PRISM program , ” Drummond told Fox News .
Google is asking to be able to publish FISA court requests as part of its biannual `` transparency report , '' in which the company lists the number and kind of user data requests it receives from the government , Drummond said .
`` Google ’ s numbers would clearly show that our compliance with these requests falls far short of the claims being made , '' Drummond said in the letter .
Facebook , Microsoft and others told FoxNews.com they agreed with Drummond : More needs to be done to improve transparency around these government requests .
`` In the past , we have questioned the value of releasing a transparency report that , because of exactly these types of government restrictions on disclosure , is necessarily incomplete and therefore potentially misleading to our users , '' Ted Ullyot , Facebook 's general counsel told FoxNews.com . `` We would welcome the opportunity to provide a transparency report that allows us to share with those who use Facebook around the world a complete picture of the government requests we receive , and how we respond . We urge the United States government to help make that possible . ''
“ Permitting greater transparency on the aggregate volume and scope of national security requests , including FISA orders , would help the community understand and debate these important issues , '' a Micrsoft spokeswoman told FoxNews.com . `` Our recent Report went as far as we legally could and the government should take action to allow companies to provide additional transparency . ”
Reports from the Guardian and the Washington Post stated that the NSA had “ direct access ” to the servers of Google , Facebook , and several other major Internet companies . Drummond stressed that that simply wasn ’ t true -- but legal restrictions were preventing him from offering further details .
“ There 's no lockbox , there 's no backdoor -- none of the other terms that you 've seen in the past few days , ” Drummond told Fox News . “ We comply with orders , we deliver information when we receive these targeted orders . ''
Earlier Tuesday , Senate leaders emerged from a closed-door meeting with the NSA chief saying the story about Edward Snowden , the American who leaked details about secret U.S. surveillance programs , is enveloped in misinformation and called for public hearings .
The closed-door briefing follows a series of news stories about federal government programs that have been collecting information about millions , if not billions , of phone calls and Internet activities of Americans .
Sources familiar with the briefing also told Fox News that lawmakers were concerned about more bombshell revelations on super-secret U.S. surveillance .
Drummond stressed that it was important to remember that Google serves hundreds of millions of users and that `` only a tiny fraction of our users have ever been subject to having their data requested '' through such orders .

The article was quickly challenged by the NSA . In a statement forwarded to Fox News , the agency said `` allegations of widespread , unchecked analyst access to NSA collection data are simply not true . ''
The agency acknowledged the existence of the program -- called XKeyscore -- but said access is limited and suggested it was mainly aimed at foreign intelligence targets .
The Guardian article described it differently . According to the piece , the XKeyscore program is the `` widest-reaching '' system the agency has and allows analysts without prior authorization to dig around the database by filling out an on-screen form giving a basic justification .
According to the report , the program covers `` nearly everything a typical user does on the internet '' including emails and websites visited . It also reportedly allows analysts to intercept Internet activity in `` real time . ''
The Guardian report seems to make a distinction between what is technically possible under this program and what is legally allowed . It notes that U.S. law requires the NSA to get a warrant if the target is a U.S. individual -- but says the XKeyscore program provides `` the technological capability , if not the legal authority '' to go after Americans without a warrant as long as an analyst knows information like an email or IP address .
The NSA , in its statement , pushed back on these assertions .

The agency acknowledged the existence of the program -- called XKeyscore -- but said access is limited and suggested it was mainly aimed at foreign intelligence targets.

The Guardian article described it differently. According to the piece, the XKeyscore program is the ""widest-reaching"" system the agency has and allows analysts without prior authorization to dig around the database by filling out an on-screen form giving a basic justification.

According to the report, the program covers ""nearly everything a typical user does on the internet"" including emails and websites visited. It also reportedly allows analysts to intercept Internet activity in ""real time.""

The Guardian report seems to make a distinction between what is technically possible under this program and what is legally allowed. It notes that U.S. law requires the NSA to get a warrant if the target is a U.S. individual -- but says the XKeyscore program provides ""the technological capability, if not the legal authority"" to go after Americans without a warrant as long as an analyst knows information like an email or IP address.

The NSA, in its statement, pushed back on these assertions.

""The implication that NSA's collection is arbitrary and unconstrained is false,"" the agency said. ""NSA's activities are focused and specifically deployed against -- and only against -- legitimate foreign intelligence targets in response to requirements that our leaders need for information necessary to protect our nation and its interests.""

The agency said those with access to the system are trained on their ""ethical and legal obligations."" The agency complained that the ongoing leaks continue to jeopardize security.

nsa,USA TODAY,1,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/04/07/dea-bulk-telephone-surveillance-operation/70808616/,U.S. secretly tracked billions of calls for decades,2015-04-07,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. government started keeping secret records of Americans ' international telephone calls nearly a decade before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , harvesting billions of calls in a program that provided a blueprint for the far broader National Security Agency surveillance that followed .
For more than two decades , the Justice Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration amassed logs of virtually all telephone calls from the USA to as many as 116 countries linked to drug trafficking , current and former officials involved with the operation said . The targeted countries changed over time but included Canada , Mexico and most of Central and South America .
Federal investigators used the call records to track drug cartels ' distribution networks in the USA , allowing agents to detect previously unknown trafficking rings and money handlers . They also used the records to help rule out foreign ties to the bombing in 1995 of a federal building in Oklahoma City and to identify U.S. suspects in a wide range of other investigations .
The Justice Department revealed in January that the DEA had collected data about calls to `` designated foreign countries . '' But the history and vast scale of that operation have not been disclosed until now .
The now-discontinued operation , carried out by the DEA 's intelligence arm , was the government 's first known effort to gather data on Americans in bulk , sweeping up records of telephone calls made by millions of U.S. citizens regardless of whether they were suspected of a crime . It was a model for the massive phone surveillance system the NSA launched to identify terrorists after the Sept. 11 attacks . That dragnet drew sharp criticism that the government had intruded too deeply into Americans ' privacy after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked it to the news media two years ago .
More than a dozen current and former law enforcement and intelligence officials described the details of the Justice Department operation to ███ . Most did so on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the intelligence program , part of which remains classified .
The DEA program did not intercept the content of Americans ' calls , but the records — which numbers were dialed and when — allowed agents to map suspects ' communications and link them to troves of other police and intelligence data . At first , the drug agency did so with help from military computers and intelligence analysts .
That data collection was `` one of the most important and effective Federal drug law enforcement initiatives , '' the Justice Department said in a 1998 letter to Sprint asking the telecom giant to turn over its call records . The previously undisclosed letter was signed by the head of the department 's Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Section , Mary Lee Warren , who wrote that the operation had `` been approved at the highest levels of Federal law enforcement authority , '' including then-Attorney General Janet Reno and her deputy , Eric Holder .
The data collection began in 1992 during the administration of President George H.W . Bush , nine years before his son , President George W. Bush , authorized the NSA to gather its own logs of Americans ' phone calls in 2001 . It was approved by top Justice Department officials in four presidential administrations and detailed in occasional briefings to members of Congress but otherwise had little independent oversight , according to officials involved with running it .
The DEA used its data collection extensively and in ways that the NSA is now prohibited from doing . Agents gathered the records without court approval , searched them more often in a day than the spy agency does in a year and automatically linked the numbers the agency gathered to large electronic collections of investigative reports , domestic call records accumulated by its agents and intelligence data from overseas .
The result was `` a treasure trove of very important information on trafficking , '' former DEA administrator Thomas Constantine said in an interview .
The extent of that surveillance alarmed privacy advocates , who questioned its legality . `` This was aimed squarely at Americans , '' said Mark Rumold , an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation . `` That 's very significant from a constitutional perspective . ''
Holder halted the data collection in September 2013 amid the fallout from Snowden 's revelations about other surveillance programs . In its place , current and former officials said the drug agency sends telecom companies daily subpoenas for international calling records involving only phone numbers that agents suspect are linked to the drug trade or other crimes — sometimes a thousand or more numbers a day .
Tuesday , Justice Department spokesman Patrick Rodenbush said the DEA `` is no longer collecting bulk telephony metadata from U.S. service providers . '' A DEA spokesman declined to comment .
The DEA began assembling a data-gathering program in the 1980s as the government searched for new ways to battle Colombian drug cartels . Neither informants nor undercover agents had been enough to crack the cartels ' infrastructure . So the agency 's intelligence arm turned its attention to the groups ' communication networks .
Calling records – often called `` toll records '' – offered one way to do that . Toll records are comparable to what appears on a phone bill – the numbers a person dialed , the date and time of the call , its duration and how it was paid for . By then , DEA agents had decades of experience gathering toll records of people they suspected were linked to drug trafficking , albeit one person at a time . In the late 1980s and early 1990s , officials said the agency had little way to make sense of the data their agents accumulated and almost no ability to use them to ferret out new cartel connections . Some agents used legal pads .
`` We were drowning in toll records , '' a former intelligence official said .
The DEA asked the Pentagon for help . The military responded with a pair of supercomputers and intelligence analysts who had experience tracking the communication patterns of Soviet military units . `` What they discovered was that the incident of a communication was perhaps as important as the content of a communication , '' a former Justice Department official said .
The military installed the supercomputers on the fifth floor of the DEA 's headquarters , across from a shopping mall in Arlington , Va .
The system they built ultimately allowed the drug agency to stitch together huge collections of data to map trafficking and money laundering networks both overseas and within the USA . It allowed agents to link the call records its agents gathered domestically with calling data the DEA and intelligence agencies had acquired outside the USA . ( In some cases , officials said the DEA paid employees of foreign telecom firms for copies of call logs and subscriber lists . ) And it eventually allowed agents to cross-reference all of that against investigative reports from the DEA , FBI and Customs Service .
The result `` produced major international investigations that allowed us to take some big people , '' Constantine said , though he said he could not identify particular cases .
In 1989 , President George H.W . Bush proposed in his first prime-time address using `` sophisticated intelligence-gathering and Defense Department technology '' to disrupt drug trafficking . Three years later , when violent crime rates were at record highs , the drug agency intensified its intelligence push , launching a `` kingpin strategy '' to attack drug cartels by going after their finances , leadership and communication .
In 1992 , in the last months of Bush 's administration , Attorney General William Barr and his chief criminal prosecutor , Robert Mueller , gave the DEA permission to collect a much larger set of phone data to feed into that intelligence operation .
Instead of simply asking phone companies for records about calls made by people suspected of drug crimes , the Justice Department began ordering telephone companies to turn over lists of all phone calls from the USA to countries where the government determined drug traffickers operated , current and former officials said .
Barr and Mueller declined to comment , as did Barr 's deputy , George Terwilliger III , though Terwilliger said , `` It has been apparent for a long time in both the law enforcement and intelligence worlds that there is a tremendous value and need to collect certain metadata to support legitimate investigations . ''
The data collection was known within the agency as USTO ( a play on the fact that it tracked calls from the U.S. to other countries ) .
The DEA obtained those records using administrative subpoenas that allow the agency to collect records `` relevant or material to '' federal drug investigations . Officials acknowledged it was an expansive interpretation of that authority but one that was not likely to be challenged because unlike search warrants , DEA subpoenas do not require a judge 's approval . `` We knew we were stretching the definition , '' a former official involved in the process said .
Officials said a few telephone companies were reluctant to provide so much information , but none challenged the subpoenas in court . Those that hesitated received letters from the Justice Department urging them to comply .
After Sprint executives expressed reservations in 1998 , for example , Warren , the head of the department 's drug section , responded with a letter telling the company that `` the initiative has been determined to be legally appropriate '' and that turning over the call data was `` appropriate and required by law . '' The letter said the data would be used by authorities `` to focus scarce investigative resources by means of sophisticated pattern and link analysis . ''
The letter did not name other telecom firms providing records to the DEA but did tell executives that `` the arrangement with Sprint being sought by the DEA is by no means unique to Sprint '' and that `` major service providers have been eager to support and assist law enforcement within appropriate bounds . '' Former officials said the operation included records from AT & T and other telecom companies .
A spokesman for AT & T declined to comment . Sprint spokeswoman Stephanie Vinge Walsh said only that `` we do comply with all state and federal laws regarding law enforcement subpoenas . ''
Agents said that when the data collection began , they sought to limit its use mainly to drug investigations and turned away requests for access from the FBI and the NSA . They allowed searches of the data in terrorism cases , including the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people in 1995 , helping to rule out theories linking the attack to foreign terrorists . They allowed even broader use after Sept. 11 , 2001 . The DEA 's public disclosure of its program in January came in the case of a man charged with violating U.S. export restrictions by trying to send electrical equipment to Iran .
At first , officials said the DEA gathered records only of calls to a handful of countries , focusing on Colombian drug cartels and their supply lines . Its reach grew quickly , and by the late 1990s , the DEA was logging `` a massive number of calls , '' said a former intelligence official who supervised the program .
Former officials said they could not recall the complete list of countries included in USTO , and the coverage changed over time . The Justice Department and DEA added countries to the list if officials could establish that they were home to outfits that produced or trafficked drugs or were involved in money laundering or other drug-related crimes .
The Justice Department warned when it disclosed the program in January that the list of countries should remain secret `` to protect against any disruption to prospective law enforcement cooperation . ''
At its peak , the operation gathered data on calls to 116 countries , an official involved in reviewing the list said . Two other officials said they did not recall the precise number of countries , but it was more than 100 . That gave the collection a considerable sweep ; the U.S. government recognizes a total of 195 countries .
At one time or another , officials said , the data collection covered most of the countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean , as well as others in western Africa , Europe and Asia . It included Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iran , Italy , Mexico and Canada .
The DEA often — though not always — notified foreign governments it was collecting call records , in part to make sure its agents would not be expelled if the program was discovered . In some cases , the DEA provided some of that information to foreign law enforcement agencies to help them build their own investigations , officials said .
The DEA did not have a real-time connection to phone companies ' data ; instead , the companies regularly provided copies of their call logs , first on computer disks and later over a private network . Agents who used the system said the numbers they saw were seldom more than a few days old .
The database did not include callers ' names or other identifying data . Officials said agents often were able to identify individuals associated with telephone numbers flagged by the analysis , either by cross-referencing them against other databases or by sending follow-up requests to the phone companies .
To keep the program secret , the DEA sought not to use the information as evidence in criminal prosecutions or in its justification for warrants or other searches . Instead , its Special Operations Division passed the data to field agents as tips to help them find new targets or focus existing investigations , a process approved by Justice Department lawyers . Many of those tips were classified because the DEA phone searches drew on other intelligence data .
That practice sparked a furor when the Reuters news agency reported in 2013 that the DEA trained agents to conceal the sources of those tips from judges and defense lawyers . Reuters said the tips were based on wiretaps , foreign intelligence and a DEA database of telephone calls gathered through routine subpoenas and search warrants .
As a result , `` the government short-circuited any debate about the legality and wisdom of putting the call records of millions of innocent people in the hands of the DEA , '' American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Patrick Toomey said .
Listen to Brad Heath detail his investigation into decades of bulk data collection in the audio player below :
The NSA began collecting its own data on Americans ' phone calls within months of Sept. 11 , 2001 , as a way to identify potential terrorists within the USA . At first , it did so without court approval . In 2006 , after The New York Times and ███ began reporting on the surveillance program , President George W. Bush 's administration brought it under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which allows the government to use secret court orders to get access to records relevant to national security investigations . Unlike the DEA , the NSA also gathered logs of calls within the USA .
The similarities between the NSA program and the DEA operation established a decade earlier are striking – too much so to have been a coincidence , people familiar with the programs said . Former NSA general counsel Stewart Baker said , `` It 's very hard to see ( the DEA operation ) as anything other than the precursor '' to the NSA 's terrorist surveillance .
Both operations relied on an expansive interpretation of the word `` relevant , '' for example — one that allowed the government to collect vast amounts of information on the premise that some tiny fraction of it would be useful to investigators . Both used similar internal safeguards , requiring analysts to certify that they had `` reasonable articulable suspicion '' – a comparatively low legal threshold – that a phone number was linked to a drug or intelligence case before they could query the records .
`` The foundation of the NSA program was a mirror image of what we were doing , '' said a former Justice Department official who helped oversee the surveillance . That official said he and others briefed NSA lawyers several times on the particulars of their surveillance program . Two former DEA officials also said the NSA had been briefed on the operation . The NSA declined to comment .
For one thing , DEA analysts queried their data collection far more often . The NSA said analysts searched its telephone database only about 300 times in 2012 ; DEA analysts routinely performed that many searches in a day , former officials said . Beyond that , NSA analysts must have approval from a judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court each time they want to search their own collection of phone metadata , and they do not automatically cross-reference it with other intelligence files .
Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vt. , then the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , complained last year to Holder that the DEA had been gathering phone data `` in bulk '' without judicial oversight . Officials said the DEA 's database was disclosed to judges only occasionally , in classified hearings .
For two decades , it was never reviewed by the Justice Department 's own inspector general , which told Congress it is now looking into the DEA 's bulk data collections .
Holder pulled the plug on the phone data collection in September 2013 .
That summer , Snowden leaked a remarkable series of classified documents detailing some of the government 's most prized surveillance secrets , including the NSA 's logging of domestic phone calls and Internet traffic . Reuters and The New York Times raised questions about the drug agency 's own access to phone records .
Officials said the Justice Department told the DEA that it had determined it could not continue both surveillance programs , particularly because part of its justification for sweeping NSA surveillance was that it served national security interests , not ordinary policing . Eight months after USTO was halted , for example , department lawyers defended the spy agency 's phone dragnet in court partly on the grounds that it `` serves special governmental needs above and beyond normal law enforcement . ''
Three months after USTO was shut down , a review panel commissioned by President Obama urged Congress to bar the NSA from gathering telephone data on Americans in bulk . Not long after that , Obama instructed the NSA to get permission from the surveillance court before querying its phone data collection , a step the drug agency never was required to take .
The DEA stopped searching USTO in September 2013 . Not long after that , it purged the database .
`` It was made abundantly clear that they could n't defend both programs , '' a former Justice Department official said . Others said Holder 's message was more direct . `` He said he did n't think we should have that information , '' a former DEA official said .
By then , agents said USTO was suffering from diminishing returns . More criminals — especially the sophisticated cartel operatives the agency targeted — were communicating on Internet messaging systems that are harder for law enforcement to track .
Still , the shutdown took a toll , officials said . `` It has had a major impact on investigations , '' one former DEA official said .
The DEA asked the Justice Department to restart the surveillance program in December 2013 . It withdrew that request when agents came up with a new solution . Every day , the agency assembles a list of the telephone numbers its agents suspect may be tied to drug trafficking . Each day , it sends electronic subpoenas — sometimes listing more than a thousand numbers — to telephone companies seeking logs of international telephone calls linked to those numbers , two official familiar with the program said .
The data collection that results is more targeted but slower and more expensive . Agents said it takes a day or more to pull together communication profiles that used to take minutes .
The White House proposed a similar approach for the NSA 's telephone surveillance program , which is set to expire June 1 . That approach would halt the NSA 's bulk data collection but would give the spy agency the power to force companies to turn over records linked to particular telephone numbers , subject to a court order .","Brad Heath

WASHINGTON — The U.S. government started keeping secret records of Americans' international telephone calls nearly a decade before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, harvesting billions of calls in a program that provided a blueprint for the far broader National Security Agency surveillance that followed.

The result ""produced major international investigations that allowed us to take some big people,"" Constantine said, though he said he could not identify particular cases.

In 1989, President George H.W. Bush proposed in his first prime-time address using ""sophisticated intelligence-gathering and Defense Department technology"" to disrupt drug trafficking. Three years later, when violent crime rates were at record highs, the drug agency intensified its intelligence push, launching a ""kingpin strategy"" to attack drug cartels by going after their finances, leadership and communication.

THE START OF BULK COLLECTION

In 1992, in the last months of Bush's administration, Attorney General William Barr and his chief criminal prosecutor, Robert Mueller, gave the DEA permission to collect a much larger set of phone data to feed into that intelligence operation.

Instead of simply asking phone companies for records about calls made by people suspected of drug crimes, the Justice Department began ordering telephone companies to turn over lists of all phone calls from the USA to countries where the government determined drug traffickers operated, current and former officials said.

Barr and Mueller declined to comment, as did Barr's deputy, George Terwilliger III, though Terwilliger said, ""It has been apparent for a long time in both the law enforcement and intelligence worlds that there is a tremendous value and need to collect certain metadata to support legitimate investigations.""

The data collection was known within the agency as USTO (a play on the fact that it tracked calls from the U.S. to other countries).

The DEA obtained those records using administrative subpoenas that allow the agency to collect records ""relevant or material to"" federal drug investigations. Officials acknowledged it was an expansive interpretation of that authority but one that was not likely to be challenged because unlike search warrants, DEA subpoenas do not require a judge's approval. ""We knew we were stretching the definition,"" a former official involved in the process said.

Officials said a few telephone companies were reluctant to provide so much information, but none challenged the subpoenas in court. Those that hesitated received letters from the Justice Department urging them to comply.

After Sprint executives expressed reservations in 1998, for example, Warren, the head of the department's drug section, responded with a letter telling the company that ""the initiative has been determined to be legally appropriate"" and that turning over the call data was ""appropriate and required by law."" The letter said the data would be used by authorities ""to focus scarce investigative resources by means of sophisticated pattern and link analysis.""

The letter did not name other telecom firms providing records to the DEA but did tell executives that ""the arrangement with Sprint being sought by the DEA is by no means unique to Sprint"" and that ""major service providers have been eager to support and assist law enforcement within appropriate bounds."" Former officials said the operation included records from AT&T and other telecom companies.

A spokesman for AT&T declined to comment. Sprint spokeswoman Stephanie Vinge Walsh said only that ""we do comply with all state and federal laws regarding law enforcement subpoenas.""

Agents said that when the data collection began, they sought to limit its use mainly to drug investigations and turned away requests for access from the FBI and the NSA. They allowed searches of the data in terrorism cases, including the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people in 1995, helping to rule out theories linking the attack to foreign terrorists. They allowed even broader use after Sept. 11, 2001. The DEA's public disclosure of its program in January came in the case of a man charged with violating U.S. export restrictions by trying to send electrical equipment to Iran.

At first, officials said the DEA gathered records only of calls to a handful of countries, focusing on Colombian drug cartels and their supply lines. Its reach grew quickly, and by the late 1990s, the DEA was logging ""a massive number of calls,"" said a former intelligence official who supervised the program.

Former officials said they could not recall the complete list of countries included in USTO, and the coverage changed over time. The Justice Department and DEA added countries to the list if officials could establish that they were home to outfits that produced or trafficked drugs or were involved in money laundering or other drug-related crimes.

The Justice Department warned when it disclosed the program in January that the list of countries should remain secret ""to protect against any disruption to prospective law enforcement cooperation.""

At its peak, the operation gathered data on calls to 116 countries, an official involved in reviewing the list said. Two other officials said they did not recall the precise number of countries, but it was more than 100. That gave the collection a considerable sweep; the U.S. government recognizes a total of 195 countries.

At one time or another, officials said, the data collection covered most of the countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean, as well as others in western Africa, Europe and Asia. It included Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Italy, Mexico and Canada.

The DEA often — though not always — notified foreign governments it was collecting call records, in part to make sure its agents would not be expelled if the program was discovered. In some cases, the DEA provided some of that information to foreign law enforcement agencies to help them build their own investigations, officials said.

The DEA did not have a real-time connection to phone companies' data; instead, the companies regularly provided copies of their call logs, first on computer disks and later over a private network. Agents who used the system said the numbers they saw were seldom more than a few days old.

The database did not include callers' names or other identifying data. Officials said agents often were able to identify individuals associated with telephone numbers flagged by the analysis, either by cross-referencing them against other databases or by sending follow-up requests to the phone companies.

To keep the program secret, the DEA sought not to use the information as evidence in criminal prosecutions or in its justification for warrants or other searches. Instead, its Special Operations Division passed the data to field agents as tips to help them find new targets or focus existing investigations, a process approved by Justice Department lawyers. Many of those tips were classified because the DEA phone searches drew on other intelligence data.

That practice sparked a furor when the Reuters news agency reported in 2013 that the DEA trained agents to conceal the sources of those tips from judges and defense lawyers. Reuters said the tips were based on wiretaps, foreign intelligence and a DEA database of telephone calls gathered through routine subpoenas and search warrants.

As a result, ""the government short-circuited any debate about the legality and wisdom of putting the call records of millions of innocent people in the hands of the DEA,"" American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Patrick Toomey said.

Listen to Brad Heath detail his investigation into decades of bulk data collection in the audio player below:

A BLUEPRINT FOR BROADER SURVEILLANCE

The NSA began collecting its own data on Americans' phone calls within months of Sept. 11, 2001, as a way to identify potential terrorists within the USA. At first, it did so without court approval. In 2006, after The New York Times and USA TODAY began reporting on the surveillance program, President George W. Bush's administration brought it under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the government to use secret court orders to get access to records relevant to national security investigations. Unlike the DEA, the NSA also gathered logs of calls within the USA.

The similarities between the NSA program and the DEA operation established a decade earlier are striking – too much so to have been a coincidence, people familiar with the programs said. Former NSA general counsel Stewart Baker said, ""It's very hard to see (the DEA operation) as anything other than the precursor"" to the NSA's terrorist surveillance.

Both operations relied on an expansive interpretation of the word ""relevant,"" for example — one that allowed the government to collect vast amounts of information on the premise that some tiny fraction of it would be useful to investigators. Both used similar internal safeguards, requiring analysts to certify that they had ""reasonable articulable suspicion"" – a comparatively low legal threshold – that a phone number was linked to a drug or intelligence case before they could query the records.

""The foundation of the NSA program was a mirror image of what we were doing,"" said a former Justice Department official who helped oversee the surveillance. That official said he and others briefed NSA lawyers several times on the particulars of their surveillance program. Two former DEA officials also said the NSA had been briefed on the operation. The NSA declined to comment.

There were also significant differences.

For one thing, DEA analysts queried their data collection far more often. The NSA said analysts searched its telephone database only about 300 times in 2012; DEA analysts routinely performed that many searches in a day, former officials said. Beyond that, NSA analysts must have approval from a judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court each time they want to search their own collection of phone metadata, and they do not automatically cross-reference it with other intelligence files.

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., then the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, complained last year to Holder that the DEA had been gathering phone data ""in bulk"" without judicial oversight. Officials said the DEA's database was disclosed to judges only occasionally, in classified hearings.

For two decades, it was never reviewed by the Justice Department's own inspector general, which told Congress it is now looking into the DEA's bulk data collections.

A SMALLER SCALE COLLECTION

Holder pulled the plug on the phone data collection in September 2013.

That summer, Snowden leaked a remarkable series of classified documents detailing some of the government's most prized surveillance secrets, including the NSA's logging of domestic phone calls and Internet traffic. Reuters and The New York Times raised questions about the drug agency's own access to phone records.

Officials said the Justice Department told the DEA that it had determined it could not continue both surveillance programs, particularly because part of its justification for sweeping NSA surveillance was that it served national security interests, not ordinary policing. Eight months after USTO was halted, for example, department lawyers defended the spy agency's phone dragnet in court partly on the grounds that it ""serves special governmental needs above and beyond normal law enforcement.""

Three months after USTO was shut down, a review panel commissioned by President Obama urged Congress to bar the NSA from gathering telephone data on Americans in bulk. Not long after that, Obama instructed the NSA to get permission from the surveillance court before querying its phone data collection, a step the drug agency never was required to take.

The DEA stopped searching USTO in September 2013. Not long after that, it purged the database.

""It was made abundantly clear that they couldn't defend both programs,"" a former Justice Department official said. Others said Holder's message was more direct. ""He said he didn't think we should have that information,"" a former DEA official said.

By then, agents said USTO was suffering from diminishing returns. More criminals — especially the sophisticated cartel operatives the agency targeted — were communicating on Internet messaging systems that are harder for law enforcement to track.

Still, the shutdown took a toll, officials said. ""It has had a major impact on investigations,"" one former DEA official said.

The DEA asked the Justice Department to restart the surveillance program in December 2013. It withdrew that request when agents came up with a new solution. Every day, the agency assembles a list of the telephone numbers its agents suspect may be tied to drug trafficking. Each day, it sends electronic subpoenas — sometimes listing more than a thousand numbers — to telephone companies seeking logs of international telephone calls linked to those numbers, two official familiar with the program said.

The data collection that results is more targeted but slower and more expensive. Agents said it takes a day or more to pull together communication profiles that used to take minutes.

The White House proposed a similar approach for the NSA's telephone surveillance program, which is set to expire June 1. That approach would halt the NSA's bulk data collection but would give the spy agency the power to force companies to turn over records linked to particular telephone numbers, subject to a court order.

As Russian officials reiterated that Mr. Snowden was in the transit zone of Moscow 's Sheremetyevo International Airport , his ability to leave appeared to hinge on two points—whether there was a country that would allow him free transit on his way to Ecuador , which has said it would consider granting him asylum , and whether he had the temporary travel documents to get there .
Late Wednesday , Univision Networks posted images of what it said was a `` safe pass '' for temporary travel that had been issued to Mr. Snowden—a document he would need after U.S. officials said earlier this week they had canceled his passport . Word of such a pass echoed comments earlier this week by Julian Assange , the founder of antisecrecy group WikiLeaks , who said Ecuador had given Mr. Snowden a `` refugee document of passage . ''
But according to a senior official in Ecuador 's foreign ministry on Wednesday , Mr. Snowden had no such pass . `` He does not have any documents issued by the government of Ecuador , such as a passport or a refugee identification , '' said Galo Galarza , a senior ministry official . He did n't provide additional details .
Also Wednesday , Ecuador 's foreign ministry said the country would consider whether to grant asylum to Mr. Snowden if he presents himself at one of the country 's diplomatic missions .
`` If he goes to an embassy , we will make a decision.…But if he does n't , we can not speculate about it , '' Foreign Minister Ricardo Patiño said on an official visit to Malaysia . Even then , Mr. Patiño said , a decision could take a long time , as Ecuador is `` still studying '' the asylum request Mr. Snowden submitted . A message posted on Mr. Patiño 's Twitter feed said the decision could be `` taken in one day , one week…or two months . ''

Mr. Snowden arrived in Moscow from Hong Kong on Sunday , according to WikiLeaks , which has said it is funding and guiding the 30-year-old 's attempted escape . The U.S. , where authorities have filed espionage charges against Mr. Snowden , has demanded that international partners , including Russia , apprehend him . Russian President Vladimir Putin denied a U.S. request to expel Mr. Snowden , saying the U.S. fugitive is free to leave Sheremetyevo 's transit area and should get on his way .
An analysis of the commercial air routes available for a U.S. fugitive seeking to travel from Moscow showed that all necessary layover stops on the 7,000-mile route to Ecuador would be in countries that have extradition treaties with the U.S.—including Cuba , which has been working recently to improve U.S. ties and has so far received two flights from Moscow since Sunday without Mr. Snowden aboard .
`` I think the fact that for three days in a row , Snowden has n't gotten on the plane to Cuba begins to tell us something about how welcome he is in Havana , '' said Phil Peters , an analyst at the Cuba Research Center in Washington .
In Washington , Sen. Robert Menendez ( D. , N.J. ) , the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said granting asylum to Mr. Snowden would imperil access to the U.S. market for Ecuadorean goods under a trade-preference regimen that must be renewed by Congress next month .
Snowden on the Run U.S. authorities sought to catch Edward Snowden before he reached his next goal : political asylum in Ecuador .
`` Our government will not reward countries for bad behavior , '' said Mr. Menendez in a news release . If Ecuador grants Mr. Snowden asylum , Mr. Menendez said he would lead the effort to cut Ecuador 's duty-free access to the U.S. market . `` I urge President [ Rafael ] Correa to do the right thing by the United States and Ecuador , and deny Snowden 's request for asylum . ''
Four cities in the world could serve as a one-stop connection between Sheremetyevo airport and Quito , Ecuador , on a passenger flight , including Miami , Amsterdam and Madrid .
The fourth is Havana . That appears to make one of the five weekly flights on Russian airline OAO Aeroflot to Cuba Mr. Snowden 's best bet to reach Ecuador on a commercial flight .
Cuba has a bilateral extradition treaty with the U.S . The treaty has been little used in recent decades , though , and the country has a history of sheltering U.S. fugitives , most of them dating from the 1970s , including convicted murderers to hijackers . But Havana , which has just concluded talks in Washington about renewing direct postal links and is scheduled to start talks on immigration next month , would be loath to jeopardize a warming trend between the two countries , said Mr. Peters of the Cuba Research Center . In 2006 , in the State Department 's annual country report on terrorism , Havana said it would no longer provide safe haven to new fugitives , Mr. Peters noted .
`` If that is the case , that 's what is applying to Snowden here , '' he said .
Russia 's Mr. Putin has attempted to maintain some distance from Mr. Snowden , explaining that while the fugitive remains in the airport 's transit zone , he has n't crossed into Russian territory . But experts in international law say that while such zones are something of a no man 's land , they do n't operate outside a host country 's laws as would , for example , a diplomatic mission—meaning that there would be little stopping Cuba from seizing a fugitive in its own transit zone .
`` The misperception is that people in this zone are immune and that this is some kind of special international territory , which it is not . Countries can exercise jurisdiction on a number of public-order or public-safety issues , '' said an international diplomat working on relocating refugees .
Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has also said he would consider an asylum request from Mr. Snowden . However , like Ecuador , there are no commercial routes between Sheremetyevo airport and Venezuela that do n't require a stop in a country that has an extradition treaty with the U.S .
Mr. Snowden could also reach Ecuador via a more elaborate route : A commercial cargo flight from Dakar , Senegal , to Quito . Senegal does n't have an extradition treaty with the U.S . However , that scenario would require the cooperation of the German airline that operates the route , Deutsche Lufthansa AG . A Lufthansa spokesman said the airline never transports civilians on its cargo flights and would n't accommodate Mr. Snowden .
Only three or four private jets are capable of making a nonstop flight from Moscow to Quito . Only the largest jets from Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. , the G650 or G550 , would be able to make the flight comfortably , with ranges in excess of the 7,200 miles between the two capital cities . A Bombardier Global 6000 XRS could also make the trip with one or two passengers , little luggage and favorable winds , according to the operations director at PrivateFly , a booking service for aircraft charters based near London .
PrivateFly calculated that such a one-way door-to-door charter , including all expenses , would cost $ 212,000 .
Instead of trying to reach Quito , Mr. Snowden could also try for refuge in an Ecuadorean embassy . Ecuador could try to transport him from the airport in a car with diplomatic license plates . But such a move would likely require Russia 's blessing , said Philip Trott , an immigration lawyer and London-based partner at Bates Wells Braithwaite . `` He 'd need to be granted permission to enter '' the country through border control and a visa , Mr. Trott said . A diplomatic official who works on the international resettlement of refugees said Russia also could `` lift the diplomatic recognition of the vehicle in two seconds . ''
Mr. Assange , the WikiLeaks founder , received asylum from Ecuador in 2012 and has spent more than a year in the country 's embassy in London , beyond the reach of U.K. authorities who want to extradite him to Sweden to face sexual-assault allegations that he says are fabricated .
Mr. Assange , however , was able to walk into the embassy because he was n't in custody at the time . He spent about a month there before Ecuador granted him asylum .
One remaining option is for Mr. Snowden to apply for asylum in Russia . Though Mr. Putin has suggested he would rather see Mr. Snowden leave the country , Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said Russia would consider an asylum application from the fugitive as it would any other .

France joined the push with Germany after new revelations this week published in Le Monde showed massive spying on the part of the NSA on French telephone data, including that of French politicians, according to The Christian Science Monitor.

But anger was not limited to the two major powers within the eurozone. Former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt shared his indignation with BBC Radio 4's Today program: ""There is no reason to spy on Angela Merkel. It's a real scandal,"" he said, as quoted in the Guardian. ""A new agreement is needed between the EU and the US; this cannot continue.”

Dismay in the EU is likely to mount further with allegations that the NSA was listening in on the conversations of 35 world leaders, according to a report in the Guardian detailing a 2006 NSA memo provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

The statement Friday from EU leaders read: ""A lack of trust could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field of intelligence-gathering.""

The spying allegations could influence a host of issues between the US and Europe that go beyond actual spying.

Michel Barnier, the EU's internal market commissioner, told the BBC that he wanted to develop a European data cloud, independent of American oversight.

The European Parliament, meanwhile, has pushed for stronger data privacy rules that are controversial among member states as they increase the cost of business. But it could gain more proponents as European anger over American spying mounts.

Such rules could indirectly impact a key deal between the US and EU right now: the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). This is because the US might balk atthe high costs of potential new privacy data laws in Europe. The Christian Science Monitor explained how such rules could impact American companies like Google and Facebook.

Yet while the NSA scandal has also led to direct calls by some European politicians to call TTIP talks off, it seems that for now both the US and EU are attempting to control the damage and keep the negotiations moving forward.

“I always take the view that when you leave the room, you have to always contemplate how to get back in again,” said Merkel, according to The New York Times. “In such a tense situation, such talks may be even more important than usual.”",www.csmonitor.com,center,u6N6f12vsK8IhBc4

In an interview with CBS ' `` 60 Minutes , '' Rick Ledgett said that Snowden took `` the keys to the kingdom '' when he left the U.S. earlier this year and was granted temporary asylum in Russia .
He said he supports at least having a discussion about offering Snowden amnesty from criminal charges if he returns sensitive files still in his possession , and claimed others at the NSA share that view .
`` My personal view is , yes , it 's worth having a conversation about , '' Ledgett said . `` I would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured and my bar for those assurances would be very high . It would be more than just an assertion on his part . ''
However , NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander sharply disagreed . He likened it to `` a hostage taker taking 50 people hostage , shooting 10 and then say 'You give me full amnesty and I 'll let the other 40 go . ' ''
`` I think people have to be held accountable for their actions , '' Alexander said . `` Because what we do n't want is the next person to do the same thing , race off to Hong Kong and to Moscow with another set of data knowing they can strike the same deal . ''
`` Our position has n't changed on that matter at all , '' Press Secretary Jay Carney said . `` What I can tell you is Snowden has been accused of leaking classified information and faces felony charges in the U.S . He should be returned to the U.S. as soon as possible where he 'll be afforded due process and protections . ''
Ledgett also told CBS correspondent John Miller , himself a former employee of the office of the Director of National Intelligence , that he would not dispute an estimation that Snowden had taken 1.7 million documents from the NSA 's hard drives , using his security clearance to get around measures that blocked off access for typical employees .
`` He did something that we call scraping , '' Ledgett said . `` Where he went out and just went -- used tools to scrape information from websites , and put it into a place where he could download it . ''
Ledgett said that Snowden had taken `` an exhaustive list of the requirements that have been levied against -- against the National Security Agency . And what that gives is , what topics we 're interested in , where our gaps are . But additional information about U.S. capabilities and U.S. gaps is provided as part of that . ''
Ledgett estimated that 31,000 of the documents taken by Snowden dealt with U.S. intelligence capabilities and gaps related to countries like China , Russia , and Iran .
A series of articles published by The Washington Post and by journalist Glenn Greenwald based on documents leaked by Snowden have brought the NSA 's practice of collecting phone records and monitoring Internet use by millions around the world under public scrutiny . The NSA has consistently defended its practices as legal .
Alexander strongly denied to `` 60 Minutes '' that the NSA could monitor the communications of any American at any time .
`` NSA can only target the communications of a U.S. person with a probable cause finding under specific court order , '' Alexander said . `` Today , we have less than 60 authorizations on specific persons to do that . ''
Alexander also defended the agency 's practice of collecting so-called `` metadata '' on various phone calls , including the number dialed , time , date , and frequency .
`` How do you know when the bad guy who 's using those same communications that my daughters use , is in the United States trying to do something bad ? '' Alexander asked . `` The least intrusive way of doing that is metadata .
`` The 'to/from ' number , the duration of the call and date/time , that 's all you get , '' Alexander said later in the interview . `` And all we can do is tell the FBI , 'That number is talking to somebody who is very bad , you ought to go look at it .

Paul v Candidate X

Paul v Obama in 2014 could be an effective way of helping Paul v the Democratic candidate in 2016, if he runs for President.

It's no secret that Paul is considering such a step, but nothing's official yet.

""I keep looking at my schedule and I see New Hampshire, I see Iowa, I see South Carolina and I don't understand why I keep going to these states.""

The case against a Somali-born U.S. citizen convicted in a foiled bombing plot was built partly on secret information ""obtained or derived"" from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the Justice Department has acknowledged.

A jury convicted Mohamed Osman Mohamud in January of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction at a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland three years ago. Mohamud, a naturalized U.S. citizen, faces a possible life sentence. He had been scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Garr M. King on Dec. 18, but that proceeding could be delayed as lawyers wrangle over the use of overseas surveillance materials.

Oregon U.S. Attorney S. Amanda Marshall filed a two-paragraph notice Tuesday evening acknowledging to the defense that FISA had been used. It's part of a broader stream of disclosures to defendants that the U.S. government used warrantless electronic foreign intelligence surveillance in some way in the proceedings against them.

For their part, prosecutors were tight-lipped about the new disclosures, referring calls to the Justice Department headquarters in Washington.

""In keeping with the department's ongoing, publicly confirmed review, the government has given notice that evidence derived from Title VII of FISA was used in this case,"" Justice Department spokesman Andrew Ames said.

It's not clear exactly how prosecutors used intelligence intercepts in the Mohamud case. But earlier this year, The Oregonian reported that testimony during his trial revealed that the 22-year-old wrote for an electronic magazine devoted to jihad, exchanged emails with accused terrorists, and kept in touch with another man who traveled outside the U.S. to join the fight against ""coalition troops in Afghanistan.""

To challenge the constitutionality of the surveillance law, people need to demonstrate they have been harmed, and new proof that the government has used a section of FISA known as 702 in a criminal prosecution would finally give a defendant the ""standing"" to bring a case.

But another issue , one that 's just beginning to come into public focus , may carry the long-term potential to do far more damage to Mr. Putin 's and Russia 's already deteriorating image in the West .
That is the widespread impression , based on a new Russian law that bans `` homosexual propaganda , '' that Putin 's Russia is drifting out of the modern world altogether . The new law clearly suggests the Kremlin is trying to engineer a conformist `` majoritarian '' society in which minorities – especially the country 's beleaguered LGBT community – may exist only in private and will be severely punished for any attempt to assert their identity in the public square .
The law , which is backed by the powerful Russian Orthodox Church , does not explicitly ban homosexuality , but looks more like the US military 's former `` Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell '' rule applied to the whole of Russian society . Supporters say gay people should be allowed to live their own lives out of public sight , but must not be permitted to speak about their `` non-traditional '' orientation or display it in any venue where it might be witnessed by minors which , in the Internet age , is just about any non-private space .
`` Russia 's public development is taking the right path , '' says Fr . Vsevolod Chaplin , a leading spokesman for the Orthodox Church . `` This law gives us a chance to preserve the purity of childhood , and to oppose the artificial sexualization of children . I hope that other countries will follow Russia 's lead , because the normalization of homosexuality is wrong . ''
Reaction in the US has been gathering steam in recent weeks , including an appeal – probably misdirected – to boycott Russian vodka , which has seen many taverns around the world take the iconic Russian beverage off their shelves . Some protesters have demonstratively dumped bottles of the stuff into the streets .
But most worrisome by far to the Kremlin is a growing call for the US and Western countries to boycott the upcoming Sochi Winter Olympics , a move that would humiliate and isolate Russia like no other , and could eviscerate the personal prestige of the Games ' chief promoter , Vladimir Putin . Following Mr. Obama 's decision to shun a summit meeting with Putin , the political stage appears to be set for a major effort by global LGBT groups and their supporters to step up efforts to achieve exactly that .
Both Western misconceptions about the Russian law , as well as the view that Russia is completely out-of-step with the world on the issue of gay rights , are on full display in the exchange about Russia between Obama and Jay Leno on Tuesday 's edition of NBC 's Tonight Show .
`` Something that shocked me about Russia , and I 'm surprised that this is not a huge story , homosexuality is against the law , '' Mr. Leno says , comparing the situation to Nazi Germany . `` I mean , it starts with that . You round up people .... Why is not more of the world outraged about this ? ''
Obama responded by saying he has `` no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgender persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful to them .... I think Putin and Russia have a big stake in making sure the Olympics work and I think they understand that for most of the countries that participate in the Olympics , we wouldn ’ t tolerate gays and lesbians being treated differently . ''
Russian media have reacted angrily , especially to the misconception – clearly voiced by Leno – that homosexuality has been outlawed in Russia . A good primer on the Russian point of view can be found on the website of the Kremlin 's English-language TV network Russia Today , which prefers to be called RT .
An accompanying video report quotes RT 's own openly gay British presenter Martin Andrews , who 's lived in Russia for 8 years , as insisting that the gay community in Russia is `` thriving , excitable , wonderful [ and is ] happy here . ''
But the RT report almost contradicts itself by showing only the closed , unmarked factory-style gates of a Moscow gay nightclub which , the report admits , is in a `` discreet location '' and whose owners would not permit any filming inside `` to protect the privacy of its clients . ''
Mr. Andrews explained : `` I think if you compare America , for example , you can ’ t look at San Francisco and Los Angeles and New York and then look in the middle part , Texas . That ’ s what Russia is , especially Moscow . You ’ ve got the old meets new , '' he said .
Russian LGBT activists and human rights monitors retort that the law discriminates against sexual minorities and relegates them to second-class citizen status by defining down their civil rights . Worse , they say , it has changed the social atmosphere to encourage a statistically visible uptick in threats and violence against LGBT Russians .
`` This law actually declares sexual minorities to be socially defective persons , so no wonder many people are calling it fascistic , '' says Igor Kochetkov , chairman of the Russian Movement for Rights of Sexual and Gender Minorities .
`` It 's directed against freedom of information , which is particularly useless since teenagers know by the age of 18 what their orientation is , and need access to objective information , '' Mr. Kochetkov says . `` Even if the law is n't actively used by law enforcement , it has already served as a kind of 'green light ' for ultra-right groups to begin witch-hunting gay people . ''
`` Over the past two years ( since local anti-gay propaganda laws were enacted in St. Petersburg and other regions ) we have seen a huge increase in the frequency of public insults , blackmail , threats of violence and actual violence .... Police no longer see any need to open criminal cases when this happens . There is a direct correlation between the rising instance of violence against LGBT people and the passage of this law . ''
Russian officials have so far not offered a coherent explanation of how they plan to avoid a major PR disaster when the world descends on Sochi for the Winter Games in less than six months time . On Thursday Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak assured journalists that athletes coming to the Olympics will not be discriminated against on the basis of sexual orientation .
`` There will be no diminishing of rights based on sexual orientation at the Olympics , neither before nor after . No one should have any concerns whatsoever , '' Mr. Kozak said .
`` People can get on with their private lives , and spread their respective advantages and attraction among adults . The main thing is that this does n't touch children , '' he added .

But some experts say that does not address the basic problem . Not only hundreds of athletes , but thousands of foreign spectators , are expected to attend the Games and – especially amid the current controversy – some of them are bound to be gay rights activists intent on staging protests over the Russian law . Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko told journalists last week that the law will definitely apply to them .
`` No one is forbidding an athlete with non-traditional sexual orientation from coming to Sochi , but if he goes onto the street and starts propagandizing it , then of course he will be held accountable , '' Mr. Mutko said .","President Barack Obama's decision to cancel a planned Moscow summit with President Vladimir Putin next month was brought on by a wide spectrum of US frustrations with Russia, not least of which was its decision to grant temporary asylum to fugitive ex-National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.

Western response

Reaction in the US has been gathering steam in recent weeks, including an appeal – probably misdirected – to boycott Russian vodka, which has seen many taverns around the world take the iconic Russian beverage off their shelves. Some protesters have demonstratively dumped bottles of the stuff into the streets.

Another campaign is aimed at convincing the 27 US cities, including Philadelphia, Honolulu, and Los Angeles, that twinned with Russian cities in the euphoria following the cold war's end, to sever those ties. And a petition posted on the White House website that calls for denying US visas to the Russian law's main authors, Duma deputies Yelena Mizulina and Vitaly Milonov, has aims to gather the 100,000 signatures required to put it on the president's agenda. [Editor's note: The original version misconstrued the petition's status.]

But most worrisome by far to the Kremlin is a growing call for the US and Western countries to boycott the upcoming Sochi Winter Olympics, a move that would humiliate and isolate Russia like no other, and could eviscerate the personal prestige of the Games' chief promoter, Vladimir Putin. Following Mr. Obama's decision to shun a summit meeting with Putin, the political stage appears to be set for a major effort by global LGBT groups and their supporters to step up efforts to achieve exactly that.

“ Therefore , it is lawful , ” she said . “ It has been briefed to Congress . ”
While refusing to confirm or to directly comment on the reported court order , Verizon , in an internal e-mail to employees , defended its release of calling information to the N.S.A . Randy Milch , an executive vice president and general counsel , wrote that “ the law authorizes the federal courts to order a company to provide information in certain circumstances , and if Verizon were to receive such an order , we would be required to comply . ”
Sprint and AT & T have also received demands for data from national security officials , according to people familiar with the requests . Those companies as well as T-Mobile and CenturyLink declined to say Thursday whether they were or had been under a similar court order .
Lawmakers and administration officials who support the phone program defended it in part by noting that it was only for “ metadata ” — like logs of calls sent and received — and did not involve listening in on people ’ s conversations .
The Internet company program appeared to involve eavesdropping on the contents of communications of foreigners . The senior administration official said its legal basis was the so-called FISA Amendments Act , a 2008 law that allows the government to obtain an order from a national security court to conduct blanket surveillance of foreigners abroad without individualized warrants even if the interception takes place on American soil .
The law , which Congress reauthorized in late 2012 , is controversial in part because Americans ’ e-mails and phone calls can be swept into the database without an individualized court order when they communicate with people overseas . While the newspapers portrayed the classified documents as indicating that the N.S.A . obtained direct access to the companies ’ servers , several of the companies — including Google , Facebook , Microsoft and Apple — denied that the government could do so . Instead , the companies have negotiated with the government technical means to provide specific data in response to court orders , according to people briefed on the arrangements .","“As far as I know, this is an exact three-month renewal of what has been the case for the past seven years,” Ms. Feinstein said, adding that it was carried out by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court “under the business records section of the Patriot Act.”

Randy Milch, an executive vice president and general counsel, wrote that “the law authorizes the federal courts to order a company to provide information in certain circumstances, and if Verizon were to receive such an order, we would be required to comply.”

Sprint and AT&T have also received demands for data from national security officials, according to people familiar with the requests. Those companies as well as T-Mobile and CenturyLink declined to say Thursday whether they were or had been under a similar court order.

Lawmakers and administration officials who support the phone program defended it in part by noting that it was only for “metadata” — like logs of calls sent and received — and did not involve listening in on people’s conversations.

The Internet company program appeared to involve eavesdropping on the contents of communications of foreigners. The senior administration official said its legal basis was the so-called FISA Amendments Act, a 2008 law that allows the government to obtain an order from a national security court to conduct blanket surveillance of foreigners abroad without individualized warrants even if the interception takes place on American soil.

The law, which Congress reauthorized in late 2012, is controversial in part because Americans’ e-mails and phone calls can be swept into the database without an individualized court order when they communicate with people overseas. While the newspapers portrayed the classified documents as indicating that the N.S.A. obtained direct access to the companies’ servers, several of the companies — including Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple — denied that the government could do so. Instead, the companies have negotiated with the government technical means to provide specific data in response to court orders, according to people briefed on the arrangements.",www.nytimes.com,left,8YOeget1R20Cfb02

Many governments around the world have expressed outrage over the National Security Agency's use of the Internet as a spying platform. But the possible response may have an unforeseen consequence: It may actually lead to more online surveillance, according to Internet experts.

Some governments, led most recently by Brazil, have reacted to recent disclosures about NSA surveillance by proposing a redesign of Internet architecture. The goal would be to give governments more control over how the Internet operates within their own borders.

But privacy advocates warn that some of the changes under consideration could actually undermine Internet freedom, not strengthen it.

""Unfortunately, there is enormous blowback,"" says Bruce Schneier, a cybersecurity expert who has worked closely with Britain's Guardian newspaper in reporting on NSA surveillance activities.

Schneier says some of those who advocate changes in Internet governance are acting unwisely, though he blames the NSA for having undermined global confidence in the Internet and prompting ill-advised reform moves.

""The NSA's actions embolden these people to say, 'We need more sovereign control,' "" Schneier says. ""This is bad. We really need a global Internet.""

An Absence Of Government Control

Those who have closely followed the Internet, such as Milton Mueller of Syracuse University, say its free and open character is due largely to the absence of government control.

""The reason the Internet worked, the reason it created this massive amount of innovation, is precisely because, for a brief period of about 10 years, it just completely overcame the telecommunications system of national boundaries,"" Mueller says. ""It created a virtual space that was completely interconnected and globalized, and governments had to react to that after the fact.""

To the extent one country has dominated the Internet, it's been the United States. The only organization with a significant Internet governance function, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), was set up by the United States. Also, the companies most associated with the Internet around the world, such as Microsoft, Google and Facebook, are U.S. firms.

Prior to the uproar over NSA surveillance on the Internet, an argument could be made that American control of the Internet had served the cause of Internet freedom.

""In the area of free speech, I think it's been a great thing that the United States has had this hugely disproportionate role in providing the Internet's infrastructure,"" says Andrew McLaughlin, an Internet entrepreneur and formerly the deputy chief technology officer for the United States. ""Our First Amendment traditions have meant that freedom of speech and freedom of expression have prevailed and really characterized the Internet globally.""

Suspicion Of American Surveillance

But McLaughlin sees that record now in jeopardy.

""We've kind of blown it,"" he says. ""The global fear and suspicion about American surveillance is pushing countries to centralize their [Internet] infrastructures and get the U.S. out of the picture. Ultimately, I think that will have negative consequences for free speech as well as for protection of privacy.""

Some of the countries pushing for more international control over the Internet were never all that supportive of Internet freedom, like Russia and China. But they've now been joined by countries like Brazil, whose president, Dilma Rousseff, was furious when she read reports that she was herself an NSA target.

Speaking at the United Nations last month, Rousseff called for a new ""multilateral framework"" for Internet governance and new measures ""to ensure the effective protection of data that travel through the Web.""

At home, Rousseff has suggested that Brazil partially disconnect from U.S.-based parts of the Internet and take steps to keep Brazilians' online data stored in Brazil, supposedly out of the NSA's reach.

But Schneier says such moves would lead to ""increased Balkanization"" of the Internet.

One indication of the discontent with the dominant U.S. role on the Internet came at a meeting in Uruguay last week. Directors of major Internet organizations, including ICANN, endorsed a call for all governments to be treated equally in Internet governance.

The ICANN president, Fadi Chehade, actually praised Rousseff for her ""leadership"" and personally backed her effort to challenge the United States on Internet governance issues.

In Europe, policymakers have discussed the possibility of writing new rules for how information can flow around the world. Some proposals would introduce restrictions on how U.S. companies like Google can operate overseas.

Mueller, who teaches at Syracuse University's School of Information Studies, says such a move would be costly.

Readers of this page are well aware of the revelations during the past six months of spying by the National Security Agency (NSA). Edward Snowden, a former employee of an NSA vendor, risked his life and liberty to inform us of a governmental conspiracy to violate our right to privacy, a right guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment.

The conspiracy he revealed is vast. It involves former President George W. Bush, President Obama, their aides, a dozen or so members of Congress, federal judges, executives and technicians for American computer servers and telecommunications companies, and the thousands of NSA employees and vendors who have manipulated their fellow conspirators. The conspirators all agreed that it would be a crime for any of them to reveal the conspiracy. Mr. Snowden violated that agreement in order to uphold his higher oath to defend the Constitution.

The object of the conspiracy is to emasculate all Americans and many foreigners of their right to privacy in order to predict our behavior and make it easier to find among us those who are planning harm.

A conspiracy is an agreement among two or more persons to commit a crime. The crimes consist of capturing the emails, texts and phone calls of every American, tracing the movements of millions of Americans and foreigners via the GPS system in their cellphones, seizing the bank records and utility bills of most Americans in direct contravention of the Constitution, and pretending to do so lawfully. The pretense is that somehow Congress lessened the standard for spying that is set forth in the Constitution. It is, of course, inconceivable that Congress can change the Constitution (only the states can), but the conspirators would have us believe that it has done so.

The Constitution, which was written in the aftermath of the unhappy colonial experience with British soldiers who executed general warrants upon the colonists, forbids that practice today. That practice consists of judges authorizing government agents to search for whatever they want, wherever they wish to look. By requiring a warrant from a judge based on probable cause of criminal behavior on the part of the very person the government is investigating, however, and by requiring judges to describe particularly in the warrants they issue the places to be searched or the persons or things to be seized, the Constitution specifically outlaws general warrants.

This is more than just a constitutional violation — it is a violation of the natural right to be left alone. When that right is violated, when all of our private movements are monitored by the government, the menu of our free choices is reduced, as we surely alter our private behavior to compensate for being watched. Just as surely, the government expands its surveillance, knowing that it is not being watched.

As a result of these revelations, no one has been fired, except Mr. Snowden, and the conspiracy has grown. Earlier this week, The Washington Post reported that the FBI is now spying on us. It seems that the FBI, no doubt jealous of the unpunished lawlessness of the NSA, has acquired software that permits it to utilize the tiny cameras in many home computers to observe whoever or whatever may be in front of the computer screen. The FBI doesn’t only look at whoever is using the computer screen; it also captures the words and images on the screen. It seems to have an affinity for monitoring online gaming, even the lawful variety.

In 1949, when George Orwell predicted in his terrifying novel “Nineteen Eighty-Four” the future use of television sets to watch us in our homes, many thought he was a delusional paranoid. It turns out that he was just off by a generation. His predictions have come to pass.

Like many growing conspiracies, this one has spawned others. The Washington Post also reported this week that local cops, too, are jealous of the NSA and its ability to break the law with impunity. In an effort to catch bad guys, local police in half a dozen American cities have begun to ask local telecommunications providers for a “tower dump.” A tower dump consists of digital recordings of all cellphone usage from a given cell tower.

The Khorasan Group is an especially hard target because , unlike other al Qaeda spinoffs , it stays in the shadows and refrains from pronouncements on social media . Its goal is to design explosives that can defeat airport security and blow up an airliner , killing hundreds of people . Its prime target : the United States .
“ Intelligence reports indicated that the Khorasan Group was in the final stages of plans to execute major attacks against Western targets and potentially the U.S. homeland , ” Army Lt. Gen. William Mayville , director of operations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told reporters Tuesday at the Pentagon .
Defense analysts said that signals intelligence or Sigint — the result of intercepted communications — likely played a major role because developing spies in war-wracked Syria has been difficult at best and often results in unreliable information .
The NSA has weathered a barrage of criticism since last year , when rogue contractor Edward Snowden leaked to the news media reams of top-secret documents about how the Fort Meade , Maryland-based agency vacuums up mountains of phone and Internet data .
But U.S. airstrikes on the shadowy Khorasan Group ’ s operational centers show that America can not fight a war on terrorism without electronic eavesdropping , analysts said .
SEE ALSO : Fears grow that Obama has ‘ paper coalition ’ in Arab world
“ Presumably , all available intelligence assets are being brought to bear on this mission , including signals intelligence , overhead reconnaissance and human intelligence [ Humint ] , ” said Steven Aftergood , a national security director at the Federation of American Scientists . “ In the past , the kind of signals intelligence performed by NSA has been a strength for U.S. war fighters , while human sources have often been unreliable or hard to come by . In all likelihood , the same is true today . ”
With unprecedented assistance from the Arab nations of Saudi Arabia , Qatar , Bahrain , Jordan and the United Arab Emirates , the U.S. conducted airstrikes Monday night against the Islamic State group and the Khorasan Group west of the Syrian city of Aleppo , hitting “ training camps , an explosives and munitions production facility , a communication building , and command and control facilities , ” according to a Pentagon statement .
The target list of U.S. Central Command suggests the U.S. came to know a lot about the Khorasan Group ’ s day-to-day activities .

The Khorasan Group is an especially hard target because, unlike other al Qaeda spinoffs, it stays in the shadows and refrains from pronouncements on social media. Its goal is to design explosives that can defeat airport security and blow up an airliner, killing hundreds of people. Its prime target: the United States.

“Intelligence reports indicated that the Khorasan Group was in the final stages of plans to execute major attacks against Western targets and potentially the U.S. homeland,” Army Lt. Gen. William Mayville, director of operations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters Tuesday at the Pentagon.

Defense analysts said that signals intelligence or Sigint — the result of intercepted communications — likely played a major role because developing spies in war-wracked Syria has been difficult at best and often results in unreliable information.

The NSA has weathered a barrage of criticism since last year, when rogue contractor Edward Snowden leaked to the news media reams of top-secret documents about how the Fort Meade, Maryland-based agency vacuums up mountains of phone and Internet data.

But U.S. airstrikes on the shadowy Khorasan Group’s operational centers show that America cannot fight a war on terrorism without electronic eavesdropping, analysts said.

“Presumably, all available intelligence assets are being brought to bear on this mission, including signals intelligence, overhead reconnaissance and human intelligence [Humint],” said Steven Aftergood, a national security director at the Federation of American Scientists. “In the past, the kind of signals intelligence performed by NSA has been a strength for U.S. war fighters, while human sources have often been unreliable or hard to come by. In all likelihood, the same is true today.”

With unprecedented assistance from the Arab nations of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, the U.S. conducted airstrikes Monday night against the Islamic State group and the Khorasan Group west of the Syrian city of Aleppo, hitting “training camps, an explosives and munitions production facility, a communication building, and command and control facilities,” according to a Pentagon statement.

The target list of U.S. Central Command suggests the U.S. came to know a lot about the Khorasan Group’s day-to-day activities.

Retired Army Maj. Gen. Robert Scales was impressed by the amount of intelligence the U.S. had collected in order to put Tomahawk cruise missiles on precise Khorasan locations.

“What’s important here is that, when we operate in a denied area like Syria, it’s pretty much all Sigint,” Gen. Scales said. “Over time, we will re-establish our Humint [spies] network, but that takes time and it’s infinitely harder.”

In a new development , the National Security Agency and the FBI are tapping into the central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies in real time , obtaining audio and video chats , photographs , e-mails and other information , various news outlets reported . The program is code-named PRISM .
The revelation that the National Security Agency has been collecting phone records from Verizon Communications of all calls within the U.S. and to sources overseas raised accusations that President Obama is running a police state , in spite of his 2008 campaign promise to expand civil liberties while prosecuting the war on terror differently from his Republican predecessor .
On Thursday , the scope of the records seizure apparently expanded as former government officials familiar with the details of the domestic spying said more phone companies likely are involved and lawmakers said the court order is a routine three-month update of an ongoing program .
But a White House official said such domestic surveillance is a “ critical tool in protecting the nation from terror threats . ”
“ It allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities , particularly people located inside the United States , ” said White House deputy press secretary Joshua Earnest .

“ The information acquired does not include the content of any communications or the name of any subscriber . It relates exclusively to call details , such as a telephone number or the length of a telephone call . ”
The furor prompted Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to issue a rare statement late Thursday night in which he argued that the disclosure “ threatens potentially long-lasting and irreversible harm to our ability to identify and respond to the many threats facing our nation . ”
“ Discussing programs like this publicly will have an impact on the behavior of our adversaries and make it more difficult for us to understand their intentions , ” Mr. Clapper said .
The timing of the report came as the Obama administration already taking fire over civil liberties issues , from the IRS targeting conservative groups for extra scrutiny to the Justice Department seizing the phone records of journalists in efforts to uncover the sources of leaks of classified information .
Lawmakers of both parties on the Senate Intelligence Committee said the wholesale domestic surveillance has been going on for seven years , and that it ’ s necessary to prevent terrorist attacks .
“ It ’ s called protecting America , ” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein , California Democrat , saying that the secret court order which Britain ’ s Guardian newspaper posted online Wednesday night is a routine three-month renewal and proves that the program is carefully overseen by federal judges .
Sen. Saxby Chambliss , Georgia Republican , said the surveillance has “ proved meritorious , because we have gathered significant information on bad guys , but only on bad guys , over the years . ”
But other lawmakers called the seizures an outrageous invasion of privacy and they said the Patriot Act , under which the snooping was granted , was never intended to allow for blanket surveillance of Americans without any suspicion of wrongdoing .
Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. , who as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee helped write the Patriot Act after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , said the administration ’ s massive collection of phone records is an “ abuse ” of the law .
“ How could the phone records of so many innocent Americans be relevant to an authorized investigation as required by the act ? ” he wrote in a letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr .
Sen. Ron Wyden , Oregon Democrat , also raised the possibility of administration officials lying to Congress in service of the program . He posted on his Twitter feed a video in which Director of National Intelligence James Clapper “ specifically told me # NSA does not wittingly collect any type of data on millions of Americans . ”
“ No , sir … not wittingly , ” Mr. Clapper told Mr. Wyden at the March hearing in response to a question worded near identically to the senator ’ s Thursday tweet , though he cautioned that NSA could “ inadvertently collect ” such data .
Already reeling from accusations of too much intrusion by the Justice Department , White House officials did not dispute that a court order signed by Judge Roger Vinson of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in April directs Verizon Communications to turn over “ on an ongoing daily basis ” to the NSA all call logs “ between the United States and abroad ” or “ wholly within the United States , including local telephone calls . ”
The FBI requested the court order , first reported by Britain ’ s Guardian newspaper , with the surveillance to last until July 19 .
A former NSA employee , William Binney , said other phone companies ’ records have been seized routinely by the agency . USA Today reported in 2006 that three phone companies — Verizon , Bell South and AT & T — had been turning over data on Americans ’ domestic phone calls to NSA , though lawmakers told the newspaper then that the companies ’ cooperation was only partial .
“ NSA has been doing all this stuff all along and it ’ s been all the companies , not just one , ” Mr. Binney said in a discussion hosted by the progressive nonprofit group Democracy Now !
Thomas Drake , another former NSA official , said the revelation shows that government secrecy has become “ institutionalized . ”
“ This isn ’ t just a terrorist issue , this is simply the ability of the government in secret on a vast scale to collect any and all phone call records including domestic to domestic , local , as well as location information , ” Mr. Drake said .
“ There is no need to call this the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court . Let ’ s just call it the ‘ surveillance court , ’ it ’ s no longer about foreign intelligence . It ’ s simply about harvesting millions and millions and millions of phone call records and beyond , ” he said .
Also Thursday , the Guardian revealed the five-year existence of another NSA-FBI surveillance program , this one getting data from America ’ s Internet giants .
“ The NSA access is part of a previously undisclosed program called PRISM , which allows them to collect material including search history , the content of emails , file transfers and live chats , ” the Guardian wrote , citing a top-secret Power Point presentation .
The slide show boasts of “ collection directly from the servers ” of companies such as Yahoo , Google , Microsoft , Apple . YouTube and Skype . Several of the companies told multiple news outlets Thursday that they had no knowledge of the program and that any access to their servers was clandestine .
University of Notre Dame Law Professor Jimmy Gurulé , a former assistant U.S. Attorney General and former undersecretary for enforcement for the Treasury Department , called the program “ deeply disturbing . ”
“ It strains credulity to believe that there is probable cause to believe that the millions of Americans targeted by the NSA are engaged in international terrorism , ” Mr. Gurulé said . “ This appears to be an abuse of power that threatens the civil liberties of all Americans . Further , if Congress is aware of these FISA warrants and has failed to act to restrain the NSA ’ s overreach , it is complicit by omission . ”
The White House and some lawmakers said Congress is briefed regularly about such surveillance programs .
“ The intelligence community is conducting court-authorized intelligence activities pursuant to a public statute with the knowledge and oversight of Congress and the intelligence community in both houses of Congress , ” Mr . Earnest said .
“ There is also extensive oversight by the executive branch , including the Department of Justice and relevant agency counsels and inspectors general , as well as annual and semi-annual reports to Congress as required by law . ”
But many lawmakers said they are often kept out of the loop on sensitive national security issues .
“ This ‘ fully brief ’ is something that drives us up a wall because often ‘ fully briefed ’ usually means a group of eight [ members of ] leadership , ” said Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski , Maryland Democrat .
Many expressed outrage at the revelation of the phone seizures .
“ If the president and Congress would obey the Fourth Amendment we all swore to uphold , this new shocking revelation that the government is now spying on citizens ’ phone data en masse would never have happened , ” said Sen. Rand Paul , Kentucky Republican .
The White House said Mr. Obama “ welcomes ” a debate about the trade-offs between national security and civil liberty .
“ The close examination of some of these complicated issues could cause people to arrive at differing opinions , ” he said . “ The president welcomes that debate . He has his own ideas , he ’ s presented them . ”
Two weeks ago , in a speech at the National Defense University about the use of drones in the war on terror , Mr. Obama outlined a plan for shifting away from perpetual war with terrorists .
“ In the years to come , we will have to keep working hard to strike the appropriate balance between our need for security and preserving those freedoms that make us who we are , ” Mr. Obama said .

Backlash under way

Privacy advocates reacted angrily to the news.

University of Notre Dame Law Professor Jimmy Gurulé, a former assistant U.S. Attorney General and former undersecretary for enforcement for the Treasury Department, called the program “deeply disturbing.”

Security agency released rare document on policies Friday

Says it ""touches"" 1.6% of Web traffic, reads .00004%

The entire document is dated August 9, 2013, and has no attributable names or contact details on it. Its most striking portion? A separate block of text on page six, which states:

""According to figures published by a major tech provider, the Internet carries 1,826 Petabytes of information per day. In its foreign intelligence mission, NSA touches about 1.6% of that.

Put another way, if a standard basketball court represented the global collection would be represented by an area smaller than a dime on that basketball court.""

And, nearly directly below that section, the NSA presents its strongest categorical denial o f using foreign partners to circumvent American law:

""NSA partners with well over 30 different nations in order to conduct its foreign intelligence mission. In every case, NSA does not and will not use a relationship with a foreign intelligence service to ask that service to do what NSA is itself prohibited by law from doing. These partnerships are an important part of the US and allied defense against terrorists, cyber threat actors, and others who threaten our individual and collective security.

The document begins by referencing the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, DC, and notes that the NSA ""did not have the tools or the database to search to identify [terorrist] connections and share them with the FBI."" The NSA then argues: ""We do not need to sacrifice civil liberties for the sake of national security; both are integral to who we are as Americans.

Of course, also on Friday, The Guardian published an excerpt from a document leaked by Edward Snowden showing that the NSA has the ability to search Americans' e-mails—but apparently restrains itself from doing so. The document also notes Section 215 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act—the business records provision—is what gives the the government the authority to capture telephony metadata.

At the end of the document, the NSA also argues that it has adequate oversight from a number of government agencies— Bruce Schneier probably would disagree with that —and also is able to police itself.

As the NSA concludes:

The top-secret spill has proven ready-made for the Islamic State ( also referred to as ISIL or ISIS ) . It relies heavily on Internet channels to communicate internally and to spread propaganda .

U.S. ambassadors have been summoned in Paris and Berlin to explain actions
Many are asking if EU can -- or should -- now agree free trade deal with the U.S .
Snowden allegations changed mood in Europe , forcing leaders to take tougher line
On July 24 , 2008 , then-presidential candidate Barack Obama addressed tens of thousands of Germans on the avenue that leads from the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin . In a pointed reference to the outgoing administration of President George W. Bush , he promised a new era of `` allies who will listen to each other , who will learn from each other , who will , above all , trust each other . ''
One German present among the hugely enthusiastic crowd said the occasion reminded him of Berlin 's famous `` Love Parade . '' No U.S. politician since John F. Kennedy had so captured Europeans ' imagination .
Five years on , in the words of the song , it 's a case of `` After the Love Has Gone . '' The U.S. ambassador in Berlin has been summoned to the foreign ministry over reports in Der Spiegel that the U.S. National Security Administration ( NSA ) monitored Chancellor Angela Merkel 's official cellphone . His counterpart in Paris received a similar summons earlier this week after revelations in Le Monde .
Both Der Spiegel and Le Monde used documents provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden .

Merkel 's spokesman , Steffen Seibert , lamented a `` grave breach of trust . '' One of Chancellor Merkel 's closest allies , Defense Minister Thomas de Maiziere told broadcaster ARD there would be consequences .
Der Spiegel reported Thursday that Thomas Oppermann , who leads the parliamentary committee that scrutinizes Germany 's intelligence services , complained that `` the NSA 's monitoring activities have gotten completely out of hand , and take place beyond all democratic controls . ''
In an article for the forthcoming edition of Foreign Affairs magazine , Henry Farrell and Martha Finnemore argue that it 's the disclosure of such practices rather than their existence that is damaging .
`` When these deeds turn out to clash with the government 's public rhetoric , as they so often do , it becomes harder for U.S. allies to overlook Washington 's covert behavior and easier for U.S. adversaries to justify their own , '' they write .
`` The U.S. government , its friends , and its foes can no longer plausibly deny the dark side of U.S. foreign policy and will have to address it head-on , '' they argue .
Among the Twitterati , # merkelphone has gained some traction , with the famous Obama motif `` Yes We Can '' finding a new interpretation . And the European media has begun to debate whether the revelations provided by Edward Snowden to The Guardian and other newspapers will do to Obama 's image on the continent what the Iraq war did to that of President George W.

U.S. ambassadors have been summoned in Paris and Berlin to explain actions

Many are asking if EU can -- or should -- now agree free trade deal with the U.S.

Snowden allegations changed mood in Europe, forcing leaders to take tougher line

On July 24, 2008, then-presidential candidate Barack Obama addressed tens of thousands of Germans on the avenue that leads from the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. In a pointed reference to the outgoing administration of President George W. Bush, he promised a new era of ""allies who will listen to each other, who will learn from each other, who will, above all, trust each other.""

One German present among the hugely enthusiastic crowd said the occasion reminded him of Berlin's famous ""Love Parade."" No U.S. politician since John F. Kennedy had so captured Europeans' imagination.

Five years on, in the words of the song, it's a case of ""After the Love Has Gone."" The U.S. ambassador in Berlin has been summoned to the foreign ministry over reports in Der Spiegel that the U.S. National Security Administration (NSA) monitored Chancellor Angela Merkel's official cellphone . His counterpart in Paris received a similar summons earlier this week after revelations in Le Monde.

Both Der Spiegel and Le Monde used documents provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, lamented a ""grave breach of trust."" One of Chancellor Merkel's closest allies, Defense Minister Thomas de Maiziere told broadcaster ARD there would be consequences.

""We can't simply turn the page,"" he warned.

Der Spiegel reported Thursday that Thomas Oppermann, who leads the parliamentary committee that scrutinizes Germany's intelligence services, complained that ""the NSA's monitoring activities have gotten completely out of hand, and take place beyond all democratic controls.""

In an article for the forthcoming edition of Foreign Affairs magazine, Henry Farrell and Martha Finnemore argue that it's the disclosure of such practices rather than their existence that is damaging.

""When these deeds turn out to clash with the government's public rhetoric, as they so often do, it becomes harder for U.S. allies to overlook Washington's covert behavior and easier for U.S. adversaries to justify their own,"" they write.

""The U.S. government, its friends, and its foes can no longer plausibly deny the dark side of U.S. foreign policy and will have to address it head-on,"" they argue.

Among the Twitterati, #merkelphone has gained some traction, with the famous Obama motif ""Yes We Can"" finding a new interpretation. And the European media has begun to debate whether the revelations provided by Edward Snowden to The Guardian and other newspapers will do to Obama's image on the continent what the Iraq war did to that of President George W. Bush.

Hyperbole perhaps, but the Obama administration is on the defensive, caught between fuller disclosure of just what the NSA has been up to and the need to protect intelligence-gathering methods. The president himself received what German officials describe as an angry call from Merkel Wednesday demanding assurances that there is no American eavesdropping on her conversations.

Edward Snowden , the former National Security Agency contractor who spilled U.S. surveillance secrets to the world , is a `` free man '' biding his time in a Moscow airport , Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters Tuesday .
Putin said Snowden -- who flew to Moscow from Hong Kong on Sunday -- is in the `` transit area '' of Sheremetyevo International Airport , the zone between arrival gates and Russia 's passport control checkpoints . While he said Russia wo n't hand Snowden over to the United States , he seemed eager to have the focus of international intrigue off his hands .

Kristinn Hrafnsson -- a spokesman for WikiLeaks , an organization that facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information and has one of its members with Snowden in Russia -- told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday only that Snowden `` is in a safe place and is comfortable and possibly simply relaxing after a very stressful week .

Noting the United States and Russia do not have an extradition agreement , Putin said Snowden ca n't be turned over to U.S. authorities and has committed no crimes on Russian soil .
But he also said Russian security forces have not been `` working with '' Snowden and expressed hope that the incident would not `` affect the cordial nature of our relations with the U.S. '' Hrafnsson offered a similar story , saying there 's been `` no cooperation or coordination with the Russian authority '' before or since Snowden arrived in Moscow .
A senior Obama administration official called Putin 's comments `` potentially positive '' while reiterating hopes that Snowden would be expelled from Russia and returned to the United States .
U.S. officials believe Russian authorities have a `` clear legal basis to expel Mr. Snowden , based on the status of his travel documents and the pending charges against him , '' National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said .
Secretary of State John Kerry , speaking to reporters while traveling in Saudi Arabia , said the United States is n't looking to Russia to enforce U.S. law , only to `` allow him to be subject to the laws of our land and our Constitution . ''
`` We are not looking for confrontation , we 're not ordering anybody , '' Kerry said . `` We 're simply requesting under a very normal procedure for the transfer of somebody , just as we transferred to Russia seven people in the last two years that they requested , that we did without any clamor , without any rancor , without any argument and according to our sense of the appropriateness of meeting their request . ''
Snowden left Hong Kong on Sunday after a couple of weeks spent doling out details of classified U.S. intelligence programs to journalists .
With his passport revoked by U.S. officials , Snowden traveled out of the semiautonomous Chinese territory on refugee papers issued by Ecuador , one of the countries from which he is seeking asylum .
His travels have sparked international dust-ups , with U.S. officials accusing China of making a `` deliberate choice '' to let Snowden go free and criticizing Russia for failing to hand him over in a spirit of international cooperation .
On Tuesday , a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman rejected the U.S. claims as `` unreasonable , '' according to the official Xinhua news service .
`` The accusation that the U.S. side made against the Central Government of China fell short of proof . The Chinese side will absolutely not accept it , '' spokeswoman Hua Chunying said .
Rimsky Yuen Kwok-keung , Hong Kong 's justice secretary , likewise denied that authorities there intentionally let Snowden leave before acting on U.S. requests .
`` All along , we acted fully in accordance with the law and any suggestion that we have been deliberately letting Mr. Snowden go away or to do any other thing to obstruct the normal operation is totally untrue , '' Yuen said Tuesday .
Authorities in Hong Kong were seeking answers from U.S. authorities around when Snowden left , the justice secretary added . Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-Ying said Monday that authorities acted independently from Beijing `` to follow procedural fairness and procedural justice . ''
In Moscow , Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the U.S. complaints `` absolutely groundless and unacceptable . ''
`` I want to say , right away , that we have nothing to do with Mr. Snowden or his movements around the world , '' Lavrov said .

The White House is eager to avoid a repeat of what happened in Hong Kong , where authorities let Snowden leave despite a U.S. request for his arrest and extradition . Washington has described that move as a `` serious setback '' to building trust between the United States and China .
But the Obama administration does n't have much leverage with Moscow , said Matthew Rojansky , an expert on U.S. and Russian national security at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace .
`` We really need Russian cooperation , I think , much more in most areas than the Russians need us , '' he said .
Washington is also telling other countries where Snowden might end up -- notably Ecuador , which says it 's analyzing an asylum request from Snowden -- that they should hand him over if he lands on their soil . They note that his U.S. passport has been revoked .
`` The U.S. is advising these governments that Mr. Snowden is wanted on felony charges and as such should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel other than is necessary to return him here to the United States , '' Carney said .
One rumored destination is Venezuela , whose leaders have been frequently at odds with Washington in recent years .
According to the AVN state news agency , President Nicolas Maduro said Tuesday his country has not received a formal request for political asylum from Snowden . But if it did , the government would consider it on humanitarian grounds , the agency reports .
In its quest to get Snowden , the United States has limited options . CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the issue now `` is much more of a political and diplomatic matter than it is a legal matter . ''
`` In an ordinary case , sure , you need a passport to get around , '' Toobin said . `` But here , where this case is causing increasing embarrassment for the United States , governments that want the United States to be embarrassed are only too happy to waive some of the technical legal rules . ''
Snowden has acknowledged he leaked classified documents about the NSA 's surveillance programs to the Guardian newspaper in Britain and The Washington Post .
The documents revealed the existence of programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and monitor the Internet activity of people overseas residents .
The disclosures shook the U.S. intelligence community and raised questions about whether the NSA is eroding American civil liberties .
Snowden worked as a Hawaii-based computer network administrator for Booz Allen Hamilton , an NSA contractor , before he fled to Hong Kong last month with laptops full of confidential information .
The South China Morning Post newspaper published a story Monday quoting Snowden as saying he took the job to gather evidence on U.S. surveillance programs .
He told the Guardian that he exposed the surveillance programs because they pose a threat to democracy , but administration officials said the programs are vital to preventing terrorist attacks and are overseen by all three branches of government .
Carney questioned Snowden 's assertion that he acted in defense of democratic transparency , saying his argument `` is belied by the protectors he has potentially chosen -- China , Russia , Ecuador . ''
`` His failures to criticize these regimes suggests that his true motive throughout has been to injure the national security of the United States , not to advance Internet freedom and free speech , '' Carney told reporters .
Snowden is seeking asylum from Ecuador , Iceland and other , unspecified countries , a WikiLeaks attorney said Monday .
Ecuador has already given WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange freedom if he can find a way out of the country 's embassy in London .
In his aslyum request read by Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo , Snowden compared himself to Pvt . Bradley Manning , the U.S. soldier accused of leaking classified information through WikiLeaks .
He said U.S. officials have treated Manning inhumanely by holding him in solitary confinement , and he predicted a similar `` cruel and unusual '' fate for himself if he falls into U.S. hands .
Snowden has come under some criticism for seeking out help from nations with questionable histories on free speech and press freedom .
For instance , The Committee to Protect Journalists has criticized Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa 's government for pushing legislation that would roll back press freedoms , calling its policies increasingly repressive .
Snowden is n't looking for `` political nirvana , '' said Glenn Greenwald , the columnist for the Guardian who broke his revelations .
`` He 's searching for a place where he can be safe and remain free and participate in the debate , and Ecuador seems to be the place he has chosen , '' Greenwald told CNN 's `` The Lead . ''
Some have speculated Snowden has `` doomsday insurance '' in the form of even more top-secret U.S. documents that will go public if he 's ever detained by U.S. authorities .
Hrafnsson , the WikiLeaks spokesman , said he did n't know about Snowden 's specific plans , but did suggest more secrets may be revealed .
`` This is simply information that should be out in the public , '' he said . `` There is more to come . ''","Story highlights Snowden is safe and ""possibly simply relaxing,"" WikiLeaks spokesman says

U.S. officials believe Russian authorities have a ""clear legal basis to expel Mr. Snowden, based on the status of his travel documents and the pending charges against him,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said.

Secretary of State John Kerry, speaking to reporters while traveling in Saudi Arabia, said the United States isn't looking to Russia to enforce U.S. law, only to ""allow him to be subject to the laws of our land and our Constitution.""

""We are not looking for confrontation, we're not ordering anybody,"" Kerry said. ""We're simply requesting under a very normal procedure for the transfer of somebody, just as we transferred to Russia seven people in the last two years that they requested, that we did without any clamor, without any rancor, without any argument and according to our sense of the appropriateness of meeting their request.""

Snowden left Hong Kong on Sunday after a couple of weeks spent doling out details of classified U.S. intelligence programs to journalists.

With his passport revoked by U.S. officials, Snowden traveled out of the semiautonomous Chinese territory on refugee papers issued by Ecuador, one of the countries from which he is seeking asylum.

International tiff

His travels have sparked international dust-ups, with U.S. officials accusing China of making a ""deliberate choice"" to let Snowden go free and criticizing Russia for failing to hand him over in a spirit of international cooperation.

On Tuesday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman rejected the U.S. claims as ""unreasonable,"" according to the official Xinhua news service.

""The accusation that the U.S. side made against the Central Government of China fell short of proof. The Chinese side will absolutely not accept it,"" spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.

Rimsky Yuen Kwok-keung, Hong Kong's justice secretary, likewise denied that authorities there intentionally let Snowden leave before acting on U.S. requests.

""All along, we acted fully in accordance with the law and any suggestion that we have been deliberately letting Mr. Snowden go away or to do any other thing to obstruct the normal operation is totally untrue,"" Yuen said Tuesday.

Authorities in Hong Kong were seeking answers from U.S. authorities around when Snowden left, the justice secretary added. Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-Ying said Monday that authorities acted independently from Beijing ""to follow procedural fairness and procedural justice.""

In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the U.S. complaints ""absolutely groundless and unacceptable.""

""I want to say, right away, that we have nothing to do with Mr. Snowden or his movements around the world,"" Lavrov said.

The White House is eager to avoid a repeat of what happened in Hong Kong, where authorities let Snowden leave despite a U.S. request for his arrest and extradition. Washington has described that move as a ""serious setback"" to building trust between the United States and China.

But the Obama administration doesn't have much leverage with Moscow, said Matthew Rojansky, an expert on U.S. and Russian national security at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

""We really need Russian cooperation, I think, much more in most areas than the Russians need us,"" he said.

U.S. diplomatic headache

Washington is also telling other countries where Snowden might end up -- notably Ecuador, which says it's analyzing an asylum request from Snowden -- that they should hand him over if he lands on their soil. They note that his U.S. passport has been revoked.

""The U.S. is advising these governments that Mr. Snowden is wanted on felony charges and as such should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel other than is necessary to return him here to the United States,"" Carney said.

One rumored destination is Venezuela, whose leaders have been frequently at odds with Washington in recent years.

According to the AVN state news agency, President Nicolas Maduro said Tuesday his country has not received a formal request for political asylum from Snowden. But if it did, the government would consider it on humanitarian grounds, the agency reports.

In its quest to get Snowden, the United States has limited options. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the issue now ""is much more of a political and diplomatic matter than it is a legal matter.""

""In an ordinary case, sure, you need a passport to get around,"" Toobin said. ""But here, where this case is causing increasing embarrassment for the United States, governments that want the United States to be embarrassed are only too happy to waive some of the technical legal rules.""

The leak controversy

Snowden has acknowledged he leaked classified documents about the NSA's surveillance programs to the Guardian newspaper in Britain and The Washington Post.

The documents revealed the existence of programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and monitor the Internet activity of people overseas residents.

The disclosures shook the U.S. intelligence community and raised questions about whether the NSA is eroding American civil liberties.

Snowden worked as a Hawaii-based computer network administrator for Booz Allen Hamilton, an NSA contractor, before he fled to Hong Kong last month with laptops full of confidential information.

The South China Morning Post newspaper published a story Monday quoting Snowden as saying he took the job to gather evidence on U.S. surveillance programs.

He told the Guardian that he exposed the surveillance programs because they pose a threat to democracy, but administration officials said the programs are vital to preventing terrorist attacks and are overseen by all three branches of government.

Carney questioned Snowden's assertion that he acted in defense of democratic transparency, saying his argument ""is belied by the protectors he has potentially chosen -- China, Russia, Ecuador.""

""His failures to criticize these regimes suggests that his true motive throughout has been to injure the national security of the United States, not to advance Internet freedom and free speech,"" Carney told reporters.

Snowden's search

Snowden is seeking asylum from Ecuador, Iceland and other, unspecified countries, a WikiLeaks attorney said Monday.

Ecuador has already given WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange freedom if he can find a way out of the country's embassy in London.

In his aslyum request read by Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo, Snowden compared himself to Pvt. Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier accused of leaking classified information through WikiLeaks.

He said U.S. officials have treated Manning inhumanely by holding him in solitary confinement, and he predicted a similar ""cruel and unusual"" fate for himself if he falls into U.S. hands.

Snowden has come under some criticism for seeking out help from nations with questionable histories on free speech and press freedom.

For instance, The Committee to Protect Journalists has criticized Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa's government for pushing legislation that would roll back press freedoms, calling its policies increasingly repressive.

Snowden isn't looking for ""political nirvana,"" said Glenn Greenwald, the columnist for the Guardian who broke his revelations.

""He's searching for a place where he can be safe and remain free and participate in the debate, and Ecuador seems to be the place he has chosen,"" Greenwald told CNN's ""The Lead.""

Some have speculated Snowden has ""doomsday insurance"" in the form of even more top-secret U.S. documents that will go public if he's ever detained by U.S. authorities.

Hrafnsson, the WikiLeaks spokesman, said he didn't know about Snowden's specific plans, but did suggest more secrets may be revealed.

""This is simply information that should be out in the public,"" he said. ""There is more to come.""",www.cnn.com,left,K2TmpX7etEkDPGEX

He describes his daily life as that of an `` indoor cat ''
Snowden says he raised concerns about surveillance to his colleagues and superiors
Edward Snowden , the National Security Agency leaker , has given a wide-ranging interview to The Washington Post about the effects of the startling information he shared this year with journalists , shedding light on the U.S. surveillance apparatus .
The revelations from Snowden , a former NSA contractor , about the American government 's surveillance of its citizens and allies have generated fierce debate over intelligence-gathering practices .
Here are five key takeaways from the interview , the first Snowden has given in person since he arrived in Russia in June .

`` For me , in terms of personal satisfaction , the mission 's already accomplished . I already won , '' Snowden told The Washington Post 's Barton Gellman in Moscow . `` As soon as the journalists were able to work , everything that I had been trying to do was validated . Because , remember , I did n't want to change society . I wanted to give society a chance to determine if it should change itself . ''
Snowden left his job in Hawaii with the NSA contract firm Booz Allen Hamilton and fled to Hong Kong in May , taking with him a hoard of secret information about intelligence programs . He shared the files with Gellman and journalists from The Guardian , a British newspaper .
The ensuing articles about how the NSA hoovers up vast amounts of phone and Internet data about American citizens sparked an uproar , with Snowden described as a hero by some and a traitor by others . Many more articles about other controversial aspects of U.S. surveillance have followed , and Snowden has said there 's plenty more information still to be revealed .
`` All I wanted was for the public to be able to have a say in how they are governed , '' Snowden said . `` That is a milestone we left a long time ago . Right now , all we are looking at are stretch goals . ''
Gellman told CNN that his impression was not that Snowden was gloating , but that his goal to strip some of the secrecy off the NSA 's activities had been achieved .
Snowden has so far managed to dodge the U.S. government 's attempts to bring him back to America to face charges of espionage and theft of government property . And he 's not taking any chances as he lives in asylum in Russia .
Gellman reported that during more than 14 hours of conversations in Moscow , Snowden did n't once `` part the curtains or step outside . ''
Snowden , 30 , described his life as that of an `` indoor cat . '' He said he does n't drink alcohol and lives on ramen noodles and chips .
`` It has always been really difficult to get me to leave the house , '' he told Gellman . `` I just do n't have a lot of needs . ... Occasionally there 's things to go do , things to go see , people to meet , tasks to accomplish . But it 's really got to be goal-oriented , you know . Otherwise , as long as I can sit down and think and write and talk to somebody , that 's more meaningful to me than going out and looking at landmarks . ''
Gellman said Snowden is the kind of person who usually keeps to himself indoors anyway .

His mission is ""already accomplished,"" he says

Snowden says he raised concerns about surveillance to his colleagues and superiors

Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency leaker, has given a wide-ranging interview to The Washington Post about the effects of the startling information he shared this year with journalists, shedding light on the U.S. surveillance apparatus.

The revelations from Snowden, a former NSA contractor, about the American government's surveillance of its citizens and allies have generated fierce debate over intelligence-gathering practices.

Here are five key takeaways from the interview, the first Snowden has given in person since he arrived in Russia in June.

Snowden says ...

1. His mission is 'already accomplished'

""For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission's already accomplished. I already won,"" Snowden told The Washington Post's Barton Gellman in Moscow. ""As soon as the journalists were able to work, everything that I had been trying to do was validated. Because, remember, I didn't want to change society. I wanted to give society a chance to determine if it should change itself.""

Snowden left his job in Hawaii with the NSA contract firm Booz Allen Hamilton and fled to Hong Kong in May, taking with him a hoard of secret information about intelligence programs. He shared the files with Gellman and journalists from The Guardian, a British newspaper.

The ensuing articles about how the NSA hoovers up vast amounts of phone and Internet data about American citizens sparked an uproar, with Snowden described as a hero by some and a traitor by others. Many more articles about other controversial aspects of U.S. surveillance have followed, and Snowden has said there's plenty more information still to be revealed.

His actions have had clear consequences.

""All I wanted was for the public to be able to have a say in how they are governed,"" Snowden said. ""That is a milestone we left a long time ago. Right now, all we are looking at are stretch goals.""

Gellman told CNN that his impression was not that Snowden was gloating, but that his goal to strip some of the secrecy off the NSA's activities had been achieved.

2. He's become 'an indoor cat'

Snowden has so far managed to dodge the U.S. government's attempts to bring him back to America to face charges of espionage and theft of government property. And he's not taking any chances as he lives in asylum in Russia.

Gellman reported that during more than 14 hours of conversations in Moscow, Snowden didn't once ""part the curtains or step outside.""

Snowden, 30, described his life as that of an ""indoor cat."" He said he doesn't drink alcohol and lives on ramen noodles and chips.

""It has always been really difficult to get me to leave the house,"" he told Gellman. ""I just don't have a lot of needs. ... Occasionally there's things to go do, things to go see, people to meet, tasks to accomplish. But it's really got to be goal-oriented, you know. Otherwise, as long as I can sit down and think and write and talk to somebody, that's more meaningful to me than going out and looking at landmarks.""

Gellman said Snowden is the kind of person who usually keeps to himself indoors anyway.

He said Snowden does not want to continuing being part of the story, but wants to see his cause advance.

Snowden has had continuous access to the Internet and talks to journalists and his lawyers on a daily basis, the Post reported.

People who visit him bring him books, but he doesn't read them, preferring to get his information from the Internet.

Gellman reported that it was unclear to what degree Snowden was under surveillance by Russian authorities, saying that ""no retinue"" accompanied Snowden and that he didn't see anybody else nearby.

3. He raised flags before going public

Snowden said some other people who worked for the NSA's surveillance system also had misgivings about the activities.

He told Gellman that he raised concerns with colleagues and with superiors in the NSA's Technology Directorate and the NSA Threat Operations Center's regional base in Hawaii.

His co-workers were often ""astonished to learn we are collecting more in the United States on Americans than we are on Russians in Russia,"" Snowden told the Post.

A lot of his colleagues were disturbed by what they heard, Snowden said, and several asked him not to tell them any more.

""I asked these people, 'What do you think the public would do if this was on the front page?' "" he said, according to the Post.

""How is that not reporting it? How is that not raising it?"" he said in response to criticism that he circumvented the NSA's internal channels for disagreement.

The NSA said in a statement to the Post that it had ""not found any evidence to support Mr. Snowden's contention that he brought these matters to anyone's attention.""

4. The intelligence community's overseers 'elected' him

Snowden has faced widespread criticism over his actions from Obama administration officials and members of Congress. But he told Gellman that the U.S. government left him little choice.

Asked why he felt entitled to bring the NSA's intrusive activities to public attention, Snowden told the Post: ""That whole question -- who elected you? -- inverts the model. They elected me. The overseers.""

He singled out the chairmen of the Senate and House intelligence committees, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Mike Rogers, both of whom have voiced criticism of his leaks.

""It wasn't that they put it on me as an individual -- that I'm uniquely qualified, an angel descending from the heavens -- as that they put it on someone, somewhere,"" he said. ""You have the capability, and you realize every other (person) sitting around the table has the same capability but they don't do it. So somebody has to be the first.""

He said his aim was not to bring down the NSA, but to improve it.

""I am still working for the NSA right now,"" he said. ""They are the only ones who don't realize it.""

5. Personal attacks don't faze him

Ever since he stepped into the public eye, Snowden has insisted that he should not be at the center of the story. The real issue, he says, is the NSA's far-reaching surveillance programs.

He maintained that stance with Gellman, saying that he's shrugged off personal attacks against him with the intent of keeping the focus on the NSA.

""Let them say what they want,"" he said. ""It's not about me.""

He dismissed suggestions that he's made any deals with the governments of the countries where he's taken refuge from U.S. authorities.

""There is no evidence at all for the claim that I have loyalties to Russia or China or any country other than the United States,"" Snowden told Gellman. ""I have no relationship with the Russian government. I have not entered into any agreements with them.""

""If I defected at all,"" Snowden said, ""I defected from the government to the public.""",www.cnn.com,left,PBeK6roJRnoqqqo7

Napolitano","When President Obama chose a Friday before a three-day holiday weekend to address a matter as profound as the NSA spying scandal , I suspected he would raise issues that he hoped the media would ignore .
That ’ s because the Reagan White House did a study in the early 1980s and concluded that Fridays are low-value news days and thus a good time to bury the lead , so to speak . Every president since then has followed that lead .
Instead of addressing the massive violations of the natural and constitutionally protected right to privacy , instead of acknowledging that but for the personal courage of Edward Snowden his administration would still be pulling the wool over our eyes , instead of reestablishing the serious constitutional and civil liberties bona fides he established for himself as a U.S. senator , the president defended his massive spying as a necessary tool in the fight to maintain national security and offered only a placebo to its critics .
Just how massive is this scandal ? The Washington Post has reported that the NSA hacks into 500,000 American buddy lists and 600,000 American address books every day , and the Guardian of London reported last week that the NSA seizes 200,000,000 American text messages every day .
This is in addition to seizing the content of all cellphone- and landline-generated telephone conversations and copies of all emails sent or received in the United States . And all of that is in addition to seizing all bank records , utility bills and credit card bills of everyone in the United States .
By not addressing or refuting any of this , the president obviously plans to continue it .
He also plans to reject the most basic principles of American government . If the government derives its powers from the consent of the governed , as the Declaration of Independence declares it does , and if the governed lack the lawful authority to hack and seize our neighbors ’ texts and phone calls and utility bills , how could we have given that authority to the government ?
In the president ’ s world , that ’ s an easy question to answer : Do it in secret .
Enact legislation that lets a dozen NSA-sycophantic members of Congress speak for the legislative branch , tell only that dozen about the spying in secret and swear them to secrecy .
Enact legislation that lets a dozen secret judges issue search warrants based on the government ’ s wishes rather than probable cause , and seek permission from any one of those judges in secret and swear them to secrecy . And then in public deny and lie and change the subject .
In a thinly disguised effort to change the subject , Obama ’ s Friday speech focused on where the seized data is stored , rather than on whether the government in a free society is empowered to collect it .
He proposed that the data seized by the NSA be stored at non-government locations that he did not identify and kept there and be made available to the NSA after approval by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) court .
Even if a third party capable and willing to store this data could be found , the additional step to the FISA court is no additional constitutional protection whatsoever .
Every federal and state court in the United States follows the constitutional requirement that whenever any government is seeking a search warrant to conduct surveillance , the government must present particularized evidence identifying its target , and the evidence must constitute probable cause of criminal behavior on the part of that target ; every court , that is , except the FISA court . That court issues general warrants that do not name a target and are based on the NSA ’ s wishes , rather than evidence of probable cause .
So , that silent exhale of relief from the NSA last week was generated by the realization that this third-party storage proposal will not restrict the massive spying one iota .
Added to this placebo is the president ’ s proposal to employ a Defender of the Constitution ( what a great job title ! ) to appear before the FISA court , along with lawyers for the NSA , and argue against the NSA ’ s wishes . This is another diversion that would add another level of unconstitutional and irrelevant complexity to the present scheme .
In the present scheme , the persons on the FISA court may be federal judges , but they are performing clerical functions , not judicial functions . That ’ s because , unlike state courts , which are courts of general jurisdiction , the jurisdiction of all federal courts can only be invoked when there are real cases and controversies brought to them .
If the Defender of the Constitution appeared in front of the FISA court , he or she could only do so by representing a real client in a real dispute with the federal government . But the NSA does not identify its targets , much less deal with their lawyers . The president ’ s proposal would turn this non-court court into a law school moot court exercise .
His third proposal adds insult to injury . He offers to stop the NSA from doing to foreign leaders what it has been doing to Americans . No doubt , that is to enable him to save face with his selfie-snapping European colleagues . But it hardly smacks of understanding the problem of massive spying . It may be an insult to spy on his fellow heads of state , and it may affect diplomacy with them , but stopping it hardly enhances the natural right to privacy of the rest of us .
This mass spying is uniquely and profoundly un-American and will continue to undermine our freedoms . I am not arguing here that all spying is illegal -- just that spying on all of us is illegal .
Why bother with the formality of warrants when they permit all spying all the time ? Spying on anyone not named in a warrant , or employing a warrant not based on probable cause , is the hallmark of those totalitarian regimes against which we have fought our just wars and our cold wars .
Yet today , the government in America seems more like the former enemies we vanquished than the place of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness the Framers established .","When President Obama chose a Friday before a three-day holiday weekend to address a matter as profound as the NSA spying scandal, I suspected he would raise issues that he hoped the media would ignore.

And all of that is in addition to seizing all bank records, utility bills and credit card bills of everyone in the United States.

By not addressing or refuting any of this, the president obviously plans to continue it.

He also plans to reject the most basic principles of American government. If the government derives its powers from the consent of the governed, as the Declaration of Independence declares it does, and if the governed lack the lawful authority to hack and seize our neighbors’ texts and phone calls and utility bills, how could we have given that authority to the government?

In the president’s world, that’s an easy question to answer: Do it in secret.

Enact legislation that lets a dozen NSA-sycophantic members of Congress speak for the legislative branch, tell only that dozen about the spying in secret and swear them to secrecy.

Enact legislation that lets a dozen secret judges issue search warrants based on the government’s wishes rather than probable cause, and seek permission from any one of those judges in secret and swear them to secrecy. And then in public deny and lie and change the subject.

In a thinly disguised effort to change the subject, Obama’s Friday speech focused on where the seized data is stored, rather than on whether the government in a free society is empowered to collect it.

He proposed that the data seized by the NSA be stored at non-government locations that he did not identify and kept there and be made available to the NSA after approval by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court.

Even if a third party capable and willing to store this data could be found, the additional step to the FISA court is no additional constitutional protection whatsoever.

Every federal and state court in the United States follows the constitutional requirement that whenever any government is seeking a search warrant to conduct surveillance, the government must present particularized evidence identifying its target, and the evidence must constitute probable cause of criminal behavior on the part of that target; every court, that is, except the FISA court. That court issues general warrants that do not name a target and are based on the NSA’s wishes, rather than evidence of probable cause.

So, that silent exhale of relief from the NSA last week was generated by the realization that this third-party storage proposal will not restrict the massive spying one iota.

Added to this placebo is the president’s proposal to employ a Defender of the Constitution (what a great job title!) to appear before the FISA court, along with lawyers for the NSA, and argue against the NSA’s wishes. This is another diversion that would add another level of unconstitutional and irrelevant complexity to the present scheme.

In the present scheme, the persons on the FISA court may be federal judges, but they are performing clerical functions, not judicial functions. That’s because, unlike state courts, which are courts of general jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of all federal courts can only be invoked when there are real cases and controversies brought to them.

If the Defender of the Constitution appeared in front of the FISA court, he or she could only do so by representing a real client in a real dispute with the federal government. But the NSA does not identify its targets, much less deal with their lawyers. The president’s proposal would turn this non-court court into a law school moot court exercise.

His third proposal adds insult to injury. He offers to stop the NSA from doing to foreign leaders what it has been doing to Americans. No doubt, that is to enable him to save face with his selfie-snapping European colleagues. But it hardly smacks of understanding the problem of massive spying. It may be an insult to spy on his fellow heads of state, and it may affect diplomacy with them, but stopping it hardly enhances the natural right to privacy of the rest of us.

This mass spying is uniquely and profoundly un-American and will continue to undermine our freedoms. I am not arguing here that all spying is illegal -- just that spying on all of us is illegal.

Why bother with the formality of warrants when they permit all spying all the time? Spying on anyone not named in a warrant, or employing a warrant not based on probable cause, is the hallmark of those totalitarian regimes against which we have fought our just wars and our cold wars.

Yet today, the government in America seems more like the former enemies we vanquished than the place of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness the Framers established.",www.foxnews.com,right,bgPe5rw9ZbVImTOc

Last week , President Obama met with the five-member review board that he recently appointed to review the National Security Agency ’ s ( NSA ) controversial electronic surveillance program . The review board is part of the president ’ s effort to build confidence in the surveillance program and its respect for privacy rights .
But when Obama speaks about the program , he leaves the impression that its existing privacy protections are sufficient , if only we knew enough to appreciate them . That hardly instills confidence . If the president is serious about fixing the enormous overreach of U.S. surveillance that Edward Snowden helped to highlight , he should take these steps :
First , recognize 4th Amendment protection for our metadata . More than 30 years ago , in a different technological era , the Supreme Court ruled that , unlike the content of our phone conversations , we have no privacy rights in the numbers we call . The rationale was that we share those numbers with the phone company . The intrusion mattered little at the time because if the police wanted to reconstruct someone ’ s circle of contacts , they had to undertake the enormously time-consuming process of manually linking phone number to phone number .
Today , though , with a few computer commands , the government can easily reconstruct our entire direct and extended network of phone and email contacts , as well as ( using the GPS signals from our phone ) everywhere we visit . That astonishingly detailed picture of our lives – our metadata — can be more revealing of private matters than even the contents of our communications .
Moreover , the claim that we give up our privacy rights by sharing this data with communications companies makes no sense . We “ share ” the contents of our emails as well , and those are better protected by the 4th Amendment . Moreover , in today ’ s world , we have no real choice but to share our contact data if we are to communicate with anyone other than by word of mouth . In what amounted to a warning , a majority of the Supreme Court justices hinted last year that at least some of this data should receive 4th Amendment protection . The administration should get in front of the issue and propose legislation before the court rules for it .
Second , recognize the privacy rights of non-Americans outside the United States . Because the courts have interpreted the U.S. Constitution to protect the rights of American citizens and legal residents everywhere , but non-Americans only in the United States , the U.S. government recognizes no privacy rights for non-Americans abroad . It thus intercepts even the content of their communications with few restrictions . Needless to say , that intrusion does not go over well with the rest of the world . This narrow view of privacy also lets the government review the content when Americans communicate with others overseas , so long as the American is not the “ target ” of the surveillance . In a world where international communication is routine , this parochial view of privacy makes no sense .
Moreover , it is a disaster for U.S. Internet companies , which aspire to serve the world but risk losing business to competitors in foreign countries that recognize privacy rights for non-Americans . And if distrust of the United States yields pressure to move servers to where users are , all companies become more vulnerable to probing by governments like China , whose interest may not be simply fighting terrorism but also fighting dissent . Unlike the U.S. Constitution , international human rights law protects everyone , including the right to privacy . That ’ s not how the U.S. government likes to read the law , but it should .
Third , treat privacy rights as implicated as soon as information is collected . One favorite refrain of the NSA is to claim that our privacy rights are not affected when our communications are scooped up and stored in a government computer , only when an official examines that information . The NSA then insists we have nothing to worry about because the rules for “ querying ” this information are strict . But that logic crumbles on examination . Would our privacy interest in blocking the government from placing a video camera in our bedroom begin only when someone actually looked at the film ?
Moreover , once our communications are in government computers , they are there for the long haul — in some cases five years or more — yet rules on querying them can change with administration or even time . The government claims it needs to store our communications because private companies may erase them too soon , but people tend to be more comfortable with private storage ( competition is a restraint on private abuse that does not exist for the government ) . In any event , the NSA has been unable to identify any terrorist plot that would have remained concealed but for its undifferentiated scooping up of our metadata . That is true for even the most recent parts of its vast database , let alone the parts held for five or more years .
Fourth , revamp the FISA court . The administration ’ s case for the legality of its electronic surveillance depends on scrutiny by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) court , yet the court hardly engenders confidence . Its members are hand-picked by Chief Justice John Roberts ( until recently , he picked only conservative Republican appointees ) , it hears only from the government , and its opinions have mostly been kept secret . It is difficult for any judge to evaluate the government ’ s claims when no one is there to challenge its evidence and arguments , especially in so technically complex an area as electronic surveillance — as the court ’ s chief judge recently conceded . Efforts to justify this process by analogy to judges who privately hear from only the government to approve an ordinary search warrant are off base because most of those warrants can ultimately be challenged in a public adversarial hearing as part of a criminal prosecution .
At minimum , as Obama has suggested , the FISA court should hear from a government-appointed “ devil ’ s advocate , ” who would have the necessary security clearances and could challenge the government ’ s case without tipping off the surveillance target . That person should have the right to appeal adverse rulings to a higher tribunal and ultimately the Supreme Court . A presumption of public disclosure should govern all FISA court opinions about general surveillance policy and the right to privacy , since excessive secrecy has helped the surveillance state flourish .
Fifth , protect whistleblowers . The whistleblower protection provided to government employees who expose evidence of wrongdoing does not extend to those who disclose what is deemed national security information . Whistleblowers facing prosecution can ’ t even defend themselves by showing that their disclosures caused no harm and promoted the public interest . Wrongdoing involving this information is supposed to be revealed only to an agency ’ s inspector general or to the congressional intelligence committees . Yet government employees who tried to use these procedures to complain about NSA overreaching faced retaliation and even prosecution – which might help explain why Snowden skipped these mechanisms and went directly to the media . The problem is aggravated by the government ’ s temptation to protect information that is simply embarrassing or politically fraught rather than truly a matter of national security . A better balance should be struck between the government ’ s interest in keeping certain information secret and Americans ’ right to know when government activities violate their rights .
Finally , appoint a meaningful reform commission . There ’ s a real need for an independent reform group with the security clearances and technical expertise needed to review all aspects of U.S. electronic surveillance and to publicly suggest reforms . The five-person group that Obama recently created purports to be such a commission , but its mandate as publicly announced does not even mention privacy , going only so far as to ask whether U.S. intelligence collection “ appropriately account [ s ] for other policy considerations. ” Only after the group ’ s first meeting did a White House press release finally mention the “ p——— ” word as well as “ civil liberties. ” The White House should make clear that these key concerns are part of the group ’ s mandate , including the privacy rights of both Americans and non-Americans .
We have learned enough about the NSA ’ s overreach to know there are real problems with its electronic surveillance . Obama arguing that we should just trust him will no longer placate concerns . Real reform is needed to convince us that in the NSA ’ s preoccupation with security , our privacy rights have not been lost .

National security officials personally appealed to House members, hoping to derail the vote. They have said phone and e-mail surveillance have helped thwart terror plots.

President Barack Obama also has stressed that the NSA was not using the surveillance program to listen in on phone calls; that it only collected metadata, including numbers, times of calls and dates.

James Clapper, the nation's top intelligence official, released a statement before the vote noting that he had joined others in opposing the measure.

New York Democratic Rep Jerry Nadler, a critic of the original provisions on data collection in the Patriot Act, said he wasn't persuaded by the warnings from the administration. He voted for the amendment.

""I never dreamed it would ever be used for dragnet surveillance of every American phone call, even if only for metadata. And frankly that's way beyond what Congress intended,"" he said.

The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank often cited by Republicans, released an analysis that warned the amendment would ""increase the risks of terrorist attacks by limiting the scope of court-ordered foreign intelligence collection and thereby depriving the U.S. of valuable intelligence it currently collects.""

But at a monthly forum sponsored by Heritage that features some of the House's most conservative members, that argument didn't sway many members. Eight of the nine lawmakers on the Wednesday panel, which included Amash, said they planned to vote for it.

Rep Michele Bachmann, a leader of the tea party movement on Capitol Hill, broke with fellow conservative lawmakers, saying the NSA program collects phone records from telecommunications companies not individuals, so there is ""no expectation of privacy.""

A member of the House Intelligence Committee, Bachmann warned that ""if we take this program and remove from the United States the distinct advantage we have versus any other country it would be those that would be seeking to achieve the goals of Islamic Jihad who will benefit from by putting the United States at risk.""

The defense spending bill now moves to the Senate, but that chamber has not considered its version yet in committee or scheduled a floor vote. But in the Senate, there is little support for making major changes to the NSA program.

Before the vote Nadler said even this amendment failed he and other opponents of the program would continue to press for changes.

""It simply will not be renewed when it expires in 2015. It's going to end - now or later. The only question is when and on what terms.""",www.cnn.com,left,orj5f2QkkofaftyT

“ There ’ s no lack , there ’ s no dearth of insight into what the NSA does on a regular basis , ” NSA Deputy Director John C. Inglis told an audience during a rare public appearance at New York University ’ s law school .
Mr. Inglis said he hoped to generate a deeper conversation than the “ battle of sound bites ” that have rocked the world ’ s media since the summer when Edward Snowden — the former NSA contractor now living in Russia — began leaking internal information about the far-reaching scope of the agency ’ s telephone and computer data collection activities in the United States and around the world .
The Snowden leaks exposed to the public how the NSA gathers and archives basic data from billions of phone calls coming into and out of the United States so that it may be quickly searchable in the event of terrorism-related investigations . The revelations have sparked strong criticism on Capitol Hill and outrage in foreign capitals ranging from Berlin to Brasilia .
Mr. Inglis , a top NSA official since the late-1990s , said Tuesday that the agency is actually far more concerned with civil liberties than has been suggested by critics .
Analysts working inside the NSA “ care as passionately about civil liberties [ and ] national security both , as any of you might , ” he said . “ We agree with our harshest critics . We should not choose between those two . We must affect both and we need to be held accountable for them . ”
He added that analysts working inside the agency believe deeply that their work is vital to U.S. national security .
“ If I worry about anything in the midst of this dialogue , it ’ s that we ’ re causing them to reconsider whether that work is respected , ” Mr. Inglis said . “ They don ’ t want to be rewarded for that or remunerated in that with respect to money . But they do want to know that at the end of the day that work does make a difference in a way that ’ s appreciated by the nation . ”
Eager to counter negative attention on the NSA during recent months , Mr. Inglis contended that the agency ’ s spying activities are considerably more well-known to officials within the U.S. government than has been reported .
He described the agency as having little legal wiggle room to conduct complex , legitimate and secretive spying activities on a rapidly evolving technological landscape around the world — activities that he said are vital to protecting the United States and its interests from the threat of terrorism .
There are “ upwards of 300 people ” inside the NSA focused exclusively and “ on a full-time basis ” on assuring that the agency ’ s operations do not breach U.S. laws , Mr. Inglis said .
“ But NSA is not the fox watching its own hen house , ” he said , adding that in addition to its own internal oversight program , the agency is subject to “ very intrusive insight ” from the Justice Department .
“ I think that ’ s appropriate , ” he said , adding that the NSA operations are also well-known to officials conducting oversight from Defense Department , the office of the director of national intelligence and , “ of course you ’ ve got the courts that might oversee some of our authorities , the congressional intelligence committees , and various then extra-constitutional bodies like the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board . ”

While many Americans view terrorists as careful and well-informed, ex-intelligence officials say that in reality, their skill sets run the gamut — and the biggest terror threat in the United States right now actually seems to be homegrown extremists who are not hardened operatives and who lack first-rate tradecraft. These are the precisely the sorts of novices who could be tipped off or decide to behave more furtively precisely because of the recent spate of surveillance disclosures.

And, as Americans saw in April with the deadly attacks Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly carried out at the Boston Marathon, amateurs are still capable of inflicting serious damage.

Mr. Rubio cited FBI Director James Comey’s recently warning that potentially thousands of terrorist sympathizers in the United States are being self-radicalized online by associates of the Islamic State terrorist group, urging them to conduct attacks on Americans inside the United States.

“Given these threats, now is not the time to end this program, which remains essential to our security,” Mr. Rubio wrote. “Congress has until the end of May to act before the current authorities expire. We must renew these authorities and provide those we charge with protecting us every tool they need to do so.”

Many Republicans, including other 2016 presidential contenders and possible contenders, are split on the NSA program. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has said the “best part” of the Obama administration is the continuance of such programs, while Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas both hailed the federal panel’s recent ruling.

Although many Americans continue to regard Edward Snowden as some sort of traitor, he is seen increasingly by many in Europe as a whistleblowing hero, and for Russia’s Vladimir Putin, he is the gift that keeps on giving.

No longer hiding, Mr. Snowden is becoming more and more visible in Moscow, where last week it was announced that he’s landed a job with one of Russia’s social-networking firms, is increasingly willing to meet with reporters and was even spotted playing the tourist on a Moscow riverboat.

When Mr. Putin’s government originally decided to thumb its nose at President Obama by granting the fugitive National Security Agency (NSA) contractor the right to remain in Russia without fear of extradition for at least a year, the Russians relished sticking it to the U.S. president, but apparently didn’t expect what’s come since.

Mr. Putin said famously at the time that trying to squeeze much benefit out of the affair would be like “sheering a pig there is lots of squealing and little wool.” The Russian president must not have known at the time what Mr. Snowden had arranged to turn over to Western press outlets before landing in Moscow early last summer or he might used a different analogy.

Since then, of course, Mr. Snowden’s revelations have shocked many in Congress, put U.S. intelligence officers and administration officials on the spot, disrupted Washington’s relations with our most reliable allies, and allowed Mr. Putin, a former KGB operative, and Russian officials to act like outraged ACLU members shocked at the extent of U.S. spying. Russia even went so far as to host the Sam Adams Awards in October, at which Mr. Snowden was honored for promoting “integrity in intelligence.”

American defenders of NSA spying continue to argue in the face of outrage in Germany, France, Spain and elsewhere that it is hypocritical for any of these nation’s leaders to act shocked at learning that governments spy not only on their enemies and adversaries, but their friends. To an extent, they are right. In the real world, gentlemen do read each other’s mail, and Europeans have plenty of experience with the “organs of state security” in their own countries.

The outrage, however, is real and seems to stem from a feeling that neither the East German Stasi, Mr. Putin’s old employer or Hitler’s spies went to the lengths that U.S. intelligence does to collect everything they can on everybody, everywhere. Mr. Obama might simply like to dismiss the matter. Rep. Peter T. King, New York Republican, went further on television by suggesting that German Chancellor Angela Merkel ought to get over the fact that we bugged her private cellphone because, after all, we did it “for her own good.” That is the same thing NSA defenders have been telling Americans about domestic intelligence gathering. If our government cannot seem to sell that justification to Americans, one wonders why they think it will sell in Germany.

Former German Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg summed up the problem as well as anyone last week. He told The Moscow Times that “President Barack Obama and his administration have yet to comprehend the scale and severity of the damage caused to U.S. credibility among its European allies. The problem is not that countries spy on each other. They all do, of course. Rather, it is the extent of U.S. intelligence-gathering and U.S. attitudes toward allies that is most damaging.”

We Americans are like a friend of mine whose wife told me once that whatever her husband thought worth doing was worth overdoing. Our intelligence people do want everything on everybody and certainly don’t seem deterred at home by constitutional problems, or outside the United States by the consequences of getting caught. The East German Stasi may have compiled files on every East German back in the day, but we’ve got files on Americans, Spaniards, Germans and almost everyone else.

Mr. Putin the civil libertarian is outraged, but one suspects Mr. Putin the former KGB man is jealous. Maybe that’s why his government announced last week that Moscow will henceforth begin accessing Russian citizens’ phone calls and Internet communications without needing court orders.

He’d better hope there aren’t any homegrown Ed Snowdens within the Russian bureaucracy, or he’s likely to learn as we in the United States did that governments can’t get away with what they could back in the good old days.

In an interview with PBS ’ s Charlie Rose recorded Sunday and broadcast Monday night , Obama said he would not comment on any potential prosecution of Snowden , who is now believed to be in Hong Kong .
Obama also defended the National Security Agency spying programs and called them `` transparent . ''
“ That ’ s why we set up the FISA court , ” he said , referring to the secret court set up by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that authorizes two recently disclosed programs : one that gathers U.S. phone records and another that is designed to track the use of U.S.-based Internet servers by foreigners with possible links to terrorism .

He accused members of Congress and administration officials of exaggerating their claims about the success of the data gathering programs , including pointing to the arrest of would-be New York subway bomber Najibullah Zazi in 2009 .
Snowden said Zazi could have been caught with narrower , targeted surveillance programs -- a point Obama conceded in his Monday interview without mentioning Snowden .
`` We might have caught him some other way , '' Obama said . `` We might have disrupted it because a New York cop saw he was suspicious . Maybe he turned out to be incompetent and the bomb did n't go off . But at the margins we are increasing our chances of preventing a catastrophe like that through these programs , '' he said .
Obama also told Rose he wanted to encourage a national debate on the balance between privacy and national security -- a topic renewed by Snowden 's disclosures .
Obama , who repeated earlier assertions that the programs were a legitimate counterterror tool and that they were completely noninvasive to people with no terror ties , said he has created a privacy and civil liberties oversight board .

The Guardian announced that its website was hosting an online chat with Snowden , in hiding in Hong Kong , with reporter Glenn Greenwald receiving and posting his questions . The Associated Press could n't independently verify that Snowden was the man who posted 19 replies to questions .
In answer to the question of whether he fled to Hong Kong because he was spying for China , Snowden wrote , `` Ask yourself : if I were a Chinese spy , why would n't I have flown directly into Beijing ? I could be living in a palace petting a phoenix by now . ''
He added later , `` I have had no contact with the Chinese government . ''
Snowden was working as a systems analyst contractor for NSA at the time he had access to the then-secret programs .

He's a man without a country -- and after a brief flurry of speculation Wednesday that NSA leaker Edward Snowden might finally be able to exit Moscow airport, he's right back where he started, holed up in the facility's transit zone.

A Russian lawyer was reported planning to meet with Snowden at the airport Wednesday, prompting speculation he would bring documents allowing the former NSA contract employee to formally enter Russia.

Snowden had applied for temporary asylum in Russia last week after his attempts to leave Sheremetyevo airport and fly out of the country were thwarted.

But now it appears that even with new legal papers, he still must wait at the airport while Russian authorities consider his asylum request.

A spokeswoman for the Federal Migration Service told the AP they had no information about the status of Snowden's application for asylum.

Snowden is believed to have been staying at the airport transit zone since June 23, when he arrived on a flight from Hong Kong.

U.S. prosecutors charged Snowden last month with espionage and theft of government property.

Snowden seeks refuge in Ecuador and was last reported in Moscow
Washington says Snowden is a wanted man , urges nations to turn him away
Pleading for asylum after spilling American secrets , Edward Snowden told Ecuador 's government that he fears inhumane treatment or even death if he 's handed over to face U.S. espionage charges , Ecuador 's foreign minister said Monday .
Snowden told Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa that it is `` unlikely that I will have a fair trial or humane treatment '' if handed over to U.S. officials to stand trial , according to a letter from Snowden read by Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino .
The whereabouts of Snowden , the computer contractor who exposed details of the National Security Agency 's surveillance programs , were uncertain late Monday . He was last known to be in Moscow , where he landed after a flight from Hong Kong on Sunday .
He had been expected to board a flight to Cuba on Monday , Russia 's semiofficial Interfax news agency reported . But CNN journalists on two successive Moscow-to-Havana flights said Snowden did not appear to be in the cabin , while officials at the Russian capital 's Sheremetyevo International Airport declined to say whether he was still there .

U.S. officials have yanked Snowden 's passport , but he left Hong Kong on a `` refugee document of passage '' issued by Ecuador , according to Julian Assange , founder of the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks , which is aiding Snowden 's efforts to find a safe haven . Assange would say only that the former National Security Agency contractor is `` in a safe place and his spirits are high . ''
While Patino , speaking at a news conference in Vietnam , said the country has yet to decide on Snowden 's asylum request , he questioned whether it was Snowden or the United States that was acting badly in the affair .
He called the surveillance programs revealed by Snowden `` a breach of the rights '' of people around the world .
`` We have to ask , who has betrayed who ? '' he said .
Correa , meanwhile , took to Twitter to address the issue . `` Rest assured that we will analyze the Snowden case very responsibly and we will make with absolute sovereignty the decision that we believe is most appropriate , '' the president tweeted .
He added , `` A big hug to everyone and happy week . ''
Snowden has acknowledged that he leaked classified documents about NSA-run surveillance programs to the Guardian newspaper in Britain and to The Washington Post . The documents revealed the existence of programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and monitor the Internet activity of overseas residents . The disclosures shook the U.S. intelligence community and raised questions about whether the NSA is eroding American civil liberties .
He walked away from a six-figure job in Hawaii with the computer consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton , an NSA contractor , and went to Hong Kong before the newspapers began publishing stories based on his leak . He told the Guardian that he exposed the surveillance programs because they pose a threat to democracy , but administration officials said the programs are vital to preventing terrorist attacks and are overseen by all three branches of government .
A Hong Kong paper , the South China Morning Post , reported Tuesday that Snowden took the job at Booz Allen early this year to `` collect proof '' about the programs before disclosing them to reporters . Snowden told the paper that he intends to release more of the documents he took from the firm .
`` If I have time to go through this information , I would like to make it available to journalists in each country to make their own assessment , independent of my bias , as to whether or not the knowledge of U.S. network operations against their people should be published , '' the newspaper quoted Snowden as saying .
In addition to Ecuador , Snowden is asking Iceland and other , unspecified countries to consider granting him asylum , WikiLeaks attorney Michael Ratner told reporters Friday .

Iceland has not received a formal application from Snowden , the Interior Ministry said Monday .
Meanwhile , U.S. officials cast a wide net seeking his return , telling Russia and Latin American countries that they should hand Snowden over should he land on their soil .
President Barack Obama told reporters Monday that the United States is pursuing all legal channels to bring Snowden back . And White House spokesman Jay Carney said U.S. officials are reaching out to numerous countries in an effort to have Snowden turned over .
`` The U.S. is advising these governments that Mr. Snowden is wanted on felony charges and as such should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel other than is necessary to return him here to the United States , '' he said .
But CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the issue now `` is much more of a political and diplomatic matter than it is a legal matter . ''
`` In an ordinary case , sure , you need a passport to get around , '' Toobin said . `` But here , where this case is causing increasing embarrassment for the United States , governments that want the United States to be embarrassed are only too happy to waive some of the technical legal rules . ''
Secretary of State John Kerry particularly urged Russian authorities to work with the United States , noting that U.S. officials have turned over seven prisoners to Russia in recent years .
`` We need to cooperate on this because it 's important to the upholding of the rule of law , '' he told CNN .
He defended the U.S. effort to capture Snowden for prosecution , saying `` people may die as a consequence of what this man did . ''
FBI Director Robert Mueller called his counterpart at Russia 's Federal Security Service twice Monday concerning Snowden , a senior administration official said . And a Justice Department official told CNN that the United States is n't planning to ask for a `` red notice '' calling on members of the international police agency Interpol to take Snowden into custody -- but the official would not say whether the United States has sent or will send provisional arrest warrants to other countries that might take Snowden in or help him in his travels .
It seems unlikely that Cuba , Venezuela or Ecuador -- the nations on Snowden 's potential itinerary -- would be inclined to send him back to the United States . The U.S. government has already asked those three Latin American countries to not admit Snowden or to expel him if they do , a senior Obama administration official told CNN on Sunday .
But Cuba and Venezuela have long had strained relations with Washington . And Ecuador has given Assange refuge in its embassy in London for a year after he unsuccessfully fought extradition to Sweden in British courts .
Assange say he fears Sweden , which wants him for questioning about sexual assault allegations , would transfer him to the United States .
In his letter , read by Patino , Snowden compared himself to Pvt . Bradley Manning , the U.S. soldier accused of leaking classified information through WikiLeaks . He said U.S. officials have treated Manning inhumanely by holding him in solitary confinement , and he predicted a similar `` cruel and unusual '' fate for himself if he falls into U.S. hands .
Carney questioned Snowden 's assertion that he acted in defense of democratic transparency , saying his argument `` is belied by the protectors he has potentially chosen -- China , Russia , Ecuador . ''

Snowden seeks refuge in Ecuador and was last reported in Moscow

Ecuador says it's reviewing his appeal ""very responsibly""

Washington says Snowden is a wanted man, urges nations to turn him away

Pleading for asylum after spilling American secrets, Edward Snowden told Ecuador's government that he fears inhumane treatment or even death if he's handed over to face U.S. espionage charges, Ecuador's foreign minister said Monday.

Snowden told Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa that it is ""unlikely that I will have a fair trial or humane treatment"" if handed over to U.S. officials to stand trial, according to a letter from Snowden read by Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino.

The whereabouts of Snowden, the computer contractor who exposed details of the National Security Agency's surveillance programs, were uncertain late Monday. He was last known to be in Moscow, where he landed after a flight from Hong Kong on Sunday.

He had been expected to board a flight to Cuba on Monday, Russia's semiofficial Interfax news agency reported. But CNN journalists on two successive Moscow-to-Havana flights said Snowden did not appear to be in the cabin, while officials at the Russian capital's Sheremetyevo International Airport declined to say whether he was still there.

U.S. officials have yanked Snowden's passport, but he left Hong Kong on a ""refugee document of passage"" issued by Ecuador, according to Julian Assange, founder of the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, which is aiding Snowden's efforts to find a safe haven. Assange would say only that the former National Security Agency contractor is ""in a safe place and his spirits are high.""

While Patino, speaking at a news conference in Vietnam, said the country has yet to decide on Snowden's asylum request, he questioned whether it was Snowden or the United States that was acting badly in the affair.

He called the surveillance programs revealed by Snowden ""a breach of the rights"" of people around the world.

""We have to ask, who has betrayed who?"" he said.

Correa, meanwhile, took to Twitter to address the issue. ""Rest assured that we will analyze the Snowden case very responsibly and we will make with absolute sovereignty the decision that we believe is most appropriate,"" the president tweeted.

He added, ""A big hug to everyone and happy week.""

Snowden has acknowledged that he leaked classified documents about NSA-run surveillance programs to the Guardian newspaper in Britain and to The Washington Post. The documents revealed the existence of programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and monitor the Internet activity of overseas residents. The disclosures shook the U.S. intelligence community and raised questions about whether the NSA is eroding American civil liberties.

He walked away from a six-figure job in Hawaii with the computer consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, an NSA contractor, and went to Hong Kong before the newspapers began publishing stories based on his leak. He told the Guardian that he exposed the surveillance programs because they pose a threat to democracy, but administration officials said the programs are vital to preventing terrorist attacks and are overseen by all three branches of government.

A Hong Kong paper, the South China Morning Post, reported Tuesday that Snowden took the job at Booz Allen early this year to ""collect proof"" about the programs before disclosing them to reporters. Snowden told the paper that he intends to release more of the documents he took from the firm.

""If I have time to go through this information, I would like to make it available to journalists in each country to make their own assessment, independent of my bias, as to whether or not the knowledge of U.S. network operations against their people should be published,"" the newspaper quoted Snowden as saying.

In addition to Ecuador, Snowden is asking Iceland and other, unspecified countries to consider granting him asylum, WikiLeaks attorney Michael Ratner told reporters Friday.

Iceland has not received a formal application from Snowden, the Interior Ministry said Monday.

Meanwhile, U.S. officials cast a wide net seeking his return, telling Russia and Latin American countries that they should hand Snowden over should he land on their soil.

President Barack Obama told reporters Monday that the United States is pursuing all legal channels to bring Snowden back. And White House spokesman Jay Carney said U.S. officials are reaching out to numerous countries in an effort to have Snowden turned over.

""The U.S. is advising these governments that Mr. Snowden is wanted on felony charges and as such should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel other than is necessary to return him here to the United States,"" he said.

But CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the issue now ""is much more of a political and diplomatic matter than it is a legal matter.""

""In an ordinary case, sure, you need a passport to get around,"" Toobin said . ""But here, where this case is causing increasing embarrassment for the United States, governments that want the United States to be embarrassed are only too happy to waive some of the technical legal rules.""

Secretary of State John Kerry particularly urged Russian authorities to work with the United States, noting that U.S. officials have turned over seven prisoners to Russia in recent years.

""We need to cooperate on this because it's important to the upholding of the rule of law,"" he told CNN.

He defended the U.S. effort to capture Snowden for prosecution, saying ""people may die as a consequence of what this man did.""

FBI Director Robert Mueller called his counterpart at Russia's Federal Security Service twice Monday concerning Snowden, a senior administration official said. And a Justice Department official told CNN that the United States isn't planning to ask for a ""red notice"" calling on members of the international police agency Interpol to take Snowden into custody -- but the official would not say whether the United States has sent or will send provisional arrest warrants to other countries that might take Snowden in or help him in his travels.

Ecuador 'analyzing' request

It seems unlikely that Cuba, Venezuela or Ecuador -- the nations on Snowden's potential itinerary -- would be inclined to send him back to the United States. The U.S. government has already asked those three Latin American countries to not admit Snowden or to expel him if they do, a senior Obama administration official told CNN on Sunday.

But Cuba and Venezuela have long had strained relations with Washington. And Ecuador has given Assange refuge in its embassy in London for a year after he unsuccessfully fought extradition to Sweden in British courts.

Assange say he fears Sweden, which wants him for questioning about sexual assault allegations, would transfer him to the United States.

In his letter, read by Patino, Snowden compared himself to Pvt. Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier accused of leaking classified information through WikiLeaks. He said U.S. officials have treated Manning inhumanely by holding him in solitary confinement, and he predicted a similar ""cruel and unusual"" fate for himself if he falls into U.S. hands.

Carney questioned Snowden's assertion that he acted in defense of democratic transparency, saying his argument ""is belied by the protectors he has potentially chosen -- China, Russia, Ecuador.""

""His failures to criticize these regimes suggests that his true motive throughout has been to injure the national security of the United States, not to advance Internet freedom and free speech,"" Carney told reporters.

The Committee to Protect Journalists has criticized Correa's government for pushing legislation that would roll back press freedoms, calling its policies increasingly repressive. But Snowden isn't looking for ""political nirvana,"" said Glenn Greenwald, the columnist for the Guardian who broke Snowden's revelations.

""He's searching for a place where he can be safe and remain free and participate in the debate, and Ecuador seems to be the place he has chosen,"" Greenwald told CNN's The Lead.

U.S. warns China

Carney said Monday that Hong Kong's decision to let Snowden leave dealt efforts to build trust between the United States and China a ""serious setback."" He declined to speculate what impact the decision could have on U.S.-China relations, but said U.S. officials are making their displeasure known ""very directly.""

Don Borelli , a former FBI agent and U.S. legal attache overseas , said computer forensics will be an important element of any case against Snowden , who took off for Hong Kong before the stories were published .
`` You need to corroborate what he said , '' Borelli told CNN . `` You need to be able to prove the elements of a crime . ''
Snowden checked out of his Hong Kong hotel Monday but remains in the semiautonomous Chinese territory , said Ewen MacAskill , the Guardian 's Washington bureau chief .
MacAskill told CNN that Snowden planned his disclosure and his getaway in great detail -- `` but this next phase , the phase we 're in now , he was almost vague about it , '' MacAskill said . `` I do n't think he actually knew or even cared that much . His main objective was to get the information about the level of surveillance out into the public domain and then beyond that , he did n't care . ''
Snowden 's revelations fueled new debate about the U.S. government 's collection of records of domestic telephone calls and overseas Internet activity in the global hunt for terrorists and criminals . Supporters of the programs say they are legal and have yielded evidence that has helped put terror plotters in prison , though many of the details remain classified .
Obama administration officials and leaders of the intelligence committees in Congress say the program undergoes periodic review by all three branches of government , and that the content of Americans ' calls is not being monitored .
White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday the measures are a necessary middle way between total privacy and unacceptable threat . He said President Barack Obama would be willing to consider changes should a national debate show the public wants them -- but he wryly noted , `` This is not the manner by which he hoped to have the debate . ''
`` What I can tell you is that the programs are judged by the president and by his national security team to be necessary and effective . They are also accorded oversight by all three branches of government , as is appropriate , and it is also the case that these programs and the general principle about finding the balance between our security interests and our need and desire for privacy is something that we should constantly engage in .
U.S. Rep. Peter King , chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee 's Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence , called Snowden `` a defector '' who should be turned over to the United States with an eye toward harsh prosecution .
`` This person is dangerous to the country , '' King said on CNN 's `` Starting Point '' on Monday .
Sen. Bill Nelson , D-Florida , fumed that Snowden committed `` an act of treason , '' while Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein questioned whether his access to government secrets was as extensive as he claims .
`` I listened carefully to what he said , and what he said is , you know , ' I can get access to where every asset is in the world and their stations and their missions , ' and I 've been told that is n't possible , '' said Feinstein , D-California .
She added , `` I do n't really have any way of knowing how adept he is in the computer world . ... I ca n't say he 's overstating anything in these programs . Maybe he 's overstating his prowess . ''
But Glenn Greenwald , the Guardian columnist who was the lead author on last week 's stories , told CNN 's `` The Lead '' that Snowden has revealed secrets that were being kept only from American citizens .
`` Terrorists already know the U.S. government tries to surveil their communications , '' Greenwald said . `` Nothing that we revealed helps , quote-unquote , the terrorists . All we did was tell our fellow citizens of the United States and around the world the extent and capabilities of how vast the surveillance state is and the reasons why it needs scrutiny and accountability . And the only things we damaged are the reputation of American political officials , not national security . ''
Greenwald said he knew `` generally '' where Snowden has gone , but added , `` I 'm not going to disclose information about his whereabouts . He 's capable of doing that himself if he wants to . ''

A major question is whether Hong Kong , where Snowden fled , would extradite him to face charges in the United States .
Although Hong Kong is part of communist-ruled China , the former British colony has a separate ruling system that allows a free press and tolerates political dissent . Hong Kong 's extradition treaty with the United States has exceptions for political crimes and cases when handing over a criminal suspect would harm the `` defense , foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy '' of either party .
`` I think he looked around , this seemed the safest bet , '' said MacAskill .
Snowden hopes to get asylum , he added , with Iceland his first choice because of the way it dealt with WikiLeaks , a group that facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information through its website . The group reportedly once operated from there .
Kristin Arnadottir , Iceland 's ambassador to China , said Icelandic law requires asylum applications to be made from inside the country .
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , bottled up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since last June , said Snowden should be looking to the southeast , not northwest .
`` I would strongly advise him to go to Latin America , '' Assange told CNN 's `` Anderson Cooper 360 '' on Monday night . `` Latin America has shown in the past 10 years that it is really pushing forward in human rights . There 's a long tradition of asylum . ''
Assange sought refuge in the Ecuadorian mission to avoid extradition to Sweden , where he is wanted for questioning over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another . He has repeatedly said the allegations in Sweden are politically motivated and tied to the work of his website .
Assange has said he fears Sweden will transfer him to the United States , where he could face the death penalty if he were charged with and convicted of a crime . Though no U.S. charges are pending , WikiLeaks source Bradley Manning is being court-martialed on charges that he aided U.S. enemies by leaking documents he obtained as a U.S. Army intelligence analyst .
If Snowden is charged and brought back to the United States , the Progressive Change Campaign Committee started a campaign to raise funds for his legal defense . The group promotes progressive causes and candidates , its website says .
Snowden 's revelations began Wednesday when the Guardian published a top secret court order demanding that Verizon Business Network Services turn over details of phone calls published from April 25 to July 19 . Intelligence officials later confirmed the program , which analysts say likely covers all U.S. carriers .
On Thursday , the Guardian and the Post disclosed the existence of PRISM , a program they said allows NSA analysts to extract the details of people 's online activities -- including `` audio and video chats , photographs , e-mails , documents '' and other materials -- from computers at Microsoft , Google , Apple and other Internet firms .
Intelligence officials similarly confirmed that program 's existence , but said it targets only overseas residents who are not U.S. citizens .
On Friday , Obama said he entered office skeptical of such programs but decided to reauthorize them after a thorough vetting and the addition of unspecified additional safeguards . He called them only `` modest encroachments on privacy '' that help thwart terror attacks .
Before joining Booz Allen Hamilton , which provides support technology and computer support to the government , Snowden worked for the CIA , he told the newspaper .
He told the Guardian he worked for the consulting firm in Hawaii , holding down a $ 200,000-a-year job that gave him easy access to a vast trove of sensitive data .
`` The NSA has built an infrastructure that allows it to intercept almost everything , '' he told the newspaper . `` With this capability , the vast majority of human communications are automatically ingested without targeting . If I wanted to see your e-mails or your wife 's phone , all I have to do is use intercepts . I can get your e-mails , passwords , phone records , credit cards . ''
In a statement released Sunday , Booz Allen Hamilton said Snowden had worked for the company for less than three months . The report that he had leaked American secrets was `` shocking '' and if true , `` represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm , '' the company said .
Snowden 's actions , while opposed by many , have also brought together some liberals and conservatives to hail him as a hero .
Liberal activist and filmmaker Michael Moore tweeted that Snowden is `` HERO OF THE YEAR . '' Conservative commentator Glenn Beck , meanwhile , called Snowden a `` patriot leaker '' who could help America `` regain her moral compass . ''
Daniel Ellsberg , who in the 1970s leaked the Pentagon Papers documents showing the government had lied about the progress of the Vietnam War , said Snowden had done the country an `` enormous service . '' And in Congress , Democratic senators such as Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado have warned about the dangers of excessive surveillance as vociferously as Sen. Rand Paul , a Republican from Kentucky .
On the other side , Feinstein joined Republicans such as Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and Rep. Mike Rogers in defending the surveillance programs .
They point to what they say are the program 's successes , including charges against an Afghan-born Colorado man who pleaded guilty to conspiring to bomb targets in New York , and David Headley , who was accused of conducting advance surveillance for the Pakistani jihadists who attacked hotels and other targets in Mumbai , India , in 2008 , killing 164 people . Both men pleaded guilty .
Rogers , the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , told ABC 's `` This Week '' that the `` inflammatory nature '' of the accusations does n't fit with how the program actually operates .
`` The instances where this has produced good -- has disrupted plots , prevented terrorist attacks -- is all classified , '' said Rogers , R-Michigan . `` That 's what 's so hard about this . ''","Story highlights Forget Hong Kong, go to Latin America, Assange advises

Further, they showed that the government had lied to Congress and the public about the progress of the war. Ellsberg surrendered to authorities and was charged as a spy. During his trial, the court learned that President Richard Nixon's administration had embarked on a campaign to discredit Ellsberg, illegally wiretapping him and breaking into his psychiatrist's office. All charges against him were dropped. Since then he has lived a relatively quiet life as a respected author and lecturer.

Peter Buxtun, who worked for the Public Health Service, relayed information about the Tuskegee syphilis experiment to a reporter in 1972, which halted the 40-year study.

The stories sparked a congressional investigation that eventually led to President Nixon's resignation in 1974. The Post won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage.

Don Borelli, a former FBI agent and U.S. legal attache overseas, said computer forensics will be an important element of any case against Snowden, who took off for Hong Kong before the stories were published.

""You need to corroborate what he said,"" Borelli told CNN. ""You need to be able to prove the elements of a crime.""

Snowden checked out of his Hong Kong hotel Monday but remains in the semiautonomous Chinese territory, said Ewen MacAskill, the Guardian's Washington bureau chief.

MacAskill told CNN that Snowden planned his disclosure and his getaway in great detail -- ""but this next phase, the phase we're in now, he was almost vague about it,"" MacAskill said. ""I don't think he actually knew or even cared that much. His main objective was to get the information about the level of surveillance out into the public domain and then beyond that, he didn't care.""

Snowden's revelations fueled new debate about the U.S. government's collection of records of domestic telephone calls and overseas Internet activity in the global hunt for terrorists and criminals. Supporters of the programs say they are legal and have yielded evidence that has helped put terror plotters in prison, though many of the details remain classified.

Obama administration officials and leaders of the intelligence committees in Congress say the program undergoes periodic review by all three branches of government, and that the content of Americans' calls is not being monitored.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday the measures are a necessary middle way between total privacy and unacceptable threat. He said President Barack Obama would be willing to consider changes should a national debate show the public wants them -- but he wryly noted, ""This is not the manner by which he hoped to have the debate.""

""What I can tell you is that the programs are judged by the president and by his national security team to be necessary and effective. They are also accorded oversight by all three branches of government, as is appropriate, and it is also the case that these programs and the general principle about finding the balance between our security interests and our need and desire for privacy is something that we should constantly engage in.

U.S. Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee's Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, called Snowden ""a defector"" who should be turned over to the United States with an eye toward harsh prosecution.

""This person is dangerous to the country,"" King said on CNN's ""Starting Point"" on Monday.

Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, fumed that Snowden committed ""an act of treason,"" while Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein questioned whether his access to government secrets was as extensive as he claims.

""I listened carefully to what he said, and what he said is, you know, 'I can get access to where every asset is in the world and their stations and their missions,' and I've been told that isn't possible,"" said Feinstein, D-California.

She added, ""I don't really have any way of knowing how adept he is in the computer world. ... I can't say he's overstating anything in these programs. Maybe he's overstating his prowess.""

But Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian columnist who was the lead author on last week's stories, told CNN's ""The Lead"" that Snowden has revealed secrets that were being kept only from American citizens.

""Terrorists already know the U.S. government tries to surveil their communications,"" Greenwald said. ""Nothing that we revealed helps, quote-unquote, the terrorists. All we did was tell our fellow citizens of the United States and around the world the extent and capabilities of how vast the surveillance state is and the reasons why it needs scrutiny and accountability. And the only things we damaged are the reputation of American political officials, not national security.""

Greenwald said he knew ""generally"" where Snowden has gone, but added, ""I'm not going to disclose information about his whereabouts. He's capable of doing that himself if he wants to.""

Extradition for Snowden?

A major question is whether Hong Kong, where Snowden fled, would extradite him to face charges in the United States.

Although Hong Kong is part of communist-ruled China, the former British colony has a separate ruling system that allows a free press and tolerates political dissent. Hong Kong's extradition treaty with the United States has exceptions for political crimes and cases when handing over a criminal suspect would harm the ""defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy"" of either party.

""I think he looked around, this seemed the safest bet,"" said MacAskill.

Snowden hopes to get asylum, he added, with Iceland his first choice because of the way it dealt with WikiLeaks, a group that facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information through its website. The group reportedly once operated from there.

Kristin Arnadottir, Iceland's ambassador to China, said Icelandic law requires asylum applications to be made from inside the country.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, bottled up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since last June, said Snowden should be looking to the southeast, not northwest.

""I would strongly advise him to go to Latin America,"" Assange told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on Monday night. ""Latin America has shown in the past 10 years that it is really pushing forward in human rights. There's a long tradition of asylum.""

Assange sought refuge in the Ecuadorian mission to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. He has repeatedly said the allegations in Sweden are politically motivated and tied to the work of his website.

Assange has said he fears Sweden will transfer him to the United States, where he could face the death penalty if he were charged with and convicted of a crime. Though no U.S. charges are pending, WikiLeaks source Bradley Manning is being court-martialed on charges that he aided U.S. enemies by leaking documents he obtained as a U.S. Army intelligence analyst.

If Snowden is charged and brought back to the United States, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee started a campaign to raise funds for his legal defense. The group promotes progressive causes and candidates, its website says.

Snowden's revelations began Wednesday when the Guardian published a top secret court order demanding that Verizon Business Network Services turn over details of phone calls published from April 25 to July 19. Intelligence officials later confirmed the program, which analysts say likely covers all U.S. carriers.

On Thursday, the Guardian and the Post disclosed the existence of PRISM, a program they said allows NSA analysts to extract the details of people's online activities -- including ""audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents"" and other materials -- from computers at Microsoft, Google, Apple and other Internet firms.

Intelligence officials similarly confirmed that program's existence, but said it targets only overseas residents who are not U.S. citizens.

On Friday, Obama said he entered office skeptical of such programs but decided to reauthorize them after a thorough vetting and the addition of unspecified additional safeguards. He called them only ""modest encroachments on privacy"" that help thwart terror attacks.

Copying secrets

Before joining Booz Allen Hamilton, which provides support technology and computer support to the government, Snowden worked for the CIA, he told the newspaper.

He told the Guardian he worked for the consulting firm in Hawaii, holding down a $200,000-a-year job that gave him easy access to a vast trove of sensitive data.

""The NSA has built an infrastructure that allows it to intercept almost everything,"" he told the newspaper. ""With this capability, the vast majority of human communications are automatically ingested without targeting. If I wanted to see your e-mails or your wife's phone, all I have to do is use intercepts. I can get your e-mails, passwords, phone records, credit cards.""

In a statement released Sunday, Booz Allen Hamilton said Snowden had worked for the company for less than three months. The report that he had leaked American secrets was ""shocking"" and if true, ""represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm,"" the company said.

Strange bedfellows

Snowden's actions, while opposed by many, have also brought together some liberals and conservatives to hail him as a hero.

Liberal activist and filmmaker Michael Moore tweeted that Snowden is ""HERO OF THE YEAR."" Conservative commentator Glenn Beck, meanwhile, called Snowden a ""patriot leaker"" who could help America ""regain her moral compass.""

Daniel Ellsberg, who in the 1970s leaked the Pentagon Papers documents showing the government had lied about the progress of the Vietnam War, said Snowden had done the country an ""enormous service."" And in Congress, Democratic senators such as Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado have warned about the dangers of excessive surveillance as vociferously as Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky.

On the other side, Feinstein joined Republicans such as Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and Rep. Mike Rogers in defending the surveillance programs.

They point to what they say are the program's successes, including charges against an Afghan-born Colorado man who pleaded guilty to conspiring to bomb targets in New York, and David Headley, who was accused of conducting advance surveillance for the Pakistani jihadists who attacked hotels and other targets in Mumbai, India, in 2008, killing 164 people. Both men pleaded guilty.

Rogers, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told ABC's ""This Week"" that the ""inflammatory nature"" of the accusations doesn't fit with how the program actually operates.

""The instances where this has produced good -- has disrupted plots, prevented terrorist attacks -- is all classified,"" said Rogers, R-Michigan. ""That's what's so hard about this.""",www.cnn.com,left,7udrmQ38hvTyrx1k

Pundits across the political left should be careful about heaping too much praise on U.S. District Judge Richard Leon for this week ’ s dramatic ruling that the National Security Agency ’ s electronic dragnet capturing Americans ’ online activities is “ significantly likely ” to be unconstitutional , even though it is a powerful rebuke to America ’ s spymasters .
That ’ s because Leon , a longtime Republican warrior , is as much of a legal loudmouth and rightwing activist judge as U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia . More importantly , his elbows-out 68-page opinion is not going to be the last word on the government ’ s data mining . Leon ’ s ruling is one of several NSA-related suits moving through the federal courts , including rulings that have reached the opposite conclusion .
“ It should be noted that last month Judge Jeffrey Miller of the Southern District of California found the NSA business records program to be constitutional , '' Sen. Dianne Feinstein , Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman , said Tuesday . `` Leon ’ s opinion also differs from those of at least 15 separate federal district court judges ... Only the Supreme Court can resolve the question on the constitutionality of the NSA ’ s program . ''
These conflicts will likely trigger a review by the Supreme Court , where the conservative majority already has sanctioned NSA electronic eavesdropping and is known for elevating government searches over individual rights . In other words , Leon 's rebuke may help put the issue in front of a court majority that is poised to codify national security over privacy rights .
“ There ’ s a generalized right of privacy that comes from penumbras and emanations , blah blah blah , garbage , ” Scalia said in a recent speech to the Northern Virginia Technology Council , where he more than signaled his support for unbridled NSA surveillance .
You would think that left-leaning pundits would realize these dynamics and that it is perilous to praise an unabashedly activist judge just because he issued a decision they like . But that ’ s exactly what appeared in Tuesday ’ s lead editorial in The New York Times .
“ The ruling by Judge Leon , who was nominated to the bench by President George W. Bush on Sept. 10 , 2001 , was remarkable for many reasons , but mainly because there were real people sitting in open court challenging the government ’ s lawyers over the program ’ s constitutionality , ” the Times wrote . “ It is an enormously symbolic victory for opponents of the bulk-collected program , and a reminder of the adversarial process [ a trial ] . For seven years , these constitutional issues have been adjudicated under a ‘ cloak of secrecy , ’ as Judge Leon put it . Now , that cloak has finally been lifted in a true court of law . ”
It ’ s a bit dangerous to praise Judge Leon ’ s courtroom as a citadel of “ true ” justice . Leon has a long history of not just making quotable outbursts in decisions and from the bench , but also issuing truly damaging pro-corporate rulings . He singlehandedly stopped new graphic labels for tobacco products after Congress passed new labeling laws , and federal health officials drafted and issued new labeling rules . In that case , he took Big Tobacco ’ s side saying that putting photos on cigarette packages was a form of coerced speech that violated their First Amendment commerical speech rights .
You won ’ t see many references to Leon ’ s outbursts in the Times or on many left-leaning blogs , such as Leon telling the Security and Exchange Commission and IBM ’ s lawyers in a bribery case that they had to “ satisfy me ” before accepting a settlement . Nor will you see much about his history as a GOP hitman when he was a congressional staffer who blocked inquiries into the Iran-Contra scandal . To its credit , ConsortiumNews.com drew on its memory to recall Leon ’ s role in that 1980s scandal , where Ronald Reagan ’ s White House traded weapons with terrorists to free American hostages held by Iran .
“ Leon clearly possesses a libertarian streak , but he earned his place on the bench by running a partisan cover-up of a historic crime , ” wrote Consortium News ’ Robert Parry . “ Leon was appointed to his lifetime judicial post by George W. Bush in 2002 after Leon won the gratitude of the Bush Family by protecting its interests as an aggressive and reliable Republican legal apparatchik on Capital Hill . There , the heavy-set Leon gained a reputation as a partisan bully who made sure politically charged investigations reached a desired outcome , whatever the facts . ”
That same characterization could be made of the right-wing lawyer who brought the suit that led to Leon ’ s ruling , Larry Klayman , who has been picking legal fights for 20-plus years , first with his group called Judicial Watch—now Freedom Watch . Klayman has sought to portray Obama as a closet Muslim , and said he likely was born in Kenya , among his many right-wing crusades .
Beyond the players that resulted in Leon ’ s striking ruling lies a legal bottom line that opponents of the national security state and domestic spying should note . In Supreme Court doctrine , there is a famous phrase , “ The Constitution is not a suicide pact . ”
It refers to the Court ’ s history over the decades of justifying whatever liberties-infinging activity that the White House deems necessary to preserve the federal government . Civil libertarians should watch to see how the NSA ’ s electronic dragnet resurfaces at the high Court as other cases make their way through the federal courts .
`` Clearly we have competing decisions from those of at least three different courts ( the FISA Court , the D.C. District Court and the Southern District of California ) , '' Feinstein said . `` I welcome a Supreme Court review since it has been more than 30 years since the court ’ s original decision of constitutionality [ of NSA spying ] , and I believe it is crucial to settling the issue once and for all .

Kinsey recalled seeing Snowdenthrough the blinds, working on a computer ""at all times of day and night."" She had the impression he was sort of a ""computer geek.""

Snowden spent part of his childhood in Wilmington, North Carolina, before his family moved to the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C., an area rife with government workers. He attended public school in Anne Arundel County, from elementary school through three semesters at Arundel High School in Gambrills, according to a county school spokesman.

Snowden told the Guardian he didn't finish high school but studied computers at a Maryland community college.

Snowden served in the Army from June to September in 2004 at Fort Benning, Georgia, where he declared his intent to qualify for the Special Forces, said Col. David H. Patterson Jr., an Army spokesman. Snowden didn't complete basic training and was discharged. The Army wouldn't give other details.

Snowden said he tapped his computer skills to get an information technology job at the CIA and rose quickly through the ranks.

Snowden said he left the CIA in 2009 to begin working for a private contractor that assigned him to a functioning NSA facility, stationed on a military base in Japan.

Former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden is willing to return to the U.S. if he is guaranteed a fair trial, his lawyer says.

""Edward Snowden is ready to return to the U.S., but on the condition that he be given ... a fair and impartial trial,"" lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said, according to the Russian news agency TASS.

Kucherena said he received a letter from the U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder promising Snowden would not face capital punishment should he return.

""That is, they guarantee that Snowden will not be executed, not that he will receive a fair trial. And it is guaranteed by the attorney general who cannot even influence court decisions according to law,"" Kucherena said.

Kucherena spoke at a news conference in Moscow while promoting a book he has written about Snowden.

""I won't keep it secret that he... wants to return back home,"" Reuters reported. ""And we are doing everything possible now to solve this issue. There is a group of U.S. lawyers, there is also a group of German lawyers and I'm dealing with it on the Russian side.""

He said he does not trust some countries who said they would protect Snowden.

""Snowden can leave the Russian territory with his residence permit. But I suspect that as soon as he leaves Russia, he will be delivered to the U.S. Embassy,"" TASS quoted Kucherena as saying.

Snowden, now 31, is a North Carolina native who once spent four months in the Army. He was a contractor for Booz Allen Hamilton when he leaked details of U.S. surveillance programs to The Guardian and The Washington Post. The first reports were published in June 2013, setting off an immediate global firestorm.

Snowden, who was in hiding in Hong Kong at the time, fled to Moscow.

On Thursday, I held a news conference announcing my intent to pursue legal action against the federal government for infringing on Americans’ Fourth Amendment rights. The National Security Agency’s collection of Verizon’s client data probably only scratches the surface. A court order that allows the government to obtain a billion records a day and does not name an individual target is clearly beyond the scope of the Fourth Amendment, which states clearly that warrants must be specific to the person and the place.

Joining me Thursday to show support for this action were U.S. Reps. Justin Amash, Thomas Massie, Mick Mulvaney, Louie Gohmert and Mark Sanford, along with representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union, FreedomWorks, Electronic Privacy Information Center, Campaign for Liberty, as well as constitutional scholar and lawyer Bruce Fein.

Mr. Gohmert joked about standing next to the ACLU, but he pointed out that upholding the Constitution is not about Republican versus Democrat or conservative versus liberal. It is about liberty versus power. It recognizes and attempts to limit the inevitable arrogance of power. President Obama says that we can trust his administration not to abuse the mountains of data he admits it gathers. Perhaps we can also trust the Internal Revenue Service not to target those who speak out against the government. Perhaps we can also trust the Justice Department not to seize the phone records of Associated Press reporters.

Our Founders never intended for Americans to trust their government. Our entire Constitution was predicated on the notion that government was a necessary evil, to be restrained and minimized as much as possible.

Indiscriminate monitoring of citizens’ records is precisely the kind of general warranting we fought a revolution over. The Colonists did not appreciate a British government that could go door to door, searching anyone and everyone without probable cause or suspicion.

Today, our government goes phone to phone, computer to computer and dares to call this lawful and constitutional. At a hearing on March 12, Sen. Ron Wyden asked Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper, “Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?” Mr. Clapper replied, “No sir not wittingly.”

We now know that the NSA did this wittingly. We know that Mr. Clapper was not telling us the truth.

Are these government officials telling us the truth now when they claim they are not abusing our phone-data information? By what history or track record are we supposed to trust them? What does it say about us if we are willing to give government the benefit of the doubt, but that same government treats every American as a potential terrorist?

No, the proper order of things in our constitutional republic is that the government is supposed to fear its citizens, not the other way around.

So far, we have more than 250,000 people who have signed up to challenge the constitutionality of the generalized warrants. We expect many more.

The Constitution is not a negotiable piece of parchment to be ignored or abused at the president’s whim. Washington leaders are expected to obey and protect what they took an oath to uphold — and if this means taking them to court over it, so be it.

Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Homeland Security committees.

The defense spending bill passed 315 to 109 . The amendment was voted down 217-205 on an issue that created unusual political coalitions in Washington , with libertarian-leaning conservatives and liberal Democrats pressing for the change against the Obama administration , the Republican establishment and Congress ' national security experts .
94 Republicans and 111 Democrats voted for the amendment , while 134 Republicans and 83 Democrats voted no .
The showdown vote marked the first chance for lawmakers to take a stand on the secret surveillance program since former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden leaked classified documents last month that spelled out the monumental scope of the government 's activities .
It is unlikely to be the final word on government intrusion to defend the nation and Americans ' civil liberties .
`` Have 12 years gone by and our memories faded so badly that we forgot what happened on Sept . 11 ? '' Rep. Mike Rogers , R-Mich. , chairman of the Intelligence committee , said in pleading with his colleagues to back the program during House debate .
Republican Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan , chief sponsor of the repeal effort , said his aim was to end the indiscriminate collection of Americans ' phone records .
After the vote , Amash could barely hide his frustration , telling reporters : “ Ask the American people if the House did the right thing . ''
His measure , offered as an addition to the defense spending bill , would have canceled the statutory authority for the NSA program , ending the agency 's ability to collect phone records and metadata under the USA Patriot Act unless it identified an individual under investigation .
Amash told the House that his effort was to defend the Constitution and `` defend the privacy of every American . ''
The unusual political coalitions were on full display during a spirited but brief House debate .
`` Let us not deal in false narratives . Let 's deal in facts that will keep Americans safe , '' said Rep. Michele Bachmann , R-Minn. , a member of the Intelligence committee who implored her colleagues to back a program that she argued was vital in combatting terrorism .
But Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner , R-Wis. , a senior member of the Judiciary Committee who helped write the Patriot Act , insisted `` the time has come '' to stop the collection of phone records .
Several Republicans acknowledged the difficulty in balancing civil liberties against national security , but expressed suspicion about the Obama administration 's implementation of the NSA programs -- and anger at Director of National Intelligence James Clapper .
`` Right now the balancing is being done by people we do not know . People who lied to this body , '' said Rep. Mick Mulvaney , R-S.C .
He was referring to Clapper who admitted he gave misleading statements to Congress on how much the U.S. spies on Americans . Clapper apologized to lawmakers earlier this month after saying in March that the U.S. does not gather data on citizens -- something that Snowden revealed as false by releasing documents showing the NSA collects millions of phone records .
With a flurry of letters , statements and tweets , both sides lobbied furiously in the hours prior to the vote in the Republican-controlled House . In a last-minute statement , Clapper warned against dismantling a critical intelligence tool .
Since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , Congress has authorized -- and a Republican and a Democratic president have signed -- extensions of the powers to search records and conduct roving wiretaps in pursuit of terrorists .
Two years ago , in a strong bipartisan statement , the Senate voted 72-23 to renew the Patriot Act and the House backed the extension 250-153 .
Since the disclosures this year , however , lawmakers have said they were shocked by the scope of the two programs -- one to collect records of hundreds of millions of calls and the other allowing the NSA to sweep up Internet usage data from around the world that goes through nine major U.S.-based providers .
Although Republican leaders agreed to a vote on the Amash amendment , one of 100 to the defense spending bill , time for debate was limited to 15 minutes out of the two days the House dedicated to the overall legislation .
The White House and the director of the NSA , Army Gen. Keith Alexander , made last-minute appeals to lawmakers , urging them to oppose the amendment . Rogers and Rep. C.A . Dutch Ruppersberger , D-Md. , leaders of the House Intelligence committee , implored their colleagues to back the NSA program .
Eight former attorneys general , CIA directors and national security experts wrote in a letter to lawmakers that the two programs are fully authorized by law and `` conducted in a manner that appropriately respects the privacy and civil liberties interests of Americans . ''
White House press secretary Jay Carney issued an unusual , nighttime statement on the eve of Wednesday 's vote , arguing that the change would `` hastily dismantle one of our intelligence community 's counterterrorism tools . ''
Proponents of the NSA programs argue that the surveillance operations have been successful in thwarting at least 50 terror plots across 20 countries , including 10 to 12 directed at the United States . Among them was a 2009 plot to strike at the New York Stock Exchange .
Rogers joined six GOP committee chairmen in a letter urging lawmakers to reject the Amash amendment .
`` While many members have legitimate questions about the NSA metadata program , including whether there are sufficient protections for Americans ' civil liberties , '' the chairman wrote , `` eliminating this program altogether without careful deliberation would not reflect our duty , under Article I of the Constitution , to provide for the common defense . ''
The overall defense spending bill would provide the Pentagon with $ 512.5 billion for weapons , personnel , aircraft and ships plus $ 85.8 billion for the war in Afghanistan for the next budget year .
The total , which is $ 5.1 billion below current spending , has drawn a veto threat from the White House , which argues that it would force the administration to cut education , health research and other domestic programs in order to boost spending for the Pentagon .
In a leap of faith , the bill assumes that Congress and the administration will resolve the automatic , across-the-board spending cuts that have led the Pentagon to furlough workers and cut back on training . The bill projects spending in the next fiscal year at $ 28.1 billion above the so-called sequester level .
By voice vote , the House backed an amendment that would require the president to seek congressional approval before sending U.S. military forces into the 2-year-old civil war in Syria .
Rep. Trey Radel , R-Fla. , sponsor of the measure , said Obama has a `` cloudy foreign policy '' and noted the nation 's war weariness after more than 10 years of conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The administration is moving ahead with sending weapons to vetted rebels , but Obama and members of Congress have rejected the notion of U.S. ground forces .
The House also adopted , by voice vote , an amendment barring funds for military or paramilitary operations in Egypt . Several lawmakers , including Rep. Kay Granger , R-Texas , who heads the panel overseeing foreign aid , expressed concerns about the measure jeopardizing the United States ' longstanding relationship with the Egyptian military .
The sponsor of the measure , Rep. Thomas Massie , R-Ky. , insisted that his amendment would not affect that relationship .

""Let us not deal in false narratives. Let's deal in facts that will keep Americans safe,"" said Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., a member of the Intelligence committee who implored her colleagues to back a program that she argued was vital in combatting terrorism.

But Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., a senior member of the Judiciary Committee who helped write the Patriot Act, insisted ""the time has come"" to stop the collection of phone records.

Several Republicans acknowledged the difficulty in balancing civil liberties against national security, but expressed suspicion about the Obama administration's implementation of the NSA programs -- and anger at Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.

""Right now the balancing is being done by people we do not know. People who lied to this body,"" said Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C.

He was referring to Clapper who admitted he gave misleading statements to Congress on how much the U.S. spies on Americans. Clapper apologized to lawmakers earlier this month after saying in March that the U.S. does not gather data on citizens -- something that Snowden revealed as false by releasing documents showing the NSA collects millions of phone records.

With a flurry of letters, statements and tweets, both sides lobbied furiously in the hours prior to the vote in the Republican-controlled House. In a last-minute statement, Clapper warned against dismantling a critical intelligence tool.

Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Congress has authorized -- and a Republican and a Democratic president have signed -- extensions of the powers to search records and conduct roving wiretaps in pursuit of terrorists.

Two years ago, in a strong bipartisan statement, the Senate voted 72-23 to renew the Patriot Act and the House backed the extension 250-153.

Since the disclosures this year, however, lawmakers have said they were shocked by the scope of the two programs -- one to collect records of hundreds of millions of calls and the other allowing the NSA to sweep up Internet usage data from around the world that goes through nine major U.S.-based providers.

Although Republican leaders agreed to a vote on the Amash amendment, one of 100 to the defense spending bill, time for debate was limited to 15 minutes out of the two days the House dedicated to the overall legislation.

The White House and the director of the NSA, Army Gen. Keith Alexander, made last-minute appeals to lawmakers, urging them to oppose the amendment. Rogers and Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Md., leaders of the House Intelligence committee, implored their colleagues to back the NSA program.

Eight former attorneys general, CIA directors and national security experts wrote in a letter to lawmakers that the two programs are fully authorized by law and ""conducted in a manner that appropriately respects the privacy and civil liberties interests of Americans.""

White House press secretary Jay Carney issued an unusual, nighttime statement on the eve of Wednesday's vote, arguing that the change would ""hastily dismantle one of our intelligence community's counterterrorism tools.""

Proponents of the NSA programs argue that the surveillance operations have been successful in thwarting at least 50 terror plots across 20 countries, including 10 to 12 directed at the United States. Among them was a 2009 plot to strike at the New York Stock Exchange.

Rogers joined six GOP committee chairmen in a letter urging lawmakers to reject the Amash amendment.

""While many members have legitimate questions about the NSA metadata program, including whether there are sufficient protections for Americans' civil liberties,"" the chairman wrote, ""eliminating this program altogether without careful deliberation would not reflect our duty, under Article I of the Constitution, to provide for the common defense.""

The overall defense spending bill would provide the Pentagon with $512.5 billion for weapons, personnel, aircraft and ships plus $85.8 billion for the war in Afghanistan for the next budget year.

The total, which is $5.1 billion below current spending, has drawn a veto threat from the White House, which argues that it would force the administration to cut education, health research and other domestic programs in order to boost spending for the Pentagon.

In a leap of faith, the bill assumes that Congress and the administration will resolve the automatic, across-the-board spending cuts that have led the Pentagon to furlough workers and cut back on training. The bill projects spending in the next fiscal year at $28.1 billion above the so-called sequester level.

By voice vote, the House backed an amendment that would require the president to seek congressional approval before sending U.S. military forces into the 2-year-old civil war in Syria.

Rep. Trey Radel, R-Fla., sponsor of the measure, said Obama has a ""cloudy foreign policy"" and noted the nation's war weariness after more than 10 years of conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The administration is moving ahead with sending weapons to vetted rebels, but Obama and members of Congress have rejected the notion of U.S. ground forces.

The House also adopted, by voice vote, an amendment barring funds for military or paramilitary operations in Egypt. Several lawmakers, including Rep. Kay Granger, R-Texas, who heads the panel overseeing foreign aid, expressed concerns about the measure jeopardizing the United States' longstanding relationship with the Egyptian military.

The sponsor of the measure, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., insisted that his amendment would not affect that relationship.

The overall bill must be reconciled with whatever measure the Democratic-controlled Senate produces.

Controversial surveillance practices that spilled into public view through a series of dramatic leaks last week have helped to avert “ dozens of terrorist events ” in recent years , National Security Agency Director Keith Alexander told a Senate committee Wednesday .
However , the longer the NSA director spoke before the Senate Appropriations Committee , the less clear it became just which surveillance programs he was crediting for those successes .

Controversial surveillance practices that spilled into public view through a series of dramatic leaks last week have helped to avert “dozens of terrorist events” in recent years, National Security Agency Director Keith Alexander told a Senate committee Wednesday.

However, the longer the NSA director spoke before the Senate Appropriations Committee, the less clear it became just which surveillance programs he was crediting for those successes.

His answer came in response to a question from Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) about call-tracking surveillance conducted under Patriot Act Section 215.

Alexander said it was difficult to segregate information obtained under that provision from another practice disclosed by leak last week: a system that gathers bulk data from internet providers, e-mail services and social media sites. That system is aimed at foreigners outside the United States, though it sometimes data from Americans or foreigners on U.S. soil is swept in as well.

“These authorities complement each other. The reality is, they work together,” said Alexander.

It was also not clear whether Alexander was attributing the prevention of dozens of terrorist events to the phone-call tracking program or to the use of Section 215 more generally. Beyond the mass collection of phone records revealed last week, that provision can be used to acquire a variety of business records.

“Clearly, this authority is being used for something more than phone records,” Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said.

However, Alexander made it clear there are limits to the NSA’s surveillance

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) asked whether it was true that the NSA had the ability to tap into Americans’ phone calls and electronic communications.

“False. I know of no way to do that,” Alexander responded.

The NSA chief, who is also a four-star Army general who oversees the U.S. Cyber Command, said he is pressing to declassify information on how often the information has been useful. “I’m pushing for that,” he said. “We do want to get this right and it has to be vetted across the community so what we give you, you know, is accurate.”

Leahy complained that the intelligence community has been dismissive of past congressional efforts to rein in the practices.

The “intelligence community has told us we obviously don’t have the ability as simple senators to know things as well as you do,” Leahy said, paraphrasing what he’s been told about NSA’s programs as: “Congress shouldn’t tinker with it at all. We should simply trust you.”

The Senate hearing was called to address efforts to protect Americans from cyber attacks, but it took less than an hour for senators to turn their focus to the question of government surveillance.

At the outset of the session, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) encouraged her colleagues to put off questions about the hot surveillance issues to other hearings to take place in the future. Multiple times she interrupted their questions of Alexander about domestic surveillance to plead with them to put off questions on the phone records programs.

“In the last several days, many intelligence issues have been in the press…I understand that these are issues that are very much on the public’s mind and members of the Senate,” Mikulski said. “That’s not today. That’s for another day.”

However, Mikulski was clearly sensitive to suggestions she was trying to steer the hearing away from the surveillance issues that have dominated the news in recent days. She publicly took exception to a BuzzFeed reporter’s tweet saying Mikulski was “trying hard” to keep other senators from delving into the data mining issue

”There is no attempt here to muzzle — stifle any senator from asking any line of question,” Mikulski insisted.

Glenn Greenwald’s latest disclosure from the Snowden files is an NSA program called X-KEYSCORE, which provides access to a truly vast amount of information. How vast?

The quantity of communications accessible through programs such as XKeyscore is staggeringly large….The XKeyscore system is continuously collecting so much internet data that it can be stored only for short periods of time. Content remains on the system for only three to five days, while metadata is stored for 30 days. One document explains: “At some sites, the amount of data we receive per day (20+ terabytes) can only be stored for as little as 24 hours.” To solve this problem, the NSA has created a multi-tiered system that allows analysts to store “interesting” content in other databases, such as one named Pinwale which can store material for up to five years.

It’s not clear precisely what’s available through X-KEYSCORE, but it appears to be exclusively foreign signals intelligence: phone conversations, emails, chat, etc. Because it’s non-U.S., this includes the content of the communications, not just the metadata:

An NSA tool called DNI Presenter, used to read the content of stored emails, also enables an analyst using XKeyscore to read the content of Facebook chats or private messages. An analyst can monitor such Facebook chats by entering the Facebook user name and a date range into a simple search screen. Analysts can search for internet browsing activities using a wide range of information, including search terms entered by the user or the websites viewed….The XKeyscore program also allows an analyst to learn the IP addresses of every person who visits any website the analyst specifies.

But does this include U.S. persons, or only foreign nationals? This is where things get a little murky:

Under US law, the NSA is required to obtain an individualized Fisa warrant only if the target of their surveillance is a ‘US person’, though no such warrant is required for intercepting the communications of Americans with foreign targets. But XKeyscore provides the technological capability, if not the legal authority, to target even US persons for extensive electronic surveillance without a warrant provided that some identifying information, such as their email or IP address, is known to the analyst. ….The NSA documents assert that by 2008, 300 terrorists had been captured using intelligence from XKeyscore. ….While the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008 requires an individualized warrant for the targeting of US persons, NSA analysts are permitted to intercept the communications of such individuals without a warrant if they are in contact with one of the NSA’s foreign targets….An example is provided by one XKeyscore document showing an NSA target in Tehran communicating with people in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and New York.

Greenwald suggests that this validates Snowden’s statement in an earlier interview that “I, sitting at my desk, certainly had the authorities to wiretap anyone, from you, or your accountant, to a federal judge, to even the President if I had a personal email.” But that’s not clear at all. X-KEYSCORE appears to be a database search tool, not a real-time surveillance tool, nor does it appear to give anyone “authority” to wiretap a U.S. citizen. Rather, it provides access to tremendous volumes of foreign communications, which can then be searched by NSA analysts.

As Greenwald points out, there are known “compliance problems” with NSA’s surveillance programs, since communications by U.S. persons end up in this database if the other end of the conversation is overseas—and these communications can therefore end up on an analyst’s desktop. The NSA’s minimization procedures are supposed to prevent such “inadvertent” targeting of U.S. persons, but as Greenwald reported earlier, there are plenty of exceptions to this rule.

Rand Paul filed a class-action lawsuit Wednesday to halt the NSA ’ s phone records collection program and invited millions of Americans to sign up as co-plaintiffs with him , calling the case a chance to re-establish constitutional boundaries on privacy .
The Kentucky Republican , a potential presidential candidate in 2016 , said he doesn ’ t see Congress moving quickly to crack down on the National Security Agency ’ s snooping and the changes President Obama announced last month don ’ t go far enough . Instead , he said , Americans must turn to the courts .
“ We are filing suit against the president of the United States in defense of the Fourth Amendment , ” Mr. Paul said as he stood outside the federal courthouse in Washington , holding up cellphones as props . “ There ’ s a huge and growing swell of protest in this country of people who are outraged that their records would be taken without suspicion , without a judge ’ s warrant , and without individualization . This , we believe , will be a historic lawsuit . ”
Under the NSA program , the government collects and holds five years of phone metadata , including numbers , times and durations of almost all calls made in the U.S. , which can be searched without a warrant .
Federal judges in Washington and New York have issued competing decisions . One ruling called the program unconstitutional and the other upheld it .
Mr. Paul ’ s lawsuit is the latest challenge but probably will not be the decisive one , constitutional scholars said .
SEE ALSO : White House ’ s NSA snooping violates separation of powers , congressmen say
“ The reality is that Sen. Paul is late to this particular party , ” said Steve Vladeck , a professor at George Washington University . “ Separate challenges to the metadata program are already on appeal to the federal appeals courts in New York and Washington , and class actions tend to move far more slowly to begin with .
“ It seems likely that , by the time a federal judge is in a position to reach Sen. Paul ’ s claims on the merits , they will have been settled by the federal courts and/or Congress , ” Mr. Vladeck said .
All sides expect the issue to end up in front of the Supreme Court .
Former Virginia Attorney General Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II , who is acting as attorney for Mr. Paul and Freedomworks , a conservative group that is also part of the case , said they expect to file the first challenge to the NSA that gets certified as a class-action lawsuit .
The lawsuit names as defendants President Obama , Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper , NSA Director Keith B. Alexander , and FBI Director James Comey .
The Obama administration has maintained that the program is constitutional and legal . As evidence of that , officials point to repeated approval of the program by congressional intelligence committees and a foreign intelligence court . The administration also says the program is an important part of the nation ’ s effort to prevent another terrorist attack .
But other reviews , including panels appointed by Mr. Obama and Congress , have said the program violates Bill of Rights protections and , according to one of those reviews , violates a telecommunications law that prohibits phone companies from turning over bulk data to federal agencies .
Mr. Paul countered Wednesday that there hasn ’ t been any evidence that the phone program has prevented an attack . He said he respects the need for security but boundaries must be maintained .
“ I am not against the NSA , I am not against spying , I am not against looking at phone records , ” Mr. Paul said . “ I just want you to go to a judge , have a person ’ s name and individualize the warrant . That is what the Fourth Amendment says . ”
The collection of phone records started under the George W. Bush administration but did not come to light until last year when former government contractor Edward Snowden leaked details to the press .
Larry Klayman , a conservative activist , filed a pair of lawsuits against the Obama administration last summer . In December , he scored a victory when U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon ruled that the NSA must stop collecting and retaining the phone records of Mr. Klayman and his co-plaintiff .
Judge Leon stayed his order , though , pending an appeal from the Justice Department .
Soon afterward , a federal judge in New York ruled in favor of the NSA program , turning back a constitutional challenge from the American Civil Liberties Union .
Judges who sit on the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court have approved the program repeatedly , though they occasionally have added restrictions and issued warnings when they thought the government was overstepping its boundaries .
Since winning before Judge Leon , Mr. Klayman has filed another class-action lawsuit that is broader in scope than Mr. Paul ’ s case .
That lawsuit challenges the government ’ s data mining program known as Prism . It also challenges Section 215 of the Patriot Act , which grants the government the power to collect records from businesses .
Mr. Paul on Wednesday dismissed reporters ’ political questions , but the lawsuit and government snooping programs overall likely will be issues in the 2016 presidential race .
But Mr. Klayman said the politics showed in the way that complaint was written .
“ It is very peculiar in that the allegations seem to be watered down , ” he told The ███ . “ It is more of a political document . In any event , as I said , we are pleased finally that Paul is entering the fray . That is fine , but we would like them to accurately reflect that there is another class action out there that was filed much sooner than him .

In a recent case , a group of AT & T customers claimed that the N.S.A. ’ s tapping of the Internet violated the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches . This year , a federal judge dismissed key portions of the lawsuit after the Obama administration argued that public discussion of its telecom surveillance efforts would reveal state secrets , damaging national security .
The N.S.A . documents do not identify AT & T or other companies by name . Instead , they refer to corporate partnerships run by the agency ’ s Special Source Operations division using code names .

In a recent case, a group of AT&T customers claimed that the N.S.A.’s tapping of the Internet violated the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches. This year, a federal judge dismissed key portions of the lawsuit after the Obama administration argued that public discussion of its telecom surveillance efforts would reveal state secrets, damaging national security.

The N.S.A. documents do not identify AT&T or other companies by name. Instead, they refer to corporate partnerships run by the agency’s Special Source Operations division using code names. The division is responsible for more than 80 percent of the information the N.S.A. collects, one document states.

Fairview is one of its oldest programs. It began in 1985, the year after antitrust regulators broke up the Ma Bell telephone monopoly and its long-distance division became AT&T Communications. An analysis of the Fairview documents by The Times and ProPublica reveals a constellation of evidence that points to AT&T as that program’s partner. Several former intelligence officials confirmed that finding.
