What to do

Given that their aim amounts to domestic terrorism, any strategy to get them out of the building must, then, take into account a number of federal concerns and priorities.

Violence should be avoided at all costs. Do not turn these men into martyrs or heroes by excessive force or unnecessary violence. And, in the process of resolving the standoff, teach them (and others) a lesson or two.

How do the feds do that?

First, time is on their side. No question about that. In the absence of an imminent threat to children, bystanders or captives, the federal response should be akin to, ""We got all day. And night. And another day. And are you getting hungry? Possibly thirsty? Bored? Are you wondering why you are here in the first place? We got all day. And another one after that.""

If a federal agent or public safety official is harmed or killed during any siege, the federal authorities should remind those inside that they will all be accomplices to first-degree murder. Over time, Bundy may find it difficult to keep his troops unified. Again, time is on the federal authorities' side.

Rule of law is paramount

Finally, while the presence of federal troops might make the situation more tense than it already is, the Obama administration needs to make a statement with this organization and future domestic terrorists.

Various federal authorities are now in charge, but the administration should be ready to mobilize federal military support should they need it, if only for the long haul. And to make an important point that the rule of law is paramount in a civil, democratic society.

Local law enforcement officials, in such an isolated area of Oregon, are likely to know some of these men and could let their perspective be colored by their relationships, either to be too lenient or to want to vigorously uphold the law against such flagrant actions. There are risks if too much emotion is allowed to seep into the decision-making process.

Liberty is rarely lost overnight. The wall of tyranny often begins with benign building blocks of safety — each one lying on top of a predecessor — eventually collectively constituting an impediment to the exercise of free choices by free people, often not even recognized until it is too late.

Here is the back story.

In the pre-Revolutionary era, British courts in London secretly issued general warrants to British government agents in America. The warrants were not based on any probable cause of crime or individual articulable suspicion; they did not name the person or thing to be seized or identify the place to be searched. They authorized agents to search where they wished and seize what they found.

The use of general warrants was so offensive to our Colonial ancestors that it whipped up more serious opposition to British rule and support for the revolutionaries than the ""no taxation without representation"" argument did. And when it came time for Americans to write the Constitution, they prohibited general warrants in the Fourth Amendment, the whole purpose of which was to guarantee the right to be left alone by forcing the government to focus on bad guys and prohibit it from engaging in fishing expeditions. But the fishing expeditions would come.

In 1978, Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which was intended to rein in the government spying on Americans that had been unleashed by the Nixon administration. FISA established a secret court and permitted it to issue warrants authorizing spying on agents of foreign governments when physically present in the United States.

People born in foreign countries who are here for benevolent or benign or even evil purposes have the same constitutional protections as those of us born here. That's because the critical parts of the Constitution that insulate human freedom from the government's reach protect ""persons,"" not just citizens. But FISA ignored that.

And FISA was easy for the government to justify. It was a pullback from Richard Nixon's lawlessness. It required the feds to seek a warrant from federal judges. The targets were not Americans. Never mind, the argument went, that FISA has no requirement of showing any probable cause of crime or even articulable suspicion on the part of the foreign target; this will keep us safe. Besides, the government insisted, it can't be used against Americans.

That argument was bought by presidents, members of Congress and nearly all federal courts that examined it. We don't know whether the authors of this scheme really wanted federal spies to be able to spy on anyone at will, but that is where we are today. Through secret courts whose judges cannot keep records of their own decisions and secret permissions by select committees of Congress whose members cannot tell their constituents or other members of Congress what they have learned in secret, FISA has morphed so as to authorize spying down a slippery slope of targets, from foreign agents to all foreigners to anyone who communicates with foreigners to anyone capable of communicating with them.

The British system that arguably impelled our secession in 1776 is now here on steroids.

general_news,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/9/22/12893444/clinton-foundation-effectiveness,The key question on the Clinton Foundation is whether it saved lives. The answer is clearly yes.,2016-09-22,Dylan Matthews,"Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign and her allies have so far offered a simple defense of the Clinton Foundation — which Donald Trump , Republicans , some left-wing critics , and much of the press have characterized as a giant pay-for-play scam that the wealthy and powerful used to gain access to the Clintons .
The Clintonites assert there ’ s simply no evidence of a quid pro quo , no evidence of favors being given by Clinton to foundation donors . On the contrary , according to reporting thus far , the evidence that exists is of such favors being requested and denied . When foundation staffer Doug Band tried to use his ties to Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin to get a diplomatic passport for himself , he was rebuffed . When he tried to get a visa for a British soccer player , Abedin said the request made her nervous , and Band backed off .
`` The fact remains that Hillary Clinton never took action as Secretary of State because of donations to the Clinton Foundation , '' campaign spokesperson Josh Schwerin told the Washington Post .
`` Hillary Clinton does n't have a conflict of interest with charitable work , '' campaign manager Robby Mook asserted on MSNBC ’ s Morning Joe . `` That 's all it is . ''
But some Clinton surrogates have tried a different approach : focusing on what the foundation does , rather than what it didn ’ t do . In August , Clinton loyalist James Carville told CNN ’ s Anderson Cooper that if the press succeeds in getting the foundation shut down , `` There will be people that are going to die because of this . ''
`` The foundation negotiated drugs prices to reduce malaria drug prices by 89 percent , '' Carville said . `` The Clinton Foundation was taking no money for the Clintons , raising money from rich people and giving it to poor people . … All of the people that helped shut it down will say , some people , a million people , had to die , but we had to prove a point . ''
`` People will die '' if @ ClintonFdn is shut down . - @ JamesCarville touts the achievements of the Clinton Foundation https : //t.co/avxJcG6hWx — Anderson Cooper 360° ( @ AC360 ) August 23 , 2016
Carville ’ s argument raises the question we should be asking about the Clinton Foundation : Is it a good charity ? If the Clinton Foundation really is saving millions of lives , then that ’ s the story — not what favors Band asked for , but didn ’ t receive , from Huma Abedin . But if the Clinton Foundation was a poorly run vanity project where Bill Clinton traded on his celebrity while merely pretending to help the needy , then that ’ s a genuine scandal given the billions of dollars that passed through its coffers .
Effective philanthropy is something I ’ ve spent a lot of time thinking about and reporting on , and so that ’ s the question I set out to answer : Does the Clinton Foundation do worthwhile charitable work ?
My starting point , to be honest , was skepticism . Most elite charitable giving is terrible , more a vehicle for wealthy donors ’ self-aggrandizement than actual change . Donors tend to select causes that are trendy and thus oversaturated with funders as is , or to give to famous organizations regardless of merit . Even when they pick a good cause , like global poverty , screw-ups are common .
Take the PlayPump , a charity fad from the mid-2000s in which merry-go-rounds were attached to water pumps in African villages . The goal was to make it easier to access clean water . The project was catnip to clever design–obsessed philanthropists . Donors loved watching cheerful kids play their way to cleaner water . But when the cameras left , it turned out children were being forced to toil on the playground for hours on end .
I thought it was likely the Clinton Foundation had gotten behind a lot of PlayPump-like projects — feel-good , sound-great ideas that attracted Clinton ’ s wealthy and well-known friends but didn ’ t really have much of a measurable impact the world .
But I was wrong . After reviewing foundation documents and talking to numerous people in the philanthropy and global health sectors familiar with its work , I ’ ve come to the conclusion that the Clinton Foundation is a real charitable enterprise that did enormous good . Its projects are of varying effectiveness , but its work is supported by credible , discriminating funders , and the foundation has least one huge accomplishment under its belt — an HIV/AIDS program that saved an untold number of lives .
And — perhaps uncomfortably for liberals and conservatives alike — it is exactly the kind of unsavory-seeming glad-handing and melding of business and politics for which Bill and Hillary Clinton have taken years of criticism that led to its greatest success .
The Clinton administration ’ s failures set the stage for the foundation ’ s breakthrough win
The Clinton Foundation ’ s biggest victory was born of one of the Clinton administration ’ s greatest failings .
The AIDS epidemic had been going on for more than a decade when Bill Clinton took office . During his eight years in the White House , HIV/AIDS went from a death sentence to a manageable condition that patients could live with for decades — at least in rich countries like the US .
The game changer was an approach known as highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) , introduced in 1996 . Antiretrovirals ( a category of drugs that target retroviruses , the type of virus that includes HIV ) had been used against HIV since the drug AZT was approved as a treatment in 1987 . But HAART combines three antiretrovirals into a `` triple cocktail , '' creating multiple obstacles for the virus and preventing it from replicating far more effectively than a single drug alone could .
At the same time HAART was revolutionizing HIV/AIDS treatment in the US , the AIDS epidemic began to tear through developing countries , particularly the sub-Saharan region of Africa . The tone of press coverage in the late ’ 90s and early ’ 00s suggested the whole continent was on the verge of a Black Death–scale catastrophe . A Newsweek cover story in January 2000 anticipated `` 10 million AIDS orphans . '' The writer , Tom Masland , elaborated : `` Before the current epidemic , the perennial cataclysms of war and famine orphaned 2 percent of the region 's children ; AIDS makes that figure look benign . ''
NGO heads were also prepared for apocalypse . The World Bank vice president for Africa , Callisto Madavo , told the Village Voice 's Mark Schoofs in 1999 that in the worst-hit African countries , life expectancy `` will soon be 17 years shorter because of AIDS — 47 years instead of 64 … [ HIV ] is quite literally robbing Africa of a quarter of our lives . ''
Schoofs went further : `` Quite simply , AIDS is on track to dwarf every catastrophe in Africa 's recorded history . '' Schoofs , who won a Pulitzer for his reporting on the epidemic , noted that the three-drug therapy available in the US could save millions of lives if deployed to Africa , but despaired at the high cost .
`` These regimens must be taken for years , probably for life , and they can cost more than $ 10,000 per patient per year , '' he noted . `` Even at discounted prices , the annual cost of putting every African with HIV on triple combination therapy would exceed $ 150 billion , so the world is letting a leading infectious killer for which treatment exists mow down millions . ''
The main reason HIV drugs were so expensive was that they were patented and pharmaceutical companies set the prices high ; cheap , generic competitors were banned . There was a catch , however : Not every country respected US and European patent law .
India had , for decades , banned patents on pharmaceutical chemicals , and the Indian generics company Cipla had been reverse-engineering AIDS drugs since 1992 . The company had a triple-cocktail option soon after it was introduced in the West . At the time , India had signed on to TRIPS , an agreement of the World Trade Organization that obligated signatories to obey US-style intellectual property law , but because of India ’ s relative poverty , the country was allowed to defer implementation of the agreement until 2005 . That gave generics companies a decade to become leaders in supplying cheap HIV drugs .
In 1997 , South Africa , facing HIV infection rates of close to 20 percent , decided to start taking advantage of the lower prices from Cipla and other Indian generics companies . The country passed a law seeking to access generics through two policies : first , parallel importation , which let it import generics from countries like India where they might be cheaper , and second , compulsory licensing , which lets generics manufacturers produce patented drugs and compensates the patent holder for the IP violation at a dramatically reduced rate .
Pharmaceutical companies went ballistic — and the Clinton administration backed them up . Thirty-nine drug companies sued South Africa to block the new policy . The US Trade Representative put South Africa on a `` watch list '' of intellectual property violators and withheld normal trade benefits for a number of South African products . Al Gore , the administration ’ s leading voice on South Africa , told then-President Nelson Mandela that the US would not allow the legislation to go forward . It probably did n't hurt pharma 's cause that the White House deputy and then full chief of staff at the time was John Podesta , whose brother Tony was the industry 's top lobbyist in DC .
Effectively , Clinton was using the full weight of the US government to make it harder for HIV patients in South Africa to get treatment even though it was suffering sky-high infection rates .
This prompted an international backlash from AIDS activists who were horrified to watch the US government fight drug affordability in a poor country hit hard by the epidemic . Gore , who was in the middle of running for president , was an important target . Protesters repeatedly interrupted rallies in 1999 by chanting , `` Gore ’ s greed kills ! '' The activist campaign in turn spurred members of the Congressional Black Caucus like Reps. Jesse Jackson Jr. and James Clyburn to put pressure on the White House to reverse course .
And so Clinton flip-flopped under pressure . In September 1999 , the US Trade Representative and the South African government announced that the fight was resolved and the US would stop pressuring South Africa on the matter ; it would be free to attempt to get generic drugs without penalties from US trade officials .
President Clinton issued an executive order in May 2000 stating , `` The United States shall not seek , through negotiation or otherwise , the revocation or revision of any intellectual property law or policy of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country [ … ] that regulates HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals or medical technologies . '' Later , during the Bush administration , this policy went global . At its 2001 Doha meeting , the WTO agreed to delay implementation of TRIPS in poor countries and give countries more flexibility to use compulsory licensing and other methods to bring down prices of drugs needed to address emergencies like the AIDS epidemic .
This was the Bill Clinton record on HIV/AIDS as president : years of standing behind drug companies and offering little US aid in the face of the crisis , followed by a late-breaking flip-flop . It was a moral stain on his administration .
Just as Clinton was leaving office , something remarkable began to happen to the price of HIV/AIDS drugs : They started to fall . A lot .
In 2000 , the cost of the cheapest brand-name three-drug combo was about $ 10,439 per year — manageable for US insurers but simply untenable in poor countries . A year later , the cheapest brand-name combo was running about $ 727 a year . And then it just kept falling further :
This price drop had two initial sources , according to Tamara Mann Tweel , a Columbia researcher who ’ s studied it in depth .
First , pharmaceutical companies , facing intense public relations pressure , began to offer huge discounts for pilot projects in poor countries . This was not an act of altruism — the companies still turned a small profit on the sales and managed to boost their corporate reputations .
Second , activists like Jamie Love of the Consumer Project on Technology ( now known as Knowledge Ecology International ) pushed for and won a change in WTO rules that let generic drugs be sold more broadly . They attempted to negotiate down prices by attempting to match generics manufacturers with NGO funders who could buy in bulk .
By 2000 , Cipla was offering a combination one-pill therapy containing all the drugs in the cocktail . But it did n't have sufficient demand . Love brokered a deal between Cipla CEO Yusuf Hamied and Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ) wherein Cipla would provide the drugs in bulk — for only $ 350 a year per person , or about $ 1 a day . This was a dramatic reduction even from generic prices , but Cipla would still be able to turn a profit provided MSF paid in cash and took care of distribution .
Once the $ 1-a-day offer demonstrated that mass purchases of AIDS drugs could be done affordably , institutions capable of financing bigger buys than MSF sprouted up . One was the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria , a public-private partnership formed in 2002 and funded by governments like the US and foundations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation . Another was the US President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) , a massive expansion of AIDS funding pushed by George W. Bush 's administration . Later on came UNITAID , a project of the governments of Brazil , Chile , France , Norway , and UK that funds global health measures through a tax on airline tickets .
Those institutions provided the money necessary to purchase and distribute vast quantities of generics , taking advantage of the price reductions that activists like Love had achieved .
It ’ s here — after the price drop to $ 350 , and after the extensive work of activists who once opposed his administration — that Bill Clinton enters the picture .
In 2002 , only a year after leaving office , Clinton decided to make reducing the cost of HIV/AIDS drugs his first project at the Clinton Foundation . He formed the Clinton Health Access Initiative ( CHAI ) , a division of the foundation that housed the group ’ s work on public health , and tapped his old Rhodes Scholar buddy Ira Magaziner ( who had become famous , or infamous , for his role in the failed Clinton health reform push of 1993- ’ 94 ) to run the operation .
Specialists in the field were understandably skeptical of a president who ’ d failed to tackle the epidemic when he wielded the power of the presidency suddenly adopting the cause . Former Harvard School of Public Health dean Howard Hiatt asked Clinton at a meeting at the foundation in 2002 why he and other attendees should expect `` you ’ ll be able to accomplish now what you didn ’ t undertake in your presidency — an attack on this plague ? ''
But Magaziner and CHAI had a plan — one that relied on Clinton ’ s unique celebrity and ability to bring foreign leaders and pharmaceutical CEOs to the table in the way an ordinary civilian couldn ’ t . This was the whole idea behind the Clinton Foundation . At the time , Clinton himself wasn ’ t wealthy enough to influence things solely as a funder . But what he lacked in money he made up for in an extensive Rolodex and unparalleled glad-handing skills . And in HIV/AIDS drugs , he thought he ’ d found a problem that those resources could help solve .
The HIV/AIDS drug market , CHAI argued , was still not functioning correctly . PEPFAR and the Global Fund were still getting set up , and the former was initially required to pay for brand-name drugs . CHAI ’ s theory was that prices could be brought down still further by banding developing countries together and having them act as a purchasing unit that could bargain with generics manufacturers . Initially they tried to do this with US and European drug companies , and met with little success , and so moved on to Indian and South African generics companies .
CHAI ’ s basic approach was to ask drug companies to accept smaller margins in exchange for higher volumes . `` In essence , CHAI negotiations helped transform the business model for the ARV industry , '' political scientists Ethan Kapstein and Joshua Busby write in their history of the global AIDS activist movement , AIDS Drugs for All . Previously , even with prices as low as $ 350 , companies like Cipla and its competitor Ranbaxy were selling at relatively low volumes but with healthy margins . The goal of CHAI was to transform the sector into a lower-margin , higher-volume industry .
In an interview with the Atlantic ’ s Jonathan Rauch , Bill Clinton put the change this way : `` What we tried to do was to get them to go from what I call a ‘ jewelry-store model ’ to a ‘ grocery-store model ’ —from a high-profit , low-volume , uncertain-payment business to a low-margin , high-volume , certain-payment business . ''
Many of these developing country governments were led by politicians with whom Bill Clinton had personal relationships from his time as president . `` My sources at CHAI often remarked that CHAI ’ s ability to work with governments and their health ministries led to the most sustainable form of change , '' Mann Tweel writes . `` It made governments commit to purchasing the drugs while helping them build the infrastructure for sustainable treatment . ''
One of the most striking features of the first deal CHAI cut was the inclusion of South Africa as one of the bargaining nations . For years , South African President Thabo Mbeki had stalled on providing access to HIV drugs because he subscribed to discredited pseudoscience alleging that HIV doesn ’ t cause AIDS .
Clinton appears to have personally played a role in getting Mbeki , whom he got to know when their presidencies overlapped in Clinton ’ s last years in office , and his government to join the price negotiations . In July 2003 , Clinton attended Mandela 's 85th birthday party in Johannesburg , and during the dinner he pulled Mbeki away to discuss his AIDS response . Per New York magazine ’ s Jennifer Senior :
Two years ago , at Nelson Mandela ’ s 85th-birthday party — a 1,600-person extravaganza whose guest list included everyone from Bono to F. W. de Klerk — Clinton and Thabo Mbeki , the current president of South Africa , got up in the middle of the festivities , trailed by [ CHAI president Ira ] Magaziner . `` They just … walked out , '' recalls Richard Holbrooke , the former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. `` And went into a private room . '' They returned half an hour later . It was after that meeting that Mbeki , famously reluctant to even acknowledge that HIV caused AIDS , agreed to allow the Clinton Foundation to assist his government in preparing an AIDS-treatment plan . ( It was adopted by the Cabinet the following November . )
The victory was hardly complete ; Mbeki later reversed himself and rejected a team Clinton sent in 2004 . Clinton soldiered on , and CHAI eventually did build a South Africa operation , but Mbeki kept CHAI ’ s operations from growing too much . The group ’ s involvement in the country grew dramatically after Jacob Zuma succeeded Mbeki in 2009 .
`` The health ministry had never fully welcomed CHAI , '' journalist Joe Conason concedes in Man of the World , his very positive account of Clinton 's post-presidency . `` By 2009 , only 700,000 people were on treatment there . '' But Clinton ’ s glad-handing appears to have meaningfully moved the needle at least somewhat , turning one of the most intransigent opponents of action on HIV/AIDS in Africa into an occasional , if unreliable , ally .
Clinton ’ s personal touch was also influential in getting buy-in from generics manufacturers . When CHAI was getting started , Conason reports , Clinton sent personal letters to generics company CEOs in India explaining his plan and urging them to join the initiative . His track record as president helped gain their trust : `` No doubt his restoration of good diplomatic relations with India as president and subsequent work with Indian American business moguls on disaster relief were helpful , '' Conason notes .
One obvious question this raises is whether the price drop could ’ ve happened without the explicit bargaining CHAI did . If these developing countries were going to start putting in orders anyway , that increase in demand should ’ ve prompted generics companies to produce more , to start benefiting from economics of scale , and to then cut prices to maintain an edge over one another . In a properly functioning market , that ’ s what would have happened .
The argument CHAI staffers make is that the international generics market at that time was poorly functioning , and even if it could have organized itself better in time , that delay would ’ ve meant thousands , if not millions , of HIV-positive people going untreated . Instead , they got treatment because CHAI brokered cheaper prices sooner .
Analysts across the board tend to give CHAI and the Clinton Foundation credit for its role in helping rationalize the market . `` CHAI successfully intervened in a transforming market , '' Mann Tweel concludes . Busby , the political scientist , tells me his and Kapstein ’ s research convinced them that `` CHAI was essential for organizing the market for AIDS drugs in the early days both on the demand side and the producer side . ''
Love , the activist who was key to the generics-based price drop , is more skeptical , saying , `` CHAI and others have often distorted view of the CHAI and drug company role in lowering drug prices . '' But all the same , he grants that CHAI `` helped people do some more coordinated procurement '' and `` has played an important role in the rollout and scaling of treatment of HIV/AIDS in developing countries . ''
This is reflected in the actual pricing data . From 2002 to 2007 , purchasers bought drugs both at CHAI-negotiated prices and through non-CHAI channels . One study found that prices for CHAI drugs during that period were 6 to 36 percent lower . That ’ s a strong indication that CHAI pushed prices below where they would ’ ve been had it never existed .
And crucially , CHAI ’ s victory appeared to hinge strongly on the very dynamics that make people uncomfortable about the Clinton Foundation . The deals made required buy-in from developing governments . The person tasked with getting that buy-in was a former US president with existing relationships with many of those people . Bill Clinton essentially used his chumminess with foreign politicians and pharmaceutical executives , the kind of thing about the Clinton Global Initiative that earns suspicious news coverage , to enlist their help in a scheme to expand access to HIV/AIDS drugs .
Larry Chang , an associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins who has worked on global HIV/AIDS response for the past two decades , singles out `` the convening power of Clinton '' as a key factor in getting the price reduction done . As Rauch put it in the Atlantic , `` It seems unlikely that anyone but a Clintonesque political celebrity could have persuaded disparate , disorganized AIDS-drug makers and governments to join hands . ''
The foundation is still doing important work in global health
The Clinton Foundation ’ s role in the price drop is undoubtedly its biggest single victory . Now that that ’ s finished , would we really miss the foundation that much ?
Global health researchers seem to think we would . It ’ s stayed active on HIV/AIDS and other infectious disease issues , and has notched similar wins . After the price drops , it hired scientists and built up technical capacity to help develop cost-saving alterations to drug formulae . In 2011 , CHAI , with funding from the Gates Foundation and the UK government , and in collaboration with Howard University , developed a new way to synthesize the antiretroviral tenofovir , which lowered production costs by 20 percent .
It has also played a role in the direct distribution of ARVs . Laura Seay , a political scientist at Colby College who was doing dissertation research in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the mid-2000s , recalls the Clinton Foundation as one of the only NGOs willing to provide AIDS treatment in the country , given ongoing violence . In conjunction with local partners and the group Global Strategies , she says , `` The Clinton Foundation decided to provide the first pediatric AIDS treatment in the region . ''
`` I found it really powerful work . You have to remember at that time , across the border in Rwanda or Uganda , if you had HIV , it wasn ’ t hopeless , like it had been five or six years before , '' she explains . `` The Clinton Foundation negotiated the prices down and got the generic access that was needed to extend that to millions of people but that had not reached into places that were dangerous and where there was a risk of rebels coming in . But they decided to take the risk . ''
`` I saw kids who in the space of two years went from skin and bones to being healthy and thriving children who could go to school and have a good life , '' she continues . `` It was because of the Clinton Foundation , and because they weren ’ t afraid to give it a try . ''
For funding rollout efforts like this , Bill Clinton ’ s personal charm again played a role . In 2003 , Schoofs reported that Clinton `` secured partial funding by personally lobbying leaders of rich nations , such as Ireland and Canada . '' Clinton told Schoofs , `` Usually I just call the prime minister or the president , and tell them what we 're doing and ask them to have somebody look at it . And I always tell them that even though we 're friends they do n't have to do this for me — do n't do it unless they think it 's a good thing . But I think it 's the best thing going in the world in AIDS care . ''
Clinton ’ s personal ties also helped created a major funding stream for HIV/AIDS programs . In AIDS Drugs for All , Kapstein and Busby note that UNITAID was originally meant as a legacy project for French President Jacques Chirac . He wanted to use airline levies to fund something related to international development , but he was n't sure what .
The French foreign minister , Philippe Douste-Blazy , `` stumbled on '' a destination for the money `` after meeting with Bill Clinton in 2005 , '' Kapstein and Busby write . `` Clinton told him he should work on HIV/AIDS and said , 'You have to say to the drug companies , I 'm giving you money , not for one year but for several years , for example , three hundred million dollars per year for five years . How much do you agree to decrease the price ? ' ''
CHAI continues to play a price-negotiation role , both for drugs targeting other diseases ( it has achieved similar deals on malaria medication and for a variety of vaccines ) and on HIV/AIDS . Chang , the Johns Hopkins doctor , notes that CHAI has been active in trying to lower the price of viral load testing , an important diagnostic tool for seeing if patients are responding well to ARV treatment .
Perhaps the best argument for the value of CHAI ’ s work comes from its donors . The Gates Foundation , which is known for rigor in grant determinations , gave CHAI and other Clinton Foundation initiatives more than $ 67 million in 2015 alone . UNITAID has donated over $ 25 million . These are not groups known for frivolously throwing money around . They ’ re serious players in a variety of global health domains , which have decided to pour meaningful funds into the Clinton Foundation .
The Foundation ’ s non-health activities are smaller in scale , with some notable failures
While global health has been the crown jewel of the Clinton Foundation — so much so that CHAI was eventually spun off to become its own separate , but connected , group in 2010 — the foundation has a variety of other projects , tackling causes ranging from obesity prevention and opioid addiction in the United States to climate mitigation and adaptation to a variety of economic development efforts in Haiti . The foundation ’ s cause selection is notable in its heavy emphasis on global development , a relatively neglected area by many foundations , which tend to be more US-focused .
But these activities make up a relatively small share of the foundation ’ s work in pure monetary terms . In 2014 , fully 57.3 percent — some $ 143 million — of the Clinton Foundation 's spending went to the Clinton Health Access Initiative ; that ’ s nearly two-thirds of all non-administrative and fundraising spending . Another $ 23 million went to the Clinton Global Initiative events , and another $ 13 million after that to the Clinton Presidential Center , Clinton 's presidential library in Arkansas .
The Clinton Climate Initiative accounted for only 3.3 percent of the foundation 's expenses ; the Clinton Health Matters Initiative , its US-based health program , only 1.5 percent . Perhaps because they are funded by a relatively small slice of the foundation ’ s revenue , which is then itself spread thin across a variety of distinct projects , these endeavors haven ’ t yielded the high-profile victories that CHAI has .
But there has been one high-profile failure : the foundation ’ s work in Haiti following the country ’ s devastating 2010 earthquake . Jonathan Katz , a veteran Haiti reporter who has done excellent coverage on the foundation ’ s programs there , argues , `` The Clintons made the same mistake that has been made for generations . Though striking a populist pose , in practice they were attracted to power in Haiti , which meant making alliances and friendships within the Haitian elite . ''
That led to projects like luxury hotels that appeared to help foreign investors more than average Haitians . It also led to the Clinton effort ’ s most high-profile failure : the $ 300 million Caracol Industrial Park , an effort to build a center for garment exports in the north of Haiti . The project promised 100,000 jobs , including 60,000 within five years of its opening , many through its primary tenant , the South Korean clothing manufacturer Sae-A . As of last spring , fewer than 5,500 people were employed at Caracol .
`` That comes out to roughly $ 55,000 in investment per job created so far , '' Katz writes . `` Or , to put it another way , about 30 times more per job than the average Sae-A worker makes per year . '' And the focus on Caracol in the north distracted from the task of rebuilding Port-au-Prince , the capital that was hit particularly hard by the quake .
The failure there is tragic . But the Clinton Foundation ’ s failed Haiti development project certainly wasn ’ t the country ’ s first , and it ’ s likely not to be its last .
In light of the Clinton Foundation and CHAI 's accomplishments , it 's surreal to read the way the organization is covered , not just in anti-Clinton press outlets but in mainstream ones .
The New York Times ’ s Eric Lichtblau frets over `` new questions about whether the charitable foundation worked to reward its donors with access and influence at the State Department . '' The Wall Street Journal ’ s Peter Nicholas and James Grimaldi darkly warn , `` Hillary Clinton as secretary of state attended high-profile events and functions where donors to her family ’ s charitable foundation were in attendance , calendar records show . '' The Associated Press ’ s Stephen Braun and Eileen Sullivan , in a deeply flawed report fretting over Clinton ’ s record of meeting with prominent development economists and NGO leaders who also donated to the foundation , warn , `` [ A ] Clinton administration would have to take careful steps to ensure that past foundation donors would not have the same access as she allowed at the State Department . ''
Such stories have prompted opponents , from Trump to Karl Rove , to urge the Clinton Foundation to `` shut down '' already .
This debate has become representative of how the Clinton Foundation is covered more broadly . The value of the organization is almost entirely divorced from actual charitable programming . Stories about the foundation don ’ t mention what the money that allegedly bought this access was spent on . They don ’ t distinguish between giving to the Clintons , personally , and giving to their charitable organization .
Meanwhile , Hillary Clinton ’ s opponent runs a foundation that is very clearly a scam , which used tax-exempt funds to purchase an autographed Tim Tebow helmet and a giant portrait of Donald Trump .
The media has botched this story . The amount of ink spilled on as-yet-unsubstantiated insinuations that the Clintons sold access through their foundation , as opposed to the foundation ’ s actual lifesaving work in public health , is ludicrous .
There is little to no evidence that anyone received meaningful favors from the Clintons in exchange for donating to the foundation . There is definitely no evidence that Hillary Clinton altered her policies as secretary of state in reaction to donations . There ’ s no evidence that the Clintons or their foundation engaged in some of the more egregious activities of Trump ’ s foundation , like donating to a state attorney general to deter her from an investigation into Trump ’ s activities , or giving to a nonprofit to fund a lawsuit against another state AG who did opt to investigate , or even paying off the legal bills of his for-profit businesses .
But there is considerable evidence that the Clinton Foundation has saved millions of lives . And there ’ s evidence that Bill Clinton ’ s work with the group would make him more useful as first spouse . Presidents rely heavily on special envoys tasked with making deals to resolve prisoner disputes , facilitate peace processes , and the like . Clinton ’ s time with the foundation exhibited the exact set of skills necessary for a role like that . His presence could greatly expand the diplomatic bandwidth of his wife ’ s administration .
The fact that Hillary Clinton ’ s association with a group , and a husband , with that track record has become a liability rather than an asset is a deep indictment of how skewed the press ’ s priorities in covering this election have become .","Hillary Clinton’s campaign and her allies have so far offered a simple defense of the Clinton Foundation — which Donald Trump, Republicans, some left-wing critics, and much of the press have characterized as a giant pay-for-play scam that the wealthy and powerful used to gain access to the Clintons.

The Clintonites assert there’s simply no evidence of a quid pro quo, no evidence of favors being given by Clinton to foundation donors. On the contrary, according to reporting thus far, the evidence that exists is of such favors being requested and denied. When foundation staffer Doug Band tried to use his ties to Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin to get a diplomatic passport for himself, he was rebuffed. When he tried to get a visa for a British soccer player, Abedin said the request made her nervous, and Band backed off.

""The fact remains that Hillary Clinton never took action as Secretary of State because of donations to the Clinton Foundation,"" campaign spokesperson Josh Schwerin told the Washington Post.

""Hillary Clinton doesn't have a conflict of interest with charitable work,"" campaign manager Robby Mook asserted on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. ""That's all it is.""

But some Clinton surrogates have tried a different approach: focusing on what the foundation does, rather than what it didn’t do. In August, Clinton loyalist James Carville told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that if the press succeeds in getting the foundation shut down, ""There will be people that are going to die because of this.""

""The foundation negotiated drugs prices to reduce malaria drug prices by 89 percent,"" Carville said. ""The Clinton Foundation was taking no money for the Clintons, raising money from rich people and giving it to poor people. … All of the people that helped shut it down will say, some people, a million people, had to die, but we had to prove a point.""

""People will die"" if @ClintonFdn is shut down. - @JamesCarville touts the achievements of the Clinton Foundation https://t.co/avxJcG6hWx — Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) August 23, 2016

Carville’s argument raises the question we should be asking about the Clinton Foundation: Is it a good charity? If the Clinton Foundation really is saving millions of lives, then that’s the story — not what favors Band asked for, but didn’t receive, from Huma Abedin. But if the Clinton Foundation was a poorly run vanity project where Bill Clinton traded on his celebrity while merely pretending to help the needy, then that’s a genuine scandal given the billions of dollars that passed through its coffers.

Effective philanthropy is something I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about and reporting on, and so that’s the question I set out to answer: Does the Clinton Foundation do worthwhile charitable work?

My starting point, to be honest, was skepticism. Most elite charitable giving is terrible, more a vehicle for wealthy donors’ self-aggrandizement than actual change. Donors tend to select causes that are trendy and thus oversaturated with funders as is, or to give to famous organizations regardless of merit. Even when they pick a good cause, like global poverty, screw-ups are common.

Take the PlayPump, a charity fad from the mid-2000s in which merry-go-rounds were attached to water pumps in African villages. The goal was to make it easier to access clean water. The project was catnip to clever design–obsessed philanthropists. Donors loved watching cheerful kids play their way to cleaner water. But when the cameras left, it turned out children were being forced to toil on the playground for hours on end.

I thought it was likely the Clinton Foundation had gotten behind a lot of PlayPump-like projects — feel-good, sound-great ideas that attracted Clinton’s wealthy and well-known friends but didn’t really have much of a measurable impact the world.

But I was wrong. After reviewing foundation documents and talking to numerous people in the philanthropy and global health sectors familiar with its work, I’ve come to the conclusion that the Clinton Foundation is a real charitable enterprise that did enormous good. Its projects are of varying effectiveness, but its work is supported by credible, discriminating funders, and the foundation has least one huge accomplishment under its belt — an HIV/AIDS program that saved an untold number of lives.

And — perhaps uncomfortably for liberals and conservatives alike — it is exactly the kind of unsavory-seeming glad-handing and melding of business and politics for which Bill and Hillary Clinton have taken years of criticism that led to its greatest success.

The Clinton administration’s failures set the stage for the foundation’s breakthrough win

The Clinton Foundation’s biggest victory was born of one of the Clinton administration’s greatest failings.

The AIDS epidemic had been going on for more than a decade when Bill Clinton took office. During his eight years in the White House, HIV/AIDS went from a death sentence to a manageable condition that patients could live with for decades — at least in rich countries like the US.

The game changer was an approach known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), introduced in 1996. Antiretrovirals (a category of drugs that target retroviruses, the type of virus that includes HIV) had been used against HIV since the drug AZT was approved as a treatment in 1987. But HAART combines three antiretrovirals into a ""triple cocktail,"" creating multiple obstacles for the virus and preventing it from replicating far more effectively than a single drug alone could.

At the same time HAART was revolutionizing HIV/AIDS treatment in the US, the AIDS epidemic began to tear through developing countries, particularly the sub-Saharan region of Africa. The tone of press coverage in the late ’90s and early ’00s suggested the whole continent was on the verge of a Black Death–scale catastrophe. A Newsweek cover story in January 2000 anticipated ""10 million AIDS orphans."" The writer, Tom Masland, elaborated: ""Before the current epidemic, the perennial cataclysms of war and famine orphaned 2 percent of the region's children; AIDS makes that figure look benign.""

NGO heads were also prepared for apocalypse. The World Bank vice president for Africa, Callisto Madavo, told the Village Voice's Mark Schoofs in 1999 that in the worst-hit African countries, life expectancy ""will soon be 17 years shorter because of AIDS — 47 years instead of 64 … [HIV] is quite literally robbing Africa of a quarter of our lives.""

Schoofs went further: ""Quite simply, AIDS is on track to dwarf every catastrophe in Africa's recorded history."" Schoofs, who won a Pulitzer for his reporting on the epidemic, noted that the three-drug therapy available in the US could save millions of lives if deployed to Africa, but despaired at the high cost.

""These regimens must be taken for years, probably for life, and they can cost more than $10,000 per patient per year,"" he noted. ""Even at discounted prices, the annual cost of putting every African with HIV on triple combination therapy would exceed $150 billion, so the world is letting a leading infectious killer for which treatment exists mow down millions.""

The main reason HIV drugs were so expensive was that they were patented and pharmaceutical companies set the prices high; cheap, generic competitors were banned. There was a catch, however: Not every country respected US and European patent law.

India had, for decades, banned patents on pharmaceutical chemicals, and the Indian generics company Cipla had been reverse-engineering AIDS drugs since 1992. The company had a triple-cocktail option soon after it was introduced in the West. At the time, India had signed on to TRIPS, an agreement of the World Trade Organization that obligated signatories to obey US-style intellectual property law, but because of India’s relative poverty, the country was allowed to defer implementation of the agreement until 2005. That gave generics companies a decade to become leaders in supplying cheap HIV drugs.

In 1997, South Africa, facing HIV infection rates of close to 20 percent, decided to start taking advantage of the lower prices from Cipla and other Indian generics companies. The country passed a law seeking to access generics through two policies: first, parallel importation, which let it import generics from countries like India where they might be cheaper, and second, compulsory licensing, which lets generics manufacturers produce patented drugs and compensates the patent holder for the IP violation at a dramatically reduced rate.

Pharmaceutical companies went ballistic — and the Clinton administration backed them up. Thirty-nine drug companies sued South Africa to block the new policy. The US Trade Representative put South Africa on a ""watch list"" of intellectual property violators and withheld normal trade benefits for a number of South African products. Al Gore, the administration’s leading voice on South Africa, told then-President Nelson Mandela that the US would not allow the legislation to go forward. It probably didn't hurt pharma's cause that the White House deputy and then full chief of staff at the time was John Podesta, whose brother Tony was the industry's top lobbyist in DC.

Effectively, Clinton was using the full weight of the US government to make it harder for HIV patients in South Africa to get treatment even though it was suffering sky-high infection rates.

This prompted an international backlash from AIDS activists who were horrified to watch the US government fight drug affordability in a poor country hit hard by the epidemic. Gore, who was in the middle of running for president, was an important target. Protesters repeatedly interrupted rallies in 1999 by chanting, ""Gore’s greed kills!"" The activist campaign in turn spurred members of the Congressional Black Caucus like Reps. Jesse Jackson Jr. and James Clyburn to put pressure on the White House to reverse course.

And so Clinton flip-flopped under pressure. In September 1999, the US Trade Representative and the South African government announced that the fight was resolved and the US would stop pressuring South Africa on the matter; it would be free to attempt to get generic drugs without penalties from US trade officials.

President Clinton issued an executive order in May 2000 stating, ""The United States shall not seek, through negotiation or otherwise, the revocation or revision of any intellectual property law or policy of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country […] that regulates HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals or medical technologies."" Later, during the Bush administration, this policy went global. At its 2001 Doha meeting, the WTO agreed to delay implementation of TRIPS in poor countries and give countries more flexibility to use compulsory licensing and other methods to bring down prices of drugs needed to address emergencies like the AIDS epidemic.

This was the Bill Clinton record on HIV/AIDS as president: years of standing behind drug companies and offering little US aid in the face of the crisis, followed by a late-breaking flip-flop. It was a moral stain on his administration.

A brief history of the HIV/AIDS drug price drop

Just as Clinton was leaving office, something remarkable began to happen to the price of HIV/AIDS drugs: They started to fall. A lot.

In 2000, the cost of the cheapest brand-name three-drug combo was about $10,439 per year — manageable for US insurers but simply untenable in poor countries. A year later, the cheapest brand-name combo was running about $727 a year. And then it just kept falling further:

This price drop had two initial sources, according to Tamara Mann Tweel, a Columbia researcher who’s studied it in depth.

First, pharmaceutical companies, facing intense public relations pressure, began to offer huge discounts for pilot projects in poor countries. This was not an act of altruism — the companies still turned a small profit on the sales and managed to boost their corporate reputations.

Second, activists like Jamie Love of the Consumer Project on Technology (now known as Knowledge Ecology International) pushed for and won a change in WTO rules that let generic drugs be sold more broadly. They attempted to negotiate down prices by attempting to match generics manufacturers with NGO funders who could buy in bulk.

By 2000, Cipla was offering a combination one-pill therapy containing all the drugs in the cocktail. But it didn't have sufficient demand. Love brokered a deal between Cipla CEO Yusuf Hamied and Doctors Without Borders (MSF) wherein Cipla would provide the drugs in bulk — for only $350 a year per person, or about $1 a day. This was a dramatic reduction even from generic prices, but Cipla would still be able to turn a profit provided MSF paid in cash and took care of distribution.

Once the $1-a-day offer demonstrated that mass purchases of AIDS drugs could be done affordably, institutions capable of financing bigger buys than MSF sprouted up. One was the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, a public-private partnership formed in 2002 and funded by governments like the US and foundations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Another was the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a massive expansion of AIDS funding pushed by George W. Bush's administration. Later on came UNITAID, a project of the governments of Brazil, Chile, France, Norway, and UK that funds global health measures through a tax on airline tickets.

Those institutions provided the money necessary to purchase and distribute vast quantities of generics, taking advantage of the price reductions that activists like Love had achieved.

The Clinton Foundation’s role in the price drop

It’s here — after the price drop to $350, and after the extensive work of activists who once opposed his administration — that Bill Clinton enters the picture.

In 2002, only a year after leaving office, Clinton decided to make reducing the cost of HIV/AIDS drugs his first project at the Clinton Foundation. He formed the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), a division of the foundation that housed the group’s work on public health, and tapped his old Rhodes Scholar buddy Ira Magaziner (who had become famous, or infamous, for his role in the failed Clinton health reform push of 1993-’94) to run the operation.

Specialists in the field were understandably skeptical of a president who’d failed to tackle the epidemic when he wielded the power of the presidency suddenly adopting the cause. Former Harvard School of Public Health dean Howard Hiatt asked Clinton at a meeting at the foundation in 2002 why he and other attendees should expect ""you’ll be able to accomplish now what you didn’t undertake in your presidency — an attack on this plague?""

But Magaziner and CHAI had a plan — one that relied on Clinton’s unique celebrity and ability to bring foreign leaders and pharmaceutical CEOs to the table in the way an ordinary civilian couldn’t. This was the whole idea behind the Clinton Foundation. At the time, Clinton himself wasn’t wealthy enough to influence things solely as a funder. But what he lacked in money he made up for in an extensive Rolodex and unparalleled glad-handing skills. And in HIV/AIDS drugs, he thought he’d found a problem that those resources could help solve.

The HIV/AIDS drug market, CHAI argued, was still not functioning correctly. PEPFAR and the Global Fund were still getting set up, and the former was initially required to pay for brand-name drugs. CHAI’s theory was that prices could be brought down still further by banding developing countries together and having them act as a purchasing unit that could bargain with generics manufacturers. Initially they tried to do this with US and European drug companies, and met with little success, and so moved on to Indian and South African generics companies.

CHAI’s basic approach was to ask drug companies to accept smaller margins in exchange for higher volumes. ""In essence, CHAI negotiations helped transform the business model for the ARV industry,"" political scientists Ethan Kapstein and Joshua Busby write in their history of the global AIDS activist movement, AIDS Drugs for All. Previously, even with prices as low as $350, companies like Cipla and its competitor Ranbaxy were selling at relatively low volumes but with healthy margins. The goal of CHAI was to transform the sector into a lower-margin, higher-volume industry.

In an interview with the Atlantic’s Jonathan Rauch, Bill Clinton put the change this way: ""What we tried to do was to get them to go from what I call a ‘jewelry-store model’ to a ‘grocery-store model’—from a high-profit, low-volume, uncertain-payment business to a low-margin, high-volume, certain-payment business.""

Many of these developing country governments were led by politicians with whom Bill Clinton had personal relationships from his time as president. ""My sources at CHAI often remarked that CHAI’s ability to work with governments and their health ministries led to the most sustainable form of change,"" Mann Tweel writes. ""It made governments commit to purchasing the drugs while helping them build the infrastructure for sustainable treatment.""

One of the most striking features of the first deal CHAI cut was the inclusion of South Africa as one of the bargaining nations. For years, South African President Thabo Mbeki had stalled on providing access to HIV drugs because he subscribed to discredited pseudoscience alleging that HIV doesn’t cause AIDS.

Clinton appears to have personally played a role in getting Mbeki, whom he got to know when their presidencies overlapped in Clinton’s last years in office, and his government to join the price negotiations. In July 2003, Clinton attended Mandela's 85th birthday party in Johannesburg, and during the dinner he pulled Mbeki away to discuss his AIDS response. Per New York magazine’s Jennifer Senior:

Two years ago, at Nelson Mandela’s 85th-birthday party — a 1,600-person extravaganza whose guest list included everyone from Bono to F. W. de Klerk — Clinton and Thabo Mbeki, the current president of South Africa, got up in the middle of the festivities, trailed by [CHAI president Ira] Magaziner. ""They just … walked out,"" recalls Richard Holbrooke, the former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. ""And went into a private room."" They returned half an hour later. It was after that meeting that Mbeki, famously reluctant to even acknowledge that HIV caused AIDS, agreed to allow the Clinton Foundation to assist his government in preparing an AIDS-treatment plan. (It was adopted by the Cabinet the following November.)

The victory was hardly complete; Mbeki later reversed himself and rejected a team Clinton sent in 2004. Clinton soldiered on, and CHAI eventually did build a South Africa operation, but Mbeki kept CHAI’s operations from growing too much. The group’s involvement in the country grew dramatically after Jacob Zuma succeeded Mbeki in 2009.

""The health ministry had never fully welcomed CHAI,"" journalist Joe Conason concedes in Man of the World, his very positive account of Clinton's post-presidency. ""By 2009, only 700,000 people were on treatment there."" But Clinton’s glad-handing appears to have meaningfully moved the needle at least somewhat, turning one of the most intransigent opponents of action on HIV/AIDS in Africa into an occasional, if unreliable, ally.

Clinton’s personal touch was also influential in getting buy-in from generics manufacturers. When CHAI was getting started, Conason reports, Clinton sent personal letters to generics company CEOs in India explaining his plan and urging them to join the initiative. His track record as president helped gain their trust: ""No doubt his restoration of good diplomatic relations with India as president and subsequent work with Indian American business moguls on disaster relief were helpful,"" Conason notes.

One obvious question this raises is whether the price drop could’ve happened without the explicit bargaining CHAI did. If these developing countries were going to start putting in orders anyway, that increase in demand should’ve prompted generics companies to produce more, to start benefiting from economics of scale, and to then cut prices to maintain an edge over one another. In a properly functioning market, that’s what would have happened.

The argument CHAI staffers make is that the international generics market at that time was poorly functioning, and even if it could have organized itself better in time, that delay would’ve meant thousands, if not millions, of HIV-positive people going untreated. Instead, they got treatment because CHAI brokered cheaper prices sooner.

Analysts across the board tend to give CHAI and the Clinton Foundation credit for its role in helping rationalize the market. ""CHAI successfully intervened in a transforming market,"" Mann Tweel concludes. Busby, the political scientist, tells me his and Kapstein’s research convinced them that ""CHAI was essential for organizing the market for AIDS drugs in the early days both on the demand side and the producer side.""

Love, the activist who was key to the generics-based price drop, is more skeptical, saying, ""CHAI and others have often distorted view of the CHAI and drug company role in lowering drug prices."" But all the same, he grants that CHAI ""helped people do some more coordinated procurement"" and ""has played an important role in the rollout and scaling of treatment of HIV/AIDS in developing countries.""

This is reflected in the actual pricing data. From 2002 to 2007, purchasers bought drugs both at CHAI-negotiated prices and through non-CHAI channels. One study found that prices for CHAI drugs during that period were 6 to 36 percent lower. That’s a strong indication that CHAI pushed prices below where they would’ve been had it never existed.

And crucially, CHAI’s victory appeared to hinge strongly on the very dynamics that make people uncomfortable about the Clinton Foundation. The deals made required buy-in from developing governments. The person tasked with getting that buy-in was a former US president with existing relationships with many of those people. Bill Clinton essentially used his chumminess with foreign politicians and pharmaceutical executives, the kind of thing about the Clinton Global Initiative that earns suspicious news coverage, to enlist their help in a scheme to expand access to HIV/AIDS drugs.

Larry Chang, an associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins who has worked on global HIV/AIDS response for the past two decades, singles out ""the convening power of Clinton"" as a key factor in getting the price reduction done. As Rauch put it in the Atlantic, ""It seems unlikely that anyone but a Clintonesque political celebrity could have persuaded disparate, disorganized AIDS-drug makers and governments to join hands.""

The foundation is still doing important work in global health

The Clinton Foundation’s role in the price drop is undoubtedly its biggest single victory. Now that that’s finished, would we really miss the foundation that much?

Global health researchers seem to think we would. It’s stayed active on HIV/AIDS and other infectious disease issues, and has notched similar wins. After the price drops, it hired scientists and built up technical capacity to help develop cost-saving alterations to drug formulae. In 2011, CHAI, with funding from the Gates Foundation and the UK government, and in collaboration with Howard University, developed a new way to synthesize the antiretroviral tenofovir, which lowered production costs by 20 percent.

It has also played a role in the direct distribution of ARVs. Laura Seay, a political scientist at Colby College who was doing dissertation research in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the mid-2000s, recalls the Clinton Foundation as one of the only NGOs willing to provide AIDS treatment in the country, given ongoing violence. In conjunction with local partners and the group Global Strategies, she says, ""The Clinton Foundation decided to provide the first pediatric AIDS treatment in the region.""

""I found it really powerful work. You have to remember at that time, across the border in Rwanda or Uganda, if you had HIV, it wasn’t hopeless, like it had been five or six years before,"" she explains. ""The Clinton Foundation negotiated the prices down and got the generic access that was needed to extend that to millions of people but that had not reached into places that were dangerous and where there was a risk of rebels coming in. But they decided to take the risk.""

""I saw kids who in the space of two years went from skin and bones to being healthy and thriving children who could go to school and have a good life,"" she continues. ""It was because of the Clinton Foundation, and because they weren’t afraid to give it a try.""

For funding rollout efforts like this, Bill Clinton’s personal charm again played a role. In 2003, Schoofs reported that Clinton ""secured partial funding by personally lobbying leaders of rich nations, such as Ireland and Canada."" Clinton told Schoofs, ""Usually I just call the prime minister or the president, and tell them what we're doing and ask them to have somebody look at it. And I always tell them that even though we're friends they don't have to do this for me — don't do it unless they think it's a good thing. But I think it's the best thing going in the world in AIDS care.""

Clinton’s personal ties also helped created a major funding stream for HIV/AIDS programs. In AIDS Drugs for All, Kapstein and Busby note that UNITAID was originally meant as a legacy project for French President Jacques Chirac. He wanted to use airline levies to fund something related to international development, but he wasn't sure what.

The French foreign minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, ""stumbled on"" a destination for the money ""after meeting with Bill Clinton in 2005,"" Kapstein and Busby write. ""Clinton told him he should work on HIV/AIDS and said, 'You have to say to the drug companies, I'm giving you money, not for one year but for several years, for example, three hundred million dollars per year for five years. How much do you agree to decrease the price?'""

CHAI continues to play a price-negotiation role, both for drugs targeting other diseases (it has achieved similar deals on malaria medication and for a variety of vaccines) and on HIV/AIDS. Chang, the Johns Hopkins doctor, notes that CHAI has been active in trying to lower the price of viral load testing, an important diagnostic tool for seeing if patients are responding well to ARV treatment.

Perhaps the best argument for the value of CHAI’s work comes from its donors. The Gates Foundation, which is known for rigor in grant determinations, gave CHAI and other Clinton Foundation initiatives more than $67 million in 2015 alone. UNITAID has donated over $25 million. These are not groups known for frivolously throwing money around. They’re serious players in a variety of global health domains, which have decided to pour meaningful funds into the Clinton Foundation.

The Foundation’s non-health activities are smaller in scale, with some notable failures

While global health has been the crown jewel of the Clinton Foundation — so much so that CHAI was eventually spun off to become its own separate, but connected, group in 2010 — the foundation has a variety of other projects, tackling causes ranging from obesity prevention and opioid addiction in the United States to climate mitigation and adaptation to a variety of economic development efforts in Haiti. The foundation’s cause selection is notable in its heavy emphasis on global development, a relatively neglected area by many foundations, which tend to be more US-focused.

But these activities make up a relatively small share of the foundation’s work in pure monetary terms. In 2014, fully 57.3 percent — some $143 million — of the Clinton Foundation's spending went to the Clinton Health Access Initiative; that’s nearly two-thirds of all non-administrative and fundraising spending. Another $23 million went to the Clinton Global Initiative events, and another $13 million after that to the Clinton Presidential Center, Clinton's presidential library in Arkansas.

The Clinton Climate Initiative accounted for only 3.3 percent of the foundation's expenses; the Clinton Health Matters Initiative, its US-based health program, only 1.5 percent. Perhaps because they are funded by a relatively small slice of the foundation’s revenue, which is then itself spread thin across a variety of distinct projects, these endeavors haven’t yielded the high-profile victories that CHAI has.

But there has been one high-profile failure: the foundation’s work in Haiti following the country’s devastating 2010 earthquake. Jonathan Katz, a veteran Haiti reporter who has done excellent coverage on the foundation’s programs there, argues, ""The Clintons made the same mistake that has been made for generations. Though striking a populist pose, in practice they were attracted to power in Haiti, which meant making alliances and friendships within the Haitian elite.""

That led to projects like luxury hotels that appeared to help foreign investors more than average Haitians. It also led to the Clinton effort’s most high-profile failure: the $300 million Caracol Industrial Park, an effort to build a center for garment exports in the north of Haiti. The project promised 100,000 jobs, including 60,000 within five years of its opening, many through its primary tenant, the South Korean clothing manufacturer Sae-A. As of last spring, fewer than 5,500 people were employed at Caracol.

""That comes out to roughly $55,000 in investment per job created so far,"" Katz writes. ""Or, to put it another way, about 30 times more per job than the average Sae-A worker makes per year."" And the focus on Caracol in the north distracted from the task of rebuilding Port-au-Prince, the capital that was hit particularly hard by the quake.

The failure there is tragic. But the Clinton Foundation’s failed Haiti development project certainly wasn’t the country’s first, and it’s likely not to be its last.

Compare the Clinton Foundation to the Trump Foundation

In light of the Clinton Foundation and CHAI's accomplishments, it's surreal to read the way the organization is covered, not just in anti-Clinton press outlets but in mainstream ones.

The New York Times’s Eric Lichtblau frets over ""new questions about whether the charitable foundation worked to reward its donors with access and influence at the State Department."" The Wall Street Journal’s Peter Nicholas and James Grimaldi darkly warn, ""Hillary Clinton as secretary of state attended high-profile events and functions where donors to her family’s charitable foundation were in attendance, calendar records show."" The Associated Press’s Stephen Braun and Eileen Sullivan, in a deeply flawed report fretting over Clinton’s record of meeting with prominent development economists and NGO leaders who also donated to the foundation, warn, ""[A] Clinton administration would have to take careful steps to ensure that past foundation donors would not have the same access as she allowed at the State Department.""

Such stories have prompted opponents, from Trump to Karl Rove, to urge the Clinton Foundation to ""shut down"" already.

This debate has become representative of how the Clinton Foundation is covered more broadly. The value of the organization is almost entirely divorced from actual charitable programming. Stories about the foundation don’t mention what the money that allegedly bought this access was spent on. They don’t distinguish between giving to the Clintons, personally, and giving to their charitable organization.

Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton’s opponent runs a foundation that is very clearly a scam, which used tax-exempt funds to purchase an autographed Tim Tebow helmet and a giant portrait of Donald Trump.

The media has botched this story. The amount of ink spilled on as-yet-unsubstantiated insinuations that the Clintons sold access through their foundation, as opposed to the foundation’s actual lifesaving work in public health, is ludicrous.

There is little to no evidence that anyone received meaningful favors from the Clintons in exchange for donating to the foundation. There is definitely no evidence that Hillary Clinton altered her policies as secretary of state in reaction to donations. There’s no evidence that the Clintons or their foundation engaged in some of the more egregious activities of Trump’s foundation, like donating to a state attorney general to deter her from an investigation into Trump’s activities, or giving to a nonprofit to fund a lawsuit against another state AG who did opt to investigate, or even paying off the legal bills of his for-profit businesses.

But there is considerable evidence that the Clinton Foundation has saved millions of lives. And there’s evidence that Bill Clinton’s work with the group would make him more useful as first spouse. Presidents rely heavily on special envoys tasked with making deals to resolve prisoner disputes, facilitate peace processes, and the like. Clinton’s time with the foundation exhibited the exact set of skills necessary for a role like that. His presence could greatly expand the diplomatic bandwidth of his wife’s administration.

The fact that Hillary Clinton’s association with a group, and a husband, with that track record has become a liability rather than an asset is a deep indictment of how skewed the press’s priorities in covering this election have become.",www.vox.com,left,Pu4gD1UZ37CYsUF8

The company broke the news to circus employees Saturday night after shows in Orlando and Miami .
Ringling Bros. has two touring circuses this season and will perform 30 shows between now and May . Major stops include Atlanta , Washington , Philadelphia , Boston and Brooklyn . The final shows will be in Providence , Rhode Island , on May 7 and in Uniondale , New York , at the Nassau County Coliseum on May 21 .
The circus , with its exotic animals , flashy costumes and death-defying acrobats , has been a staple of entertainment in the United States since the mid-1800s .

Eventually , they merged and the modern circus was born . The sprawling troupes traveled around America by train , wowing audiences with the sheer scale of entertainment and exotic animals .
By midcentury , the circus was routine , wholesome family entertainment . But as the 20th century went on , kids became less and less enthralled . Movies , television , video games and the internet captured young minds . The circus did n't have savvy product merchandising tie-ins or Saturday morning cartoons to shore up its image .
`` The competitor in many ways is time , '' said Feld , adding that transporting the show by rail and other circus quirks — such as providing a traveling school for performers ' children— are throwbacks to another era . `` It 's a different model that we ca n't see how it works in today 's world to justify and maintain an affordable ticket price . So you 've got all these things working against it . ''
The Feld family bought the Ringling circus in 1967 . The show was just under 3 hours then . Today , the show is 2 hours and 7 minutes , with the longest segment — a tiger act — clocking in at 12 minutes .
`` Try getting a 3- or 4-year-old today to sit for 12 minutes , '' he said .
Feld and his daughter Juliette Feld , who is the company 's chief operating officer , acknowledged another reality that led to the closing , and it was the one thing that initially drew millions to the show : the animals . Ringling has been targeted by activists who say forcing animals to perform is cruel and unnecessary .
In May of 2016 , after a long and costly legal battle , the company removed the elephants from the shows and sent the animals to live on a conservation farm in Central Florida . The animals had been the symbol of the circus since Barnum brought an Asian elephant named Jumbo to America in 1882 . In 2014 , Feld Entertainment won $ 25.2 million in settlements from groups including the Humane Society of the United States , ending a 14-year fight over allegations that circus employees mistreated elephants .
By the time the elephants were removed , public opinion had shifted somewhat . Los Angeles prohibited the use of bull-hooks by elephant trainers and handlers , as did Oakland , California . The city of Asheville , North Carolina nixed wild or exotic animals from performing in the municipally owned , 7,600-seat U.S. Cellular Center .
Attendance has been dropping for 10 years , said Juliette Feld , but when the elephants left , there was a `` dramatic drop '' in ticket sales . Paradoxically , while many said they did n't want big animals to perform in circuses , many others refused to attend a circus without them .
`` We know now that one of the major reasons people came to Ringling Bros. was getting to see elephants , '' she said . `` We stand by that decision . We know it was the right decision . This was what audiences wanted to see and it definitely played a major role . ''
The Felds say their existing animals — lions , tigers , camels , donkeys , alpacas , kangaroos and llamas — will go to suitable homes . Juliette Feld says the company will continue operating the Center for Elephant Conservation .
Some 500 people perform and work on both touring shows . A handful will be placed in positions with the company 's other , profitable shows — it owns Monster Jam , Disney on Ice and Marvel Live , among other things — but most will be out of a job . Juliette Feld said the company will help employees with job placement and resumes . In some cases where a circus employee lives on the tour rail car ( the circus travels by train ) , the company will also help with housing relocation .
Kenneth Feld became visibly emotional while discussing the decision with a reporter . He said over the next four months , fans will be able to say goodbye at the remaining shows .
In recent years , Ringling Bros. tried to remain relevant , hiring its first African American ringmaster , then its first female ringmaster , and also launching an interactive app . It added elements from its other , popular shows , such as motorbike daredevils and ice skaters . But it seemingly was no match for Pokemon Go and a generation of kids who desire familiar brands and YouTube celebrities .
`` We tried all these different things to see what would work , and supported it with a lot of funding as well , and we were n't successful in finding the solution , '' said Kenneth Feld .","After 146 years, the curtain is coming down on ""The Greatest Show on Earth.""

By midcentury, the circus was routine, wholesome family entertainment. But as the 20th century went on, kids became less and less enthralled. Movies, television, video games and the internet captured young minds. The circus didn't have savvy product merchandising tie-ins or Saturday morning cartoons to shore up its image.

""The competitor in many ways is time,"" said Feld, adding that transporting the show by rail and other circus quirks — such as providing a traveling school for performers' children— are throwbacks to another era. ""It's a different model that we can't see how it works in today's world to justify and maintain an affordable ticket price. So you've got all these things working against it.""

The Feld family bought the Ringling circus in 1967. The show was just under 3 hours then. Today, the show is 2 hours and 7 minutes, with the longest segment — a tiger act — clocking in at 12 minutes.

""Try getting a 3- or 4-year-old today to sit for 12 minutes,"" he said.

Feld and his daughter Juliette Feld, who is the company's chief operating officer, acknowledged another reality that led to the closing, and it was the one thing that initially drew millions to the show: the animals. Ringling has been targeted by activists who say forcing animals to perform is cruel and unnecessary.

In May of 2016, after a long and costly legal battle, the company removed the elephants from the shows and sent the animals to live on a conservation farm in Central Florida. The animals had been the symbol of the circus since Barnum brought an Asian elephant named Jumbo to America in 1882. In 2014, Feld Entertainment won $25.2 million in settlements from groups including the Humane Society of the United States, ending a 14-year fight over allegations that circus employees mistreated elephants.

By the time the elephants were removed, public opinion had shifted somewhat. Los Angeles prohibited the use of bull-hooks by elephant trainers and handlers, as did Oakland, California. The city of Asheville, North Carolina nixed wild or exotic animals from performing in the municipally owned, 7,600-seat U.S. Cellular Center.

Attendance has been dropping for 10 years, said Juliette Feld, but when the elephants left, there was a ""dramatic drop"" in ticket sales. Paradoxically, while many said they didn't want big animals to perform in circuses, many others refused to attend a circus without them.

""We know now that one of the major reasons people came to Ringling Bros. was getting to see elephants,"" she said. ""We stand by that decision. We know it was the right decision. This was what audiences wanted to see and it definitely played a major role.""

The Felds say their existing animals — lions, tigers, camels, donkeys, alpacas, kangaroos and llamas — will go to suitable homes. Juliette Feld says the company will continue operating the Center for Elephant Conservation.

Some 500 people perform and work on both touring shows. A handful will be placed in positions with the company's other, profitable shows — it owns Monster Jam, Disney on Ice and Marvel Live, among other things — but most will be out of a job. Juliette Feld said the company will help employees with job placement and resumes. In some cases where a circus employee lives on the tour rail car (the circus travels by train), the company will also help with housing relocation.

Kenneth Feld became visibly emotional while discussing the decision with a reporter. He said over the next four months, fans will be able to say goodbye at the remaining shows.

In recent years, Ringling Bros. tried to remain relevant, hiring its first African American ringmaster, then its first female ringmaster, and also launching an interactive app. It added elements from its other, popular shows, such as motorbike daredevils and ice skaters. But it seemingly was no match for Pokemon Go and a generation of kids who desire familiar brands and YouTube celebrities.

""We tried all these different things to see what would work, and supported it with a lot of funding as well, and we weren't successful in finding the solution,"" said Kenneth Feld.",www.foxnews.com,right,IF3t5IQ3nxtvdhHl
general_news,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/6/8740385/josh-duggar-abuse-palin-dunham,What Sarah Palin gets wrong when comparing Lena Dunham and Josh Duggar,2015-06-06,"Alex Abad-Santos, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz, Theodore Schleifer, Li Zhou, Sean Collins, Umair Irfan","In recent weeks , it 's become clear that Josh Duggar — a star on the TLC reality series 19 Kids and Counting , as well as , until recently , a Washington lobbyist for the conservative Christian group Focus on the Family — molested underage girls when he was a teenager . But the story of Duggar 's acts has also become a meta-story of how the media and political worlds are reacting to it .
The latest person to come out in favor of Josh and the Duggars is Sarah Palin , the former governor of Alaska and onetime Republican vice presidential nominee . Palin came out swinging on Thursday , throwing around words like `` pedophile '' and `` sexual predator , '' but those words were n't for Josh Duggar — they were for Girls creator and star Lena Dunham .
In a searing Facebook post , Palin connected Duggar and Dunham , asserting a double standard between the two . That post went viral . But it 's also irresponsible . Here 's why :
People are talking about Palin because of a caps-lock-peppered Facebook tirade she shared on Thursday . Palin ( or someone on her team ) addressed Lena Dunham in the opening lines of the post , calling the Girls star a pedophile :
HEY LENA , WHY NOT LAUGH OFF EVERYONE 'S SEXUAL `` EXPERIMENTS '' AS YOU HAUGHTILY ENJOY REWARDS FOR YOUR OWN PERVERSION ? YOU PEDOPHILE , YOU Radical liberals in media who have total control over public narratives are disgusting hypocrites , so says my daughter .
Palin links to her daughter Bristol 's post on Patheos , which accuses the `` liberal '' media of treating the Duggars differently than they did Dunham — that they allegedly gave Dunham a pass while dragging the Duggars over the coals . And the idea of media hypocrisy really is the gist of Palin 's post . Palin explains that because Dunham is a liberal and the media is liberal , she was given a pass for what Palin believes is sexual assault :
I ’ m sickened that the media gives their chosen ones a pass for any behavior as long as they share their leftwing politics . Case in point , they suggest Lena Dunham 's sexual assault on her sibling is cute , and she 's rewarded for it with fame and fortune . Meanwhile , they crucify another , along with an entire family .
Can you remind me of what happened with Lena Dunham ?
Totally . To fully understand what Palin is angry about requires a working knowledge of Lena Dunham 's sexual abuse scandal . You can find a full explainer of the Dunham scandal on ███ , but the gist of the scandal revolves around the passage in Dunham 's book and a crucial mistake that followed .
Back in October , nearly a month after Dunham 's memoir had come out , the right-wing website Truth Revolt posted a passage from it under the headline `` Lena Dunham Describes Sexually Abusing Her Little Sister . ''
That headline was coupled with a passage from Dunham 's book where she describes looking at her sister 's vagina :
`` Do we all have uteruses ? '' I asked my mother when I was seven . `` Yes , '' she told me . `` We 're born with them , and with all our eggs , but they start out very small . And they are n't ready to make babies until we 're older . '' I look at my sister , now a slim , tough one-year-old , and at her tiny belly . I imagined her eggs inside her , like the sack of spider eggs in Charlotte 's Web , and her uterus , the size of a thimble . `` Does her vagina look like mine ? '' `` I guess so , '' my mother said . `` Just smaller . '' One day , as I sat in our driveway in Long Island playing with blocks and buckets , my curiosity got the best of me . Grace was sitting up , babbling and smiling , and I leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina . She did n't resist and when I saw what was inside I shrieked . My mother came running . `` Mama , Mama ! Grace has something in there ! '' My mother did n't bother asking why I had opened Grace 's vagina . This was within the spectrum of things I did . She just got on her knees and looked for herself . It quickly became apparent that Grace had stuffed six or seven pebbles in there . My mother removed them patiently while Grace cackled , thrilled that her prank had been a success .
Truth Revolt really keyed on the phrase `` she did n't resist , '' which becomes more loaded when paired with that headline .
But there was another factor , too : Truth Revolt 's article originally stated that Dunham was 17 at the time — Dunham says she was 7 — changing and charging the passage with pedophilia . Truth Revolt and NRO columnist Kevin Williamson also keyed in on a passage where Dunham writes about masturbating in the same bed with her sleeping sister .
Those factors — even though one was a glaring , irresponsible mistake — were enough to lay a foundation and give people , Truth Revolt readers in particular , the idea than Dunham had abused her sister .
Experts who weighed in said that given Dunham 's age , this was n't — though Palin believes it is — a case of sexual assault .
`` This is clearly not a case of abuse , '' developmental psychologist Ritch Savin-Williams , director of the Sex and Gender Lab at Cornell University , told Slate . `` Children have been doing this stuff forever and ever and ever and ever , and they will do it forever and ever and ever . ''
Sam Rubenstein , a psychotherapist who specializes in childhood abuse , echoed these thoughts to Gawker :
I think you have to take into consideration her age , her history , and the idea that at that age , unless you 've gone through severe sexual trauma , there 's really almost nothing sexual about it . The same explanation could be used for grabbing the dog 's tail . It 's the same type of coercion . Just because it 's in the sexual venue , people want to attach something to it , but it 's almost totally different . It 's an innocent type of thing .
John V. Caffaro , a professor at the California School of Professional Psychology and an expert on sibling abuse , explained in a Washington Post column that such non-abusive interactions are normal among siblings :
To be clear , sexual curiosity in children is normal . All children explore their bodies and may engage in visual or even manual exploration of a sibling at times . This is one way that children discover sexual differences between boys ' and girls ' anatomies . Even siblings of the same gender become curious about variations in shapes and sizes of their sex organs . Two small children exploring each other 's bodies does not predestine them to a life of emotional suffering .
Even though experts asserted that Dunham 's behavior is normal and does n't constitute sex abuse , it did not stop people from labeling her as a sexual predator .
Yes . Though both Dunham and Duggar 's stories involve touching their underage siblings , there are a couple of things that differentiate their stories .
The first and foremost is age . Duggar was around 14 years old in 2002 when he was investigated for molesting girls . Dunham was 7 during that episode with her sister . There is a gulf of difference between a 14-year-old ( who is presumably going through puberty ) and a 7-year-old when it comes to agency , autonomy , and sexuality . The difference in age between Dunham and Duggar is the difference between a police investigation and two kids playing doctor .
The 2006 police report on Duggar found instances in 2002 and 2003 where Duggar was accused of fondling several minors while they were asleep and while they were awake . Duggar 's multiple instances of molestation are another key difference between Dunham 's and Duggar 's stories .
On Friday , Josh 's sisters , Jill and Jessa , said of Josh 's actions that he was a `` young boy in puberty who was a little too curious about girls . '' Some have suggested Jill and Jessa are telling a story that their parents want them to tell . The sisters disagree .
`` This is something we chose to do , '' Jessa told Megyn Kelly . `` Nobody asked us to do this . ''
In the days following the outcry against Lena , Grace Dunham tweeted that outsiders should n't rush to judgment :
heteronormativity deems certain behaviours harmful , and others `` normal '' ; the state and media are always invested in maintaining that — Grace Dunham ( @ simongdunham ) November 3 , 2014
And that she should have the last word on determining whether or not her experiences with her sister were harmful :
As a queer person : i 'm committed to people narrating their own experiences , determining for themselves what has and has not been harmful — Grace Dunham ( @ simongdunham ) November 3 , 2014
Palin did n't name names of the publications that she felt pulled the punches on Dunham and then went off the top rope against the Duggars , which makes it hard to figure out which publications Palin and her daughter have in mind . It 's also really difficult to figure out where to start or which specific stories they 're talking about , since many stories have been written about both Dunham and Duggar in the wake of their respective allegations .
While Palin asserts sameness , the two stories , by nature of the police investigation of molestation , the ages Dunham and Duggar were when these acts occurred , and the way these stories were discovered ( Duggar 's by a Freedom of Information Act request ; Dunham 's in her memoir ) are actually quite different . Still , when you look at outlets like CBS News , you get headlines that stay within the facts : `` Josh Duggar inappropriately touched sisters , parents say '' vs. `` Lena Dunham fires back at accusations she molested her sister . ''
And there were some left-leaning news outlets , like Salon , which actually published stories like Carolyn Edgar 's `` What Dunham ’ s defenders are missing : Her story about her sister could have been a teaching opportunity . '' In that piece , Edgar voices her concern about Dunham 's behavior and questions Dunham 's defenders ' quickness to jump to her side .
Palin might be referring to Gawker , an outlet that has been on the Duggar beat . Gawker in recent weeks has published stories like `` 19 Excuses and Counting : Every Excuse the Duggars Made for Their Son '' and `` Michelle Duggar 's Crazy , Vacant Fox News Interview Stare : A Review '' and `` Angry Duggar Fans Send Email Hellfire : `` Leave This Family Alone ! ! ''
The site and its feminist sister site Jezebel covered Dunham 's sex abuse scandal throughly , but probably not in the way Palin would have liked . One of the posts featured an interview with a child psychologist who confirmed that Dunham 's experience with her sister when she was 7 did n't sound like child abuse .
But Gawker has n't been kind to Dunham in the past . Dunham threatened to sue the site in 2012 after it published her leaked book proposal . And in December , Gawker named who they believed was Dunham 's alleged rapist — something that Dunham went through great pains to keep unreported and away from the spotlight . That post called Dunham 's honesty into question .
What both Palins fail to mention is that there were some pieces written from liberal feminists who admonished Dunham 's privilege . Those writers point to Dunham 's past actions — underrepresenting or ignoring people of color on her show , making jokes about rape and molestation , outing her sister — as revealing problematic views on race , feminism , and LGBT rights that stem from Dunham 's privilege .
Writer Luvvie Ajayi , for example , pointed out that Dunham could only be as blasé as she was in her book and in her immediate reaction because of her privilege , and that Dunham 's insensitivity in writing about the subject shows that she uses that privilege to get away with things other people could not :
A Black woman could not have written what Lena did . She would not have the space to argue context . She would not have anyone championing her . She would certainly not be given some benefit of the doubt about childhood exploration because Black people 's innocence is often denied , even when we 're 7 . Our kids are tried as adults in the court of public opinion and in the court of law . In fact , NO person of color could have written this .
Another critic , Jen Pink , writing at the Flounce , suggested that Dunham did cross a line in the childhood interaction with her sister . While that 's not a typical view among Dunham 's liberal feminist critics , Pink described her in a way that captures the broader view of Dunham among those critics : as a `` blindly privileged white self-identifying feminist who wants to represent you to the rest of the world . ''
Right . This is what makes the Duggars ' story as big as it is .
The Duggars have been part of a reality television show on TLC since 2008 . And they have always depicted themselves as a wholesome family with a very fertile matriarch . The family has also been vocal in espousing these values , making clear that gay marriage is bad and implying in 2014 that transgender people are sexual predators .
Josh Duggar 's admitted abuse , especially in light of what the Duggars have said in the past regarding LGBT people , makes them seem hypocritical . Duggar 's admitted abuse would n't be as newsworthy if the Duggars did n't make their brand and themselves known as moral arbiters of right and wrong . The Duggars have made a living of telling other people how to live their private lives , and Josh 's molesting of underage girls , including his sisters , makes you question what authority they really have to be doing that anymore .
The other part of the equation is an expectation for the Duggars to hold Josh accountable and the Duggar parents , Jim Bob and Michelle , not following through . Jim Bob Duggar waited to inform authorities of the incidences of molestation for more than a year after first learning about them , and state trooper Jim Hutchens failed to take action on the information — by the time police began their investigation , they believed the three-year statute of limitations had been reached . And in their interview with Fox News 's Megyn Kelly , Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar were evasive and offered up many excuses as to why Josh molested his sisters .
Palin 's central point is that she believes people are treated differently by the media based on their political leanings . Josh Duggar and Lena Dunham have disparate stories , but she 's smashing them together , framing them to look similar , and explaining that the reason we do n't see them the same is because of liberal media outlets ( that she does not name ) :
Such obvious double standards applied to equally relevant stories underestimate the wisdom of the public , discredit the press , and spit on the graves of every American who fought and died for the press 's freedom . I hate for anyone to go through this game liberals are allowed to play , relentlessly attacking on an uneven playing field until a conservative 's career , relationships , and reputation are destroyed . To the media 's targets I encourage , `` Rise above by never claiming 'victim ' , tell the truth , and keep the faith ! ''
More than 9,500 people have liked her status . But if you look at the comments , some of the most popular and well-liked ones come from people — both conservative and liberal — who point out how Palin is misinformed in this argument :
If Sarah Palin were actually concerned with liberal media bias , a few examples and acknowledging the factual differences between Dunham and the Duggars would have made her argument stronger . She might truly believe that a 14-year-old and a 7-year-old are equally capable of sexual molestation or might believe there is something really strange with Dunham 's behavior . But she does n't make these points clear , opting only to say that people were not treated fairly . Her post has been called `` unhinged '' and `` irrelevant . ''
In essence , it seems more like Palin found an opportunity to be the conversation instead of lending a voice to it .","In recent weeks, it's become clear that Josh Duggar — a star on the TLC reality series 19 Kids and Counting, as well as, until recently, a Washington lobbyist for the conservative Christian group Focus on the Family — molested underage girls when he was a teenager.

But she doesn't make these points clear, opting only to say that people were not treated fairly. Her post has been called ""unhinged"" and ""irrelevant.""

In essence, it seems more like Palin found an opportunity to be the conversation instead of lending a voice to it.",www.vox.com,left,5ewRD1EU8TvywLY8

Matthew was never charged in 2002 case due to lack of evidence

University of Virginia student Hannah Graham was last seen on September 13

Jesse Matthew, a suspect in the disappearance of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, was questioned in connection with an alleged sexual assault nearly 12 years ago, authorities said Thursday.

However, no charges were filed because the woman didn't want to go forward with the case and investigators determined there wasn't enough evidence to arrest Matthew, said Michael Doucette, the commonwealth's attorney for Lynchburg, Virginia.

According to a statement from Lynchburg police, a woman reported she was raped on the campus of Liberty University on October 17, 2002.

Matthew told authorities that the woman consented, Doucette said, adding that there were no witnesses.

On Thursday, Matthew was sitting in a Texas jail cell, waiting for Virginia authorities to pick him up and take him back to Charlottesville, where he has been sought in the Graham case on suspicion of abduction with the intent to defile.

He was in a Texas court twice Thursday. The second time, Judge Michelle Slaughter in Galveston asked whether he wanted to fight extradition or would agree to be sent to back to Virginia.

Matthew agreed to the extradition.

Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo told reporters that he thought Matthew would be moved Friday. He had no comment when asked about the 2002 case.

Earlier, Matthew appeared before Galveston County Judge Mark Henry on a charge of giving false information to a Texas peace officer.

Authorities found Matthew on a Galveston County beach some 1,300 miles from where he's wanted in the disappearance.

Deputies were tipped off to Matthew's whereabouts when they got a call about a suspicious person camping on the beach. One responded and ran the license plate of that person's vehicle. It came back as wanted, CNN affiliate KPRC reported

Lawyer: No comment at this point

Matthew's Virginia-based lawyer had little to say about his client when approached earlier outside his Charlottesville office.

""I am Mr. Matthew's attorney,"" James Camblos said. ""I was hired on Saturday. That's the only thing that I'm going to confirm at this point. The family and I -- nobody is making any statements at this point in time. We might later on, but right now we are not.""

His comments came a day after authorities obtained an arrest warrant for his client, who police believe was the last person with Graham.

Matthew willingly went to a police station over the weekend, when there was no warrant for his arrest, Longo said. He asked for a lawyer. They spoke and then left, the police chief said.

Rick Snyder ( R ) and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy testify in Congress Thursday about the drinking water crisis in Flint , Mich. , critics say the proceedings highlight the flaws in a system that falls short of holding government leaders accountable for their decisions .
The disaster – which left about 200 children diagnosed with dangerous levels of lead in their blood – underscored not only officials ’ failure to address concerns about the city ’ s water quality , open government advocates say . The public health crisis also reflects an overall lack of transparency in Michigan ’ s government , which two watchdog groups characterized as the worst in the nation .
As some , but not all , e-mails related to the decision to switch Flint 's water source to the Flint River have been released , it also has called to question loopholes in the state ’ s Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) , which some say allowed officials to function with little public oversight .
More broadly , the situation has renewed national conversation about the value of the public ’ s right to know and the role of accountability in effective governance .
“ If there is a silver lining in what is clearly a tragedy in Flint , it ’ s that freedom of information , accountability , and transparency are getting noticed , ” says Jane Briggs-Bunting , president of the Michigan Coalition for Open Government , a nonprofit advocacy that promotes government transparency . “ People are saying , ‘ You know , maybe this could ’ ve been avoided . ’ ”
Indeed , as the crisis has unfolded , the public , advocates , and elected officials have called for reforms to Michigan ’ s public records law , which is the only one in the nation that statutorily exempts the governor ’ s office from FOIA requests . Governor Snyder has since released thousands of e-mails related to the Flint crisis . Michigan 's Legislature also is exempt from FOIA .
A review of the e-mails revealed a consistent effort among state employees to sidestep disclosure of public records under FOIA , the Detroit Free Press reports . Regardless of content , messages invoked attorney client privilege or were labeled “ preliminary and deliberative ” – an exemption meant to be used only when the public interest in encouraging honest conversations among government officials clearly eclipsed the public interest in disclosure .
“ Not subject to FOIA ” was a standard subject heading , a term that has no legal standing , according to the Free Press .
“ You have a culture that ’ s evolved over the years with employees being told they don ’ t need to be talking about that , or ‘ You might get in trouble if you raise that , ’ ” Ms. Briggs-Bunting says .
While the events in Flint were not directly caused by such lack of transparency , what happened does reflect an atmosphere of impunity that merits reform , says John Wonderlich , executive director of the Sunlight Foundation , a national nonprofit that advocates for open government .
“ I wouldn ’ t want to say that secrecy caused [ the crisis ] , ” he says , “ but it certainly made it worse . ”
Michigan ranked last in a 2015 national study of state ethics and transparency laws by the Center for Public Integrity and Global Integrity . The two nonprofit groups cited a weak public records law and an absence of laws requiring personal financial disclosures by lawmakers and top state officials for the state 's F grade .
Thursday ’ s hearing is the second of two Flint-related sessions that the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is holding this week . Snyder is set to testify for the first time , as is EPA chief McCarthy .
In prepared testimony obtained by the Associated Press ahead of the hearing , Snyder maintained that he did not know that Flint ’ s water was contaminated until Oct. 1 , 2015 – nearly a year and a half after the city began using the Flint river as its drinking water supply .
He added that as soon as he found out about the lead levels in the water , he returned the city to Detroit ’ s water system and ordered the distribution of water filters and the testing of residents and children for lead in the blood .
McCarthy , however , said state officials were responsible . She noted that at the time , the city was in the care of a state-appointed emergency manager , who was tasked to balance Flint ’ s shaky finances and approved the switch from the Detroit system to the Flint river as a way to save money . Pumped through aging pipes and fixtures without adequate corrosion control , the river water exposed Flint residents to “ dangerously high levels of lead , ” she says .
Yet crucial as it is , the question of who ’ s at fault in Flint is only one concern , critics say . Just as salient is the broader issue of government accountability – and how to ensure the public and the media are able to exercise their right to know about policy decisions that affect their everyday lives .
“ The entire idea behind FOIA laws and other transparency laws is that people can make better decisions when they have accurate information available to them , ” says Mike Reitz , executive vice president of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy , a Michigan-based think tank .
“ Representative government doesn ’ t automatically hold itself accountable , ” adds Mr. Wonderlich at the Sunlight Foundation . “ In order for democracy to work , the public has to have a basic level of information about what officials are doing . ”
At the same time , having government officials recognize they are subject to public scrutiny helps prevent abuse of of power .
“ When someone is looking over shoulder , you ’ re more wary about what you ’ re doing and you make sure you ’ re doing everything right , ” says Briggs-Bunting at the Michigan Coalition for Open Government .
Already some state lawmakers have responded to the crisis by urging greater transparency .
On Friday , House minority leader Tim Greimel released emails and meeting calendars from February at the AP ’ s request . And on Wednesday , a bipartisan group of House and Senate members unveiled new transparency legislation that would place the governor ’ s office under the purview of FOIA . In terms of greater transparency in the statehouse , a proposed bill would create a separate Legislative Open Records Act , which would not go as far as FOIA .
Still , that ’ s only the first step , says Mr. Reitz . Meaningful reform , he says , would include reducing the cost of obtaining public records and providing those records in electronic form . But he doubts such change would take place any time soon .
“ [ Freedom of information ] is not a kitchen table issue for a lot of voters , ” Reitz says . “ It doesn ’ t rise to the level of jobs or taxes or education. ” As a result , it often takes a crisis like Flint to spur lawmakers and the public to action .
Nonetheless , the events in Flint could bolster awareness of the importance of public information laws not just in Michigan , but across the nation .

“ I think it raises concerns about how much trust we ’ ve put in public officials at a time when a lot of our infrastructure is not in great shape , ” Wonderlich says . “ It means that there ’ s no one automatically looking out for when people are going to be severely hurt by failures of that public infrastructure .
“ That should be a sobering thought for everyone , ” he says .","Could greater transparency prevent another Flint?

As Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy testify in Congress Thursday about the drinking water crisis in Flint, Mich., critics say the proceedings highlight the flaws in a system that falls short of holding government leaders accountable for their decisions.

The disaster – which left about 200 children diagnosed with dangerous levels of lead in their blood – underscored not only officials’ failure to address concerns about the city’s water quality, open government advocates say. The public health crisis also reflects an overall lack of transparency in Michigan’s government, which two watchdog groups characterized as the worst in the nation.

More broadly, the situation has renewed national conversation about the value of the public’s right to know and the role of accountability in effective governance.

“If there is a silver lining in what is clearly a tragedy in Flint, it’s that freedom of information, accountability, and transparency are getting noticed,” says Jane Briggs-Bunting, president of the Michigan Coalition for Open Government, a nonprofit advocacy that promotes government transparency. “People are saying, ‘You know, maybe this could’ve been avoided.’ ”

Indeed, as the crisis has unfolded, the public, advocates, and elected officials have called for reforms to Michigan’s public records law, which is the only one in the nation that statutorily exempts the governor’s office from FOIA requests. Governor Snyder has since released thousands of e-mails related to the Flint crisis. Michigan's Legislature also is exempt from FOIA.

A review of the e-mails revealed a consistent effort among state employees to sidestep disclosure of public records under FOIA, the Detroit Free Press reports. Regardless of content, messages invoked attorney client privilege or were labeled “preliminary and deliberative” – an exemption meant to be used only when the public interest in encouraging honest conversations among government officials clearly eclipsed the public interest in disclosure.

“Not subject to FOIA” was a standard subject heading, a term that has no legal standing, according to the Free Press.

“You have a culture that’s evolved over the years with employees being told they don’t need to be talking about that, or ‘You might get in trouble if you raise that,’ ” Ms. Briggs-Bunting says.

An 'F' for transparency

While the events in Flint were not directly caused by such lack of transparency, what happened does reflect an atmosphere of impunity that merits reform, says John Wonderlich, executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a national nonprofit that advocates for open government.

“I wouldn’t want to say that secrecy caused [the crisis],” he says, “but it certainly made it worse.”

Michigan ranked last in a 2015 national study of state ethics and transparency laws by the Center for Public Integrity and Global Integrity. The two nonprofit groups cited a weak public records law and an absence of laws requiring personal financial disclosures by lawmakers and top state officials for the state's F grade.

Thursday’s hearing is the second of two Flint-related sessions that the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is holding this week. Snyder is set to testify for the first time, as is EPA chief McCarthy.

In prepared testimony obtained by the Associated Press ahead of the hearing, Snyder maintained that he did not know that Flint’s water was contaminated until Oct. 1, 2015 – nearly a year and a half after the city began using the Flint river as its drinking water supply.

He added that as soon as he found out about the lead levels in the water, he returned the city to Detroit’s water system and ordered the distribution of water filters and the testing of residents and children for lead in the blood.

McCarthy, however, said state officials were responsible. She noted that at the time, the city was in the care of a state-appointed emergency manager, who was tasked to balance Flint’s shaky finances and approved the switch from the Detroit system to the Flint river as a way to save money. Pumped through aging pipes and fixtures without adequate corrosion control, the river water exposed Flint residents to “dangerously high levels of lead,” she says.

Yet crucial as it is, the question of who’s at fault in Flint is only one concern, critics say. Just as salient is the broader issue of government accountability – and how to ensure the public and the media are able to exercise their right to know about policy decisions that affect their everyday lives.

“The entire idea behind FOIA laws and other transparency laws is that people can make better decisions when they have accurate information available to them,” says Mike Reitz, executive vice president of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a Michigan-based think tank.

“Representative government doesn’t automatically hold itself accountable,” adds Mr. Wonderlich at the Sunlight Foundation. “In order for democracy to work, the public has to have a basic level of information about what officials are doing.”

Efforts for reform

At the same time, having government officials recognize they are subject to public scrutiny helps prevent abuse of of power.

“When someone is looking over shoulder, you’re more wary about what you’re doing and you make sure you’re doing everything right,” says Briggs-Bunting at the Michigan Coalition for Open Government.

Already some state lawmakers have responded to the crisis by urging greater transparency.

On Friday, House minority leader Tim Greimel released emails and meeting calendars from February at the AP’s request. And on Wednesday, a bipartisan group of House and Senate members unveiled new transparency legislation that would place the governor’s office under the purview of FOIA. In terms of greater transparency in the statehouse, a proposed bill would create a separate Legislative Open Records Act, which would not go as far as FOIA.

Still, that’s only the first step, says Mr. Reitz. Meaningful reform, he says, would include reducing the cost of obtaining public records and providing those records in electronic form. But he doubts such change would take place any time soon.

“[Freedom of information] is not a kitchen table issue for a lot of voters,” Reitz says. “It doesn’t rise to the level of jobs or taxes or education.” As a result, it often takes a crisis like Flint to spur lawmakers and the public to action.

Nonetheless, the events in Flint could bolster awareness of the importance of public information laws not just in Michigan, but across the nation.

“I think it raises concerns about how much trust we’ve put in public officials at a time when a lot of our infrastructure is not in great shape,” Wonderlich says. “It means that there’s no one automatically looking out for when people are going to be severely hurt by failures of that public infrastructure.

“That should be a sobering thought for everyone,” he says.",www.csmonitor.com,center,aQy75F4PQFqVAJOi

A network spokesman told USA Today that Van Susteren's departure had nothing to do with the settlement.

Ailes departed the network over the summer in a move that shook up the cable news landscape.

The timing of Van Susteren's exit raised eyebrows because of the Ailes news and because it is unusual for a political anchor to leave just months before a presidential election.

In a statement, Van Susteren said that Fox ""has not felt like home to me for a few years.""

She said she was leaving now to take advantage of a clause in her contract that allows her to leave but that would have expired.

Fox News co-presidents Jack Abernethy and Bill Shine in their own statement said they were ""grateful"" to Van Susteren for her contributions to the network.

""As one of the best political analysts in the industry, Brit is the ideal choice to host a nightly political program while the most dynamic and captivating election in recent history unfolds,"" Abernethy and Shine said.

""Having Brit at the helm of this show will enable FOX News to continue on track to have its highest-rated year even as the network dominates the cable news landscape.""

Van Susteren's next career move is unclear.

She has described herself as ""a feminist"" who believes in ""equality, no special deals, just equality.""

Carlson filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Ailes about two months ago. Ailes resigned amid an internal investigation two weeks after Carlson filed the suit and denied the allegations.

Hume, who serves as the network's senior political analyst, said he was ""honored"" to be asked to take over the show.

""My FOX News colleagues have set a high standard for political coverage which I'll do my best to uphold.""

“ Time to do what I long ago promised to do . Twitter is a sewer . It brings out the worst in humanity , ” Stephens wrote . “ I sincerely apologize for any part I ’ ve played in making it worse , and to anyone I ’ ve ever hurt . Thanks to all of my followers , but I ’ m deactivating this account . ”
The deactivation comes after Stephens complained in an email to professor David Karpf and the provost of George Washington University that the educator called him a bedbug in a tweet . The reference follows reports on Monday that the Times had an outbreak of bedbugs in its midtown Manhattan newsroom .
`` Someone just pointed out a tweet you wrote about me , calling me a 'bedbug , ' '' Stephens wrote . `` I 'm often amazed about the things supposedly decent people are prepared to say about other people — people they 've never met — on Twitter . I think you 've set a new standard . ''
The Times columnist then invited Karpf to come to his home , meet his wife and children , and then `` call me 'bedbug ' to my face , '' he continued .
`` That would take some genuine courage and intellectual integrity on your part , '' Stephens told the professor . `` I promise to be courteous no matter what you have to say . Maybe it will make you feel better about yourself . ''

NYT 's Stephens roasted for response to bedbug crack : 'Dish it out but ca n't take it '","Conservative New York Times columnist Bret Stephens announced Tuesday that he deactivated his Twitter account after being called a ""bedbug"" by a George Washington University professor.

“Time to do what I long ago promised to do. Twitter is a sewer. It brings out the worst in humanity,” Stephens wrote. “I sincerely apologize for any part I’ve played in making it worse, and to anyone I’ve ever hurt. Thanks to all of my followers, but I’m deactivating this account.”

The deactivation comes after Stephens complained in an email to professor David Karpf and the provost of George Washington University that the educator called him a bedbug in a tweet. The reference follows reports on Monday that the Times had an outbreak of bedbugs in its midtown Manhattan newsroom.

""Someone just pointed out a tweet you wrote about me, calling me a 'bedbug,'"" Stephens wrote. ""I'm often amazed about the things supposedly decent people are prepared to say about other people — people they've never met — on Twitter. I think you've set a new standard.""

The Times columnist then invited Karpf to come to his home, meet his wife and children, and then ""call me 'bedbug' to my face,"" he continued.

""That would take some genuine courage and intellectual integrity on your part,"" Stephens told the professor. ""I promise to be courteous no matter what you have to say. Maybe it will make you feel better about yourself.""

Karpf shared the email from Stephens, which quickly went viral.

So far, at least 17 people have died in weather-related incidents: 15 in South Carolina and two in North Carolina.

At least nine people drowned and six died in traffic accidents, South Carolina's Department of Public Safety said.

North Carolina reported two deaths from traffic accidents, in Cumberland and Jackson counties, a state emergency management spokeswoman said.

Haley said there had been 175 water rescues so far in South Carolina, and more than 800 people were temporarily housed in shelters.

More than 70 miles of Interstate 95 in the state remained closed, with five to eight bridges still awaiting structural checks, she said.

Caskets float away

Of all the scenes of items drifting away in the flooding, perhaps none appeared as dramatic as a casket unearthed from a cemetery.

Wayne Reeves, pastor of New Life Ministries in Summerville, was in the middle of an interview when he saw the casket float away.

So he headed into the waist-deep floodwater to retrieve it.

Intense rain and flooding are expected across much of the state Monday, along with snow and freezing rain in the northern part of Missouri.

Over the weekend, eight people died in flash flooding , including four international soldiers temporarily stationed at Fort Leonard Wood for training.

A witness reported the soldiers' car driving onto a flooded road and immediately getting swept downstream, the Pulaski County Sheriff's Office said.

Authorities found their car several hundred yards from the road, entangled in some brush, the sheriff's department said.

Two soldiers found in the car Saturday night had drowned. The bodies of the other two soldiers were found Sunday morning.

""The possibility of a fifth occupant of the car exists, since an acquaintance of the above men is still missing,"" the sheriff's office said.

The names and nationalities of the four soldiers have not been released.

Two other people in Pulaski County also drowned when their car drove onto a flooded road and was also swept several hundred yards away, authorities said.

Pulaski County Sheriff Ron Long said flash flooding can be particularly dangerous at night.

""Streams turn into rivers, and people sometimes don't see the road has flooded over when they are driving at night,"" he said.

After the Lake of the Ozarks in central Missouri reached dangerously high levels, the gates on the 148-foot Bagnell Dam were opened to release 100,000 cubic feet of water per second, according to a meteorologist for CNN affiliate KY3.

Texas

Dallas-area residents trying to recover from a spate of deadly tornadoes will get hit with snow and near-freezing temperatures Monday.

The area is already grappling with the effects of several tornadoes, including a twister in Garland that killed eight people.

Cars that had been in driveways ended up inside homes. At least one car flipped and landed upside down near a highway overpass.

In Garland, Terri Sykora and her partner, Ronnell Lincoln, were among families of an apartment complex granted access to their homes Monday for the first time since the storm hit the complex.

There were no sirens to warn of the coming twister, Sykora said.

""It got real quiet,"" she recalled. Her partner ""went out and said 'tornado,' and we all went to the bathroom.""

The couple and their three children hid in the bathroom.

On Monday, Sykora reflected on what the family lost.

""I feel so bad for my kids because everything they were so excited for (at Christmas) is gone now,"" she said.

Josh White, another apartment resident, said the storm hit quickly with incredible force.

""I was running toward my closet and the doors and everything started caving in,"" White said. ""And stuff started flying through the windows. Things were just hitting us. I could feel it hitting us, bricks, everything.""

He hid under a mattress with his wife and 5-year-old son.

""This has made me realize how fragile life is,"" he said.

Other tornadoes touched down in nearby Collin and Rockwall counties. At least three people were killed by the storm in Collin County, the sheriff's office said.

David Green walked by the highway Monday, carrying some clothes on hangers. It was his first of several trips to salvage items from his home.

Green said that during the height of the storm he saw both terror and love -- destruction, followed by neighbors helping each other out.

""You take your worst fears, and you roll them up into one big ball, and you take your best feelings and put them in a ball, and combine them, that's what you come out with,"" he said.

Illinois

The National Weather Service has issued winter storm or flood warnings for much of Illinois on Monday.

As in Missouri, several people died over the weekend in Illinois when a motorist tried to drive over a flooded roadway.

Three adults and two children died after their car was swept into a creek in Marion County, Coroner Troy Cannon said.

In Mascoutah, an occupied school bus and a tractor-trailer were swept off the road by floodwaters Monday. Everybody in the vehicles was rescued without injury.

New Mexico, Oklahoma and West Texas

Parts of eastern New Mexico and the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles are under a blizzard warning through Monday evening.

Those areas could get walloped with more than 8 inches of snow, with possible snowdrifts higher than 6 feet, the National Weather Service said.

In Oklahoma, Gov. Mary Fagan declared a state of emergency in all 77 counties. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission reported more than 147,000 power outages statewide. In the eastern part of Oklahoma, many highways remain closed because of flooding, according to the state Department of Emergency Management.

Already, parts of New Mexico have seen more than 16 inches of snow, with drifts as high as 8 feet. That made roads impassable in several counties, Gov. Susana Martinez's office said.

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson asked the city’s police department to conduct an internal investigation on himself Thursday after he was found lying down in a car.

A passerby found Johnson early Thursday in a car parked near a stop sign and called 911. Police department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement that Johnson indicated he parked his car after feeling lightheaded. Officers checked on Johnson’s well-being and didn’t observe any signs of impairment.

Johnson drove himself to his home nearby.

“There were no charges of intoxication, no information of intoxication as far as I know,” Guglielmi said.

Guglielmi says Johnson requested the investigation because he believes officers and the superintendent “ought to be held to the highest standard.”

“So what that means is they’re going to interview the officers, they’re going to look at all available evidence just to make sure that this is above-board and happened as described,” Guglielmi said.

The 59-year-old Johnson underwent kidney transplant surgery in August 2017. His son Daniel was the donor.

Security video showed one of the men , Jason Polanco , firing at the officers with a powerful .44 Magnum pistol as they pursued him Monday night following the robbery in a Bronx grocery store , New York Police Department officials said .
Polanco , 23 , was arrested on attempted murder and robbery charges . The second man , 28-year-old Joshua Kemp , was charged with robbery . The names of their attorneys were not immediately available .
The two wounded officers , Andrew Dossi and Aliro Pellerano , were hospitalized in stable condition , police said at a news conference .
Police officials praised five officers for responding to the robbery report even though their shifts had ended and they were about to head home .
`` I commend them for their courage , '' Chief of Department James O'Neill said . `` They were going home … and they ended up getting into a fierce firefight . ''
Investigators released video early Tuesday that prompted several tips from the public that led to Polanco 's identification and capture , police said . Kemp was caught after seeking treatment for his wound at a hospital , which contacted police .
The officers `` went above and beyond the call to protect their fellow New Yorkers , '' Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference early Tuesday . `` Thank God the officers are doing well and will recover . ''
Officer Andrew Dossi , 30 , was shot in the left arm and lower back . Aliro Pellerano , 38 , was shot in his left arm and chest .
Dossi 's father , Joseph Dossi , told lohud.com that the officers carpooled together from suburban Rockland County . Dossi said his son is in the Army Reserve , a veteran of two tours in Iraq . He said the officer underwent surgery on his arm , which was shattered by a bullet .

USA TODAY

NEW YORK — Two men were charged Tuesday in connection with the shooting of a pair of police officers who were responding to a robbery Monday night, a day after the department buried one of its own.

Security video showed one of the men, Jason Polanco, firing at the officers with a powerful .44 Magnum pistol as they pursued him Monday night following the robbery in a Bronx grocery store, New York Police Department officials said.

Polanco, 23, was arrested on attempted murder and robbery charges. The second man, 28-year-old Joshua Kemp, was charged with robbery. The names of their attorneys were not immediately available.

The two wounded officers, Andrew Dossi and Aliro Pellerano, were hospitalized in stable condition, police said at a news conference.

Police officials praised five officers for responding to the robbery report even though their shifts had ended and they were about to head home.

""I commend them for their courage,"" Chief of Department James O'Neill said. ""They were going home … and they ended up getting into a fierce firefight.""

Investigators released video early Tuesday that prompted several tips from the public that led to Polanco's identification and capture, police said. Kemp was caught after seeking treatment for his wound at a hospital, which contacted police.

The officers ""went above and beyond the call to protect their fellow New Yorkers,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference early Tuesday. ""Thank God the officers are doing well and will recover.""

Officer Andrew Dossi, 30, was shot in the left arm and lower back. Aliro Pellerano, 38, was shot in his left arm and chest.

Dossi's father, Joseph Dossi, told lohud.com that the officers carpooled together from suburban Rockland County. Dossi said his son is in the Army Reserve, a veteran of two tours in Iraq. He said the officer underwent surgery on his arm, which was shattered by a bullet.

""He's groggy, in a bunch of pain,"" his father said. ""It looked like they put some pins in his arm. It looked pretty nasty.""

Police Commissioner William Bratton said the plainclothes officers, part of an anti-crime unit, were coming off their shift late Monday when they spotted two possible suspects in a robbery — one outside a Chinese restaurant and another inside it.

He said when the officers got out of their car, a suspect in the restaurant opened fire, forcing the officers to shoot back. The suspects fled and police believe they carjacked a vehicle occupied by two women. The car was found abandoned and a revolver was found nearby. No further details about the women were made public.

Hours before the shootings, de Blasio had released 2014 statistics that reflected record-low violent crimes across the city. Monday night's shooting came a little more than two weeks after two NYPD officers, Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, were fatally shot in Brooklyn by Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who then killed himself. Liu's funeral, held Sunday, drew thousands of officers from across the nation.

Brinsley had left behind social media posts saying he would be targeting random police officers. The officers shot Monday were in civilian clothes and apparently were not the victims of a vendetta against police, Deputy Chief Kim Royster said.

The latest shooting comes at a time when relations between officers and the mayor are strained. Joseph Dossi told the New York Post his son was not particularly pleased to see the mayor when de Blasio visited the hospital. Dossi said his son ""deals with some crappy people every day and getting no support (from de Blasio), come on. These are the guys in the trenches dealing with anything and everything.""

The organization COP SHOT, Citizens Outraged at Police Being Shot, offered a $10,000 reward leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspects.

Joseph Dossi said his son is not married but has a 8-year-old daughter. Gail Dossi was at her son's side at the hospital.

""He's a patriotic type of guy,"" Joseph Dossi said. ""Besides the Army, he was airborne, jumping and rappelling out of a helicopter. He came up through the ranks. He's now a staff sergeant. He was supposed to go to Africa next week. I guess that's off.""

USA TODAY

When U.S. Magistrate Sheri Pym ruled that Apple must help the FBI break into an iPhone belonging to one of the killers in the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings, the tech world shuddered.

Why? The battle of encryption ""backdoors"" has been longstanding in Silicon Valley, where a company's success could be made or broken based on its ability to protect customer data.

The issue came into the spotlight after Edward Snowden disclosed the extent to which technology and phone companies were letting the U.S. federal government spy on data being transmitted through their network.

Latest: San Bernardino iPhone battle rages

Since Edward Snowden's whistleblowing revelations, Facebook, Apple and Twitter have unilaterally said they are not going to create such backdoors anymore.

So here's the ""backdoor"" the FBI wants: Right now, iPhone users have the option to set a security feature that only allows a certain number of tries to guess the correct passcode to unlock the phone before all the data on the iPhone is deleted. It's a security measure Apple put in place to keep important data out of the wrong hands.

Federal prosecutors looking for more information behind the San Bernardino shootings don’t know the phone's passcode. If they guess incorrectly too many times, the data they hope to find will be deleted.

That's why the FBI wants Apple to disable the security feature. Once the security is crippled, agents would be able to guess as many combinations as possible.

Kurt Opsahl, general counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco-based digital rights non-profit, explained that this ""backdoor"" means Apple will have to to write brand new code that will compromise key features of the phone's security. Apple has five business days to respond to the request.

What does Apple have to say about this? Apple CEO Tim Cook said late Tuesday that the company would oppose the ruling. In a message to customers published on Apple's website, he said: ""We can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack. For years, cryptologists and national security experts have been warning against weakening encryption. Doing so would hurt only the well-meaning and law-abiding citizens who rely on companies like Apple to protect their data.""

Back in December, Cook defended the company's use of encryption on its mobile devices, saying users should not have to trade privacy for national security, in a broad interview with 60 Minutes. In the interview, Cook stood by the company's stance of refusing to offer encrypted texts and messages from users.

What does this mean for the next time the government wants access? The order doesn't create a precedent in the sense that other courts will be compelled to follow it, but it will give the government more ammunition.

What do digital rights experts have to say? There are two things that make this order very dangerous, Opsahl said. The first is the question it raises about who can make this type of demand. If the U.S. government can force Apple to do this, why can't the Chinese or Russian governments?

The second is that while the government is requesting a program to allow it to break into this one, specific iPhone, once the program is created it will essentially be a master key. It would be possible for the government to take this key, modify it and use it on other phones. That risks a lot, that the government will have this power and it will not be misused, he said.

And the lawmakers? Well, they are torn. Key House Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., says Congress shouldn't force tech companies to have encryption backdoors. Congress is struggling with how to handle the complex issue.

On the other side of things, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Vice Chair Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., say they want to require tech companies to provide a backdoor into encrypted communication when law enforcement officials obtain a court order to investigate a specific person.

Ferried by motorcade to the Capitol along streets bathed in the auburn afternoon sun , the president ended his journey along Constitution Avenue , adorned with U.S. and D.C. flags flying from lamp posts .

Ferried by motorcade to the Capitol along streets bathed in the auburn afternoon sun, the president ended his journey along Constitution Avenue, adorned with U.S. and D.C. flags flying from lamp posts.

The military honor guard hefted his casket up the East Front steps and into the Rotunda — the same room he strolled as a congressman in the late 1960s, and which he later strode through in 1989, after taking the presidential oath of office on the Capitol’s West Front steps.

“Today, this hero has returned to the Capitol a final time,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican. “Not on the front porch of our democracy, this time — but here, in its hallowed cathedral. Beneath paintings that tell the story of our land and our liberty. And flanked by statues of his fellow champions whom he joined in making that story possible.

President George W. Bush, son of the late president and himself “No. 43” in the line of presidents, led the Bush family in the ceremonial duties at the arrival of the casket and the early commemorations.

The late president will lie in state through Wednesday morning, when he’ll be taken from the Capitol a final time, escorted to Washington National Cathedral for a memorial service then flown back to Texas for burial Thursday at his presidential library at Texas A&M University.

Controversial as a politician, the 41st president has been feted in death as the embodiment of a public servant — with some of the commemorations pointedly contrasting him with the current White House occupant.

Vice President Mike Pence, though, sought to turn those tables. Addressing the Bush family and other guests in the Rotunda, he compared himself to the late president, saying they both served outsider presidents who came to Washington to cut taxes, rebuild the military and “shake things up.”

“President Bush was a great leader who made a great difference in the life of this nation. But he was also just a good man,” Mr. Pence said.

As official Washington paid its respects inside the Capitol, Americans queued up outside the Capitol Visitor Center for their chance.

Mary Kasper, of Arlington, Virginia, said she was working abroad in London during the first Gulf War, deemed an unqualified success on Mr. Bush’s watch. Ms. Kasper said the president’s steady hand showed through those tumultuous years.

“He gave me confidence that things would be all right,” she said. “I don’t think there are leaders like that today — the World War II generation, especially.”

Randy Bates, a 48-year-old Idaho resident, decided to pay his respects because he was in town for work.

“He was the first president I voted for,” he said, calling the late president someone who felt “public service is more important than politics.”

Even witnessing the motorcade was enough for some.

“We happened to be able to be here on this day and we were so happy to be able to experience this event. I told my kids this is not something you see in most lifetimes,” said Laura Caruso, who was in the midst of a move from Pennsylvania to Florida and had stopped in D.C.

general_news,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/23/secret-service-left-bush-41-potentially-vulnerable/,Secret Service left Bush 41 vulnerable; house alarm broken for 13 months,2015-04-23,David Sherfinski,"The Department of Homeland Security ’ s Office of Inspector General ( OIG ) has found that alarms at the Houston home of former President George H.W . Bush were broken for more than a year — the latest embarrassment for the embattled Secret Service .
No security breach occurred during the 13-month period when the alarm was broken , but the OIG review found problems with identifying , reporting and tracking alarm system malfunctions and repairing and replacing alarm systems .
In 2010 , a Secret Service security expert requested a replacement for an alarm system that had been installed around 1993 , but the request was denied in August 2011 . In July 2012 , the Secret Service made “ limited upgrades using repurposed and new equipment , ” according to the report from Inspector General John Roth .
After an alarm system failure in September 2013 , the Secret Service ’ s protective division placed one of the protective employees assigned to the resident in a “ roving post ” while others could monitor the property via cameras , the report said .
“ BPD ’ s protocol also included ensuring all access points into the residence were locked at night , ” the report said .
But since officials could not determine the exact time period when the post started , there could have been a time when protectees were in the residence without a “ roving post ” or alarm , the report said .
Most officials thought posting a person provided an acceptable level of security , though one official thought the alarm problem reprinted a “ medium risk ” and was concerned that a roving post was an “ inadequate substitute . ”
The report provides another example in a string of recent agency missteps dealing with security . Mr. Roth ’ s office said it is also investigating the 2014 White House fence-jumping incident and more recent allegations that intoxicated agents drove through a suspicious package investigation last month .
The chairman and ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said in a joint statement that it is “ startling and unacceptable ” that the alarm remained inoperable for more than a year and that the incident adds to the growing list of “ significant concerns ” Congress has had with management at the agency .
“ Although the Secret Service assigned employees to monitor the grounds , there is absolutely no room for error when it comes to protecting the nation ’ s presidents , ” said Rep. Jason Chaffetz , Utah Republican and the committee ’ s chairman , and Rep. Elijah Cummings , Maryland Democrat and the panel ’ s ranking member .
For his part , the 41st president weighed in Thursday morning via social media , tweeting : “ Barbara and I have great respect for , and confidence in , the men and women of @ SecretService . That respect and confidence has never waned . ”
In mid-January 2014 , the Secret Service got a permanent replacement alarm for the residence and a temporary one was installed in April 2014 .
The new equipment was installed in November and December 2014 , with some of the reasons for the delay provided including “ accommodating a plan for installing windows and making decisions on how to install the new system . ”
The report indicated that there were also issues with security equipment at the home of at least one other former president , though names were redacted . Mr. Roth said he was bringing the vulnerabilities to Secret Services Director Joseph Clancy ’ s attention because they may be affecting other residences .
Mr. Roth recommended that the Secret Service evaluate the status of its security equipment at all protectees ’ personal residences and evaluate the process for tracking maintenance requests at residences as well .
Mr. Clancy said in response to the recommendations that the Secret Service completed needs assessments for the residences in January and that closed camera television systems were 100 percent operational at the time . Replacement of the security systems has been included in the agency ’ s fiscal 2017 budget plan .
Mr. Clancy also said a new process for tracking maintenance requests has been implemented using an existing tracking system for similar requests at the White House .
“ It is imperative that Director Clancy act swiftly on a host of fronts to restore the American people ’ s confidence in this agency , ” Mr. Chaffetz and Mr. Cummings said . “ We are grateful for the diligent work of Inspector General Roth in bringing this issue to light . Director Clancy has assured the IG that the recommendations to resolve these problems will be implemented quickly , and we strongly urge him to maintain that commitment . ”","The Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) has found that alarms at the Houston home of former President George H.W.

The report provides another example in a string of recent agency missteps dealing with security. Mr. Roth’s office said it is also investigating the 2014 White House fence-jumping incident and more recent allegations that intoxicated agents drove through a suspicious package investigation last month.

The chairman and ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said in a joint statement that it is “startling and unacceptable” that the alarm remained inoperable for more than a year and that the incident adds to the growing list of “significant concerns” Congress has had with management at the agency.

“Although the Secret Service assigned employees to monitor the grounds, there is absolutely no room for error when it comes to protecting the nation’s presidents,” said Rep. Jason Chaffetz, Utah Republican and the committee’s chairman, and Rep. Elijah Cummings, Maryland Democrat and the panel’s ranking member.

For his part, the 41st president weighed in Thursday morning via social media, tweeting: “Barbara and I have great respect for, and confidence in, the men and women of @SecretService. That respect and confidence has never waned.”

In mid-January 2014, the Secret Service got a permanent replacement alarm for the residence and a temporary one was installed in April 2014.

The new equipment was installed in November and December 2014, with some of the reasons for the delay provided including “accommodating a plan for installing windows and making decisions on how to install the new system.”

The report indicated that there were also issues with security equipment at the home of at least one other former president, though names were redacted. Mr. Roth said he was bringing the vulnerabilities to Secret Services Director Joseph Clancy’s attention because they may be affecting other residences.

Mr. Roth recommended that the Secret Service evaluate the status of its security equipment at all protectees’ personal residences and evaluate the process for tracking maintenance requests at residences as well.

Mr. Clancy said in response to the recommendations that the Secret Service completed needs assessments for the residences in January and that closed camera television systems were 100 percent operational at the time. Replacement of the security systems has been included in the agency’s fiscal 2017 budget plan.

Mr. Clancy also said a new process for tracking maintenance requests has been implemented using an existing tracking system for similar requests at the White House.

“It is imperative that Director Clancy act swiftly on a host of fronts to restore the American people’s confidence in this agency,” Mr. Chaffetz and Mr. Cummings said. “We are grateful for the diligent work of Inspector General Roth in bringing this issue to light. Director Clancy has assured the IG that the recommendations to resolve these problems will be implemented quickly, and we strongly urge him to maintain that commitment.”

This story is part of the New Boom series on millennials in America.

They are a class of self-centered, self-absorbed, selfie-snapping 20-somethings. This is how many critics have come to define the millennial generation.

But hold on, isn't this what was said about every generation when it was young? Minus the selfies of course.

Some scholars argue that millennials aren't entitled — they just have more time to be themselves.

Markers Of Adulthood

The rise of individualism has been going on for centuries, says Jean Twenge, a psychology professor at San Diego State University and author of Generation Me: Why Today's Young Americans Are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled — and More Miserable Than Ever Before.

How we define adulthood has also changed, says Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, a research professor at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., and the director of the Clark Poll of Emerging Adults. People used to feel like adults once they got married or had children, but that's not so much the case anymore.

The 2014 Clark Established Adult Poll found that the top three markers for adulthood were accepting responsibility for self, financial independence and making independent decisions.

Twenge first encountered this rise in individualism when she was doing a project on gender roles in the 1990s. Both women and men scored high on this masculine scale that includes highly individualistic traits, such as being independent, relying on yourself, being a leader, etc. Twenge began studying other traits such as self-esteem and extroversion and recognized a pattern that these traits were all increasing over time.

""You have emerging adulthood — taking more time to find yourself in your 20s,"" Twenge says. ""By definition that is an individualistic pursuit. 'I want to have that time to myself before I settle down.' That is one that is unknown in traditional collectivist societies.""

But Arnett wouldn't fully agree with Twenge's definition of emerging adulthood — a term he coined in his 2004 book, Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from Late Teens through the Twenties.

""It's partly that, but it's more than that,"" Arnett says. ""There's a space that's opened up in the 20s that is the most individualistic time of life. When you think about it, when are you freer from social rules than in your 20s?""

""I describe it as the self-focused time in life,"" he says. ""I don't mean that they're selfish; I mean that they have fewer social rules and obligations — the freedom to be self-directed.""

'Stable Jobs Aren't Easy To Come By'

Emerging adults are ages 18 to the mid- to late 20s, so right now, the second wave of the millennial generation falls into this group.

But of course this phase of life wasn't always there. Fifty years ago, the median age of marriage for women was 20. Today, it's 27, according to the Pew Research Center.

""I think it's hard for young women today to understand the kind of pressure their grandmothers were under to find a husband,"" Arnett says.

Less Politics, More Social Change

While increased individualism opened up new opportunities to people, some researchers suggest that democracy won't fare well in the long-run.

Specifically, civic engagement and social capital declined equally between the baby boomers and Generation X, and Generation X and the millennials, Twenge says.

South Africa 's department of correctional services has policies in place for dealing with physically disabled inmates , Erfani-Ghadimi said .
`` Policy and practice , however , are often poles apart . Unfortunately , prisoners with disabilities face the same inhumane conditions as other able-bodied inmates . ''
Correctional Services Department spokesman Koos Gerber previously told CNN that South Africa 's detention facilities , whether for remand prisoners or those serving prison terms , `` can accommodate people with any disabilities . ''
There 's been speculation that Pistorius could be sent to Pretoria Central Prison , although no one really knows .
It 's not easy for rights researchers to get access inside , Erfani-Ghadimi said . But the prison does not have the best reputation .
The Pretoria News reported last year on a case brought by six inmates who told Pretoria High Court of having to share a single cell with others , with no ventilation , dirty mattresses and no bedding . They were locked up for 18 hours a day , the court heard , and threatened with sexual violence by gangs .
On average , Erfani-Ghadimi said , South African prisons are overcrowded , putting a strain on sanitation , ventilation and medical care .
The overcrowding means three men may share a single cell , or communal cells for 40 people are jammed with double the number they were intended to hold , with men sleeping in double or triple bunks , according to the Wits Justice Project .
One of the biggest risks associated with that is contracting tuberculosis , labeled the biggest killer in South Africa 's prisons in a recent report , Erfani-Ghadimi said . The disease spreads easily in packed , steamy cells with little air .

Speaking earlier this year , Correctional Services Minister Sibusiso Ndebele said that `` overcrowding at correctional facilities is a global challenge , '' and that South Africa 's prison population had dropped over the past decade .
As of April this year , there were about 157,400 inmates , of whom nearly 28 % were on remand -- a term used for pretrial custody , according to official figures . The country 's total population is about 54 million .
There 's no doubt that Pistorius ' case has put South Africa 's justice system under the international spotlight .

When he was first detained after Steenkamp 's killing , the African National Congress Women 's League complained that he got special treatment , both in where he was held and in access to his family .
Some impoverished suspects who ca n't afford a lawyer or bail spend months or even years waiting for their cases just to come to court . But Pistorius was released on bail with relaxed conditions , and his trial began little more than a year after Steenkamp 's death on February 14 , 2013 .
Erfani-Ghadimi describes his progress through the legal system as `` an anomaly '' in terms of both speed and the expert resources dedicated to it .
`` Other cases normally take much longer , and both the victims and the accused face the strong probability of a miscarriage of justice , '' she wrote in a piece published on The Conversation website
However , when it comes to serving time in prison , the athlete 's fame -- and the extra attention that goes with it -- could be a double-edged sword when it comes to getting special privileges , she told CNN .
`` A lot of people are able to subvert ( the system ) and pay bribes and get away with things , but he has n't been able to , '' she said . `` But on the other hand he has been able to get advantages that other people have n't . ''
The Wits Justice Project has highlighted the case of paraplegic inmate Ronnie Fakude , held on remand for 28 months before being freed on bail earlier this year with an electronic tag , in a pilot monitoring project .
Before his release , he described his experience to Carolyn Raphaely , a senior journalist with the project .
`` I 'm a 50-year-old paraplegic and have been awaiting trial for more than two years since my arrest on fraud charges in December 2011 . I ca n't walk , I ca n't control my bowel or bladder and have to wear disposable baby nappies which my family buy for me . I 'm paralysed from level four and do n't have a wheelchair , '' he said , according to the project .
`` If I use my [ crutches ] I have to pull my legs and throw them to the front . That 's how I walk . Living here is very hard . We are 88 men in this cell which is meant for 32 .

Pretoria Central

South Africa's department of correctional services has policies in place for dealing with physically disabled inmates, Erfani-Ghadimi said.

""Policy and practice, however, are often poles apart. Unfortunately, prisoners with disabilities face the same inhumane conditions as other able-bodied inmates.""

Correctional Services Department spokesman Koos Gerber previously told CNN that South Africa's detention facilities, whether for remand prisoners or those serving prison terms, ""can accommodate people with any disabilities.""

There's been speculation that Pistorius could be sent to Pretoria Central Prison, although no one really knows.

They were locked up for 18 hours a day, the court heard, and threatened with sexual violence by gangs.

Medical care 'overstretched'

On average, Erfani-Ghadimi said, South African prisons are overcrowded, putting a strain on sanitation, ventilation and medical care.

The overcrowding means three men may share a single cell, or communal cells for 40 people are jammed with double the number they were intended to hold, with men sleeping in double or triple bunks, according to the Wits Justice Project.

One of the biggest risks associated with that is contracting tuberculosis, labeled the biggest killer in South Africa's prisons in a recent report, Erfani-Ghadimi said. The disease spreads easily in packed, steamy cells with little air.

Double-edged sword

There's no doubt that Pistorius' case has put South Africa's justice system under the international spotlight.

While the scrutiny may have been uncomfortable at time for South African authorities, it appears to have worked in the track star's favor until now.

When he was first detained after Steenkamp's killing, the African National Congress Women's League complained that he got special treatment, both in where he was held and in access to his family.

""A lot of people are able to subvert (the system) and pay bribes and get away with things, but he hasn't been able to,"" she said. ""But on the other hand he has been able to get advantages that other people haven't.""

'Living here is very hard'

Some of these differences may be stark.

The Wits Justice Project has highlighted the case of paraplegic inmate Ronnie Fakude, held on remand for 28 months before being freed on bail earlier this year with an electronic tag , in a pilot monitoring project.

Before his release, he described his experience to Carolyn Raphaely, a senior journalist with the project.

""I'm a 50-year-old paraplegic and have been awaiting trial for more than two years since my arrest on fraud charges in December 2011. I can't walk, I can't control my bowel or bladder and have to wear disposable baby nappies which my family buy for me. I'm paralysed from level four and don't have a wheelchair,"" he said, according to the project.

""If I use my [crutches] I have to pull my legs and throw them to the front. That's how I walk. Living here is very hard. We are 88 men in this cell which is meant for 32. Sometimes there are more. Twelve people sleep in two bunks pushed together, that's six on the top and six on the bottom. I have my own bed on the bottom, which is a privilege. Luckily, I don't have to share because of my medical status.

""There are eight or 10 people with TB in this cell and four or five we know are HIV-positive. A guy with multi-drug resistant TB sleeps on top of me. I feel vulnerable all the time.""

Erfani-Ghadimi argues that as a severely disabled man, Fakude should never have been in detention at all. And if she had her way, the same would be true for Pistorius.",www.cnn.com,left,0I0gPyfAePgTNrd8

In his remarks to the media during his visit , the president noted , after saluting the various local , state and federal muckety-mucks with him on the riser , the extraordinary efforts of ordinary people in response to the floodwaters .
What Obama was talking about were the exploits of the “ Cajun Navy , ” as it ’ s been nicknamed ; that ’ s nothing more than a large , unorganized collection of small boat owners who raced into the affected areas to conduct house-to-house rescues of people whose homes were inundated . He was also talking about the tens of thousands of people in South Louisiana and elsewhere who took up collections of food , clothing , supplies , and money to aid those affected by the waters . And he was also talking about the churches and businesses — the oft-mentioned story of Celtic Media being a prime example — which opened their doors as shelters for flood refugees without any place else to go .
Taken as a whole , yes — those efforts are extraordinary . But as my friend Dustin Clouatre , who as an unofficial , unrecruited and unsupervised “ member ” of the Cajun Navy who took his bass boat to flooded areas and rescued nearly 150 people from those murky , pungent waters , said to an interviewer from New Orleans ’ WWL-TV Tuesday , “ It ’ s just people helping people . ”
Meaning on an individual basis there is nothing extraordinary at all to what the Cajun Navy , or Celtic Media , or the churches , or the volunteers , did in rendering aid to those who needed it . Those were ordinary people of goodwill doing what ordinary people of goodwill do .
Three times the rainfall doused South Louisiana during that flood event as fell during Katrina . And while the flooding isn ’ t the same — flooding from heavy rains will ruin your day , but flooding from a storm surge is more likely to knock your house off its foundation and high winds from a hurricane can blow it apart , and the latter two weren ’ t present this time — the number of homes affected easily rivals that of Katrina . The Baton Rouge Area Chamber ’ s most recent estimate of flood damage just in the area of the capital city is that some 42 percent of the region ’ s homes were affected , or as many as 145,000 homes . Given that number , and given the floodwaters were as high as five or six feet , and given that this was not a named storm complete with evacuation notices and the usual preparations in advance of a hurricane brewing offshore , you would expect casualty figures not dissimilar to the 1,800 or so people who died during Katrina .

To only lose 13 souls thus far is something just short of a miracle .
And it ’ s a miracle pulled off by those ordinary people of goodwill doing things which , at the end of the day , were not all that extraordinary . If it weren ’ t for the Cajun Navy pulling people off their rooftops and balconies , if those people had to wait for the Coast Guard , the cops , the game wardens or the National Guard , that death toll would have been a lot higher . As it was in Katrina .

Tuesday, President Barack Obama landed in Baton Rouge to tour the devastation of the historic flood in South Louisiana. In his remarks to the media during his visit, the president noted, after saluting the various local, state and federal muckety-mucks with him on the riser, the extraordinary efforts of ordinary people in response to the floodwaters.

What Obama was talking about were the exploits of the “Cajun Navy,” as it’s been nicknamed; that’s nothing more than a large, unorganized collection of small boat owners who raced into the affected areas to conduct house-to-house rescues of people whose homes were inundated. He was also talking about the tens of thousands of people in South Louisiana and elsewhere who took up collections of food, clothing, supplies, and money to aid those affected by the waters. And he was also talking about the churches and businesses — the oft-mentioned story of Celtic Media being a prime example — which opened their doors as shelters for flood refugees without any place else to go.

Taken as a whole, yes — those efforts are extraordinary. But as my friend Dustin Clouatre, who as an unofficial, unrecruited and unsupervised “member” of the Cajun Navy who took his bass boat to flooded areas and rescued nearly 150 people from those murky, pungent waters, said to an interviewer from New Orleans’ WWL-TV Tuesday, “It’s just people helping people.”

Meaning on an individual basis there is nothing extraordinary at all to what the Cajun Navy, or Celtic Media, or the churches, or the volunteers, did in rendering aid to those who needed it. Those were ordinary people of goodwill doing what ordinary people of goodwill do.

But the result is what’s extraordinary.

Three times the rainfall doused South Louisiana during that flood event as fell during Katrina. And while the flooding isn’t the same — flooding from heavy rains will ruin your day, but flooding from a storm surge is more likely to knock your house off its foundation and high winds from a hurricane can blow it apart, and the latter two weren’t present this time — the number of homes affected easily rivals that of Katrina. The Baton Rouge Area Chamber’s most recent estimate of flood damage just in the area of the capital city is that some 42 percent of the region’s homes were affected, or as many as 145,000 homes. Given that number, and given the floodwaters were as high as five or six feet, and given that this was not a named storm complete with evacuation notices and the usual preparations in advance of a hurricane brewing offshore, you would expect casualty figures not dissimilar to the 1,800 or so people who died during Katrina.

The actual death toll from the current floods was 13, as of this writing. It might go higher, but not greatly so by current appearances.

Every death is a tragedy, let’s not forget that obvious fact. But in an event like this with as little warning as was available here, before the floodwaters began to recede a week ago there was speculation of hundreds of fatalities. To only lose 13 souls thus far is something just short of a miracle.

And it’s a miracle pulled off by those ordinary people of goodwill doing things which, at the end of the day, were not all that extraordinary. If it weren’t for the Cajun Navy pulling people off their rooftops and balconies, if those people had to wait for the Coast Guard, the cops, the game wardens or the National Guard, that death toll would have been a lot higher. As it was in Katrina.

That’s not a slur against those government agencies, mind you. It’s the dependence on the government as the sole provider of aid to those who need it which produces the bad effect. As we saw during Katrina.

There’s a term for what all those volunteers have been up to here. That term is “civil society.” It describes the sum of positive human interactions arising from free people using their abilities to cooperate with one another in enlightened self-interest. Nobody had to pay these people to help their neighbors; a lot of people are taking time out of their lives to help friends, neighbors, and even strangers pull sheetrock and flooring from flooded houses (and that is not a fun job, believe me) without demanding a paycheck.

It takes good citizens to make a good society. It takes a healthy civil society to produce those good citizens.

We’ve seen that in South Louisiana. Even Obama, whose presidency has been an all-out assault on voluntary associations, has had to recognize it.

Rodriguez, Don Thompson","OROVILLE , Calif. ( AP ) — Nearly 200,000 people remained under evacuation orders Monday as California authorities try to fix erosion of the emergency spillway at the nation ’ s tallest dam that could unleash uncontrolled flood waters if it fails .
About 150 miles northeast of San Francisco , Lake Oroville — one of California ’ s largest man-made lakes — had water levels so high that an emergency spillway was used Saturday for the first time in almost 50 years after its main spillway was damaged during recent heavy rain .
The evacuation was ordered Sunday afternoon after engineers spotted a hole on the concrete lip of the secondary spillway for the 770-foot-tall Oroville Dam and told authorities that it could fail within the hour .

About 188,000 residents of owns in Yuba , Sutter and Butte counties remained under evacuation orders .
Acting Director Department of Water Resources Bill Croyle said officials will be able to assess the damage to the emergency spillway now that the lake levels have been lowered .
The erosion at the head of the emergency spillway threatens to undermine the concrete weir and allow large , uncontrolled releases of water from Lake Oroville .

Croyle said the department will continue releasing as much as 100,000 cubic feet per second from the main spillway to try and reduce the dam ’ s level by 50 feet ahead of upcoming storms forecast to reach the area Wednesday .

(AP) — Nearly 200,000 people remained under evacuation orders Monday as California authorities try to fix erosion of the emergency spillway at the nation’s tallest dam that could unleash uncontrolled flood waters if it fails.

“It was one of the most beautiful towns of Italy and now there’s nothing left,” she said, too distraught to give her name. “I don’t know what we’ll do.”

Rescue crews in Italy

“The Apennine mountains in central Italy have the highest seismic hazard in Western Europe and earthquakes of this magnitude are common,” noted Richard Walters, a lecturer in Earth sciences at Durham University in Britain.

The devastation harked back to the 2009 quake that killed more than 300 people in and around L’Aquila, about 55 miles south of the latest quake. The town, which still hasn’t fully recovered, sent emergency teams Wednesday to help with the rescue and set up tent camps for residents unwilling to stay indoors because of aftershocks.

Another hard-hit town was Pescara del Tronto, in the Le Marche region, where the main road was covered in debris.

Residents were digging their neighbors out by hand before emergency crews arrived. Aerial photos taken by regional firefighters showed the town essentially flattened and under a thick gray coat of dust; Italy requested EU satellite images of the whole area to get the scope of the damage.

Rescue crews survey damage

“There are broken liquor bottles all over the place,” said Gino Petrucci, owner of a bar in nearby Arquata Del Tronto where he was beginning the long cleanup.

One rescue was particularly delicate as a ranger in Capodacqua, in the Marche province of Ascoli Piceno, diplomatically tried to keep an 80-year-old woman calm as she begged to get to a toilet, even though she was trapped in the rubble.

“Listen, I know it’s not nice to say but if you need to pee you just do it,” he said. “Now I move away a little bit and you do pee, please.”

The mayor of Accumoli, Stefano Petrucci, said a family of four had died there, one of the few young families who had decided to stay in the area. He wept as he noted that the tiny hamlet of 700 swells to 2,000 in the summer months, and that he feared for the future of the town.

“I hope they don’t forget us,” he told Sky TG24.

President Barack Obama, speaking by telephone to Italian President Sergio Mattarella, said the U.S. sent its thoughts and prayers to the quake victims and saluted the “quick action” by first responders, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

A 1997 quake killed a dozen people in central Italy and severely damaged one of the jewels of Umbria, the Basilica of St. Francis in Assisi, filled with Giotto frescoes. The Franciscan friars who are the custodians of the basilica reported no immediate damage from Wednesday’s temblor.

With gasoline prices rising, Sen. Chuck Schumer placed the blame on President Donald Trump, and specifically his decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. But experts say that decision has had only a modest effect so far on rising prices at the pump.

The number of people who died after a newly placed pedestrian bridge collapsed at Florida International University has risen to six , as crews work to clear debris and wreckage from the scene in Miami-Dade County .
In addition to the six people who were found dead at the site , 10 others were transported to area hospitals , Miami-Dade Police said in an update on the accident Friday morning .
Weighing some 950 tons , the pedestrian bridge was still under construction along the edge of Florida International University 's campus when it collapsed Thursday afternoon on a major roadway , trapping motorists and passengers underneath .
`` We have multiple victims ; the number has n't been determined yet , '' Miami Dade County Deputy Mayor Maurice Kemp said at a news conference Thursday afternoon .
Initially , authorities said four bodies had been recovered , but later , Miami Dade Police spokesman Alvaro Zabaleta said the remains of two more people had been removed from the debris .
`` They 're still working away at that concrete , '' Zabaleta said at a news conference early Friday .
`` Engineers told us last night that it has to be done very carefully . Not only because we have to preserve evidence , not only because there might be possible victims under there and we have to treat it very delicately . But because of the safety of the rescuers , '' he said .
Video footage showed the bridge collapsed onto a multilane highway , crushing vehicles underneath , and several people being loaded into ambulances .
More than 100 search-and-rescue workers were using heavy equipment , search dogs and cranes , officials said .
Officials asked the public to avoid the area `` indefinitely '' and directed people worried about loved ones to get in touch with the family reunification center on FIU 's campus .
In a news conference late Thursday evening , FIU President Mark Rosenberg recalled that his university 's community had just celebrated over the weekend a milestone in the erection of the bridge , a project which was originally begun in 2010 .
`` This bridge was about collaboration , it was about hope , it was about opportunity , it was about determination , '' he said . Now we 're feeling immense sadness , uncontrollable sadness . ''
`` All we can do is promise a very thorough investigation — getting to the bottom of this , '' Rosenberg said . `` And mourn those who we 've lost . ''
Figg Bridge Engineers designed the bridge and said in a statement it was `` stunned by today 's tragic collapse '' and would fully cooperate in an investigation .
`` In our 40-year history , nothing like this has ever happened before , '' the statement said .
Member station WLRN reports , `` Figg was fined for the South Norfolk Jordan Bridge collapse in 2012 in Virginia . According to the Virginia Pilot , the state issued four $ 7,000 fines '' for violations that ranged from changing a girder to not performing inspections .
MCM Construction was building the Florida bridge and posted a statement expressing distress over the collapse and referring to a loss of life .
Witnesses tell WLRN the structure fell without warning around 1:30 p.m. as a traffic light went red and concrete fell on stopped vehicles . Other motorists rushed out of their cars to help .
The main span of the bridge was installed on Saturday . The bridge was not expected to open to foot traffic until early next year , reports The Associated Press .
It was intended to boost student safety , spanning a portion of U.S. Highway 41 known as the Tamiami Trail , to help people cross from campus to the city of Sweetwater , where the university said thousands of students live .
The National Transportation Safety Board said it would send a `` go team '' to investigate the incident .
In a Tuesday news release , the university touted the rapid installation of the `` first-of-its-kind pedestrian bridge , '' which the AP explains allowed it to be `` prefabricated then swung into place before its central support tower was built . ''
`` The 174-foot , 950-ton section of the bridge was built adjacent to Southwest Eight Street using Accelerated Bridge Construction ( ABC ) methods , which are being advanced at FIU 's Accelerated Bridge Construction University Transportation Center ( ABC-UTC ) . This method of construction reduces potential risks to workers , commuters and pedestrians and minimizes traffic interruptions . The main span of the FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge was installed in a few hours with limited disruption to traffic over this weekend . ''
A now-deleted tweet posted by FIU on Tuesday displayed a photo of the bridge .
In Tuesday 's release , the university added , `` The FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge is the largest pedestrian bridge moved via Self-Propelled Modular Transportation in U.S. history .

Updated at 8 a.m. ET on Friday

The number of people who died after a newly placed pedestrian bridge collapsed at Florida International University has risen to six, as crews work to clear debris and wreckage from the scene in Miami-Dade County.

In addition to the six people who were found dead at the site, 10 others were transported to area hospitals, Miami-Dade Police said in an update on the accident Friday morning.

Weighing some 950 tons, the pedestrian bridge was still under construction along the edge of Florida International University's campus when it collapsed Thursday afternoon on a major roadway, trapping motorists and passengers underneath.

""We have multiple victims; the number hasn't been determined yet,"" Miami Dade County Deputy Mayor Maurice Kemp said at a news conference Thursday afternoon.

Initially, authorities said four bodies had been recovered, but later, Miami Dade Police spokesman Alvaro Zabaleta said the remains of two more people had been removed from the debris.

""They're still working away at that concrete,"" Zabaleta said at a news conference early Friday.

""Engineers told us last night that it has to be done very carefully. Not only because we have to preserve evidence, not only because there might be possible victims under there and we have to treat it very delicately. But because of the safety of the rescuers,"" he said.

Video footage showed the bridge collapsed onto a multilane highway, crushing vehicles underneath, and several people being loaded into ambulances.

More than 100 search-and-rescue workers were using heavy equipment, search dogs and cranes, officials said.

Officials asked the public to avoid the area ""indefinitely"" and directed people worried about loved ones to get in touch with the family reunification center on FIU's campus.

In a news conference late Thursday evening, FIU President Mark Rosenberg recalled that his university's community had just celebrated over the weekend a milestone in the erection of the bridge, a project which was originally begun in 2010.

""This bridge was about collaboration, it was about hope, it was about opportunity, it was about determination,"" he said. Now we're feeling immense sadness, uncontrollable sadness.""

""All we can do is promise a very thorough investigation — getting to the bottom of this,"" Rosenberg said. ""And mourn those who we've lost.""

Figg Bridge Engineers designed the bridge and said in a statement it was ""stunned by today's tragic collapse"" and would fully cooperate in an investigation.

""In our 40-year history, nothing like this has ever happened before,"" the statement said.

Member station WLRN reports, ""Figg was fined for the South Norfolk Jordan Bridge collapse in 2012 in Virginia. According to the Virginia Pilot, the state issued four $7,000 fines"" for violations that ranged from changing a girder to not performing inspections.

MCM Construction was building the Florida bridge and posted a statement expressing distress over the collapse and referring to a loss of life.

Witnesses tell WLRN the structure fell without warning around 1:30 p.m. as a traffic light went red and concrete fell on stopped vehicles. Other motorists rushed out of their cars to help.

The main span of the bridge was installed on Saturday. The bridge was not expected to open to foot traffic until early next year, reports The Associated Press.

It was intended to boost student safety, spanning a portion of U.S. Highway 41 known as the Tamiami Trail, to help people cross from campus to the city of Sweetwater, where the university said thousands of students live.

The university is currently on spring break.

The National Transportation Safety Board said it would send a ""go team"" to investigate the incident.

In a Tuesday news release, the university touted the rapid installation of the ""first-of-its-kind pedestrian bridge,"" which the AP explains allowed it to be ""prefabricated then swung into place before its central support tower was built.""

""The 174-foot, 950-ton section of the bridge was built adjacent to Southwest Eight Street using Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC) methods, which are being advanced at FIU's Accelerated Bridge Construction University Transportation Center (ABC-UTC). This method of construction reduces potential risks to workers, commuters and pedestrians and minimizes traffic interruptions. The main span of the FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge was installed in a few hours with limited disruption to traffic over this weekend.""

A now-deleted tweet posted by FIU on Tuesday displayed a photo of the bridge.

In Tuesday's release, the university added, ""The FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge is the largest pedestrian bridge moved via Self-Propelled Modular Transportation in U.S. history. It is also the first in the world to be constructed entirely of self-cleaning concrete. When exposed to sunlight, the titanium dioxide in the concrete captures pollutants and turns it bright white, reducing maintenance costs.""

The world's richest man, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has accused the owner of a US gossip magazine of trying to blackmail him over private pictures.

He said the National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc (AMI), wanted him to stop investigating how they had obtained his private messages.

Hours after Mr Bezos announced his divorce last month, the magazine published details, including private messages, of an extramarital affair.

AMI says the company ""acted lawfully"".

""American Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr Bezos. Further, at the time of the recent allegations made by Mr Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him,"" the company said in a statement.

""Nonetheless, in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims. Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary.""

What did Bezos say?

In a stunning blog post on Thursday, Mr Bezos posted an email he said had been sent to his intermediaries by AMI's representatives threatening to publish ""intimate photos"" of him and his lover, former TV host Lauren Sanchez.

The billionaire, who also owns the Washington Post newspaper, said AMI had wanted him to make a ""false public statement"" that the National Enquirer's coverage of him and his mistress was not politically motivated.

Bill Clinton, who defeated Mr. Bush in the 1992 presidential election but went on to become friends with his former rival, said few Americans would be able to match Mr. Bush’s record of service. “I saw it up close, working with him on tsunami relief in Asia and here at home after Hurricane Katrina,” Mr. Clinton said in a statement with his wife, Hillary. “His remarkable leadership and great heart were always on full display.”

Mr. Bush was the last American president to serve in World War II. He went on to work in the oil industry before serving as a congressman, an envoy to the United Nations and China and head of the Central Intelligence Agency—before becoming Republican Ronald Reagan’s vice president and then succeeding him in the White House.

“While our hearts are heavy today, they are also filled with gratitude,” former President Barack Obama said.

Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, cited Mr. Bush’s willingness to cross party lines to benefit the country and world, highlighting his signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief work.

Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev applauded Mr. Bush’s contributions toward ending the Cold War.

“I have a lot of memories of this man. We had the opportunity to work together during the era of great changes. It was a dramatic period, which required everyone to be tremendously responsible,” Mr. Gorbachev said.

“I pay tribute to George Bush’s contribution to this historical achievement. He was a true partner,” he said.

During the dying days of the Cold War, Mr. Bush played a pivotal role in the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany. “We mourn a great statesman and a friend of Germany,” said German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. “Like few other U.S. presidents, George H.W. Bush was destined to provide his country with an orientation in a moment of historic change.”

In China, Mr. Bush was remembered as a steadfast supporter of engagement, shielding relations from domestic U.S. criticism. He played key roles in Washington’s dealing with Beijing, as an envoy prior to full diplomatic relations; as vice president, helping to forge common cause against the Soviet Union; and, as president, preserving ties after the Chinese military crushed the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations in 1989.

“Old Bush, Without Doubt an ‘Old Friend of the Chinese People,’” ran the headline in the Global Times, a popular, nationalistic tabloid and an offshoot of People’s Daily. Posts on Weibo, a Twitter-like service, with the hashtag “Old Bush Passes Away” drew 70 million page views.

The emir of Kuwait, whose country Mr. Bush aided after an invasion by Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in 1990, praised the former president for “his rejection of the Iraqi occupation in its early hours…and his pivotal role in forming an International coalition.” The victory over Hussein’s forces was swift and decisive.

The shooter, who has been identified as Robert Bowers, 46, is in custody. He is said to have shouted, “All Jews must die!” during the shooting spree.

Bush remembered and praised for service,,"Louis Casiano, Dan Quayle, Former Vice President","Soon after news broke that former President George H.W . Bush had died Friday at age 94 , tributes and remembrances started arriving from President Trump , past White House occupants and members of the Bush administration -- as well as friends and admirers of the former commander in chief and his family .
Trump , in Argentina for the G20 summit , issued a statement on behalf of himself and first lady Melania Trump . It read in part : `` Melania and I join with a grieving Nation to mourn the loss of former President George H.W . Bush , who passed away last night .
`` Through his essential authenticity , disarming wit , and unwavering commitment to faith , family , and country , President Bush inspired generations of his fellow Americans to public service — to be , in his words , “ a thousand points of light ” illuminating the greatness , hope , and opportunity of America to the world . ''
The White House confirmed Saturday morning that the Trumps would attend Bush 's funeral .
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told Fox News : “ The president and first lady were notified late last night of President George H.W . Bush ’ s passing . President Trump is scheduled to speak with President George W. Bush this morning and offer his condolences on behalf of himself , the first lady and the entire country . A state funeral is being arranged with all of the accompanying support and honors . ''
She said Trump was designating Wednesday a `` National Day Of Mourning . He and the first lady will attend the funeral at the National Cathedral in Washington , D.C . ”
Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama called Bush a `` patriot '' and a `` humble servant '' in a statement , and praised him for expelling former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein from Kuwait and helping to bring about a peaceful end to the Cold War .
The Obamas credited him with `` expanding America 's promise to new immigrants and people with disabilities . Reducing the scourge of nuclear weapons and building a broad international coalition to expel a dictator from Kuwait . And when democratic revolutions bloomed across Eastern Europe , it was his steady , diplomatic hand that made possible an achievement once thought anything but - ending the Cold War without firing a shot .
`` George H.W . Bush 's life is a testament to the notion that public service is a noble , joyous calling , '' the statement read . `` It 's a legacy of service that will never be matched , even though he 'd want all of us to try . ''
In a statement released by former Vice President Joe Biden , he wrote that the `` nation has lost a great leader '' amid the death of the 41st president . He also reflected on Bush 's kindness while remembering a trip his family had taken to Houston in 2015 `` to honor the doctors that cared for our deceased son Beau . ''
`` President Bush insisted on coming out to see us . He wanted to personally welcome us to Houston and offer his condolences for the loss of our son , '' Biden recalled . `` That was George H.W . Bush — decent , kind , and welcoming . With President Bush it was seldom about himself . Always about others . His life of service was legendary . ''
While noting the former president 's military service and his time in government , `` Bush chose a path of service , '' Biden said .
`` Over the course of the many years we worked with together — and against each other — on the biggest issues of the day , differences of policy were always based on substance . It was never personal . It was never petty . It was always with respect for our institutions and the people they govern , '' Biden said . `` As we mourn his passing today , we remember a life totally and completely dedicated to the country he loved . ''
Another White House alumnus , Bill Clinton , said he and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton `` mourn the passing of President George H.W . Bush , and give thanks for his great long life of service , love , and friendship .
`` I will be forever grateful for the friendship we formed . From the moment I met him as a young governor invited to his home in Kennebunkport , I was struck by the kindness he showed to Chelsea , by his innate and genuine decency , and by his devotion to Barbara , his children , and their growing brood . ''
Hillary Clinton echoed her husband 's sentiments , describing Bush as `` a beloved father & grandfather , a war hero , a public servant , & a class act . ''
`` In my experiences w/ him , I always valued his desire to listen , look at evidence & ask for ideas , even from people w/ different beliefs , '' she tweeted . `` My heart goes out to the entire Bush family . ''
The daughters of the late former President Richard Nixon also paid tribute to Bush 's life and public service .
`` Our father believed in George H.W . Bush , '' a statement from Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower said . `` George H.W . Bush lived a life that was purposeful , and extraordinary rewarding -- for out nation , and for our world . ''
As for Bush predecessor Jimmy Carter , he , too , had words of tribute to offer on his family 's behalf : `` Rosalynn and I are deeply saddened by the death of former President George H.W . Bush . His administration was marked by grace , civility , and social conscience . Through his Points of Light initiative and other projects , he espoused a uniquely American volunteer spirit , fostering bipartisan support for citizen service and inspiring millions to embrace community volunteerism as a cherished responsibility . We again extend our heartfelt condolences to the Bush family . ''
George P. Bush , said his grandfather was the `` greatest man I ever knew . ''
Dan Quayle , who served as vice president under the senior Bush , was considered by many a surprise choice when Bush selected the senator and former congressman from Indiana as his running mate in 1988 .
`` As so many Americans did , I had true affection for the man George Bush , '' Quayle said in a statement . `` He was a completely genuine , decent and honorable person . What ’ s more , he went into and out of the office as absolutely the same man . I think that exemplifies his character . I have often told my children , 'If you want a role model in your life — look to President George Herbert Walker Bush . ' The world mourns the loss of a great American . But , it also celebrates a life well lived . ''
`` As so many Americans did , I had true affection for the man George Bush . He was a completely genuine , decent and honorable person . What ’ s more , he went into and out of the office as absolutely the same man . '' — Dan Quayle , former vice president
Former Vice President Dick Cheney , who served as secretary of defense under the 41st president , recounted his time in the administration .
`` They were not tranquil times , and American leadership was tested repeatedly – in Central America , in Europe , in the Middle East . Our president was more than equal to the challenges , managing events with calmness and clear thinking , and emerging as one of the most respected statesmen of his era . This was never truer than in days of war , when he showed real courage and real wisdom – and never forgot the young Americans under his command .
`` George Bush was a president who welcomed responsibility , kept his nerve , stood behind his team , and brought out the best in all of us . It was easy to feel loyalty and affection for him because he was such a thoroughly admirable and decent man . He had no illusions about politics or life , but there wasn ’ t a trace of cynicism in him . His sense of duty and code of honor were uncompromising , yet he carried himself with gentle ease and without pretense or self-regard . If you knew George Bush you felt lucky and proud , and you always looked forward to being in his company .
`` Our forty-first president leaves a legacy of public service and character that will stand down the ages . He was also my good friend for more than 40 years , and I will miss him . ''
Former Vice President Al Gore said Bush inspired others to volunteer in their communities through his Thousand Points of Light initiative .
James A. Baker III , secretary of state and White House chief of staff during the Bush administration ( 1989-1993 ) , said in a statement that the late president 's legacy `` will be forever etched in the history of America and the world . ''
`` It is a lifelong record of selfless patriotic service to our nation , '' Baker continued . `` He was the youngest Navy pilot in World War II , a Texas congressman , UN ambassador , America ’ s first envoy to China , CIA director , vice president and president .
`` In each and every one of these positions , he led with strength , integrity , compassion and humility -- characteristics that define a truly great man and effective leader . With a singularly unique consistency , he always demonstrated these traits , whether on the global stage or interacting with people in his everyday life . His passion was a deep love of family and our country . It was my pleasure and great joy to have had him as my special friend for more than 60 years . Susan joins me in grieving the passing of our dear friend and sending the entire Bush family our deepest love and condolences . ''
`` His passion was a deep love of family and our country . It was my pleasure and great joy to have had him as my special friend for more than 60 years . Susan joins me in grieving the passing of our dear friend and sending the entire Bush family our deepest love and condolences . '' — James A. Baker III , former U.S. secretary of state
Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Bush `` was the epitome of a public servant . He loved America with all of his heart and served her as fully and completely as anyone ever has .
`` I am so grateful that I had the opportunity to work for him , to learn from him and to experience his deep and abiding commitment to his fellow citizens . He was a mentor to me and a dear friend . ''
The former president was also director of the CIA , and the agency issued a statement from its current director , Gina C. Haspel , saying : `` We ’ ve lost a great champion of the Agency—an accomplished Director , faithful advocate , and dear friend—with the passing of former President George H.W . Bush . As a heroic Navy pilot in the Second World War , a skilled statesman who deftly managed the collapse of the Soviet Union and liberated Kuwait from Saddam Husayn ’ s aggression , and a committed citizen who remained engaged in public service throughout his later years , President Bush exemplified the virtues of patriotism , duty , and compassion . Officers here at the George Bush Center for Intelligence and deployed around the globe honor the memory of a great American . On behalf of the men and women of CIA , I extend our heartfelt condolences to the Bush family . ”
The British monarch Queen Elizabeth II released a statement expressing her condolences to the Bush family while describing the former president as `` a great friend and ally of the United Kingdom . ''
`` It was with sadness that I learned of the death of President George H W Bush last night , '' the statement read . `` He was also a patriot , serving his country with honour and distinction in Office and during the Second World War . Prince Philip and I remember our days in Texas in 1991 with great fondness . My thoughts and prayers are with President Bush ’ s family and the American people . ”
Sen. Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , said a statement on Bush 's death would come Saturday morning , but simply tweeted `` Rest In Peace , President Bush . ''
House Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi wrote of the former president 's `` duty , sacrifice , commitment and patriotism . ''
`` President Bush profoundly believed in the power of ordinary Americans to make a difference , '' she said in a statement . `` His belief in a ‘ kinder , gentler ’ America encouraged people to embrace the spirit of service and encouraged them to share his vision of ‘ a thousand points of light. ’ We will all remember his great humility , unwavering compassion , deep faith and extraordinary kindness in and out of the political arena . ''
Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis wrote , `` President George Herbert Walker Bush , naval aviator , decorated in his youth for valor in combat , took his experience in war to build a better world as our commander in chief . His service to our nation demonstrated how we as a people can draw on our humility , diversity and devotion to our country to meet every challenge with fortitude and confidence . We will miss him , but at the going down of the day , his example will long guide our Sailors , Soldiers , Airmen and Marines for how to live life without regret . ''
The U.S. Navy tweeted out a memorial of the former president , who enlisted when he turned 18 . The memorial cited a common mariner wish , `` Fair winds and following seas , Sir . We have the watch . ''
Justice Clarence Thomas , who was nominated to the Supreme Court by 41 in 1991 , said , : '' It is with deep and profound sadness that Virginia and I learned of the passing of President Bush . I was honored to be nominated by him to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the Supreme Court of the United States .

Bush had died Friday at age 94, tributes and remembrances started arriving from President Trump, past White House occupants and members of the Bush administration -- as well as friends and admirers of the former commander in chief and his family.

Trump, in Argentina for the G20 summit, issued a statement on behalf of himself and first lady Melania Trump. It read in part: ""Melania and I join with a grieving Nation to mourn the loss of former President George H.W. Bush, who passed away last night.



""Through his essential authenticity, disarming wit, and unwavering commitment to faith, family, and country, President Bush inspired generations of his fellow Americans to public service — to be, in his words, “a thousand points of light” illuminating the greatness, hope, and opportunity of America to the world.""

REMEMBERING GEORGE H.W. BUSH

The White House confirmed Saturday morning that the Trumps would attend Bush's funeral.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told Fox News: “The president and first lady were notified late last night of President George H.W. Bush’s passing. President Trump is scheduled to speak with President George W. Bush this morning and offer his condolences on behalf of himself, the first lady and the entire country. A state funeral is being arranged with all of the accompanying support and honors.""

She said Trump was designating Wednesday a ""National Day Of Mourning. He and the first lady will attend the funeral at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.”

Former President George W. Bush, 41's eldest son and the nation's 43rd president, posted a photo of his parents boarding Marine One with the caption, ""Jeb, Neil, Marvin, Doro, and I are saddened to announce that after 94 remarkable years, our dear Dad has died. George H.W. Bush was a man of the highest character and the best dad a son or daughter could ask for. The entire Bush family is deeply grateful for 41's life and love, for the compassion of those who have cared and prayed for Dad, and for the condolences of our friends and fellow citizens.""

Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama called Bush a ""patriot"" and a ""humble servant"" in a statement, and praised him for expelling former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein from Kuwait and helping to bring about a peaceful end to the Cold War.

The Obamas credited him with ""expanding America's promise to new immigrants and people with disabilities. Reducing the scourge of nuclear weapons and building a broad international coalition to expel a dictator from Kuwait. And when democratic revolutions bloomed across Eastern Europe, it was his steady, diplomatic hand that made possible an achievement once thought anything but - ending the Cold War without firing a shot.

""George H.W. Bush's life is a testament to the notion that public service is a noble, joyous calling,"" the statement read. ""It's a legacy of service that will never be matched, even though he'd want all of us to try.""

In a statement released by former Vice President Joe Biden, he wrote that the ""nation has lost a great leader"" amid the death of the 41st president. He also reflected on Bush's kindness while remembering a trip his family had taken to Houston in 2015 ""to honor the doctors that cared for our deceased son Beau.""

""President Bush insisted on coming out to see us. He wanted to personally welcome us to Houston and offer his condolences for the loss of our son,"" Biden recalled. ""That was George H.W. Bush — decent, kind, and welcoming. With President Bush it was seldom about himself. Always about others. His life of service was legendary.""

While noting the former president's military service and his time in government, ""Bush chose a path of service,"" Biden said.

""Over the course of the many years we worked with together — and against each other — on the biggest issues of the day, differences of policy were always based on substance. It was never personal. It was never petty. It was always with respect for our institutions and the people they govern,"" Biden said. ""As we mourn his passing today, we remember a life totally and completely dedicated to the country he loved.""

Another White House alumnus, Bill Clinton, said he and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ""mourn the passing of President George H.W. Bush, and give thanks for his great long life of service, love, and friendship.

""I will be forever grateful for the friendship we formed. From the moment I met him as a young governor invited to his home in Kennebunkport, I was struck by the kindness he showed to Chelsea, by his innate and genuine decency, and by his devotion to Barbara, his children, and their growing brood.""

Hillary Clinton echoed her husband's sentiments, describing Bush as ""a beloved father & grandfather, a war hero, a public servant, & a class act.""

""In my experiences w/ him, I always valued his desire to listen, look at evidence & ask for ideas, even from people w/ different beliefs,"" she tweeted. ""My heart goes out to the entire Bush family.""

The daughters of the late former President Richard Nixon also paid tribute to Bush's life and public service.

""Our father believed in George H.W. Bush,"" a statement from Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower said. ""George H.W. Bush lived a life that was purposeful, and extraordinary rewarding -- for out nation, and for our world.""

As for Bush predecessor Jimmy Carter, he, too, had words of tribute to offer on his family's behalf: ""Rosalynn and I are deeply saddened by the death of former President George H.W. Bush. His administration was marked by grace, civility, and social conscience. Through his Points of Light initiative and other projects, he espoused a uniquely American volunteer spirit, fostering bipartisan support for citizen service and inspiring millions to embrace community volunteerism as a cherished responsibility. We again extend our heartfelt condolences to the Bush family.""

George P. Bush, said his grandfather was the ""greatest man I ever knew.""

Dan Quayle, who served as vice president under the senior Bush, was considered by many a surprise choice when Bush selected the senator and former congressman from Indiana as his running mate in 1988.

""As so many Americans did, I had true affection for the man George Bush,"" Quayle said in a statement. ""He was a completely genuine, decent and honorable person. What’s more, he went into and out of the office as absolutely the same man. I think that exemplifies his character. I have often told my children, 'If you want a role model in your life — look to President George Herbert Walker Bush.' The world mourns the loss of a great American. But, it also celebrates a life well lived.""

""As so many Americans did, I had true affection for the man George Bush. He was a completely genuine, decent and honorable person. What’s more, he went into and out of the office as absolutely the same man."" — Dan Quayle, former vice president

Former Vice President Dick Cheney, who served as secretary of defense under the 41st president, recounted his time in the administration.

""They were not tranquil times, and American leadership was tested repeatedly – in Central America, in Europe, in the Middle East. Our president was more than equal to the challenges, managing events with calmness and clear thinking, and emerging as one of the most respected statesmen of his era. This was never truer than in days of war, when he showed real courage and real wisdom – and never forgot the young Americans under his command.

""George Bush was a president who welcomed responsibility, kept his nerve, stood behind his team, and brought out the best in all of us. It was easy to feel loyalty and affection for him because he was such a thoroughly admirable and decent man. He had no illusions about politics or life, but there wasn’t a trace of cynicism in him. His sense of duty and code of honor were uncompromising, yet he carried himself with gentle ease and without pretense or self-regard. If you knew George Bush you felt lucky and proud, and you always looked forward to being in his company.

""Our forty-first president leaves a legacy of public service and character that will stand down the ages. He was also my good friend for more than 40 years, and I will miss him.""

Former Vice President Al Gore said Bush inspired others to volunteer in their communities through his Thousand Points of Light initiative.

James A. Baker III, secretary of state and White House chief of staff during the Bush administration (1989-1993), said in a statement that the late president's legacy ""will be forever etched in the history of America and the world.""

""It is a lifelong record of selfless patriotic service to our nation,"" Baker continued. ""He was the youngest Navy pilot in World War II, a Texas congressman, UN ambassador, America’s first envoy to China, CIA director, vice president and president.

""In each and every one of these positions, he led with strength, integrity, compassion and humility -- characteristics that define a truly great man and effective leader. With a singularly unique consistency, he always demonstrated these traits, whether on the global stage or interacting with people in his everyday life. His passion was a deep love of family and our country. It was my pleasure and great joy to have had him as my special friend for more than 60 years. Susan joins me in grieving the passing of our dear friend and sending the entire Bush family our deepest love and condolences.""

""His passion was a deep love of family and our country. It was my pleasure and great joy to have had him as my special friend for more than 60 years. Susan joins me in grieving the passing of our dear friend and sending the entire Bush family our deepest love and condolences."" — James A. Baker III, former U.S. secretary of state

Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Bush ""was the epitome of a public servant. He loved America with all of his heart and served her as fully and completely as anyone ever has.

""I am so grateful that I had the opportunity to work for him, to learn from him and to experience his deep and abiding commitment to his fellow citizens. He was a mentor to me and a dear friend.""

The former president was also director of the CIA, and the agency issued a statement from its current director, Gina C. Haspel, saying: ""We’ve lost a great champion of the Agency—an accomplished Director, faithful advocate, and dear friend—with the passing of former President George H.W. Bush. As a heroic Navy pilot in the Second World War, a skilled statesman who deftly managed the collapse of the Soviet Union and liberated Kuwait from Saddam Husayn’s aggression, and a committed citizen who remained engaged in public service throughout his later years, President Bush exemplified the virtues of patriotism, duty, and compassion. Officers here at the George Bush Center for Intelligence and deployed around the globe honor the memory of a great American. On behalf of the men and women of CIA, I extend our heartfelt condolences to the Bush family.”

The British monarch Queen Elizabeth II released a statement expressing her condolences to the Bush family while describing the former president as ""a great friend and ally of the United Kingdom.""

""It was with sadness that I learned of the death of President George H W Bush last night,"" the statement read. ""He was also a patriot, serving his country with honour and distinction in Office and during the Second World War. Prince Philip and I remember our days in Texas in 1991 with great fondness. My thoughts and prayers are with President Bush’s family and the American people.”

Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said a statement on Bush's death would come Saturday morning, but simply tweeted ""Rest In Peace, President Bush.""

House Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi wrote of the former president's ""duty, sacrifice, commitment and patriotism.""

""President Bush profoundly believed in the power of ordinary Americans to make a difference,"" she said in a statement. ""His belief in a ‘kinder, gentler’ America encouraged people to embrace the spirit of service and encouraged them to share his vision of ‘a thousand points of light.’ We will all remember his great humility, unwavering compassion, deep faith and extraordinary kindness in and out of the political arena.""

Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis wrote, ""President George Herbert Walker Bush, naval aviator, decorated in his youth for valor in combat, took his experience in war to build a better world as our commander in chief. His service to our nation demonstrated how we as a people can draw on our humility, diversity and devotion to our country to meet every challenge with fortitude and confidence. We will miss him, but at the going down of the day, his example will long guide our Sailors, Soldiers, Airmen and Marines for how to live life without regret.""

The U.S. Navy tweeted out a memorial of the former president, who enlisted when he turned 18. The memorial cited a common mariner wish, ""Fair winds and following seas, Sir. We have the watch.""

Justice Clarence Thomas, who was nominated to the Supreme Court by 41 in 1991, said,:""It is with deep and profound sadness that Virginia and I learned of the passing of President Bush. I was honored to be nominated by him to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the Supreme Court of the United States. Both he and Mrs. Bush were the essence of decency and kindness then and throughout the years. Virginia and I extend our thoughts and prayers to the entire Bush family.""

And Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Justice John G. Roberts Jr., said the former president was, ""an extraordinary American patriot and fundamentally decent man. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the Bush family.""

Mike Huckabee, former governor of Arkansas and Republican presidential candidate, said: ""I first met President George HW Bush in 1980 in Little Rock when he was a candidate for President. He ultimately became Ronald Reagan's Vice-President and I met him again at a Bassmaster's Classic in Pine Bluff, Arkansas where he (an avid angler) presented the trophies.

Janet and I are saddened to learn that his exceptional life has ended, but celebrate a life 'Done Well.'""

Outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., offered his condolences in a tweet, adding that “We all owe a debt of gratitude for his honorable and humble service to the nation, and for his enduring example of kindness.”

Former Texas governor and current Energy Secretary Rick Perry posted a photo of him and Bush on Instagram.

""Honoring a great & good man who inspired all,"" the post read. ""We are all better knowing this fine gentleman. Gig 'em & God Bless.""

In fact , Andrew Dossi , Aliro Pellerano and three other officers were changing clothes at the end of a dangerous anti-crime detail when they ran out of a Bronx station house to search for two robbery suspects , officials said . The suspects were arrested Tuesday .
`` Chances are they were n't wearing their vests , '' Chief of Department James O'Neill told reporters . `` They were going home . They jumped into a car and they ended up getting into this fierce firefight . ''
The alleged shooter was identified as Jason Polanco , a 24-year-old boxer who was charged with five counts of attempted murder of a police officer and was said to have posted anti-police and anti-government statements on social media , police said . His alleged accomplice , Joshua Kemp , 28 , was arrested on robbery charges .
The wounded officers spent Tuesday at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx . One of them , Dossi , who is 30 and has eight years on the job , was in stable condition following surgery after being shot in the arm and lower back , according to police . The other , Pellerano , who is 38 and has nine years as an officer , is in stable condition with gunshot wounds to the chest and arm .
`` Last night a team of our officers displayed extraordinary bravery , going above and beyond the call to protect their fellow New Yorkers , '' Mayor Bill de Blasio , who has found himself at odds with some in his police force in recent weeks , said in a statement Tuesday . `` We thank these officers for their commitment to serving our city , including answering the call after their shift had ended . ...

De Blasio also thanked New Yorkers who provided more than two dozen tips that helped identify the gunman . Police said 10 of the tipsters identified Polanco by name .
Monday night , authorities located the white Camaro that two suspects carjacked a block from the shooting , as well as a .44-caliber revolver , but no one was inside the vehicle .
Before Polanco was arrested , police offered a $ 12,000 reward for information leading to a bearded man pictured in a surveillance video from inside a take-out Chinese restaurant moments before the shooting .

The officers exchanged gunfire with Polanco , police said , but the suspects got away , fleeing on foot for one block and then carjacking the Camaro .

Sometime after the shooting , Kemp checked himself into a Manhattan hospital with a gunshot wound to the back , officials said . The man who drove him to the hospital was also taken into custody .

Thomas Eric Duncan's nephew: ""He wasn't given a chance""

He wasn't hospitalized right away

He wasn't immediately given an experimental drug

His family is devastated. The woman he planned to marry, haunted by the ""what ifs."" And many are wondering why Thomas Eric Duncan died when several other Ebola patients treated in the United States survived.

Duncan was hospitalized eight days after he arrived from Liberia, and later tested positive for Ebola. He died Wednesday, but not much is known about his medical history.

Here are seven ways his case differs from other patients in the U.S.:

1. Duncan wasn't hospitalized right away

Unlike the American patients, who were quickly tested and quarantined at the first sign of Ebola, Duncan wasn't.

Duncan arrived in Dallas from Liberia on September 20, and he made his initial visit to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 25.

He was treated for a fever, vomiting and abdominal pain -- all symptoms of Ebola. But he was sent home with antibiotics and was not screened for the virus. Relatives say he told hospital staff he'd come from Liberia.

Three days later, he was hospitalized in worse condition and was quickly isolated. He became the first case of the deadly virus diagnosed on American soil.

""What if they had taken him right away? And what if they had been able to get treatment to him earlier?"" said pastor George Mason of Wilshire Baptist Church in Dallas.

2. He didn't get an experimental drug immediately

Duncan received experimental medicine on October 4 -- six days after admission to the hospital. It was a far longer wait than four other Ebola patients treated in the United States. Those patients -- two each at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital and the University of Nebraska Medical Center -- got experimental medicine immediately. They're all U.S. citizens; Duncan was a Liberian.

His family is claiming bias, arguing it took too long for him to receive the medicine.

""It is suspicious to us that all the white patients survived and this one black patient passed away ... He didn't begin his treatment in Africa. He began treatment here, but he wasn't given a chance,"" said Josephus Weeks, his nephew.

Not so, the hospital says.

""The investigative drug was administered as soon as his physicians determined that his condition warranted it, and as soon as it could be obtained,"" Texas Health Presbyterian said Thursday.

Since the drugs are still experimental, individual hospitals have to file the paperwork with the Food and Drug Administration for permission to use them. The agency received the request to use the experimental drug brincidofovir on October 3, five days after Duncan entered the hospital.

3. He got a different experimental drug

Duncan got brincidofovir. And he was the first Ebola patient to receive it, the hospital said.

Two of four patients who survived after treatment in the U.S. received a different drug, ZMapp. Experts say there's no proof that ZMapp or any drug is effective in treating Ebola. A Spanish priest infected with Ebola died after taking it in August.

The fourth one, NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, who got infected in Liberia and was airlifted to Nebraska on Sunday, got the same drug as Duncan.

4. He didn't get a blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor

Unlike other American patients, Duncan didn't get a blood transfusion from someone who'd survived the virus.

That's because doctors couldn't find a match, the hospital said Thursday.

""Mr. Duncan did not receive the same type of serum transfusion as the patient in Nebraska (Mukpo) because his blood type was not compatible with the serum donors,"" the hospital said. Mukpo received a transfusion from Dr. Kent Brantly, who survived the virus.

5. The hospital treating him had no advance notice

The Atlanta and Nebraska facilities knew in advance they were expecting Ebola patients, a crucial element for a disease so rare in the United States.

Hospitals that took care of the four are also among the most well-equipped nationwide to battle the deadly virus.

Despite lack of notification, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital said Duncan got top-notch care and his medical team consulted daily with the CDC and Emory.

6. Information on his case has been muddled

Details on Duncan's background have not been as clear-cut.

His relatives said he made it clear to the hospital that he had just come from Liberia. His symptoms pointed at Ebola, they said.

Initially, the hospital said Duncan was ""not exhibiting symptoms specific to Ebola"" when he first went to the hospital. And, they said, details about his travel history weren't communicated to doctors.

But later, it said a flaw in electronic records had kept doctors from seeing his travel history. Then it said his travel history had been documented and was available to his care team.

7. Family believes his insurance status played a role

Duncan had just arrived from Liberia to visit his girlfriend and son, and probably had no insurance.

The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who's serving as a spokesman for the family, said that was a concern.

""I would tend to think that those who do not have insurance, those who do not have Medicaid, do not have the same priorities as those who do,"" the civil rights leader said.

But the hospital denied the claim.

""Our care team provided Mr. Duncan with the same high level of attention and care that would be given any patient, regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care,"" the hospital said. ""In this case that included a four-hour evaluation and numerous tests. We have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area.""",www.cnn.com,left,tTY3TuIDeE7mGwIP

We've become transparent. And we've become more effective than we've ever been."" For Chicago, changes like those sound crazy, but they just might work.

(CNN) -- The U.S. health system has been preparing since late March for the news we announced Tuesday: the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the United States.

In this age of global travel, we anticipated that a traveler from a country with an Ebola outbreak would come to the United States and develop symptoms once they arrived. But from everything we know now, there appears to be no risk that anyone on this patient's flights from Liberia to the United States was exposed to the virus.

Can you catch Ebola on a plane?

Clinicians on the front lines have been one key to our safety: identifying patients with both a history of travel and symptoms indicating they might have Ebola, immediately isolating them, consulting their local or state health departments, and getting the patients tested as needed. Indeed, since the outbreak began in Africa, CDC has consulted with state and local health departments on almost 100 cases in which travelers had recently returned from West Africa and showed symptoms that might have been caused by Ebola. Of those cases, 14 were considered to be truly at risk. Specimens from 13 were tested and Ebola was ruled out in all 13 cases.

But now CDC labs have confirmed our nation's first U.S.-diagnosed Ebola patient.

I understand this can be deeply troubling news, especially after what we have witnessed Ebola do in West Africa. But there are distinct differences in what will happen here.

The United States has a strong health care system and dedicated public health professionals -- all hard at work right now -- to make sure this case will not threaten the community at large, or the nation. A person who is sick from Ebola virus disease can be cared for in U.S. hospitals when the patient is isolated in a private room with a private bathroom and contact with them is highly controlled. Every health care worker must meticulously follow every single infection control protection we recommend.

How the Ebola virus spreads

Public health officials, meanwhile, are also identifying people who have had close personal contact with the newly diagnosed patient and will follow up with them for 21 days, the longest known incubation period for Ebola. If they develop any signs of the disease, those people will be isolated, tested and cared for.

The fact is that CDC has been preparing for this day, working around the clock with local and state health departments to enhance surveillance and laboratory testing capacity, provide recommendations for health care infection control and other measures to prevent disease spread, and deliver guidance and tools for health departments to conduct public health investigations.

Your Ebola questions answered

I'm not going to promise that we can stop this at just one case, but I can tell you we have the advantage because the right steps are being taken, and I am therefore confident we will stop Ebola in its tracks here in the United States.

And there is one final thing to remember, even as the first case here grabs the headlines: We must be relentless in stopping its spread in West Africa. After all, after all is said and done here, that is the only way to truly and completely protect the health security of America -- and the world.

The tax evasion charge alone carries up to 10 years behind bars. It stems from allegations that Rappler and Ressa did not pay taxes on 2015 bond sales that netted $3 million.

Rappler has been among a clutch of Philippine news outlets that have questioned the methods of the president's signature crackdown, which police say has killed nearly 5,000 alleged dealers and addicts since 2016.

Rights campaigners say the true toll is triple that and could amount to crimes against humanity.

Philippine journalist Maria Ressa has been threatened with prison and closure of the news site she co-founded but she's fighting back

Yet, the site and its roughly 30 journalists, a majority of whom are women in their 20s, has kept publishing stories on the drug war.

Ressa insists the site is not anti-Duterte, saying it is just doing its job to hold the government to account.

In doing so it has invited a steady stream of online vitriol since Duterte came to power over two years ago.

The Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, is also recognized by Time, as staff continue with their coverage after five colleague were gunned down on June 28.

Jarrod Ramos is charged with five counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of five newspaper employees after he shot through the glass newsroom entrance.

The victims were reporter John McNamara, special publications editor Wendi Winters, assistant editor Robert Hiaasen, editorial page editor Gerald Fischman, and sales assistant Rebecca Smith.

Time has also recognized the two Reuters journalists Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, who were jailed for their reporting on the Rohingya crisis. Their wives are pictured holding photos of their husbands

Time has also recognized the two Reuters journalists Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, who were jailed for their reporting on the Rohingya crisis, in the Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar.

They were found guilty under a state secrets act in September after exposing the extrajudicial killing of 10 Rohingya men during a brutal military crackdown in Myanmar's western Rakhine state last year.

The pair - who have been held behind bars for nearly a year since their arrest last December - were sentenced to seven years in jail, a verdict that drew widespread condemnation, including from US Vice President Mike Pence.

Four journalists from across the world round out additional examples of courage in the name of reporting the truth.

Shahidul Alam, a photographer from Bangladesh, was taken into custody on August 5 after criticizing Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in an interview about mass protests in Dhaka. Alam had spent over 100 days behind bars for making 'false' and 'provocative' statements before finally being granted bail in November, according to the Guardian.

Amal Habani, a freelance journalist in Sudan, was captured by authorities while reporting on protests over economic conditions in the northeast African country in January. Habana was beaten with electric rods while detained for more than 34 days before her release in February, according to FrontlineDefenders.org.

Reporter Patricia Campos Mello in Brazil experienced threats following her coverage in October that President-elect Jair Bolsonaro's supporters had financially supported a campaign to spread false news stories on WhatsApp, according to a Google translation of Abraji.org.br, the website for the Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism.

And in Hong Kong, Asia news editor for the Financial Times Victor Mallet had to leave the territory after his visa was not renewed, following him acting against the wishes of the Chinese government by inviting Hong Kong pro-independence political activist Andy Chan to speak at a press club event in August.

Mallet was forced to leave in October and allowed to return for only seven days to wrap up his affairs, the South China Morning Post reported.

Time lauded those expressly named as well as the additional examples provided, among the myriad of others risking their lives to speak truth to power across the globe, collectively as the 2018 Person of the Year.

'Such independence is no small thing. It marks the distinction between tyranny and democracy. And in a world where budding authoritarians have advanced by blurring the difference, there was a clarity in the spectacle of a tyrant’s fury visited upon a man armed only with a pen,' the article read.

'Because the strongmen of the world only look strong. All despots live in fear of their people. To see genuine strength, look to the spaces where individuals dare to describe what’s going on in front of them.'

The shortlist for Time Person of the Year included President Donald Trump, who made the cover in 2016, as well as the man who has rocked his presidency - special counsel Robert Mueller.",www.dailymail.co.uk,right,Cmg2fjHBf2GlN4So

1st person to contract Ebola outside Africa

The Ebola virus has been voracious, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing at least 3,800, according to the World Health Organization. It's also been largely confined, with every person catching the disease in West Africa.

Until Romero.

She is the first person to contract the deadly virus outside Africa. Dr. German Ramirez, who is among those treating her, said the nurse's assistant at Madrid's Carlos III hospital may have been exposed while removing protective gear she'd donned to treat a Spanish missionary infected with Ebola in West Africa.

So, too, is how her treatment was handled afterward.

According to a Carlos III hospital spokeswoman, who isn't named as is customary in Spain, Romero started feeling ill on September 29. She went the next day to her doctor, who did not properly identify her problem and sent her home.

The country launched a five-year study to unravel the mystery of the long-term health effects that plague survivors of the viral disease. Since the epidemic started more than a year ago in a remote village in Guinea, more than 11,000 people have died, the vast majority in three West African nations, according to the latest numbers from the World Health Organization . And that number is believed to be low, since there was widespread under-reporting of cases, according to WHO.

But Romero didn't get better. She called Carlos III hospital on October 2 and was directed, per protocol, to an external medical department under the umbrella of Madrid's regional health service, the hospital spokesman.

Romero ended back home again. On Monday, she ended up calling an ambulance, which took her to Alcorcon hospital.

It was there, on Tuesday, that Romero got tested for Ebola. The positive result came back two hours later, according to an Alcorcon doctor.

Yet it wasn't until eight hours later, a worker at the same hospital said, when she was transported to the hospital where she worked, Carlos III.

Dog of nursing assistant put down

As she battles the deadly virus, Romero has company.

Five others related to her case were also at Carlos III hospital as of late Wednesday, including two doctors and a male nurse admitted earlier in the day, Carlos III hospital said in a press release.

The nurse's assistant is the only one confirmed to have Ebola. Besides the three new cases, the others include the woman's husband, judged to be at high risk of infection, and a nurse from the same hospital. Two others were released from Carlos III hospital earlier in the today -- a Spanish man who'd recently come from Nigeria and a female nurse.

Others are being tracked from afar.

Authorities said Tuesday that a total of 30 people from Carlos III Hospital and 22 others -- from the Alcorcon hospital where the woman first sought care, plus family members -- are being monitored.

Already, there's one victim in this case: Romero and her husband's dog, Excalibur.

It's not known if Ebola can be passed through canines. The WHO has said, though, that it's infected chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines. Yet human infections, to date, have not been linked to dogs.

Nonetheless, health authorities felt they had to take action in case Excalibur had the disease.

About 400,000 people signed an online petition to save the dog from being killed, contending that that ""it would be much easier to isolate or quarantine the dog just as they have the victim's husband,"" rather than forcing the couple to lose ""one of the family.""

general_news,The Intercept,0,https://theintercept.com/2019/10/10/congratulations-nobel-committee-you-just-gave-the-literature-prize-to-a-genocide-apologist/,"Congratulations, Nobel Committee, You Just Gave the Literature Prize to a Genocide Apologist",2019-10-10,,"We live in perplexing times when the U.S. president saw “ very fine people ” among neo-Nazis who marched in Charlottesville , Virginia , and we have a television network that traffics in racism and conspiracy theories . Our world is being described in fraudulent ways , and history is being rewritten to suit these distorted narratives . The last thing we need , and the last thing I ’ d expect to happen , is for an intellectual honor as paramount as the Nobel Prize to go to a writer who embodies the prime intellectual diseases of our era . And let ’ s remember that the Nobel selection comes at a moment when violent white supremacists are singling out the 1990s Serbs as heroic avatars of what needs to be done in our world . It ’ s dumbfounding that the Nobel Committee would seize this moment to honor an Austrian writer who defends these war criminals and dissembles on their behalf .
Stockholm is more than 1,500 miles from Sarajevo , and the war in Bosnia was halted in 1995 , so there ’ s a lot of time and distance between the Swedes who just chose the winner of the Nobel Prize in literature and the nasty war that happened in the heart of the Balkans a generation ago . But that ’ s no excuse for the decision to give this year ’ s prize to Peter Handke , who denies that a well-documented genocide was committed by Serbs against Muslims in Bosnia .
I honestly don ’ t know where to begin with this whole thing . But let me start by making clear what I am not saying . I am not saying that we should not read Handke ’ s literary work . My objection is not a version of the age-old question of whether we should listen to Richard Wagner . Go ahead and listen to Wagner . Go ahead and read Handke . My point is this : It is one thing to read him — it is quite another to bestow upon him a prize that delivers a great amount of legitimacy to his entire body of work , not just the novels and plays that are most impeccable and nonpolitical .
Handke ’ s most famous political offense was attending the funeral of Serbian strongman Slobodan Miloševic , who died in prison awaiting a trial for genocide and war crimes . Handke had visited Miloševic during his detention in The Hague and made a short eulogy during his funeral in Požarevac , Serbia , in 2006 . This followed many years of Handke writing about how the Serbs were misunderstood and were unfairly given the lion ’ s share of blame for the bloodshed that occurred during the breakup of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
The controversy over Handke winning the Nobel Prize revolves around what he wrote in a series of essays in 1996 that were collected in a short book titled , “ A Journey to the Rivers : Justice for Serbia. ” His book , based on a brief trip he made to Serbia , complained that the media “ relentlessly portray the Serbs as evil , ” and Handke pretended to distance himself from the Serbian leader , writing that “ I am with the Serbian people , not with Miloševic ” — which turned out to be a strange thing for one of the few Westerners who attended Miloševic ’ s funeral to have written .
So what does Handke really believe , and is it so terrible ? Handke distilled his views into a concise article he wrote for the French newspaper Liberation after his 1996 essays appeared . The article has gotten very little attention in the current discussion , and that ’ s unfortunate because it clearly demonstrates that he is a truther on the subject of the genocide in Bosnia . For instance , he wrote that it is wrong to talk of “ concentration camps ” in Bosnia .
“ True , there were intolerable camps between 1992 and 1995 on the territories of the Yugoslav republics , especially in Bosnia , ” he wrote . “ But let ’ s stop automatically connecting these camps to the Serbs in Bosnia . There were also Croat camps and Muslim camps , and the crimes committed here and there are and will be judged at the Hague . ”
Let me tell you something about the Serb camps in Bosnia that Handke , who never visited Bosnia during the war , does not admit : They were concentration camps . I visited them during the war , which I covered for the Washington Post . I talked with prisoners inside the camps , as well as survivors . The United Nations war crimes tribunal at The Hague sentenced Serbs to lengthy prison terms for the crimes committed there .
Let me tell you something else about Bosnia : The Muslims had nothing like those industrial-scale camps , where thousands of prisoners were brought in , tortured , and killed . The position that Handke adopts — everyone was doing it — is a dodge that would be funny if it weren ’ t so evil . Were some atrocities committed by Muslim troops ? Yes , but equating a small number of random crimes with a systemic and massive number is a transparent form of deception and deflection . That ’ s what apologists do .
Handke , who lives in France , deepens that deception in his article for Liberation . When writing about Srebrenica , where several thousand Muslims were executed by Serb forces after they captured the enclave , he allows that what happened there was the most “ abominable ” massacre in the war , but he swiftly pivots to saying that we should also “ listen to the survivors of Muslim massacres in numerous Serb villages around Srebrencia. ” This is the same “ all sides do it ” canard , which equates the extremely few with the very many , and fails to acknowledge that this war was started by Serbs and Miloševic in particular .
Handke is full of it . The writer David Rieff , who has reported from Bosnia , took the time to read “ A Journey to the Rivers ” and issued this assessment of its author : “ The truth is that he doesn ’ t know what he ’ s talking about . … He came to Serbia knowing nothing about its complicated politics and , to judge by the book , left knowing no more . ”","We live in perplexing times when the U.S. president saw “very fine people” among neo-Nazis who marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, and we have a television network that traffics in racism and conspiracy theories. Our world is being described in fraudulent ways, and history is being rewritten to suit these distorted narratives. The last thing we need, and the last thing I’d expect to happen, is for an intellectual honor as paramount as the Nobel Prize to go to a writer who embodies the prime intellectual diseases of our era. And let’s remember that the Nobel selection comes at a moment when violent white supremacists are singling out the 1990s Serbs as heroic avatars of what needs to be done in our world. It’s dumbfounding that the Nobel Committee would seize this moment to honor an Austrian writer who defends these war criminals and dissembles on their behalf.

Stockholm is more than 1,500 miles from Sarajevo, and the war in Bosnia was halted in 1995, so there’s a lot of time and distance between the Swedes who just chose the winner of the Nobel Prize in literature and the nasty war that happened in the heart of the Balkans a generation ago. But that’s no excuse for the decision to give this year’s prize to Peter Handke, who denies that a well-documented genocide was committed by Serbs against Muslims in Bosnia.

What were they thinking?

I honestly don’t know where to begin with this whole thing. But let me start by making clear what I am not saying. I am not saying that we should not read Handke’s literary work. My objection is not a version of the age-old question of whether we should listen to Richard Wagner. Go ahead and listen to Wagner. Go ahead and read Handke. My point is this: It is one thing to read him — it is quite another to bestow upon him a prize that delivers a great amount of legitimacy to his entire body of work, not just the novels and plays that are most impeccable and nonpolitical.

Handke’s most famous political offense was attending the funeral of Serbian strongman Slobodan Miloševic, who died in prison awaiting a trial for genocide and war crimes. Handke had visited Miloševic during his detention in The Hague and made a short eulogy during his funeral in Požarevac, Serbia, in 2006. This followed many years of Handke writing about how the Serbs were misunderstood and were unfairly given the lion’s share of blame for the bloodshed that occurred during the breakup of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s.

The controversy over Handke winning the Nobel Prize revolves around what he wrote in a series of essays in 1996 that were collected in a short book titled, “A Journey to the Rivers: Justice for Serbia.” His book, based on a brief trip he made to Serbia, complained that the media “relentlessly portray the Serbs as evil,” and Handke pretended to distance himself from the Serbian leader, writing that “I am with the Serbian people, not with Miloševic” — which turned out to be a strange thing for one of the few Westerners who attended Miloševic’s funeral to have written.

So what does Handke really believe, and is it so terrible? Handke distilled his views into a concise article he wrote for the French newspaper Liberation after his 1996 essays appeared. The article has gotten very little attention in the current discussion, and that’s unfortunate because it clearly demonstrates that he is a truther on the subject of the genocide in Bosnia.

There were also Croat camps and Muslim camps, and the crimes committed here and there are and will be judged at the Hague.”

Let me tell you something about the Serb camps in Bosnia that Handke, who never visited Bosnia during the war, does not admit: They were concentration camps. I visited them during the war, which I covered for the Washington Post. I talked with prisoners inside the camps, as well as survivors.

During this past week as we’ve been swamped with bad news pouring out of every corner of the globe, it wouldn’t be surprising if you missed one of the more shocking revelations about White House actions that would make even Richard Nixon blush.

The Wall Street Journal revealed that it had obtained a 2012 Federal Trade Commission report detailing the closeness of Google and the Obama administration while the FTC was engaging in an antitrust investigation of the Internet giant.

It’s usually the case that you get more interesting information when the details were supposed to remain secret, and that’s the case here. The FTC, responding to an open-records request, accidentally sent 160 pages of a private 2012 report to the The Wall Street Journal, detailing their antitrust investigation into Google.

What was disclosed paints a picture of unusual activity between the White House, Google and the FTC while the antitrust investigation was being conducted. Ultimately, the FTC staff recommended bringing a lawsuit against Google on antitrust grounds. Despite this, the commission voted 5-0 against charges.

Most of the headlines focus on the number of visits Google executives and lobbyists made to the White House during the investigation. Even the newspaper in its coverage cast the events as a “sign of the Internet giant’s reach in Washington” implying that access to the Obama White House is some sort of a byproduct of overall influence.

But in this case, that’s placing the cart well before the horse.

Since President Obama took office, The Wall Street Journal reports, employees of Google “have visited the White House for meetings with senior officials about 230 times, or an average of roughly once a week.” Google’s top lobbyist had more than 60 meetings at the White House. That’s more meetings than most of Mr. Obama’s Cabinet members.

For White House watchers, none of this should be a surprise. One of the people standing next to Mr. Obama at his first press conference after winning the 2008 presidential election was Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google. While Mr. Schmidt is not on record donating to an Obama campaign, National Public Radio reports, “Eric Schmidt’s wife, Wendy, gave Obama’s campaigns $47,600. And Wendy Schmidt got behind Obama’s political career early, donating $2,000 to his Senate run in 2004.”

But some contributions are priceless and highlight the nature of the commitment to Mr. Obama by one company. On the night of the November 2012 election, Mr. Schmidt personally handled the custom voter-turnout software for Mr. Obama. By the end of that election month, The Wall Street Journal reports, the FTC decided to not file charges against Google.

During the 2012 re-election campaign, Google employees were the second-largest source of campaign donations to the Obama campaign, reports the Daily Caller.

Perhaps Google should just change its name to Obamoogle, but it wouldn’t be the first time a corporation has curried the favor of an administration. Between lobbyists and political donations, and even long-standing relationships, Americans have seen how some companies manage to secure Most Favored Nation-type relationships with presidents and their administrations.

Who can forget the hysterics of the left, bemoaning the relationship between Halliburton and the George W. Bush White House? Yet, there are no complaints from the left about Mr. Obama’s increasing reliance on Google and its extraordinary access to his administration. In fact, some liberals, including one with whom I appeared on Fox News about this subject, explained away this as nothing new, it happens all the time, and it’s just the way Washington works.

Well, not really. This is wholly different. Special relationships are one thing, and working directly on the president’s re-election campaign only to have a federal agency walk away from a federal lawsuit that same month is quite another.

All parties, of course, deny that any of the activity between Google and the White House had anything to do with the FTC’s decision to not sue the company. At the same time, the agency refuses to release the rest of the report that was accidentally sent to The Wall Street Journal. Even with this incomplete picture, Americans should be extremely concerned over the appearance that if you help Barack Obama with what he wants, the rule of law will bend, or even break, for you.

This revelation about the intensity of the Obama-Google merger also helps explain the Federal Communications Commission’s determination to regulate the Internet using the pretext of “net neutrality.” The biggest winners of that action? Obama supporters Google (through YouTube) and Netflix, which now consume at least 50 percent of Internet bandwidth.

Google has literally been at Mr. Obama’s side from the beginning of his presidency. They now are the beneficiaries of administration policy. These days on the domestic and international front, it’s becoming more and more difficult to determine for whom Mr. Obama works.

Sitting around a campfire with Joye Braun , directly in the pipeline ’ s path , she reminded me that until 1978 , such rituals had been prohibited under federal law . Tribes had to literally re-learn how to do this .
“ In the 1980s we didn ’ t know how to do what we ’ re doing now , ” she said . “ Everything we do is in prayer here , and prayer is an essential part of the revitalization of our cultures and our languages . ”
The next three days of reporting brought more anecdotes of this revival , from a young man who helped build his tribe ’ s first canoe in a century to BJ Kidder , an elder Standing Rock Sioux member and the son of a medicine man unable to practice his tribe ’ s traditional rituals and practices like his ancestors .
The story that rescued 12-year-old Dorje from a Nepal brick kiln
Michael Holtz , the Monitor ’ s incoming Beijing bureau chief , set out to report on how activists in Nepal sought to shake up the country ’ s dependence on child labor .
Ann Hermes/The ███ Dorje Lama loads bricks with Ajmal Hasan , a mule owner , at the Rakta Kali brick kiln in the district of Dhading , Nepal . As many as 60,000 children work in brick kilns across the country .
I ’ m always skeptical that the work I do as a reporter will make a lasting difference . But in this case it did .
It started when Monitor photographer Ann Hermes and I , with the help our trusty fixer , found Dorje Lama , a 12-year-old boy working at a brick kiln outside of Kathmandu , Nepal . After hearing his heartbreaking story , we shared it with the activist who is the focus of my story .
A few weeks later I got word that Dorje had been rescued from the brick kiln and was starting a new life at a children ’ s home in Kathmandu . I was so relieved and grateful when I heard the news . It was an experience I won ’ t soon forget .
Education writer Stacy Teicher Khadaroo gained new perspective as a parent when she visited Flint , Mich. , where the taps in the schools and many people ’ s homes are still not safe .
Alfredo Sosa/Staff Parent and volunteer Sandra Hinman poses with her children Chase , 8 , and Troy,12 , at the Holmes STEM Academy 's community garden on Sept. 29 in Flint , Mich. Hinman says that , despite Flint 's problems , there is an outpouring of support from the community , which is moving to embrace its schools .
When my children are thirsty , they go to the sink and fill a cup . I hadn ’ t thought of that as a privilege .
The Flint mom told me that when they visit people in other towns , the first thing her kids ask for is a drink of water – from the tap .
Though ​the city is still enduring the injustice of a poisoned water system , and ​​Ms . Hinman was devastated to learn her children had been exposed to lead , she says it also makes them understand how precious things are : “ There are children all over the world that have to drink [ unclean water ] every day . We ’ re fortunate to live in a country where people are sending us bottled water ... ”
For Africa correspondent Ryan Lenora Brown , one of the most striking refugee stories of the year was that of the first Refugee Olympic Team .
Ryan Lenora Brown Garkuouth Puok Diep ( l. ) , a South Sudanese marathoner who hopes to qualify for the refugee Olympic team , runs in Eldoret , Kenya , with his training partner , Kenyan Michael Cheboi .
In April , I had the chance to spend a week with 15 of the athletes competing to be on that team – a group of runners from South Sudan , the Democratic Republic of Congo , and Somalia who were being trained by one of Kenya ’ s greatest distance runners , Tegla Loroupe .
There are many chances as a reporter to write about the plight of refugees – their struggles and their sorrows – but fewer to give readers a window onto other , more prosaic parts of their lives – their ambitions , their hobbies , their hopes . I hope this story does that .
In 2014 , Sunni jihadists from ISIS killed more than 1,700 Shiite cadets in the Iraqi city of Tikrit , which seemed set to trigger an especially brutal blood feud . But it didn ’ t happen . The reasons why captivated veteran war reporter Scott Peterson .
Since I started covering Iraq in 1991 , there has been very little good news . So I was very pleasantly surprised to write about how Sunni and Shiite politicians in Tikrit worked with Iraqi peace facilitators to overcome demands for revenge .
“ When we started , all the signs were bad.… We thought it was a lost cause , ” the mayor of Tikrit , Omar Tariq al-Shindah , told me .
Through a carefully calibrated solution of accountability and apology , tens of thousands of displaced Sunnis returned safely home , and Shiites found a degree of justice . The result could yield lessons for Iraq to break the cycle of sectarian conflict .
A different story of migration : Shahzad and his Austrian foster family
A fellow journalist happened to tell European bureau chief Sara Miller Llana about an Afghan boy who had lost his entire family and traveled to Europe mainly on foot – and was taken in by his German teacher 's family .
Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Shahzad Haidari ( facing camera ) eats dinner with his foster family in Vienna .
After covering hardship on the migrant trail for a year , I heard about Shahzad .
I wasn ’ t sure he and his foster family would want their story told , so it was with trepidation that Monitor photographer Melanie Stetson Freeman and I showed up at their house for dinner . But the connection was immediate . And they remain such an inspiration .
Every time I hear a horrible story about migration I wonder how this family will process it together . That helps me put the broader refugee story in perspective , thinking about the humans living through the experience and not just numbers or headlines . Though I check in with the family from time to time , they probably have no idea how much they mean to me .
Simon Montlake ’ s interest in whether it was possible to move past the political impasse on guns led him to Ralph Demicco .
JOHN J. HAPPEL/THE ███ Ralph Demicco , a gun enthusiast and former gun shop owner in New Hampshire , is working with mental health experts to try to curb firearm suicides .
Mr. Demicco is a fascinating character – a New Hampshire gun seller and NRA member who wants to prevent gun suicides and is willing to work with public-health officials , who are viewed with suspicion by many gun-rights folks .
I spent hours talking to Demicco , who told me about the customers who bought guns from him and used them to take their lives – and the ones whom he did n't serve because he recognized the risk .
On my second visit we went to his range behind his house for a photo shoot . After he 'd fired some rounds he asked if I wanted a go . It was my first time , and my aim was bad . But it felt important to stand in his shoes for a minute .
One last wild , wooly trip to the hinterlands of China
Peter Ford , who in March wrapped up his sixth foreign posting for the Monitor , recounts his prescient trip to China ’ s last major undammed river .
PETER FORD/THE ███ The Nu carves through some of China ’ s most stunning scenery and runs toward Myanmar , where it is known as the Salween , and from there into the Andaman Sea .
Before I end a foreign posting , I like to go somewhere really wild and wooly . Just before I left China I visited the Nu River , plunging through some of the most beautiful scenery in a distant corner of the country , between Tibet and Burma . The Nu is China ’ s last major undammed river , but the government had long been planning to exploit its hydropower potential .
I sensed that opponents of the dams were beginning to prevail , and my story in April reflected environmentalists ’ growing hopes of victory . Those hopes were crowned last month when the government signaled it was abandoning the dam projects . The decision , say Chinese activists , points to the government ’ s increasing awareness of environmental issues .

When Barronelle Stutzman refused to arrange the flowers for a same-sex wedding ceremony , the Richland , Wash. , florist never expected to become a national symbol of anti-gay bigotry . She just wanted to live her life consistent with the teachings of her Southern Baptist faith .
This was a difficult story to research and write because I felt a strong sense of the righteousness of the gay couple ’ s cause . They just wanted to live free as full members of society like everyone else .
But because of my own upbringing in a minority religious group that is , itself , sometimes ridiculed and vilified , I also felt a connection with Mrs. Stutzman ’ s claim of religious liberty . And I admired her courage .
In writing the story I wanted readers to understand what can happen when competing constitutional values collide in a court of law and in the court of public opinion .

Six months ago , when I wrote this story , few people outside the Philippines had heard of Rodrigo Duterte . Since he became president though , he has become internationally notorious for the extra-judicial murder spree he has unleashed against drug users .
That may have shocked the world , but it did not shock the citizens of Davao , where I reported this piece from the city ’ s parks and streets . Duterte had been their mayor for 22 years and people told me how he had used death squads to clean up city crime . They also told me that this did not bother them much .
This article shows how ground-level reporting can signpost the future . Anyone who read this story as Mr. Duterte took office would have come away with a pretty shrewd idea of what his presidency held in store .

Evan Vucci/AP President-elect Donald Trump speaks during an election rally , on Wednesday , Nov. 9 , 2016 , in New York .
This year , I am most proud of a story I didn ’ t want to write – a story that posed the question , “ After the most divisive US election in memory , can healing and reconciliation follow ? ” The concept felt manufactured , given my assignment : Write the story before Election Day , for publication soon after .
But I like a challenge . For three weeks , at Republican and Democratic campaign rallies , I asked voters about post-election reconciliation . Some looked dumbstruck . But most warmed to the topic . Some even welcomed the chance to look beyond the negativity of the moment , and imagine ways of healing the divisions the campaign had wrought .
The irony is that I suspect most of the people I interviewed , on both sides , thought Mrs. Clinton would probably win . After Mr. Trump won , I decided the piece still worked . In fact , it made sense to run it the day after the election , when about half the nation was in shock and looking for something hopeful to grab onto .
The concept of reconciliation transcends partisanship , and the interviewees spoke in that spirit . ( Just to be clear , everyone I interviewed knew the story would run after Election Day . )
When I posted the piece on Facebook , it got a lot of thumbs-up , but also some push-back . One friend , a Democrat , said : “ Let ’ s see one hard-core GOP try to understand us . Let ’ s see any Trump supporter speak out against the hate crimes now going on . When we see Nazi symbols spray-painted with Trump ’ s name , it doesn ’ t inspire reconciliation . ”
I ’ ve seen similar comments in other publications from anguished voters , clearly in no mood to find any common ground or reconciliation . They say the coming Trump presidency poses a threat to American democracy and to the future of the planet itself , and that calls for “ hope ” and “ healing ” are misplaced . It ’ s time to take action , they say , not hold hands and sing Kumbaya .

I take all these reactions to heart . Everyone processes a political earthquake in his or her own way . But I keep thinking about a young Trump supporter I interviewed at a Clinton rally in Coconut Creek , Fla. : “ People should listen more and speak less , ” he said .","After Henry Gass’s first interview with Dakota Access Pipeline protesters, it became clear that for Native Americans, the protest was about much more than battling the oil industry.

Sitting around a campfire with Joye Braun, directly in the pipeline’s path, she reminded me that until 1978, such rituals had been prohibited under federal law. Tribes had to literally re-learn how to do this.

“In the 1980s we didn’t know how to do what we’re doing now,” she said. “Everything we do is in prayer here, and prayer is an essential part of the revitalization of our cultures and our languages.”

The next three days of reporting brought more anecdotes of this revival, from a young man who helped build his tribe’s first canoe in a century to BJ Kidder, an elder Standing Rock Sioux member and the son of a medicine man unable to practice his tribe’s traditional rituals and practices like his ancestors.

The story that rescued 12-year-old Dorje from a Nepal brick kiln

Michael Holtz, the Monitor’s incoming Beijing bureau chief, set out to report on how activists in Nepal sought to shake up the country’s dependence on child labor.

Ann Hermes/The Christian Science Monitor Dorje Lama loads bricks with Ajmal Hasan, a mule owner, at the Rakta Kali brick kiln in the district of Dhading, Nepal. As many as 60,000 children work in brick kilns across the country.

I’m always skeptical that the work I do as a reporter will make a lasting difference. But in this case it did.

It started when Monitor photographer Ann Hermes and I, with the help our trusty fixer, found Dorje Lama, a 12-year-old boy working at a brick kiln outside of Kathmandu, Nepal. After hearing his heartbreaking story, we shared it with the activist who is the focus of my story.

A few weeks later I got word that Dorje had been rescued from the brick kiln and was starting a new life at a children’s home in Kathmandu. I was so relieved and grateful when I heard the news. It was an experience I won’t soon forget.

What I learned from Flint moms

Education writer Stacy Teicher Khadaroo gained new perspective as a parent when she visited Flint, Mich., where the taps in the schools and many people’s homes are still not safe.

Alfredo Sosa/Staff Parent and volunteer Sandra Hinman poses with her children Chase, 8, and Troy,12, at the Holmes STEM Academy's community garden on Sept. 29 in Flint, Mich. Hinman says that, despite Flint's problems, there is an outpouring of support from the community, which is moving to embrace its schools.

When my children are thirsty, they go to the sink and fill a cup. I hadn’t thought of that as a privilege.

But for Sandra Hinman’s kids, it is.

The Flint mom told me that when they visit people in other towns, the first thing her kids ask for is a drink of water – from the tap.

Though ​the city is still enduring the injustice of a poisoned water system, and ​​Ms. Hinman was devastated to learn her children had been exposed to lead, she says it also makes them understand how precious things are: “There are children all over the world that have to drink [unclean water] every day. We’re fortunate to live in a country where people are sending us bottled water...”

The refugees with Olympic dreams

For Africa correspondent Ryan Lenora Brown, one of the most striking refugee stories of the year was that of the first Refugee Olympic Team.

Ryan Lenora Brown Garkuouth Puok Diep (l.), a South Sudanese marathoner who hopes to qualify for the refugee Olympic team, runs in Eldoret,Kenya, with his training partner, Kenyan Michael Cheboi.

In April, I had the chance to spend a week with 15 of the athletes competing to be on that team – a group of runners from South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Somalia who were being trained by one of Kenya’s greatest distance runners, Tegla Loroupe.

There are many chances as a reporter to write about the plight of refugees – their struggles and their sorrows – but fewer to give readers a window onto other, more prosaic parts of their lives – their ambitions, their hobbies, their hopes. I hope this story does that.

Finding a rare story of reconciliation in Iraq

In 2014, Sunni jihadists from ISIS killed more than 1,700 Shiite cadets in the Iraqi city of Tikrit, which seemed set to trigger an especially brutal blood feud. But it didn’t happen. The reasons why captivated veteran war reporter Scott Peterson.

Scott Peterson/The Christian Science Monitor/Getty Images Darkness gathers Nov. 10, 2016, over the memorial to the Islamic State massacre of 1,700 Iraqi Shiite cadets from Camp Speicher in June 2014. The memorial is beneath a bridge in Tikrit where the victims were shot and their bodies thrown into the Tigris River by the Sunni jihadist group.

Since I started covering Iraq in 1991, there has been very little good news. So I was very pleasantly surprised to write about how Sunni and Shiite politicians in Tikrit worked with Iraqi peace facilitators to overcome demands for revenge.

“When we started, all the signs were bad.… We thought it was a lost cause,” the mayor of Tikrit, Omar Tariq al-Shindah, told me.

Through a carefully calibrated solution of accountability and apology, tens of thousands of displaced Sunnis returned safely home, and Shiites found a degree of justice. The result could yield lessons for Iraq to break the cycle of sectarian conflict.

A different story of migration: Shahzad and his Austrian foster family

A fellow journalist happened to tell European bureau chief Sara Miller Llana about an Afghan boy who had lost his entire family and traveled to Europe mainly on foot – and was taken in by his German teacher's family.

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Shahzad Haidari (facing camera) eats dinner with his foster family in Vienna.

After covering hardship on the migrant trail for a year, I heard about Shahzad.

I wasn’t sure he and his foster family would want their story told, so it was with trepidation that Monitor photographer Melanie Stetson Freeman and I showed up at their house for dinner. But the connection was immediate. And they remain such an inspiration.

Every time I hear a horrible story about migration I wonder how this family will process it together. That helps me put the broader refugee story in perspective, thinking about the humans living through the experience and not just numbers or headlines. Though I check in with the family from time to time, they probably have no idea how much they mean to me.

Joining an NRA member on his shooting range

Simon Montlake’s interest in whether it was possible to move past the political impasse on guns led him to Ralph Demicco.

JOHN J. HAPPEL/THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR Ralph Demicco, a gun enthusiast and former gun shop owner in New Hampshire, is working with mental health experts to try to curb firearm suicides.

Mr. Demicco is a fascinating character – a New Hampshire gun seller and NRA member who wants to prevent gun suicides and is willing to work with public-health officials, who are viewed with suspicion by many gun-rights folks.

I spent hours talking to Demicco, who told me about the customers who bought guns from him and used them to take their lives – and the ones whom he didn't serve because he recognized the risk.

On my second visit we went to his range behind his house for a photo shoot. After he'd fired some rounds he asked if I wanted a go. It was my first time, and my aim was bad. But it felt important to stand in his shoes for a minute.

One last wild, wooly trip to the hinterlands of China

Peter Ford, who in March wrapped up his sixth foreign posting for the Monitor, recounts his prescient trip to China’s last major undammed river.

PETER FORD/THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR The Nu carves through some of China’s most stunning scenery and runs toward Myanmar, where it is known as the Salween, and from there into the Andaman Sea.

Before I end a foreign posting, I like to go somewhere really wild and wooly. Just before I left China I visited the Nu River, plunging through some of the most beautiful scenery in a distant corner of the country, between Tibet and Burma. The Nu is China’s last major undammed river, but the government had long been planning to exploit its hydropower potential.

I sensed that opponents of the dams were beginning to prevail, and my story in April reflected environmentalists’ growing hopes of victory. Those hopes were crowned last month when the government signaled it was abandoning the dam projects. The decision, say Chinese activists, points to the government’s increasing awareness of environmental issues.

The Washington florist

Warren Richey waded into one of America's most pitched cultural battles, and came away with a deeper view of the constitutional claims of both sides.

Elaine Thompson/AP/File Barronelle Stutzman (center) a Richland, Wash., florist who was fined for denying service to a gay couple in 2013, looks around as she is surrounded by supporters after a hearing before Washington's Supreme Court on Nov. 15 in Bellevue, Wash.

When Barronelle Stutzman refused to arrange the flowers for a same-sex wedding ceremony, the Richland, Wash., florist never expected to become a national symbol of anti-gay bigotry. She just wanted to live her life consistent with the teachings of her Southern Baptist faith.

This was a difficult story to research and write because I felt a strong sense of the righteousness of the gay couple’s cause. They just wanted to live free as full members of society like everyone else.

But because of my own upbringing in a minority religious group that is, itself, sometimes ridiculed and vilified, I also felt a connection with Mrs. Stutzman’s claim of religious liberty. And I admired her courage.

In writing the story I wanted readers to understand what can happen when competing constitutional values collide in a court of law and in the court of public opinion.

The story I didn't want to write

Linda Feldmann thought voters in the heat of battle wouldn't be thinking about how to bridge America's political divide after the election; they’d be thinking about how their candidate could win.

USA TODAY

SWAN QUARTER, N.C. — Florence showed no sign of letting up Saturday, taking its torrential rain, powerful winds and storm surges deep into South Carolina before an expected northerly turn that could head it toward the Ohio Valley, the National Hurricane Center reported.

Since marching ashore Friday near Wilmington, North Carolina, as a hurricane, Florence had claimed five lives, caused widespread flooding and knocked out power to nearly 900,000 homes.

Now, as a tropical storm, it is expected to produce more flash floods as it drops up to another 25 inches of rain in some areas. Also possible are storm surges of up to 7 feet and possible tornadoes.

At 2 a.m. EST Saturday, the center of the storm was about 35 miles from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph. It was moving at a paltry 5 mph.

In the first report of storm-related fatalities, a mother and infant died after a tree fell on a house in Wilmington, North Carolina, according to local police. The father was hospitalized with injuries.

In addition, a woman in Hampstead suffered a heart attack Friday morning, but emergency crews hampered by downed trees in the road could not reach her before she died, ABC News reports.

A fourth person was killed while plugging in a generator and a fifth when he was blown down trying to check on his hunting dogs in Lenoir County, north of Wilmington, said Emergency Planner Samuel Kornegay, emergency planner for the county's emergency services division.

North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said Friday that several other deaths were under investigation as possibly related to the storm.

""We have days of rain ahead of us,"" he warned. ""If you're asked to evacuate, go.""

Meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com calculates that Hurricane Florence is forecast to dump 9.6 trillion gallons, enough rain to cover the Tar Heel state in about 10 inches of water.

The National Weather Service says 16 inches of rain has already fallen in parts of North Carolina.

Tom Collins, emergency management director in Pender County, N.C., says the woman in Hampstead had a heart attack Friday morning, but emergency crews could not get to her because of the downed trees. Collins says crews have a front loader they're using to clear roads, but a tree went through the windshield.

In New Bern, where the Neuse and Trent rivers intersect, around 200 people were rescued after being stranded in their homes overnight, according to Mayor Dana Outlaw. Another 150, including some trapped in second floors of houses or in attics, awaited rescue.

Cinder blocks that were part of the structure crumbled in some places and portions of the roof were missing. Police and fire teams forced their way into some rooms to free the residents, who were temporarily taken to the town's center for public safety.

Rescuers were able to reach a flooded animal shelter in Newport, N.C., after the Carteret County Humane Society put out a call for help on Facebook. The Cajun Navy, a group of volunteers in boats, brought two stranded shelter workers, 43 dogs, 80 cats and roughly 15 chickens to safety.

In keeping with presidential tradition, a detailed schedule of the funeral and memorial services for former President George H.W. Bush was released Saturday evening, with ceremonies planned in Houston, Washington, D.C., Spring, Texas, and College Station, Texas. Bush died late Friday at age 94.

In honor of the 41st president, President Trump has declared Wednesday a national day of mourning, the White House said, and issued an executive order to close federal offices. Trump also announced that he'll be sending one of the Boeing 747s that serves as Air Force One to Houston to transport Bush's casket to Washington, D.C.

On Monday, members of both the House and Senate will attend an arrival ceremony held at the U.S. Capitol at 4:45 p.m. ET. Bush will lie in state in the rotunda until Wednesday morning.

Family and friends will then gather at the National Cathedral in Washington for an 11 a.m. funeral service on Wednesday.

Bush will be taken to his home of Houston, where he'll lie in repose at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston from 7:45 p.m. ET Wednesday until 7 a.m. ET Thursday. The church will also hold a second memorial service for the former president at 11 a.m. ET Thursday.

On Thursday afternoon, a motorcade will take Bush's body to Union Pacific Railroad Westfield Auto Facility. From there, a funeral train transports Bush to Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas, the site of the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, where he will be laid to rest.

Bush will be buried next to his wife and former first lady Barbara Bush, who died in April, and his daughter Pauline Robinson ""Robin"" Bush, who died in 1953 at just 3 years old.

More details about Bush's funeral arrangements are posted on a tribute website for the former president. For those who want to pay their respects, the Bush family requested that donations be made to the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University to ""help ensure that President Bush's legacy of public service with integrity is perpetuated.""",www.npr.org,center,5yiRo5kSadxgVKNs
general_news,Salon,0,http://www.salon.com/2014/12/31/the_2014_hall_of_shame_looking_back_at_the_years_worst_candidates/,The 2014 hall of shame: Looking back at the year’s worst candidates,2014-12-31,Luke Brinker,"With the midterm elections nearly two months behind us , the political press has long since pivoted to 2016 . But this being the end of the year and all , now is as apt a time as any to look back and take stock of the 2014 campaign before finally consigning it to the ash heap of political history .
Today , we turn our attention to the five worst candidates of the cycle . Of course , every election year features a select slate of disastrous candidates ( Do the names Sharron Angle , Christine O'Donnell , Todd Akin or Richard Mourdock ring any bells ? ) It 's not that this year witnessed the nomination of uniquely bad candidates -- indeed , compared to past candidates notorious for dabbling in topics like witchcraft and rape , this year 's crop of contenders was positively splendid .
Still , some candidates managed to go from odds-on favorites to Election Day losers , while others badly fumbled closely contested races and ended up losing by far larger margins than expected . Here , without further adieu , we rank the 2014 hall of political shame .
Democrats still shudder when they think back to the early winter of 2010 , when , after a lackadaisical campaign , Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley blew a 30-point lead in the special election to succeed the late Sen. Ted Kennedy , losing to Republican Scott Brown by 5 points . But Coakley dusted herself off and won another term as attorney general that fall , with an eye toward ultimately redeeming herself and winning higher office .
Democratic Gov . Deval Patrick 's decision not to seek a third term gave Coakley that opening . While many Democrats remained scarred by the 2010 experience , Coakley assured the party that she 'd learned from her humiliating defeat , and early polling gave her a double-digit lead over GOP gubernatorial candidate Charlie Baker . A repeat of 2010 could n't have been in the cards -- right ?
But it was . Lingering doubts prevented Coakley from consolidating support in her own party , and 58 percent of Democratic voters supported candidates other than Coakley in the September primary . Such a late and divisive primary left Coakley little time to unite Democrats , and despite a massive fundraising gap between Coakley and the well-funded Baker , fellow Massachusetts Democrats were reluctant to pony up and contribute to Coakley 's campaign . By mid-September , polls showed the race effectively tied , and Coakley never recovered , losing to Baker by 2 points on Election Day .
To be sure , moderate Republicans like Baker have won five of the last seven Massachusetts gubernatorial races , so his victory was hardly precedent-breaking . But there was never a clear rationale for Coakley 's campaign -- other than that she wanted a job promotion -- and the fact that she has now lost two major elections after once leading in both by 30 points does n't exactly speak highly of her political acumen .
When Democrat Chad Taylor dropped out of the three-way Kansas Senate race in early September , GOP Sen. Pat Roberts looked like he was in real trouble . Polls showed him losing badly in a head-to-head contest with independent Greg Orman , a self-funding millionaire businessman . But Roberts rallied the GOP troops , portraying Orman as a liberal Trojan Horse for national Democrats and bringing conservatives like Ted Cruz and Sarah Palin to stump for him .
It worked . Roberts ' base mobilization played a key role in his victory , but do n't discount the avoidable errors Orman committed during the campaign . Fearful of looking like a ( gulp ) Democrat , he emphasized that even though he supported President Obama in 2008 , he voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 , and adamantly refused to say whether he 'd caucus with the Republicans or Democrats in the Senate . Orman ran a campaign heavy on No Labels-type platitudes -- he wanted to `` go to Washington , solve problems , and focus on challenges that affected Kansans '' -- while taking care to avoid policy specifics . For awhile , it looked like that sufficed ; the final polling average in the race gave him a tiny edge over the incumbent .
But the polls were way off , and Roberts trounced Orman by 11 points . It turns out that you ca n't beat something with nothing , after all . And while it may have been a strong Republican year in a strongly Republican state , Orman 's strategy of distancing himself from Democrats did him no favors . Even as Orman went down to a double-digit defeat , Paul Davis , running as a Democrat , came within 4 points of unseating Gov . Sam Brownback .
What does it take to lose to one of the country 's most unpopular senators ? It helps , of course , if that senator is a Republican in a midterm climate that favors Republicans . But as Kentucky Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes ' loss to Mitch McConnell attests , a permanent defensive crouch does n't hurt , either .
Not unlike Orman , Grimes took pains to distance herself from Obama and the Democratic Party , avowing that she was a `` Clinton Democrat '' and repeatedly refusing to say whether she voted for the president . She also excoriated Obama in terms that sounded like they came directly from a Republican National Committee press release , denouncing his administration 's so-called war on coal , for instance . It made McConnell 's effort to secure a sixth term considerably easier . All McConnell had to do was ask the following : If even my Democratic opponent agrees that Obama is waging war on this state , why would you vote to empower his party in the U.S. Senate ?
By Election Day , it was clear that Grimes , once touted as a top Democratic recruit , would lose -- probably by a margin in the mid-to-high single digits . She fared even worse than the polls predicted , however ; McConnell crushed her by 16 points .
Having gained nine Senate seats this year -- better than the six to eight most forecasters predicted -- it would seem that Republicans could hardly have performed better in the fight to control the chamber . But the Michigan Senate race is a rare example of a contest in which the party surrendered an early lead , and while Michigan is indeed a mostly blue state , the GOP 's poor performance in the race had virtually everything to do with Republican nominee Terri Lynn Land 's calamitous campaign .
Land , a former Michigan secretary of state , was n't the GOP 's first choice in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Carl Levin , but she looked like a credible enough contender . Early polls showed Land either tied with or leading Rep. Gary Peters , the Democratic candidate . In March , Nate Silver 's FiveThirtyEight pegged Land 's chances of victory at 45 percent , suggesting that the race was effectively a coin flip .
But Land gradually wrote herself out of contention -- running bizarre campaign ads , dodging questions on policy issues , and failing to assert control of her campaign . By the late summer , she was a clear underdog , and Republicans were already trashing Land as politically inept and woefully unprepared for the rigors of a Senate campaign .
Peters ultimately cruised to a 13-point victory on Election Day , even as Michigan voters reelected Rick Snyder , the state 's Republican governor .
For progressives , the retirement of populist liberal Sen. Tom Harkin was already a big loss . What makes Harkin 's impending departure even more cruel is that he 'll be succeeded by Joni Ernst , a right-wing conspiracy theorist who once supported arresting federal officials for implementing Obamacare , declared that she keeps a gun in case the government should `` decide that my rights are no longer important , '' and flirted with President Obama 's impeachment .
Ernst did n't trumpet such views during the campaign ; she ran a primarily personality-based race in which she promoted her hog-castrating , motorcycle-riding , farm girl persona . On Election Day , she defeated the charisma-challenged Rep. Bruce Braley , the Democratic nominee , by 8 points .
Though his support never hit 50 percent , Braley had begun the campaign with a clear edge , but he proved a rusty campaigner -- and paid the price . Most Iowans got to know him as the guy who hated Iowa farmers . In reality , Braley simply got caught on tape noting that it 's a bit silly for Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley , who has an agricultural background but lacks a law degree , to be the Republican poised to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee . Even if the GOP-generated outrage over Braley 's comment was dumb and his point was a fair one , a four-term congressman should be well aware that politics is often a dumb business and that thanks to a press corps obsessed with gaffes and gotcha moments , it does n't matter how valid a point is if you make it inartfully .
Once it emerged that Braley had gotten into a fierce dispute with a neighbor over trespassing chickens , it cemented the image of him as something of a prick . Ernst pounced on Chickengate , making the asinine claim that if Braley could n't even get along with his own neighbors , he 'd surely be an ineffective senator . It was , again , a dumb debate over a non-issue , but it 's hard to blame Ernst , tactically speaking , for making the race a referendum on Braley 's personality rather than her insane worldview .
To be fair , the election of Sen. Ernst ( R-World Net Daily ) was n't just a matter of Braley being a problematic candidate . Committed to the narrative that Republicans had undergone a post-Tea Party makeover , a lazy mainstream media largely glided over Ernst 's disturbing extremism , all but handing her the keys to a six-year Senate term . But it 's hard to believe that Harkin or any other politically deft Democrat would have lost to Ernst -- let alone by such an unexpectedly wide margin . It would also have helped , perhaps , if Braley had actually faced a competitive primary , rather than running unopposed for the Democratic nod . His flaws on the stump may have been exposed , giving the party enough time to stave off a wholly unnecessary , perfectly avoidable defeat .
So hats off to you , Bruce Braley . You wo n't be a senator , but you 've earned the ( dubious ) distinction of being 2014 's worst candidate .","With the midterm elections nearly two months behind us, the political press has long since pivoted to 2016.

A bad batch of Botox will have everyone in the Democratic primary hospitalized just before their first debate, with the exception of former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley who declined to go with “Biden’s guy” because he always carries his own stash. Senator Elizabeth Warren files “hate crime” charges against the doctor, claiming he should have used less tainted Botox because of her high “native American” cheekbones. That case is dismissed when, during a pretrial motion hearing, no one could stop laughing at her claim of being a minority. She wins the Iowa primary the following January by focusing her campaign efforts on shuttling those who’ve recently suffered closed head injuries to the polls.

The possibilities for 2015 are endless, and will probably be annoying (at a minimum). Republicans will “sell-out” or otherwise irritate people who make their living screaming about “the Establishment,” the President will continue to ignore the Constitution and get away with it, the media will suck and pollute televisions from coast to coast with people who make up for their lack of first-hand knowledge through a doubling-down on a lack of institutional knowledge, and the Cubs won’t win the World Series. That last bit is just a swipe at my Chicago friends, but it stands a decent chance at being the least true of any of these predictions.

As the Georgia Legislature considers blocking a tax break for Delta Air Lines, other states and cities are lining up to put out the welcome mat for the carrier to move its headquarters from Atlanta.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, tweeted to Delta on Tuesday that “if Georgia politicians disagree with your stand against gun violence, we invite you to move your headquarters to New York.”

Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, tweeted to Delta that “you’re welcome here any time.”

Georgia conservatives threaten Delta tax break after airline cuts ties with NRA

The solicitations came after leaders of the Georgia state Senate threatened a jet-fuel tax break Monday for Delta because of the airline’s halt to a discount-fare program with the National Rifle Association.

Delta announced the change Saturday in an effort to stay out of the political debate over gun control after the Feb. 14 shooting deaths of 17 people at a Florida high school.

Even members of Congress are joining the recruitment. Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan tweeted that the quality of life and infrastructure in northwest Ohio would make a great headquarters for the airline.

“I’d love to show you around!” Ryan said.

Local officials didn’t want to miss out on the action. Randall Woodfin, the mayor of Birmingham, Ala., invited a chat about moving Delta’s headquarters to his city.

The Georgia jabs came amid a serious debate over gun control and tax policy.

More than a dozen companies, including United Airlines, Metlife, Hertz, Avis and Best Western have ended marketing deals with NRA.

But the move instead thrust Delta into the center of the gun debate, potentially costing it a tax break estimated at $40 million that had already been approved as part of a larger package in the state House.

Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, a Republican who heads the Senate and is running for governor, threatened to kill any tax break for Delta unless the airline reversed course.

His full-throated advocacy became a rallying cry for conservative opposition to gun proposals. Cagle argued discriminating against law-abiding citizens wouldn’t solve the problem.

The NRA tweeted that “those on the left pushing for a boycott to pressure companies to drop discounts just shows how out of touch some are.”

Republican Gov. Nathan Deal pushed for the tax package but hasn’t commented on the Delta dispute.

general_news,CBS News,0,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tonya-couch-mom-affluenza-ethan-couch-us-custody-los-angeles-california/,"Records provide look into ""affluenza"" teen's upbringing",,,"FORT WORTH , Texas -- The Texas teenager who used an `` affluenza '' defense in a deadly drunken-driving wreck grew up in a wealthy yet unstable household where his parents underwent an acrimonious divorce , which included accusations that his mother was addicted to pain pills and his father was abusive .
The divorce provides a revealing backdrop for the latest chapter in Ethan Couch 's troubled life : He and his mother were arrested Monday after fleeing to Mexico while he was on probation and using one of their phones to order a pizza delivered to a condo in the resort city of Puerto Vallarta .
On Wednesday , the 18-year-old won a delay in deportation . The ruling could lead to a much longer court process if a judge decides Couch has grounds to challenge his deportation based on arguments that kicking him out of Mexico would violate his rights . The judge has three days to consider the appeal .
Such cases can take anywhere from two weeks to several months , depending on the priorities of the local courts and the actions of defense attorneys , said Richard Hunter , chief deputy for the U.S . Marshals Service in South Texas .
Video from CBS Dallas station KTVT appears to show Couch clad in a dark baseball hat and coat being moved to a larger immigration facility in Mexico City .
Tonya Couch is taken by authorities to a waiting car after arriving at Los Angeles International Airport Dec. 31 , 2015 , in Los Angeles . AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill
Couch 's mother , Tonya Couch , was brought through Los Angeles International Airport early Thursday in handcuffs after a flight from Mexico . She was in the custody of the Los Angeles Police Department Thursday morning , records show .
It was unclear why she was brought to Los Angeles and unclear where she would be taken next . A U.S . Marshals spokesman said he could not reveal any details about her trip , citing security concerns in transporting someone in custody .
Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson has said he believes the mother and son fled in late November after a video surfaced that appears to show Couch at a party where people were drinking . He said authorities have no evidence that Couch 's father was involved in the getaway .
Couch was driving drunk and speeding south of Fort Worth in June 2013 when he crashed into a disabled SUV parked on the side of the road , killing four people and injuring several others , including passengers in his pickup truck . He pleaded guilty to four counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of intoxication assault causing serious bodily injury .
During the sentencing phase of his trial , a defense expert argued that his wealthy parents had coddled him into a sense of irresponsibility - a condition the expert termed `` affluenza . '' The condition is not recognized as a medical diagnosis by the American Psychiatric Association , and its invocation drew ridicule .
A judge sentenced him in juvenile court to 10 years ' probation and a stint in a rehabilitation center .
When Fred and Tonya Couch divorced in 2006 , the court ordered psychological evaluations of both parents and Ethan , their only child . Fred Couch , now 50 , told a social worker that their marriage had been a `` mistake from the start , '' Johnson County court documents show .
He said that his wife , now 48 , was addicted to Vicodin and had given the painkiller to their son about five times . She also kept his bed in her room and considered him to be her `` protector . ''
Tonya Couch said the marriage ended because her husband had been verbally and physically abusive . She said there was daily name-calling , that he often grabbed her by the hair and that he once `` threw her into a fireplace . ''
Ethan Couch said his parents had always `` yelled at each other a lot , '' and he wished that they `` would n't put him in the middle . ''
The social worker concluded that the Couches had `` adultified '' a then-9-year-old Ethan , allowing him to become overly involved in adult issues and decisions .
After his parents ' divorce , the Couches ' son lived mainly with his mother in a gated , 5,000-square-foot ranch home set on 6 acres of land in rural Burleson , Texas .

Why mother of ""affluenza"" teen could face harsher sentence

The divorce provides a revealing backdrop for the latest chapter in Ethan Couch's troubled life: He and his mother were arrested Monday after fleeing to Mexico while he was on probation and using one of their phones to order a pizza delivered to a condo in the resort city of Puerto Vallarta.

On Wednesday, the 18-year-old won a delay in deportation. The ruling could lead to a much longer court process if a judge decides Couch has grounds to challenge his deportation based on arguments that kicking him out of Mexico would violate his rights. The judge has three days to consider the appeal.

Such cases can take anywhere from two weeks to several months, depending on the priorities of the local courts and the actions of defense attorneys, said Richard Hunter, chief deputy for the U.S. Marshals Service in South Texas.

Video from CBS Dallas station KTVT appears to show Couch clad in a dark baseball hat and coat being moved to a larger immigration facility in Mexico City.

Couch's mother, Tonya Couch, was brought through Los Angeles International Airport early Thursday in handcuffs after a flight from Mexico. She was in the custody of the Los Angeles Police Department Thursday morning, records show.

""Affluenza"" teen back in custody

It was unclear why she was brought to Los Angeles and unclear where she would be taken next. A U.S. Marshals spokesman said he could not reveal any details about her trip, citing security concerns in transporting someone in custody.

Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson has said he believes the mother and son fled in late November after a video surfaced that appears to show Couch at a party where people were drinking. He said authorities have no evidence that Couch's father was involved in the getaway.

Couch was driving drunk and speeding south of Fort Worth in June 2013 when he crashed into a disabled SUV parked on the side of the road, killing four people and injuring several others, including passengers in his pickup truck. He pleaded guilty to four counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of intoxication assault causing serious bodily injury.

During the sentencing phase of his trial, a defense expert argued that his wealthy parents had coddled him into a sense of irresponsibility - a condition the expert termed ""affluenza."" The condition is not recognized as a medical diagnosis by the American Psychiatric Association, and its invocation drew ridicule.

A judge sentenced him in juvenile court to 10 years' probation and a stint in a rehabilitation center.

When Fred and Tonya Couch divorced in 2006, the court ordered psychological evaluations of both parents and Ethan, their only child. Fred Couch, now 50, told a social worker that their marriage had been a ""mistake from the start,"" Johnson County court documents show.

He said that his wife, now 48, was addicted to Vicodin and had given the painkiller to their son about five times. She also kept his bed in her room and considered him to be her ""protector.""

Tonya Couch said the marriage ended because her husband had been verbally and physically abusive. She said there was daily name-calling, that he often grabbed her by the hair and that he once ""threw her into a fireplace.""

Ethan Couch said his parents had always ""yelled at each other a lot,"" and he wished that they ""wouldn't put him in the middle.""

The social worker concluded that the Couches had ""adultified"" a then-9-year-old Ethan, allowing him to become overly involved in adult issues and decisions.

After his parents' divorce, the Couches' son lived mainly with his mother in a gated, 5,000-square-foot ranch home set on 6 acres of land in rural Burleson, Texas.

Tonya Couch had her nursing license revoked in 2012 for failing to disclose a reckless driving charge in 2003, according to the Texas Board of Nursing.

Fred Couch founded Cleburne Metal Works, which does large-scale metal roofing, in 1986.

His lawyer confessed to federal crimes, implicating the president in the process. The government of Saudi Arabia killed a Washington Post columnist and continues to kill civilians with airstrikes in Yemen, and retained the support of the US government throughout.

This is all real, and truly alarming. But it would be a mistake to view these events as the sum total of the world in 2018.

Under the radar, some aspects of life on Earth are getting dramatically better. Here are just four.

1) Extreme poverty is falling

This is probably the most important chart on this list. The extraordinary rate of economic growth in India and China — as well as slower but still significant growth in other developing countries — has led to a huge decline in the share of the world population living on less than $1.90 a day, from 35.9 percent in 1990 to only 10 percent in 2015.

But it estimates that the 2018 rate will be about 8.6 percent, a notable decline from 2015.

While we’re continuing to make progress, the World Bank report is also clear that progress is slowing. While in 1990, most poor people lived in East Asia, today most live in Sub-Saharan Africa, where growth in GDP per capita has been slower than in East or South Asia in recent decades. Unless that changes, the rate of poverty reduction could go down.

But that doesn’t change the fact that poverty is, in fact, declining. It should be declining faster, but we’re making progress.

2) Child mortality is falling

An overall improvement in global public health has accompanied the decline in extreme poverty. One good example: kids born in 2017 are much less likely to die in their first five years of life than kids born in 1990 (like myself) were.

The global under-five mortality rate fell from 93 per 1,000 to 39 to 1,000, meaning it fell by over 58 percent. We don’t have data for 2018 yet, but given the change just between 2015 and 2017, it’s likely there was a further decline.

Even if the pace of progress slows down, the reduction in death rates in 2018 could wind up saving 100,000 kids’ lives, easily.

3) We’re getting better at preventing preventable diseases

There are a variety of reasons for the decline in preventable deaths among children. Health improves with income, so the decline in extreme poverty helps, and richer countries can afford more extensive and more universal health care programs. One specific reason worth highlighting is more expenditure on preventative measures: programs that prevent disease and can save lives at quite low cost.

A great example are insecticidal bednets for malaria, a highly effective intervention that can meaningfully prevent infections and save lives. The share of the population in sub-Saharan African covered by these has been steadily increasing in recent years:

More generally, malaria is an area where scientists and global health practitioners have been making great progress. A new technology that could be able to radically control or outright eliminate malaria — gene drive mosquitos — are almost ready, and foundations like Gates and Open Philanthropy Project are devoting huge sums to fund its development and testing. Target Malaria, the main group working on that solution, could start testing it in the field within the coming decade.

4) Clean energy is getting cheaper

The big exception to any story of the world getting better is, obviously, climate change. It’s real, the trajectory is bad (we’re on track for 3.1 to 3.7ºC of warming by 2100 unless current government policies change), and we’re all going to suffer for it in the coming decades.

But avoiding total hopelessness on the issue requires paying attention to those areas where things are getting better. One bright spot is the declining price of solar power, which is fueling a rapid increase in adoption. Solar and wind are now cheaper per megawatt hour than gas or oil, though better batteries are needed if the two are to become primary sources of energy.

As Dave Roberts explains, this is largely a triumph of government policy and concerted efforts to invest in solar R&D.

Cheap solar and wind is not enough to triumph over global warming. For one thing, these technologies have to be cost-competitive with coal and natural gas worldwide to keep global emissions down to reasonable levels. For another, while solar and wind are great sources of electricity, not all energy humans consume is electrical.

Petroleum-fueled cars are the obvious example, but there’s also propane heating, natural gas furnaces, etc. And solar and wind, while great, are inconsistent, meaning they need to be paired either with better and more numerous batteries, or with more consistent zero-carbon sources of power, like nuclear or carbon-capture fossil fuel plants.

So, as Roberts has argued, we need to electrify as much of our energy as possible, and make sure our electricity is as clean as possible. Cheap solar and wind makes the second part much, much easier.

“ We ’ re talking about breaching , in some places significant amounts of steel , rebar and metal , ” sheriff ’ s Lt. Jeff Hallock told the Associated Press . A defeat that required sophisticated tools from outside the jail .
After prison tailor Joyce Mitchell pleaded guilty to helping two upstate New York inmates Richard Matt and David Sweat escape last summer , the spotlight is being turned on employees in the Orange County jail who may have helped the three inmates escape Friday .

After prison tailor Joyce Mitchell pleaded guilty to helping two upstate New York inmates Richard Matt and David Sweat escape last summer, the spotlight is being turned on employees in the Orange County jail who may have helped the three inmates escape Friday.

general_news,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/10/02/ebola-most-us-hospitals-not-prepared-for-deadly-disease/,OPINION: Ebola: Most US hospitals not prepared for deadly disease,2014-10-02,Betsy Mccaughey,"Thomas Frieden , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , announced on Tuesday that a man who flew from Liberia to Dallas last week is infected with Ebola and being treated at Texas Presbyterian Hospital .
The CDC should discourage panic . But Frieden went overboard . Listening to him , you ’ d think C-D-C stands for Centers for Denial and Confusion .
Frieden flatly rejects limiting commercial air traffic from Ebola-stricken African countries , claiming it would cripple their economies and recovery efforts . Perhaps , but what about the risks to Americans ? From the outbreak ’ s start , Frieden has predicted that patients infected with Ebola will fly to the U.S. and seek care in hospitals here .
Whether -- or how many -- Americans die of Ebola will depend on what hospitals do when travelers carrying the disease arrive in the emergency room . Frieden claims hospitals are well prepared . The truth is , some are but many are not .
Cities like Dallas and New York are home to enclaves of Liberians and other West African newcomers , making it all the more likely that visitors from West Africa could be headed there .
In Dallas , the infected traveler , Thomas Eric Duncan , went to the emergency room on Sept. 25.He told one nurse he had just come from Liberia , but that critical fact was ignored , and he was sent home with antibiotics instead of being put into isolation and tested .
The hospital ’ s epidemiologist , Dr. Edward Goodman claims “ we have had a plan in place for some time now for a patient presenting with possible Ebola. ” Not a very good plan , obviously . After leaving the hospital , Duncan grew sicker over the next few days , and returned by ambulance . The emergency staff who originally treated him and the three ambulance personnel are now under observation for Ebola .
The infection control mistakes at Texas Presbyterian are reminiscent of what ended up killing44 people in Toronto when SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) struck therein March , 2003 .
A patient who had unknowingly picked up the virus from an Asian traveler went to a Toronto hospital for help and was left sitting in a crowded emergency room for 16 hours , infecting others , before the staff realized he might have SARS and isolated him .
In contrast , when a SARS-infected traveler sought care at a Vancouver hospital with rigorous infection control , he was isolated within five minutes , and not one other person there contracted the disease.One hospital averted an outbreak . The other hospital failed .
Most hospitals in the U.S. lack the rigor and discipline to control Ebola . That ’ s why common infectious diseases such as MRSA and C. diff are racing through these hospitals , killing an estimated 75,000 patients every year . Ebola is even deadlier . Yet the CDC has done little to equip hospitals , other than send around memos .
At the Tuesday announcement , Frieden said “ I have no doubt we will control this case of Ebola so that it does not spread widely. ” Those are weasel words .
As an example of “ control , ” he pointed to what Nigeria did when another infected Liberian , Patrick Sawyer , flew there on July 20 , collapsed , was hospitalized and died . Twenty Nigerians , mostly health care workers who treated Sawyer , contracted the virus , and 8 have died . So when Frieden promises “ control , ” of the Dallas case , does he mean it ’ s OK for 8 Texans to die ?

We all hope for the best for the doctors and nurses at Texas Presbyterian and any other hospitals hit with Ebola . But hope and spin will not be enough to stop Ebola .","Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, announced on Tuesday that a man who flew from Liberia to Dallas last week is infected with Ebola and being treated at Texas Presbyterian Hospital.

The CDC should discourage panic. But Frieden went overboard. Listening to him,you’d think C-D-C stands for Centers for Denial and Confusion.

Frieden flatly rejects limiting commercial air traffic from Ebola-stricken African countries, claiming it would cripple their economies and recovery efforts. Perhaps,but what about the risks to Americans? From the outbreak’s start, Frieden has predicted that patients infected with Ebola will fly to the U.S. and seek care in hospitals here.

[pullquote]

Whether -- or how many -- Americans die of Ebola will depend on what hospitals do when travelers carrying the disease arrive in the emergency room. Frieden claims hospitals are well prepared. The truth is, some are but many are not.

More On This...

Cities like Dallas and New York are home to enclaves of Liberians and other West African newcomers, making it all the more likely that visitors from West Africa could be headed there.

In Dallas, the infected traveler, Thomas Eric Duncan,went to the emergency room on Sept. 25.He told one nurse he had just come from Liberia, but that critical fact was ignored, and he was sent home with antibiotics instead of being put into isolation and tested.

The hospital’s epidemiologist, Dr. Edward Goodman claims “we have had a plan in place for some time now for a patient presenting with possible Ebola.” Not a very good plan, obviously. After leaving the hospital, Duncan grew sicker over the next few days, and returned by ambulance. The emergency staff who originally treated him and the three ambulance personnel are now under observation for Ebola.

The infection control mistakes at Texas Presbyterian are reminiscent of what ended up killing44 people in Toronto when SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) struck therein March, 2003.

A patient who had unknowingly picked up the virus from an Asian traveler went to a Toronto hospital for help and was left sitting in a crowded emergency room for 16 hours, infecting others, before the staff realized he might have SARS and isolated him.

In contrast, when a SARS-infected traveler sought care at a Vancouver hospital with rigorous infection control, he was isolated within five minutes, and not one other person there contracted the disease.One hospital averted an outbreak. The other hospital failed.

Most hospitals in the U.S. lack the rigor and discipline to control Ebola. That’s why common infectious diseases such as MRSA and C. diff are racing through these hospitals, killing an estimated 75,000 patients every year. Ebola is even deadlier. Yet the CDC has done little to equip hospitals, other than send around memos.

At the Tuesday announcement, Frieden said “I have no doubt we will control this case of Ebola so that it does not spread widely.” Those are weasel words.

As an example of “control,” he pointed to what Nigeria did when another infected Liberian,Patrick Sawyer, flew there on July 20, collapsed, was hospitalized and died. Twenty Nigerians, mostly health care workers who treated Sawyer, contracted the virus, and 8 have died. So when Frieden promises “control,” of the Dallas case, does he mean it’s OK for 8 Texans to die?

Frankly, if even one Texan dies, Frieden should lose his job.

Frieden understates the difficulty of dealing with Ebola. On Tuesday,when he was asked about the deaths of the Nigerian health care workers, he dismissed the question,claiming“that hospital had zero infection control” and a nurse exposed to Sawyer’s blood failed to wash her hands

Maybe one nurse was careless. But Frieden left out half the story. Dr. Ada Igonoh, who wrote an extensive report about contracting Ebola at Sawyer’s bedside and surviving it, explained that she double gloved the one and only time she touched him to check his pulse, and caught the virus anyway.

On the most immediate level , the new timeline has clearly made the service a little friendlier and livelier .

But you can ’ t see more of some kinds of tweets without seeing less of others , and the hidden consequences of that equation could affect us all .

Facebook has taken the brunt of the blame for the fake news and sensationalism that polluted political news in the 2016 U.S. presidential election , both because it is bigger and because its more potent algorithm lends itself to those pitfalls . But Twitter played a role , too , and with the world ’ s most powerful person setting national policy via tweets on a daily basis , the service has never been more influential than it is today .
The question now for Twitter is whether a service that doubles as a global news ticker and water cooler can seize this moment to regain its business footing . The rest of us need to ask a different question : Should we hope that Twitter succeeds ?
Despite insisting that the algorithm is working , Twitter declined to share its precise impact on key metrics with me . This reticence suggests that the effects , while positive , are not yet impressive enough to comfort the company ’ s restless investors . Its latest earnings report , covering the fourth quarter of 2016 , showed modest gains in active users and engagement , which CEO Jack Dorsey attributed to “ better relevance in both the timeline and notifications. ” Yet the company ’ s revenue flat-lined , and its stock dropped .
Twitter ’ s engineers are constantly probing how well the service is engaging its users , running tests that quietly enable tweaks for a small fraction of Twitter accounts , then studying the effects on their behavior . Those tests generate much richer insights now that Twitter can toy with the ordering of users ’ feeds . “ Everything we are doing , we are measuring if it ’ s working or not , ” said Deepak Rao , the product manager who oversees the company ’ s home timeline . “ We run dozens of experiments every month . ”
I spoke in depth with Rao to better understand this process and the thinking behind Twitter ’ s algorithm . In our conversation , Rao described a system that is still in its nascent stages yet is already far more complex and subtle than most users realize . It is a system so finely personalized that no two users will experience it in the same way yet rudimentary enough that its engineers are still struggling to ensure that it doesn ’ t show you the same people ’ s tweets every time you open the app .
The company told me that its own data show that the algorithm has boosted users ’ engagement along every major yardstick it watches . Not only are people spending more time reading , favoriting , and retweeting as a result , but they ’ re actually tweeting more themselves—an outcome that surprised Twitter ’ s own product managers . “ Every possible engagement and attention metric went up ” when the algorithm took effect last year , Rao told me . By exactly how much , the company declined to disclose , although a spokesperson called it “ one of our most impactful product launches . ”
As a result of the experiments made possible by the algorithm , Twitter knows more about its users than it ever did before , such as how much they value recency or how they react to seeing multiple tweets in a row from the same person . The company has tried out new features that group tweets about a given topic or hashtag within your feed . It has even experimented with showing you occasional tweets from people you don ’ t follow , if Twitter ’ s ranking system shows that you ’ re likely to want to see them . Twitter can now evaluate the efficacy of such new features by comparing their effects on user behavior to the effects of the ranked timeline and “ In case you missed it , ” another newish feature . “ Our algorithm changes on an almost daily to weekly basis , ” Rao said .
All these tweaks have yet to bear much fruit , from investors ’ perspectives . The good news for the company is that , when managed properly , machine-learning algorithms can be radically improved with time . Likewise , upticks in user engagement have a way of gaining momentum , as engagement begets engagement . Muted as its impact has been to the business so far , the algorithm may still power future product changes that both lure and retain new users—and , ultimately , get Twitter growing again in a meaningful way .
Twitter is sometimes accused by its loyalists of making changes too rashly . In fact , the company has treated its core product with excessive caution . The failure of former CEO Dick Costolo , pushed aside in 2015 , was not that he ruined the product , as so many feared . It was that he accorded it too much reverence . The business evolved on his watch , but the user experience stagnated . The timeline when he left looked and functioned much the same as it did when Costolo arrived in 2010 .
His successor , Dorsey , approved the timeline algorithm in 2015 , and its success or failure will probably be attributed to him . But the minds who developed and championed the idea within the company included former CTO Adam Messinger , former head of engineering Alex Roetter , and former head of product Kevin Weil . ( That all three have since left is a sign of the long-running dysfunction atop Twitter ’ s org chart . )
To understand why they saw the algorithm as vital to Twitter ’ s future , it helps to recall what preceded it . The reverse-chronological timeline stemmed from the site ’ s origins as a way to blast brief , real-time “ status updates ” via text message to friends and acquaintances . But over the years Twitter morphed into something more like a public platform for news , opinions , jokes . As the user base and its follow lists grew , the chronological feed ’ s limitations became clear . You ’ d log in and find yourself thrust into the middle of dozens of unrelated , often insider-y conversations , and the good stuff required tedious scrolling to unearth . For the ordinary internet user , it simply wasn ’ t worth the trouble .
This led to Twitter ’ s most existential and enduring problem as a business : its inability to retain a large proportion of the new users who sign up . In December 2012 , Twitter announced that it had 200 million monthly active users . CEO Costolo predicted that Twitter would hit 400 million within a year . Instead , the company filed to go public in late 2013 with only 218 million monthly active users . More than three years later , that active-user number is still just 319 million , and growth has slowed to a trickle . Though the comparison isn ’ t perfect , the company plateaued at roughly the age at which Facebook took off . A crucial difference between the two services : Facebook ’ s news feed algorithm , which the company implemented early on and has been aggressively improving ever since . Whereas right now Twitter ’ s algorithm affects only the tweets at the very top of your feed , Facebook ’ s automatically orders every post according to a highly sophisticated formula that is personalized to each user ’ s habits , tastes , and relationships .
That the ranked tweets are easy to miss is by design .
Part of Twitter ’ s problem has been its struggle to define the timeline ’ s precise purpose . Rao told me that this has become clearer since the algorithm launched , that the company now sees the timeline ’ s function as “ helping users to stay informed with what ’ s going on in the world. ” Twitter , in other words , is no longer a social network , at least by its own reckoning . It ’ s a real-time , personalized news service . And since there are no human editors , it falls to Twitter ’ s algorithm to determine which tweets will lead the news each time you open it .
Of all Twitter ’ s efforts to address its retention problem—and there have been many—the algorithm is its boldest . But what is the Twitter algorithm , and how does it work ? The short version is that it ’ s a software program that evaluates tweets according to various criteria , then chooses a handful to show each user at the top of his or her timeline upon opening the app . The rest of the timeline remains reverse-chronological , at least for now . For the curious ( and the confused ) , here is the long version—the first public peek into the algorithm ’ s workings .
As soon as you open it , Twitter quickly collects and assesses every recent tweet from every person you follow and assigns each one a relevance score . This score is based on a wide array of factors , ranging from the number of favorites and retweets it received to how often you ’ ve engaged with its author lately .
At the same time , the algorithm is assessing a variety of other variables—including how long you ’ ve been away from the site , how many people you follow , and your individual Twitter habits—to determine exactly how those scores will affect what you see in your feed . ( All of this happens in the background . )
The algorithm ’ s output can take different forms in your feed , but the “ ranked timeline ” and “ In case you missed it ” are the most notable additions . The ranked timeline is what was supposed to herald the end of Twitter as we know it . Visit the site or open the app after a few hours away , and the top of your feed will look much the same as it did a year ago , with a series of tweets listed in reverse-chronological order . But examine the time stamps and you ’ ll notice that these tweets aren ’ t quite as recent as you might expect . The top one might have been posted 10 or 15 minutes ago . Scroll just a few tweets down , and you might see something published an hour ago or more . Together , these are the tweets that Twitter ’ s algorithm has “ ranked ” for you to see first .
While Twitter won ’ t disclose all the signals involved in the ranking— “ thousands , ” a spokesperson told me—the company did specify a few of them . They include :
A tweet ’ s overall engagement , including retweets , clicks , favorites , and time spent reading it
A tweet ’ s engagement relative to other tweets by the same author
How much time you spend reading tweets by that author , even if you don ’ t engage .
What kind of attachment the tweet includes ( e.g . link , image , video , none ) , and what kind of attachments you tend to engage with .
The tweets that appear in this ranked section of your timeline constitute a tiny subset of the tweets you missed since the last time you were active on Twitter . So if you keep scrolling , soon enough you ’ ll reach a tweet that was published even more recently than the one that appeared at the very top of your feed . From that point on , your Twitter is back to normal , displaying every tweet from every person you follow in reverse-chronological order . And when you refresh your timeline , the ranked tweets will sink out of view .
That the ranked tweets are easy to miss , Rao told me , is by design . The company has tried at several junctures in its history to cordon off a batch of algorithmically selected tweets from the rest of the timeline . But these efforts were mostly stumbles because they didn ’ t feel like part of the core experience . ( Remember the # Discover tab ? Neither do most people . ) They were “ too module-y , ” in Rao ’ s words . He said the company ultimately decided to incorporate the ranked tweets directly into the timeline so that they wouldn ’ t detract from the “ liveliness ” of the Twitter experience .
The ICYMI feature , which used to be called “ While you were away , ” predates the ranked timeline and remains under a separate label from the rest of your feed . Given its move away from self-contained modules , many assumed Twitter would dispense with ICYMI when the ranked timeline was launched , but the company has retained it as a complementary feature . Whereas the ranked timeline will appear at the top of your feed after just an hour or two away , ICYMI typically enters your feed only when it ’ s been several hours or a few days since you last opened Twitter . The tweets that appear there are less recent , and they don ’ t appear in chronological order at all . Rather , they ’ re ordered according to their ranking scores . The tweet at the top of your ICYMI box , then , will be the one that ranked highest out of all the possible tweets from everyone you follow since the last time you logged on . It ’ s Twitter ’ s equivalent of the top post in your Facebook feed .
From a design standpoint , Twitter ’ s use of both the ICYMI box and the ranked timeline is a clunky arrangement . But if people find it confusing , Rao said no one has told him so . The goal , in his mind , is for users not to have to think about which set of ranked tweets they see at what time , or how many , or why . Twitter ’ s algorithm is supposed to do that thinking for them .
Twitter , the technology and media writer John Herrman once wrote , is a truth machine . The network ’ s inherently public structure made it relatively easy to debunk the sorts of viral rumors and misinformation that tend to spread unchecked on Facebook . But as Twitter gets better at showing users the tweets that most resonate with them , the risk is that it ’ s also getting better at reinforcing their biases and abetting their construction of alternate realities—not a marketplace of ideas , but a battlefield pocked with foxholes . This past election cycle , those searching for truth on Twitter could still find it , but for others the service doubled as a lie machine—a place where falsehoods and fake news flourished among isolated ideological subcommunities that dwell in divergent realities . The same social network that had helped to call the world ’ s attention to Tahrir Square and Ferguson became a breeding ground for conspiracy theories such as Pizzagate . The same service that gave Trump ’ s critics a platform to counter his rhetoric with facts also gave his supporters the power to drown them out in a cacophony of abuse and invective .
The reason for this self-reinforcing dynamic is unsurprising : When you draw on users ’ past habits to shape their future experiences , you risk enclosing them in bubbles of their own making—what Eli Pariser called a “ filter bubble. ” The term has often been applied to Facebook , due to its heavy reliance on a personalization algorithm that weights each post according to , among other metrics , how likely you are to hit “ like. ” Old-school Twitter could be a bubble of sorts , too , depending on who you followed . But the chronological timeline at least gave equal weight to every tweet , regardless of whether it was likely to please or upset you .
The ranked timeline , even in its modest present form , has changed that . You ’ re now far more likely to see certain types of tweets than others when you log in . The question is : What types of tweets are you seeing more of ?
While social-media ranking algorithms are incredibly difficult to perfect , it actually isn ’ t that hard to improve on a purely chronological approach when it comes to generating engagement . Without an algorithm , users might log in and see at the top of their timeline a random thought from technology writer Farhad Manjoo that got far less engagement than his typical tweets . But even a rudimentary ranking system could ensure that users are more likely to see a viral joke from comedy writer Dan Amira , playing off a popular meme , which generated far more engagement .
The question , though , is how an algorithm alters the overall playing field—whose tweets tend to flourish , and whose wither on the vine . One person who has almost certainly benefited from Twitter ’ s ranked timeline is Donald Trump . Trump may not have won the presidency because of Twitter , but it ’ s hard to imagine his campaign strategy succeeding without it . Mocked and disdained by the mainstream media , Trump used the platform as his megaphone , bypassing editorial filters to address voters directly , in his own words—and with his own facts . With each tweet gaining tens of thousands of shares , and some far more than that , Trump ’ s Twitter account became a major media organ in its own right , helping to dictate the political news of the day . While no data are available on exactly what role the algorithm played , it ’ s a safe bet that Trump ’ s tweets regularly topped his followers ’ ranked timelines , ensuring that the missives reached a much wider audience than they would have under the old system .
And it ’ s not just his fans . Before the algorithm , I used to see Trump ’ s tweets only when he happened to publish while I was online or shortly beforehand . They would trigger a sudden cavalcade of retweets and commentary in my feed , but it would quickly die down . Now the president ’ s tweets—in their original , unfiltered form—appear routinely near the top of my feed , even if he published them hours ago . I see at least one of them most weekday mornings when I log in as I prepare to board the subway to work . It ’ s often joined there by one or two of the cleverer or more trenchant responses from people I follow . ( Twitter has also recently begun using an algorithm to order the replies to popular tweets , giving rise to a cottage industry of “ first replies ” that reach a substantial portion of the original tweet ’ s audience . )
I used to see Trump ’ s tweets only when he happened to publish while I was online .
Has this improved my Twitter experience ? On the whole , I ’ d argue it has . Trump ’ s tweets and the commentary around them , for better or worse , are part of what I come for now . Twitter ’ s algorithm has successfully detected that , even though I almost never favorite them myself . ( It may be because I occasionally quote-tweet or reply to them , or it may be because so many other people on Twitter interact with them . ) By making sure I see Trump ’ s tweets without having to seek them out , Twitter ’ s timeline software is doing the job Rao asked of it . It ’ s telling me what ’ s going on in the world , or at least that portion of the world that generally concerns me .
On the other hand , the commentary it shows me about Trump ’ s tweets—and about politics in general—almost always comes from the left . No doubt that ’ s largely a function of the people I ’ ve chosen to follow : Most of them are liberal . Yet I ’ ve also taken care over the years to follow a number of pundits whose politics I disagree with . They tend to skew toward the moderate , # NeverTrump side of the spectrum , although some do support the president . Their tweets often irk me , sometimes upset me , and occasionally infuriate me . But I ’ ve always continued to follow them because it ’ s important to me that my Twitter feed not insulate me altogether from opposing viewpoints . I rarely favorite or rebroadcast their tweets , or even click their links . But I do read them , and on the whole I find them indispensable .
Interestingly , Twitter ’ s timeline algorithm seems not to have picked up on this . For whatever reason , conservatives ’ tweets virtually never seem to crack my ranked timeline or my ICYMI box .
This has implications far beyond my own attempts to consume a balanced media diet . If you ’ re a right-winger who watches Fox News and reads Breitbart , you might still follow a handful of mainstream news outlets on Twitter . But if you tend not to favorite or retweet their tweets , Twitter ’ s software could decide that you don ’ t really care to see them in your feed after all . To boost your engagement , it might instead serve you ever more tweets from the same few people whose tweets you favorite and retweet the most . Within that subset , it might further emphasize the tweets that are getting most widely favorited and retweeted by others who already think like you do . Stoking a few Pizzagate embers might cause the conspiracy theory to flourish on your feed .
The good news is that Twitter is not in denial about them , as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg seemed to be about his own platform ’ s shortcomings in the election ’ s immediate wake . Twitter assures me that it ’ s both concerned by and actively working to mitigate the algorithm ’ s potential to reinforce biases .
Taking more into consideration than retweets and favorites is part of this effort . A Twitter spokesperson explained to me that a Bay Area resident might never interact with the Caltrain account she follows for its service updates . But Twitter ’ s software can learn over time that she tends to stop scrolling long enough to read a Caltrain tweet before moving on . It could then make sure to show her a noteworthy Caltrain update in her ranked timeline during commute hours .
Rao told me Twitter also runs qualitative surveys meant to complement its data on users ’ behavior , to help distinguish between what the team thinks of as “ salad ” ( like Caltrain ’ s tweets ) and “ doughnuts ” ( such as an ideological exhortation that plays to your preconceptions ) . Still , it ’ s clear to anyone who uses Twitter regularly that the viral “ doughnut ” tweets now go more viral than before and that you tend to see more tweets from the people whose accounts you engage with most frequently . In our polarized political climate , the potential implications could be dire—not because of Twitter ’ s sheer scale , but because the people in power in Washington , Hollywood , and the media are among those who use it the most .
Rao said the company has noticed this homogeneity in the rankings and has already tweaked its software to try to address it . So far , he said , the data suggest that injecting more diversity into users ’ ranked timelines might actually be good for engagement . If that ’ s true , it could be good news for both the company and its users . Then again , recent history is rife with examples of tech companies ’ interests not aligning with society ’ s quite so neatly .
At a time when Twitter is still clawing desperately for traction—it has launched multiple live-streaming products and overhauled its harassment policies in a bid to budge its stagnant user growth and clean up the more noxious and abusive discourse in its commons—giving the algorithm more control over users ’ feeds would be a logical next move . It would be risky , sure . But for Twitter , at this juncture , the risks of inaction may be greater .
Yet if ever-greater personalization is the answer to Twitter ’ s business woes , it ’ s unlikely to be the answer to the woes of a media ecosystem in which all news has become “ fake news ” to someone . Presenting people with contrary viewpoints simply isn ’ t a recipe for massive gains in engagement , for reasons that may run too deep in human nature to change .
On the other hand , the main alternatives to Twitter as a news source—Fox News , CNN , Facebook , et al.—all have their own crises of credibility and perception , driven in part by the perverse incentives of their respective business and audience models . If Twitter is right that its users value at least some diversity of viewpoints in their feeds—and if it ’ s serious about being a place people come for information rather than just entertainment or endorphins—we ’ ll be better off with a more automated Twitter than we would be with no Twitter at all .","Natalie Matthews-Ramo

What do you see when you open Twitter? Until a year ago, the answer was straightforward: With minor exceptions, you’d see every tweet from every person you followed, in chronological order, with the most recent at the top.

In February 2016, word leaked to BuzzFeed that Twitter was planning a move that would change everything. The company was introducing what insiders called an “algorithmic timeline.” It meant that tweets would no longer appear in the order they were posted. Instead, a complex, opaque software program would decide which tweets you’d see when you opened the app.

It sounded nefarious. Worse: It sounded like Facebook, the older, more mainstream social network that Twitter’s cool kids shun.

Not only are people spending more time reading, favoriting, and retweeting as a result, but they’re actually tweeting more themselves—an outcome that surprised Twitter’s own product managers. “Every possible engagement and attention metric went up” when the algorithm took effect last year, Rao told me. By exactly how much, the company declined to disclose, although a spokesperson called it “one of our most impactful product launches.”

As a result of the experiments made possible by the algorithm, Twitter knows more about its users than it ever did before, such as how much they value recency or how they react to seeing multiple tweets in a row from the same person. The company has tried out new features that group tweets about a given topic or hashtag within your feed. It has even experimented with showing you occasional tweets from people you don’t follow, if Twitter’s ranking system shows that you’re likely to want to see them. Twitter can now evaluate the efficacy of such new features by comparing their effects on user behavior to the effects of the ranked timeline and “In case you missed it,” another newish feature. “Our algorithm changes on an almost daily to weekly basis,” Rao said.

All these tweaks have yet to bear much fruit, from investors’ perspectives. The good news for the company is that, when managed properly, machine-learning algorithms can be radically improved with time. Likewise, upticks in user engagement have a way of gaining momentum, as engagement begets engagement. Muted as its impact has been to the business so far, the algorithm may still power future product changes that both lure and retain new users—and, ultimately, get Twitter growing again in a meaningful way.

Twitter is sometimes accused by its loyalists of making changes too rashly. In fact, the company has treated its core product with excessive caution. The failure of former CEO Dick Costolo, pushed aside in 2015, was not that he ruined the product, as so many feared. It was that he accorded it too much reverence. The business evolved on his watch, but the user experience stagnated. The timeline when he left looked and functioned much the same as it did when Costolo arrived in 2010.

His successor, Dorsey, approved the timeline algorithm in 2015, and its success or failure will probably be attributed to him. But the minds who developed and championed the idea within the company included former CTO Adam Messinger, former head of engineering Alex Roetter, and former head of product Kevin Weil. (That all three have since left is a sign of the long-running dysfunction atop Twitter’s org chart.)

To understand why they saw the algorithm as vital to Twitter’s future, it helps to recall what preceded it. The reverse-chronological timeline stemmed from the site’s origins as a way to blast brief, real-time “status updates” via text message to friends and acquaintances. But over the years Twitter morphed into something more like a public platform for news, opinions, jokes. As the user base and its follow lists grew, the chronological feed’s limitations became clear. You’d log in and find yourself thrust into the middle of dozens of unrelated, often insider-y conversations, and the good stuff required tedious scrolling to unearth. For the ordinary internet user, it simply wasn’t worth the trouble.

This led to Twitter’s most existential and enduring problem as a business: its inability to retain a large proportion of the new users who sign up. In December 2012, Twitter announced that it had 200 million monthly active users. CEO Costolo predicted that Twitter would hit 400 million within a year. Instead, the company filed to go public in late 2013 with only 218 million monthly active users. More than three years later, that active-user number is still just 319 million, and growth has slowed to a trickle. Though the comparison isn’t perfect, the company plateaued at roughly the age at which Facebook took off. A crucial difference between the two services: Facebook’s news feed algorithm, which the company implemented early on and has been aggressively improving ever since. Whereas right now Twitter’s algorithm affects only the tweets at the very top of your feed, Facebook’s automatically orders every post according to a highly sophisticated formula that is personalized to each user’s habits, tastes, and relationships.

That the ranked tweets are easy to miss is by design.

Part of Twitter’s problem has been its struggle to define the timeline’s precise purpose. Rao told me that this has become clearer since the algorithm launched, that the company now sees the timeline’s function as “helping users to stay informed with what’s going on in the world.” Twitter, in other words, is no longer a social network, at least by its own reckoning. It’s a real-time, personalized news service. And since there are no human editors, it falls to Twitter’s algorithm to determine which tweets will lead the news each time you open it.

Of all Twitter’s efforts to address its retention problem—and there have been many—the algorithm is its boldest. But what is the Twitter algorithm, and how does it work? The short version is that it’s a software program that evaluates tweets according to various criteria, then chooses a handful to show each user at the top of his or her timeline upon opening the app. The rest of the timeline remains reverse-chronological, at least for now. For the curious (and the confused), here is the long version—the first public peek into the algorithm’s workings.

As soon as you open it, Twitter quickly collects and assesses every recent tweet from every person you follow and assigns each one a relevance score. This score is based on a wide array of factors, ranging from the number of favorites and retweets it received to how often you’ve engaged with its author lately.

At the same time, the algorithm is assessing a variety of other variables—including how long you’ve been away from the site, how many people you follow, and your individual Twitter habits—to determine exactly how those scores will affect what you see in your feed. (All of this happens in the background.)

The algorithm’s output can take different forms in your feed, but the “ranked timeline” and “In case you missed it” are the most notable additions. The ranked timeline is what was supposed to herald the end of Twitter as we know it. Visit the site or open the app after a few hours away, and the top of your feed will look much the same as it did a year ago, with a series of tweets listed in reverse-chronological order. But examine the time stamps and you’ll notice that these tweets aren’t quite as recent as you might expect. The top one might have been posted 10 or 15 minutes ago. Scroll just a few tweets down, and you might see something published an hour ago or more. Together, these are the tweets that Twitter’s algorithm has “ranked” for you to see first.

While Twitter won’t disclose all the signals involved in the ranking—“thousands,” a spokesperson told me—the company did specify a few of them. They include:

A tweet’s overall engagement, including retweets, clicks, favorites, and time spent reading it

A tweet’s engagement relative to other tweets by the same author

How recently the tweet was published

How often you engage with the tweet’s author

How much time you spend reading tweets by that author, even if you don’t engage.

What kind of attachment the tweet includes (e.g. link, image, video, none), and what kind of attachments you tend to engage with.

The tweets that appear in this ranked section of your timeline constitute a tiny subset of the tweets you missed since the last time you were active on Twitter. So if you keep scrolling, soon enough you’ll reach a tweet that was published even more recently than the one that appeared at the very top of your feed. From that point on, your Twitter is back to normal, displaying every tweet from every person you follow in reverse-chronological order. And when you refresh your timeline, the ranked tweets will sink out of view.

That the ranked tweets are easy to miss, Rao told me, is by design. The company has tried at several junctures in its history to cordon off a batch of algorithmically selected tweets from the rest of the timeline. But these efforts were mostly stumbles because they didn’t feel like part of the core experience. (Remember the #Discover tab? Neither do most people.) They were “too module-y,” in Rao’s words. He said the company ultimately decided to incorporate the ranked tweets directly into the timeline so that they wouldn’t detract from the “liveliness” of the Twitter experience.

The ICYMI feature, which used to be called “While you were away,” predates the ranked timeline and remains under a separate label from the rest of your feed. Given its move away from self-contained modules, many assumed Twitter would dispense with ICYMI when the ranked timeline was launched, but the company has retained it as a complementary feature. Whereas the ranked timeline will appear at the top of your feed after just an hour or two away, ICYMI typically enters your feed only when it’s been several hours or a few days since you last opened Twitter. The tweets that appear there are less recent, and they don’t appear in chronological order at all. Rather, they’re ordered according to their ranking scores. The tweet at the top of your ICYMI box, then, will be the one that ranked highest out of all the possible tweets from everyone you follow since the last time you logged on. It’s Twitter’s equivalent of the top post in your Facebook feed.

From a design standpoint, Twitter’s use of both the ICYMI box and the ranked timeline is a clunky arrangement. But if people find it confusing, Rao said no one has told him so. The goal, in his mind, is for users not to have to think about which set of ranked tweets they see at what time, or how many, or why. Twitter’s algorithm is supposed to do that thinking for them.

Twitter, the technology and media writer John Herrman once wrote, is a truth machine. The network’s inherently public structure made it relatively easy to debunk the sorts of viral rumors and misinformation that tend to spread unchecked on Facebook. But as Twitter gets better at showing users the tweets that most resonate with them, the risk is that it’s also getting better at reinforcing their biases and abetting their construction of alternate realities—not a marketplace of ideas, but a battlefield pocked with foxholes. This past election cycle, those searching for truth on Twitter could still find it, but for others the service doubled as a lie machine—a place where falsehoods and fake news flourished among isolated ideological subcommunities that dwell in divergent realities. The same social network that had helped to call the world’s attention to Tahrir Square and Ferguson became a breeding ground for conspiracy theories such as Pizzagate. The same service that gave Trump’s critics a platform to counter his rhetoric with facts also gave his supporters the power to drown them out in a cacophony of abuse and invective.

The reason for this self-reinforcing dynamic is unsurprising: When you draw on users’ past habits to shape their future experiences, you risk enclosing them in bubbles of their own making—what Eli Pariser called a “filter bubble.” The term has often been applied to Facebook, due to its heavy reliance on a personalization algorithm that weights each post according to, among other metrics, how likely you are to hit “like.” Old-school Twitter could be a bubble of sorts, too, depending on who you followed. But the chronological timeline at least gave equal weight to every tweet, regardless of whether it was likely to please or upset you.

The ranked timeline, even in its modest present form, has changed that. You’re now far more likely to see certain types of tweets than others when you log in. The question is: What types of tweets are you seeing more of?

While social-media ranking algorithms are incredibly difficult to perfect, it actually isn’t that hard to improve on a purely chronological approach when it comes to generating engagement. Without an algorithm, users might log in and see at the top of their timeline a random thought from technology writer Farhad Manjoo that got far less engagement than his typical tweets. But even a rudimentary ranking system could ensure that users are more likely to see a viral joke from comedy writer Dan Amira, playing off a popular meme, which generated far more engagement.

The question, though, is how an algorithm alters the overall playing field—whose tweets tend to flourish, and whose wither on the vine. One person who has almost certainly benefited from Twitter’s ranked timeline is Donald Trump. Trump may not have won the presidency because of Twitter, but it’s hard to imagine his campaign strategy succeeding without it. Mocked and disdained by the mainstream media, Trump used the platform as his megaphone, bypassing editorial filters to address voters directly, in his own words—and with his own facts. With each tweet gaining tens of thousands of shares, and some far more than that, Trump’s Twitter account became a major media organ in its own right, helping to dictate the political news of the day. While no data are available on exactly what role the algorithm played, it’s a safe bet that Trump’s tweets regularly topped his followers’ ranked timelines, ensuring that the missives reached a much wider audience than they would have under the old system.

And it’s not just his fans. Before the algorithm, I used to see Trump’s tweets only when he happened to publish while I was online or shortly beforehand. They would trigger a sudden cavalcade of retweets and commentary in my feed, but it would quickly die down. Now the president’s tweets—in their original, unfiltered form—appear routinely near the top of my feed, even if he published them hours ago. I see at least one of them most weekday mornings when I log in as I prepare to board the subway to work. It’s often joined there by one or two of the cleverer or more trenchant responses from people I follow. (Twitter has also recently begun using an algorithm to order the replies to popular tweets, giving rise to a cottage industry of “first replies” that reach a substantial portion of the original tweet’s audience.)

I used to see Trump’s tweets only when he happened to publish while I was online.

Has this improved my Twitter experience? On the whole, I’d argue it has. Trump’s tweets and the commentary around them, for better or worse, are part of what I come for now. Twitter’s algorithm has successfully detected that, even though I almost never favorite them myself. (It may be because I occasionally quote-tweet or reply to them, or it may be because so many other people on Twitter interact with them.) By making sure I see Trump’s tweets without having to seek them out, Twitter’s timeline software is doing the job Rao asked of it. It’s telling me what’s going on in the world, or at least that portion of the world that generally concerns me.

On the other hand, the commentary it shows me about Trump’s tweets—and about politics in general—almost always comes from the left. No doubt that’s largely a function of the people I’ve chosen to follow: Most of them are liberal. Yet I’ve also taken care over the years to follow a number of pundits whose politics I disagree with. They tend to skew toward the moderate, #NeverTrump side of the spectrum, although some do support the president. Their tweets often irk me, sometimes upset me, and occasionally infuriate me. But I’ve always continued to follow them because it’s important to me that my Twitter feed not insulate me altogether from opposing viewpoints. I rarely favorite or rebroadcast their tweets, or even click their links. But I do read them, and on the whole I find them indispensable.

Interestingly, Twitter’s timeline algorithm seems not to have picked up on this. For whatever reason, conservatives’ tweets virtually never seem to crack my ranked timeline or my ICYMI box.

This has implications far beyond my own attempts to consume a balanced media diet. If you’re a right-winger who watches Fox News and reads Breitbart, you might still follow a handful of mainstream news outlets on Twitter. But if you tend not to favorite or retweet their tweets, Twitter’s software could decide that you don’t really care to see them in your feed after all. To boost your engagement, it might instead serve you ever more tweets from the same few people whose tweets you favorite and retweet the most. Within that subset, it might further emphasize the tweets that are getting most widely favorited and retweeted by others who already think like you do. Stoking a few Pizzagate embers might cause the conspiracy theory to flourish on your feed.

The good news is that Twitter is not in denial about them, as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg seemed to be about his own platform’s shortcomings in the election’s immediate wake. Twitter assures me that it’s both concerned by and actively working to mitigate the algorithm’s potential to reinforce biases.

Taking more into consideration than retweets and favorites is part of this effort. A Twitter spokesperson explained to me that a Bay Area resident might never interact with the Caltrain account she follows for its service updates. But Twitter’s software can learn over time that she tends to stop scrolling long enough to read a Caltrain tweet before moving on. It could then make sure to show her a noteworthy Caltrain update in her ranked timeline during commute hours.

Rao told me Twitter also runs qualitative surveys meant to complement its data on users’ behavior, to help distinguish between what the team thinks of as “salad” (like Caltrain’s tweets) and “doughnuts” (such as an ideological exhortation that plays to your preconceptions). Still, it’s clear to anyone who uses Twitter regularly that the viral “doughnut” tweets now go more viral than before and that you tend to see more tweets from the people whose accounts you engage with most frequently. In our polarized political climate, the potential implications could be dire—not because of Twitter’s sheer scale, but because the people in power in Washington, Hollywood, and the media are among those who use it the most.

Rao said the company has noticed this homogeneity in the rankings and has already tweaked its software to try to address it. So far, he said, the data suggest that injecting more diversity into users’ ranked timelines might actually be good for engagement. If that’s true, it could be good news for both the company and its users. Then again, recent history is rife with examples of tech companies’ interests not aligning with society’s quite so neatly.

At a time when Twitter is still clawing desperately for traction—it has launched multiple live-streaming products and overhauled its harassment policies in a bid to budge its stagnant user growth and clean up the more noxious and abusive discourse in its commons—giving the algorithm more control over users’ feeds would be a logical next move. It would be risky, sure. But for Twitter, at this juncture, the risks of inaction may be greater.

Yet if ever-greater personalization is the answer to Twitter’s business woes, it’s unlikely to be the answer to the woes of a media ecosystem in which all news has become “fake news” to someone. Presenting people with contrary viewpoints simply isn’t a recipe for massive gains in engagement, for reasons that may run too deep in human nature to change.

On the other hand, the main alternatives to Twitter as a news source—Fox News, CNN, Facebook, et al.—all have their own crises of credibility and perception, driven in part by the perverse incentives of their respective business and audience models. If Twitter is right that its users value at least some diversity of viewpoints in their feeds—and if it’s serious about being a place people come for information rather than just entertainment or endorphins—we’ll be better off with a more automated Twitter than we would be with no Twitter at all.",www.slate.com,left,CnwBwxXOLjlrvzfz

So what can you do in the meantime, besides pray that the power stays on?

""It's just go out and clean up a little bit so you can,"" said DePasa, a CNN iReporter . ""Then wait a few hours and do it again.""

The good news? Most people seemed to have heeded the warnings about the storm, which was forecast as ""crippling"" and ""potentially historic,"" by stocking up and staying off the roads. If you go through this every year, after all, there's a good chance you'll know the drill.

""During these storms, everybody has to hunker down and just be safe,"" said Bob Connors from Plum Island, on Massachusetts' North Shore. ""We've become pretty proficient at that.""

N.Y. mayor: 'We've dodged the bullet'

As the storm approached, Marge Winski hoped for the best.

It's not the first time she's braced for bad weather as the caretaker of a lighthouse in Montauk, New York. Riding out Superstorm Sandy was terrifying, she said. This storm, which packed powerful winds, also had it's scary moments, she said.

""I was just praying I didn't get sick, or the roof didn't blow off,"" she said. ""What was I going to do? You know no one's coming to get you.""

But Winski, like many residents of New York and New Jersey, was breathing a sigh of relief on Tuesday.

A day earlier, officials warned the storm could turn 58 million people's lives upside down. Seven states, from New Jersey to New Hampshire, declared states of emergency. School was canceled. Public transit shut down. Businesses closed, suggesting a far-reaching economic impact in one of America's busiest commercial regions.

But by midmorning, snow wasn't even falling in New York City. By then, travel bans in New Jersey and New York -- even places like Long Island's Islip, which got more than 20 inches of snow -- had been lifted.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called all the warning and preparations ""a better-safe-than-sorry scenario.""

""We've dodged the bullet,"" he said. ""This is nothing like we feared it would be.""

But for some in the state, the storm proved dangerous.

A 17-year-old died after he hit something while snow-tubing Monday night in Huntington, New York, Suffolk County's Tim Sini said. An 83-year-old man who suffered from dementia was found frozen to death in his backyard in the same Long Island county.

Blocked in, hunkered down

The forecast even improved for Boston. Once expected to see up to 30 inches of snow, Logan International Airport had received 24.4 inches by midnight Tuesday.

Still, 2 feet of snow isn't anything to scoff at.

Just ask all those who had their cars snowed in, their front doors blocked and their backyards littered with branches Tuesday.

""The worst part is the steady winds, I think they were approaching 50 mph,"" said Nantucket Police Chief William Pittman.

The entire island, where 15,000 people live, lost power during the storm. But that didn't stop the doctors and nurses at Nantucket Cottage Hospital, where Cayden Keith Moore was born at the height of the blizzard early Tuesday.

As she cradled her newborn boy, mom Danielle Smith said she was doing well, thanks to the generator keeping the hospital warm.

""It's definitely better to be here than at home with no power,"" she said.

Thousands of flights canceled

If you're trying to escape this wintry mess quickly, don't count on it.

Traffic crawled on everything from side roads to highways -- including the Massachusetts Turnpike, which was closed to traffic as of early Tuesday afternoon -- and many public transit systems shut down.

More than 4,700 flights in and out of the United States had been canceled as of 8 p.m. Tuesday, the flight-tracking website Flightaware.com reported. That's on top of 2,800 scrubbed Monday. Hundreds more have already been called off for Wednesday.

From stocking up to snowball fights

The storm warnings seemed to impress even the most jaded Northeasterner, as groceries flew off store shelves from Brooklyn to Bangor.

Shoppers clear the shelves at a Star Market in Boston

Still, it's not like everyone was shaking in their snow boots.

As Steve Nogueira, a retired meteorologist who lives in Taunton, Massachusetts, said, ""We've done it before.""

In the coastal city of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, hundreds accepted a Facebook invitation to a community snowball fight -- one that organizer Devin Murphy joked is in the proud tradition dating back to around 1624, when the city was first settled.

Fresh off snowblowing his driveway, Jim Robins estimated about 2 feet of light, fluffy snow had fallen outside his home in Dover, New Hampshire. That's hardly a dusting, but it's also not surprising when you live in New England.

""Sure, that's a lot, but I have tons of family in Buffalo and they were dealing with 6-10 feet of (snow) at the start of the season,"" Robins said. ""...We will weather this like the New Englanders we are.""",www.cnn.com,left,hX4nnhqLkjEHpgTc

He has become a lightning rod for suspicions about Donald Trump’s ties with Russia, inadvertently bringing down one of the president’s closest allies and now threatening another.



Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, Vladimir Putin’s man in Washington, is usually far from view inside an imposing white marbled embassy on the third highest hill in the city – a location that prompted fears the Soviets would be able to intercept communications – but now finds himself in the spotlight.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , America ’ s premier disease fighter , offered an air of confidence Tuesday in declaring that the first Ebola patient in Dallas was carefully contained .
But earlier this year , it sounded less optimistic about the U.S. health care system ’ s ability to fight a pandemic should a major disease outbreak occur .
“ CDC continues to work with reduced financial resources , which similarly affects state , local , and insular public health departments . … These losses make it difficult for state and local health departments to continue to expand their preparedness capabilities , instead forcing them to focus on maintaining their current capabilities , ” the CDC warned in a report this year .
CDC flagged several key trend lines , including congressional funding for public health emergency preparedness had shrunk by $ 1 billion from its highs shortly after the 2001 terrorist and anthrax attacks .
It also noted that state and local public health departments on the front lines of any health emergency have shed 45,700 jobs since the 2008 financial crisis .
The concerns , however , extend far beyond financial resources . The Department of Homeland Security inspector general issued a scathing report in September warning the department was woefully prepared for a pandemic , with expired medicines and inadequate resources to effectively equip its top responders in the field .
“ DHS may not be able to provide sufficient pandemic preparedness supplies to its employees to continue operations during a pandemic , ” the agency ’ s watchdog declared in a report made public Sept. 1 .
“ Without sufficiently determining its needs , the department has no assurance it will have an adequate amount of antiviral [ drugs ] to maintain critical operations during a pandemic , ” the report said , warning of the effects for offices such as the Secret Service , U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Transportation Security Administration .
Despite having the task of protecting the U.S. from dangerous threats , the Homeland Security Department “ did not keep accurate records of what it purchased and it received , ” the department ’ s inspector general found .
Homeland Security officials disagreed with much of the report , saying it was a misrepresentation of the agency ’ s preparedness for an outbreak .
Other preparedness concerns flagged in recent months include the ability of overburdened Border Patrol agents to screen immigrants for disease and inadequate tools to detect or combat a bioterrorist attack .
For instance , numerous government investigations have questioned the adequacy of the federal government ’ s premier biosurveillance system , code named BioWatch . The respected National Academies of Science questioned whether the current-generation system can detect hazards , and the next generation of the project is in danger of being canceled after the Government Accountability Office questioned its dealing with contractors .
“ Over the past several years , our work has identified significant shortcomings in the department ’ s ability to manage an expanding portfolio of major acquisitions , ” said the GAO report , dated June 10 . “ We recommended that before continuing the Gen-3 acquisition , DHS should carry out key acquisition steps , including reevaluating the mission need and systematically analyzing alternatives based on cost-benefit and risk information . ”
The message from the panoply of reports is clear : Although the U.S. clearly made strides after 2001 on pandemic preparation , those gains have stagnated and in some cases begun to reverse even as the risks for an outbreak grow with global travel and determined terrorists .
People say that Ebola looks “ so far away , it ’ s so remote , ” said Dr. J. Scott Ries , vice president of Christian Medical & Dental Associations , who worked with Ebola survivor Dr. Kent Brantly , who contracted the disease while treating Ebola patients in Liberia . “ Well now , anyone who has thought that will change their opinion . It ’ s here , like we predicted , and it ’ s time to massively ramp up our efforts to address this . ”
To be sure , the CDC says it will contain the incident in Texas , and the Ebola virus will not spread in the U.S. like it has in West African countries because of U.S. isolation methods , first-world medical care , and the fact that friends and relatives don ’ t intimately prepare bodies for burial as is customary in West Africa .
“ There is no doubt in my mind , we will stop it here , ” CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a press conference Tuesday . Although Ebola is a “ scary disease , ” he said , “ we are stopping it in its tracks in this country . ”
Worrisome , however , is that the infected patient in Texas waited four days after he began experiencing symptoms to seek admission to the Dallas hospital . During that time , he was symptomatic and contagious . Ebola doesn ’ t spread via airborne methods like the flu does , but only through contact with bodily fluids such as blood , feces , urine and vomit .
The CDC said it was monitoring the people with whom the infected patient came into contact . Ebola starts with a high fever and leads to internal bleeding . In Africa , it has a mortality rate as high as 90 percent .
The West African countries of Liberia , Sierra Leone and Guinea have experienced the worst outbreak of the disease in history , killing more than 3,000 people there and infecting others . A total of 6,574 cases have been reported , according to the World Health Organization . There is a separate outbreak in Congo .
Dr. Ries said news of a U.S. Ebola case is “ no surprise , ” but there is also “ no need to panic . ”
“ We know how to deal with Ebola . While Ebola is highly infectious , it ’ s not highly contagious , ” he said , adding that the Dallas patient has been isolated and is being treated aggressively .
“ That ’ s the advantage we have here with our health system versus what they have in Sierra Leone , Liberia and Guinea , ” he said .
Nevertheless , U.S. policymakers renewed alarm that the African outbreak had reached American shores .
“ Communicable diseases do not stop at borders , ” said Rep. Edward R. Royce , California Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs . “ While the likelihood of a major outbreak in the United States is still very unlikely , with this case , it is more clear than ever that the rapid spread of Ebola in Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone presents a clear and present danger not only to West Africa , but the broader international community . ”
Sen . Rob Portman , Ohio Republican , renewed his call for the CDC to direct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to enact active screening of travelers demonstrating Ebola symptoms at U.S. ports of entry .
“ While I hope that this is an isolated case , today ’ s announcement serves as a reminder of the need for increased U.S. prevention efforts , ” Mr. Portman said in a statement . “ According to reports , the patient had recently travelled to West Africa and would have been a clear candidate for active screening . With this announcement , I hope the CDC will consider enacting elevated screening levels . ”
Three American medical missionaries other than Dr. Brantly became infected and fell ill in Africa while treating Ebola patients . All were flown back to the U.S. in isolation and have recovered .
“ The lessons learned ” from treating those workers at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and elsewhere showed that “ this is a disease that we can manage with tech , ” said Michael G. Schmidt , vice chairman of the microbiology and immunology department at the Medical University of South Carolina .
Credit also goes , he said , to “ the convalescent serum and ZMAPP ” administered to Ebola patients , and the “ unsung heroes ” within local health departments , public health agencies and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases “ who have been planning for this event since ” the Ebola outbreak flared up in March .
A White House statement said President Obama had spoken via phone Tuesday with Dr. Frieden and discussed Ebola isolation protocols and efforts to figure out where the patient may have contracted the virus .
The CDC said the Dallas patient was asymptomatic during his flight from Liberia to Dallas . Although he likely contracted the disease abroad , he was not contagious during air travel or noticeably sick on arrival .
CBP works in conjunction with the CDC to monitor travelers and attempt to contain any diseases that may be spread by travelers from abroad .
However , given CBP ’ s current resources and other strains at the border given the recent influx of unaccompanied minors , it may not be well-equipped to handle another crisis , the Congressional Research Service warned in a report .
“ In the current context of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa , CDC has emphasized exit-based airport screening from areas with Ebola , and not screening at [ point of entry ] in the United States , ” wrote Ruth Ellen Wasem , an immigration specialist in a Congressional Research Service report dated Aug. 13 .
Ms. Wasem warned that “ from an immigration standpoint , an outbreak of an infectious disease places substantial procedural and resource pressures on CBP . ”","The confirmation Tuesday of the first Ebola case on U.S. soil emerges against a backdrop of increasing concern in America’s medical community that preparedness for a pandemic has stagnated or slipped in recent years because of tough economic times and increasing malaise since the 2001 anthrax threat.

Three American medical missionaries other than Dr. Brantly became infected and fell ill in Africa while treating Ebola patients. All were flown back to the U.S. in isolation and have recovered.

“The lessons learned” from treating those workers at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and elsewhere showed that “this is a disease that we can manage with tech,” said Michael G. Schmidt, vice chairman of the microbiology and immunology department at the Medical University of South Carolina.

Credit also goes, he said, to “the convalescent serum and ZMAPP” administered to Ebola patients, and the “unsung heroes” within local health departments, public health agencies and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases “who have been planning for this event since” the Ebola outbreak flared up in March.

A White House statement said President Obama had spoken via phone Tuesday with Dr. Frieden and discussed Ebola isolation protocols and efforts to figure out where the patient may have contracted the virus.

The CDC said the Dallas patient was asymptomatic during his flight from Liberia to Dallas. Although he likely contracted the disease abroad, he was not contagious during air travel or noticeably sick on arrival.

CBP works in conjunction with the CDC to monitor travelers and attempt to contain any diseases that may be spread by travelers from abroad.

However, given CBP’s current resources and other strains at the border given the recent influx of unaccompanied minors, it may not be well-equipped to handle another crisis, the Congressional Research Service warned in a report.

“In the current context of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, CDC has emphasized exit-based airport screening from areas with Ebola, and not screening at [point of entry] in the United States,” wrote Ruth Ellen Wasem, an immigration specialist in a Congressional Research Service report dated Aug. 13.

Ms. Wasem warned that “from an immigration standpoint, an outbreak of an infectious disease places substantial procedural and resource pressures on CBP.”

`` As soon as a new Ebola treatment facility is opened , it immediately fills to overflowing with patients , '' the WHO said .
Hospitals and clinics in Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone -- the countries hit hardest by the outbreak -- are overwhelmed by what the WHO is calling the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history .
The virus has killed at least 2,400 people , and thousands more are infected . And there are now cases in Nigeria and Senegal .
`` The number of new cases is increasing exponentially , '' the WHO said , calling the situation a `` dire emergency with ... unprecedented dimensions of human suffering . ''
`` Men and women and children are just sitting , waiting to die right now , '' Obama said .
`` This is a daunting task , but here 's what gives us hope . The world knows how to fight this disease . It 's not a mystery . We know the science . We know how to prevent it from spreading .

Maj. Gen. Darryl Williams , commander of the U.S. Army Africa , arrived in Liberia on Tuesday . Liberian leadership asked that the U.S. military step in to help support civilian efforts there .
Williams will coordinate the military 's efforts to improve logistics , to build additional field hospitals and to create what the President called an `` air bridge '' to bring in additional supplies and health care workers . The effort will be called Operation United Assistance .
The new treatment centers may house up to 1,700 additional beds . American military personnel in the region could increase by 3,000 , administration officials said .
The U.S. will also create a new training facility to help prepare thousands more health care workers to handle sick patients . U.S. medics will train up to 500 health care workers per week to identify and care for people with Ebola .
USAID will give 400,000 treatment kits with sanitizer and other protective items like gloves to families to help them protect their own safety as they care for sick relatives .

SIM and other organizations such as Doctors Without Borders that have been working on the Ebola outbreak since the beginning have been asking for additional international help for months .
`` Three things are vital right now : More beds and equipment , more trained medical professionals , and more training of Liberians and West Africans , '' Johnson said . `` This current plan addresses these desperate needs . ''
One of the doctors who had been working with SIM 's clinic in Liberia when he became infected with the virus testified Tuesday in front of a joint hearing in Congress to look at ways to stop Ebola .
Dr. Kent Brantly urged Congress to provide the extra funds to fight the outbreak . Earlier in the day he met with President Obama , who told him about the expanded U.S. efforts .
Brantly said he thanked the President , and urged Congress to back this plan up with `` immediate action . ''
`` As a survivor , it is not only my privilege , but it is my duty to speak out on behalf of the people of West Africa who continue to face unspeakable devastation because of this horrific disease , '' Brantly said .
He told the story about a patient named Francis who he believes may have been saved had the world acted sooner .
The patient became infected after carrying a neighbor sick with Ebola to a taxi to get him to a hospital .
`` If someone had gone alongside Francis and given him a little education and given him the equipment he needed , his family would have a father , '' Brantly said . Instead his patient died and the world lost `` this good Samaritan . ''
Brantly went on to respond to the analogy some have used to describe Ebola as a fire burning out of control .
He warned , it is a `` fire . It is a fire straight from the pit of hell . ''
`` We can not fool ourselves into thinking that the vast Atlantic Ocean will protect us from the flames of this fire , '' Brantly said .
Move quickly , he urged , as it is `` the only way to keep entire nations from being reduced to ashes . ''
There is also a concern about the possibility that the virus could mutate into an even more dangerous form .
Ebola currently transmits only though contact with bodily fluids ; a mutation that allows the virus to spread through the air would pose a catastrophic threat to people worldwide , health experts say .

`` Right now , the risk of an Ebola outbreak in the United States is very low , '' he said , `` but that risk would only increase if there were not a robust response on the part of the United States . ''
The President noted a number of precautionary steps that are being taken in the United States to prevent the disease from spreading here .
The government has stepped up screening at West African airports . It has increased education for flight crews to teach them what to watch for with people who may be sick . It has worked with hospitals and health care workers to prepare them in case there is a domestic Ebola problem .
Ebola is more than a health threat to West Africa ; it could become a `` major humanitarian crisis , '' according to United Nations Under-Secretary-General Valerie Amos , if it is not stopped soon enough .
The United Nations said that many millions more will be needed to fight the outbreak . U.N. leaders estimate they need $ 1 billion to fight the epidemic , with about half needed for the worst-hit country , Liberia .
Political systems and infrastructure are fragile in the countries where the virus is concentrated . Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea are still rebuilding their economies after suffering through years of civil wars .
`` Now their capacity to deliver the necessities of daily life for their people is on the brink of collapse , '' Amos said . `` The Ebola outbreak poses a serious threat to their post-conflict recovery . ''
More people are believed to have died in these countries from secondary diseases like malaria and tuberculosis and from chronic illnesses and pregnancies with complications than from Ebola because the health care systems are so strained .
Heavy rain adds to the risk of waterborne diseases like malaria .
Food security has also become a problem . Quarantines keep workers from their jobs and have slowed the delivery of food to certain areas , according to the U.N .
`` We must act now if we want to avoid greater humanitarian consequences in future , '' Amos said .","Story highlights Doctor who survived Ebola says: ""It is a fire straight from the pit of hell""

The country launched a five-year study to unravel the mystery of the long-term health effects that plague survivors of the viral disease. Since the epidemic started more than a year ago in a remote village in Guinea, more than 11,000 people have died, the vast majority in three West African nations, according to the latest numbers from the World Health Organization . And that number is believed to be low, since there was widespread under-reporting of cases, according to WHO.

""As soon as a new Ebola treatment facility is opened, it immediately fills to overflowing with patients,"" the WHO said.

Hospitals and clinics in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- the countries hit hardest by the outbreak -- are overwhelmed by what the WHO is calling the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history.

The virus has killed at least 2,400 people, and thousands more are infected. And there are now cases in Nigeria and Senegal.

""The number of new cases is increasing exponentially,"" the WHO said, calling the situation a ""dire emergency with ... unprecedented dimensions of human suffering.""

""Men and women and children are just sitting, waiting to die right now,"" Obama said.

""This is a daunting task, but here's what gives us hope. The world knows how to fight this disease. It's not a mystery. We know the science. We know how to prevent it from spreading. We know how to care for those who contract it. We know that if we take the proper steps, we can save lives. But we have to act fast,"" Obama said.

""We can't dawdle on this one. We have to move with force and make sure that we are catching this as best we can, given that it has already broken out in ways that we have not seen before.""

The CDC already has hundreds of professionals on the ground in what the President described as the ""largest international response in the history of the CDC.""

Maj. Gen. Darryl Williams , commander of the U.S. Army Africa, arrived in Liberia on Tuesday. Liberian leadership asked that the U.S. military step in to help support civilian efforts there.

Williams will coordinate the military's efforts to improve logistics, to build additional field hospitals and to create what the President called an ""air bridge"" to bring in additional supplies and health care workers. The effort will be called Operation United Assistance.

The new treatment centers may house up to 1,700 additional beds. American military personnel in the region could increase by 3,000, administration officials said.

The U.S. will also create a new training facility to help prepare thousands more health care workers to handle sick patients. U.S. medics will train up to 500 health care workers per week to identify and care for people with Ebola.

USAID will give 400,000 treatment kits with sanitizer and other protective items like gloves to families to help them protect their own safety as they care for sick relatives.

The President also called on Congress to approve additional funding his administration requested to carry on these critical efforts to stop the virus.

Obama added that ""faced with this outbreak, the world is looking to"" the United States to lead international efforts to combat the virus. He said the United States is ready to take on that leadership role.

""Here's the hard truth. In West Africa, Ebola is now an epidemic of the likes that we have not seen before. It's spiraling out of control,"" Obama said. ""If the outbreak is not stopped now, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected with profound political and economic and security implications for all of us.""

Washington has already committed more than $100 million to combat Ebola, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development.

Last week, USAID said it would spend $75 million to build treatment facilities and supply them with medical equipment. The Pentagon says it's working to shift $500 million of not yet obligated funds toward the Ebola effort.

Public health campaigns will be broadcast through existing networks in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

'Hundreds turn into thousands'

The President's visit to the CDC comes amid escalating criticism from health experts of the global response to the outbreak in West Africa.

U.S. officials hope a more coordinated response on the ground, put in place by the United States, will encourage other nations to step up their efforts.

""This is a global threat and demands a global response,"" Obama said. He added that the international community needs to move faster.

Next week, the U.S. will chair an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to maximize the response to the Ebola crisis. The White House will also bring more countries together to talk about future health threats.

Tuesday, WHO announced that China dispatched a mobile laboratory team to Sierra Leone to help test for the virus. The team of 59 from the Chinese Center for Disease Control includes epidemiologists, clinicians and nurses. This team will join 115 Chinese medical staff already on the ground in Sierra Leone.

Nongovernmental organizations that have been fighting this outbreak since its start reacted positively to Obama's announcement.

""The multifaceted response to the Ebola crisis announced today by President Obama is what we have been hoping for and what is needed in Liberia and West Africa,"" said Bruce Johnson, president of SIM USA.

Two of the three American workers who contracted Ebola in Liberia and were evacuated to the United States for treatment work for SIM.

SIM and other organizations such as Doctors Without Borders that have been working on the Ebola outbreak since the beginning have been asking for additional international help for months.

""Three things are vital right now: More beds and equipment, more trained medical professionals, and more training of Liberians and West Africans,"" Johnson said. ""This current plan addresses these desperate needs.""

One of the doctors who had been working with SIM's clinic in Liberia when he became infected with the virus testified Tuesday in front of a joint hearing in Congress to look at ways to stop Ebola.

Dr. Kent Brantly urged Congress to provide the extra funds to fight the outbreak. Earlier in the day he met with President Obama, who told him about the expanded U.S. efforts.

Brantly said he thanked the President, and urged Congress to back this plan up with ""immediate action.""

""As a survivor, it is not only my privilege, but it is my duty to speak out on behalf of the people of West Africa who continue to face unspeakable devastation because of this horrific disease,"" Brantly said.

The patient became infected after carrying a neighbor sick with Ebola to a taxi to get him to a hospital.

""If someone had gone alongside Francis and given him a little education and given him the equipment he needed, his family would have a father,"" Brantly said. Instead his patient died and the world lost ""this good Samaritan.""

Brantly went on to respond to the analogy some have used to describe Ebola as a fire burning out of control.

He warned, it is a ""fire. It is a fire straight from the pit of hell.""

""We cannot fool ourselves into thinking that the vast Atlantic Ocean will protect us from the flames of this fire,"" Brantly said.

Move quickly, he urged, as it is ""the only way to keep entire nations from being reduced to ashes.""

Could the virus mutate?

There is also a concern about the possibility that the virus could mutate into an even more dangerous form.

Ebola currently transmits only though contact with bodily fluids; a mutation that allows the virus to spread through the air would pose a catastrophic threat to people worldwide, health experts say.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that there was still a ""very low"" likelihood the Ebola virus could mutate in a way that threatens the United States.

""Right now, the risk of an Ebola outbreak in the United States is very low,"" he said, ""but that risk would only increase if there were not a robust response on the part of the United States.""

The President noted a number of precautionary steps that are being taken in the United States to prevent the disease from spreading here.

The government has stepped up screening at West African airports. It has increased education for flight crews to teach them what to watch for with people who may be sick. It has worked with hospitals and health care workers to prepare them in case there is a domestic Ebola problem.

Will it be enough?

Ebola is more than a health threat to West Africa; it could become a ""major humanitarian crisis,"" according to United Nations Under-Secretary-General Valerie Amos , if it is not stopped soon enough.

The United Nations said that many millions more will be needed to fight the outbreak. U.N. leaders estimate they need $1 billion to fight the epidemic, with about half needed for the worst-hit country, Liberia.

Political systems and infrastructure are fragile in the countries where the virus is concentrated. Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea are still rebuilding their economies after suffering through years of civil wars.

""Now their capacity to deliver the necessities of daily life for their people is on the brink of collapse,"" Amos said. ""The Ebola outbreak poses a serious threat to their post-conflict recovery.""

More people are believed to have died in these countries from secondary diseases like malaria and tuberculosis and from chronic illnesses and pregnancies with complications than from Ebola because the health care systems are so strained.

Heavy rain adds to the risk of waterborne diseases like malaria.

Food security has also become a problem. Quarantines keep workers from their jobs and have slowed the delivery of food to certain areas, according to the U.N.

""We must act now if we want to avoid greater humanitarian consequences in future,"" Amos said.",www.cnn.com,left,H7p4W9b2cN6WmuCz

The CBN News team has arrived in Florida to cover #HurricaneMatthew. Please keep our crew in prayer. May God be merciful to Florida. Watch John Jessup's message below:

Gushing flood waters stranded many who refused to escape the storm's path and left some 1 million Floridians without electricity.

Tempers flared among some people as they tried to gas up before getting out. One man said he ""saw two guys fighting at a gas station yesterday - actually throwing punches!""

Those who stayed behind emptied store shelves and Disney World closed for only the fourth time in its history. Thousands of travelers were stuck as flights were canceled at airports in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Orlando.

But the full force of Mathew's powerful gusts and 125 miles per hour winds veered away from the 6 million people living in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Palm Beach area. Instead of mauling through Florida as expected, the hurricane mostly stayed over warm waters.

But after gaining fuel from the warm winds off the coast, Florida's fortune could mean devastation for the surrounding region. President Barack Obama is warning that Matthew is ""still a really dangerous hurricane.""



Meeting in the Oval Office on Friday with FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate, Obama said he was concerned about storm surge and that as the hurricane moves north, areas such as Jacksonville, Florida, and Georgia might be less prepared.

Some 500,000 people were told to evacuate the Jacksonville area, while thousands more were told to completely clear out of Georgia. Meteorologists say these areas could see 15 inches to 9 feet of potentially deadly flood waters.

Earlier Friday, CBN News Anchor John Jessup was in Florida near Cocoa Beach.

""We're already seeing the effects of Matthew, with bands of driving rain, and heavy winds. Just behind me the road is absolutely empty. County-wide curfews went into effect late Thursday night. They'll last until Saturday morning, all with the intent to keeping people safe,"" Jessup reported.

The National Hurricane Center says storm surge and destruction will make places along the coast uninhabitable for weeks, possibly months.

CBN's Operation Blessing is staging relief in central Florida and is ready to move into those areas as needed. Volunteers will be serving up hot meals, providing food, water, and other essentials.

Operation Blessing Vice President Jody Gettys says in the long run, the relief organization will help the hurricane victims rebuild.

Meanwhile, the U.S. military is heading to Haiti to provide aid to residents. The death toll is steadily rising over the initial 300 casualties. Most of the victims were impoverished people who either did not know about the storm or had nothing to protect themselves.

Apple CEO Tim Cook, who was born in Mobile in the south-west of the state, said he was ""devastated"" by the news, saying Lee County was ""a place close to my heart"".

Are tornadoes expected at this time of year?

This series has occurred earlier than the traditional peak season for tornadoes, which runs from April to June, when more than half of the year's tornadoes generally strike.

Weather systems are more conducive in these months. Warm air flows north from the Gulf of Mexico at the same time as storm systems are propelled into the south and mid-west by a southward dip in the jet stream.

These latest tornadoes appear to have caused the highest death toll since 35 people were killed in Arkansas and Mississippi in April 2014.

A ""super outbreak"" of tornadoes across a swathe of the US in April 2011 killed more than 300 people.

Carter , 90 , said he initially thought he had only weeks to live when he first learned of the diagnosis . He 's now more optimistic , placing his fate in the hands of God . At the news conference in Atlanta where he sat alone before a bank of reporters and cameras , Carter said he would begin a course of radiation therapy on Thursday afternoon .
`` I have had a wonderful life , '' Carter said with the same unsparing honesty and meticulous detail that marked his presidency . `` I 'm ready for anything and I 'm looking forward to new adventure , '' Carter said , in the 40-minute appearance before the cameras , in which he frequently beamed his huge smile and never fell prey to emotion .
`` It is in the hands of God , whom I worship . ''
Carter , speaking slowly and softly and wearing a coat and tie with blue jeans , said he had been overwhelmed with phone calls of support -- including outreach from Secretary of State John Kerry and former presidents George H. W. and George W. Bush , who called at once . Carter said he was n't in a lot of discomfort but had some shoulder pain .
I spoke with President Carter to wish him well , and he sounded strong . Bar and I are wishing him the very best as he fights the good fight . — George Bush ( @ GeorgeHWBush ) August 20 , 2015
Carter said in the immediate aftermath of the diagnosis , `` I just thought I had a few weeks left ( to live ) , but I was surprisingly at ease -- much more so than my wife was . ''
His devoted partner Rosalynn , the former First Lady , looked on , as Carter described her as the `` pinnacle '' of his life . `` We 've had 69 years together , still together , '' Carter said .
The former president announced that he would cut back on the globetrotting personal diplomacy , peacemaking , election monitoring and pioneering public health work with which he has redefined the role of presidents once they leave office . He said his symptoms first appeared during a trip to Guyana earlier this year . On his return , doctors found a small tumor on his liver and diagnosed melanoma , which was later found to have spread to four spots on his brain .
But the 39th president 's appearance did n't feel like a goodbye , as Carter said he still hoped to mount a visit to Nepal later this year for the `` Habitat for Humanity '' charity which builds shelter for homeless people . In fact — with the political world immersed in the fury of another election campaign , Carter seemed almost a throwback to a past , more courtly era .
Carter 's sanguine acceptance of his prognosis seems to lie in his deep religious belief , and he pledged to continue teaching Sunday school at his church `` as long as I 'm physically able . ''
`` I do have deep religious faith , which I 'm very grateful for , and I was pleasantly surprised that I did n't go into an attitude of despair or anger or anything like that . I was just completely at ease . ''
He continued : `` I ca n't really anticipate how I 'll be feeling . Obviously I 'll have to defer quite substantially to my doctors who are in charge of the treatment , '' Carter said Thursday , saying he 'll get his first radiation treatment this afternoon .
Carter had a `` small mass '' removed from his liver in an early August surgical procedure . So far , he said the only places where cancer had been found in his body were in his brain and liver , though he also discussed his family 's history with the disease . He said it is likely that other spots of cancer would show up elsewhere in his body .
Elected in 1976 and ousted in the 1980 election by Ronald Reagan , Carter has a family history of pancreatic cancer -- a disease that claimed his father , brother and two sisters . His mother had breast cancer , which later spread to her pancreas .
`` For a long time my family was the only one on earth that had four people who have died of pancreatic cancer , '' he said .
After providing a detailed briefing on his diagnosis , Carter was asked to reflect on his life and career in politics , including the single term presidency between 1977 and 1981 that yielded some notable achievements overseas but ended when Republican Ronald Reagan swept to power amid the humiliation of a 444 day hostage crisis in Iran and a sickly economy at home .
Carter said that looking back , he wished he had insisted on more firepower for a botched U.S. 1980 operation to rescue the U.S. hostages in Tehran , which ended when a helicopter crashed into a U.S. transport plane in the desert , killing eight servicemen .
`` I wish I had sent one more helicopter to get the hostages , and we would have rescued them , and I would have been reelected , '' Carter said .
The veteran Democrat said that on reflection however , he would have traded a second term for the Carter Center , which is renowned the world over for its advocacy of human rights and democracy , and which earned the former president the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 .
He said that if he had one wish for the rest of his life it would be that he gets to see peace in the Middle East but bemoaned the fact that that goal seems `` more dismal than any time I remember in the last 50 years . The only process is practically dormant , '' he said , and took a swipe at the administration of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
`` The government of Israel has no desire for a two-state solution , which is the policy of all other nations in the world , and the United States has practically no influence compared to past years in either Israel or Palestine . So I feel very discouraged . ''
And he said that he was hoping to outlive one of the many scourges that has caused misery for millions of people in tropical Africa that his Carter Center has worked to eradicate .
`` I 'd like for the last guinea worm to die before I do . ''","Atlanta (CNN) In a remarkable press conference marked by grace and devoid of self-pity, former President Jimmy Carter said Thursday that four spots of cancer had spread to his brain.

“ I 'm not sure I can make it my new normal , ” my friend texts me .
And so began my Tuesday , a mad swirl of typical and terrifying , when my Jewish Community Center in Rochester , N.Y. , became the latest target of harassment with a bomb threat , specifically targeting the children ’ s day care at the JCC . Since January , JCCs in the U.S. and Canada have received nearly 70 bomb threats .
I knew it was coming . My nephew ’ s JCC was evacuated in January . And the administration at my daughter ’ s JCC began testing the emergency communication system last month in the event of a threat .
What is it like to receive a text message notifying you of bomb threat at your child ’ s preschool at 6:40 in the morning ? It ’ s like this : a flurry of texts from friends and family , an uptick in comments of love and solidarity on Facebook . And life goes on in our little house , my daughter blissfully oblivious to her mother ’ s distraction this morning .
“ Mom , can I have sprinkle cookies ? ” She begged for them at Trader Joe ’ s over the weekend . I was saving them for a special occasion .

My morning went something like this:

Give baby his morning bottle.

Brush teeth.

Help preschooler fix a broken toy before school starts.

Check phone. Learn that my daughter’s school received a bomb threat.

“I'm not sure I can make it my new normal,” my friend texts me.

And so began my Tuesday, a mad swirl of typical and terrifying, when my Jewish Community Center in Rochester, N.Y., became the latest target of harassment with a bomb threat, specifically targeting the children’s day care at the JCC. Since January, JCCs in the U.S. and Canada have received nearly 70 bomb threats.

I knew it was coming. My nephew’s JCC was evacuated in January. And the administration at my daughter’s JCC began testing the emergency communication system last month in the event of a threat.

What is it like to receive a text message notifying you of bomb threat at your child’s preschool at 6:40 in the morning? It’s like this: a flurry of texts from friends and family, an uptick in comments of love and solidarity on Facebook. And life goes on in our little house, my daughter blissfully oblivious to her mother’s distraction this morning.

The anti-Semitism we hoped to never see again: Column

Europeans or Latin Americans, we're all immigrants: Column

“Mom, can I have sprinkle cookies?” She begged for them at Trader Joe’s over the weekend. I was saving them for a special occasion.

I open the fresh package of cookies and hand over the entire box. Why not?

My sister sends her love via text: “That is such a scary thing to see first thing in the morning. Or to see ever.”

The baby begins to cry from his play mat. He’s overdue for his morning nap. I place him in the swing and he enters the Land of Nod.

I check Facebook. My daughter’s teacher from last year posted a reassuring comment. I want to reach through the fiber optic cables and hug her warmly: “Even if your children were with us when getting the threat, we would have taken care of them and protected them as if they were our own.”

I’m amazed how such love and compassion can coexist with cruelty.

“Mom, there's a monster! He’s getting Sofia. She needs to hex him!” My daughter’s glued to the iPad this morning, typically forbidden on weekdays, watching her beloved Disney show Sofia the First, about a villager who becomes a princess and encounters all manner of mystical creatures.

She looks up: “Is it school day?” Cookie crumbs spray everywhere.

“Yes, sweetheart,” I say. “I just want you to meet the babysitter.” My son’s sitter is arriving any minute.

Delayed openings are supposed to be because of snow. Not bombs.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

We all need to scrap identity politics: Column

I look out the window, awaiting the babysitter’s red car. She used to work at the JCC. Upon her arrival, I whisper this morning’s news. She pales. She regains composure. I feel as if I have caused her harm with this news.

I check my phone. My aunt sends a note: “We will just carry on. Why be intimidated ... it’s what they want. We are strong.”

And our children are so beautiful.

“I don't like socks!” My daughter yells as I tell her to get dressed for the day. ""Make a cuff!""

I smile at her demands. They seem so innocent even though they typically cause me to grit my teeth. I revel in her exuberant presence. For her it’s a special day because she gets cookies for breakfast and an iPad on her lap.

The monsters are real, sweetheart, but together let’s crush this darkness. I wish I could hex the hoaxers because my love for you is more powerful than any magic spell.

My phone alerts me that the school reopens at 10 a.m. We will be there.

general_news,American Spectator,2,https://spectator.org/a-gift-worth-keeping/,A Gift Worth Keeping,,"Roger Kaplan, Jeffrey Lord, Dov Fischer, Debra J. Saunders, Brian Mcnicoll, Aymenn Al-Tamimi","Christmas is a time of gifts , and they may be great gifts or small gifts . But it ’ s the thought that counts . But , the golden rule is , give , think not of getting , and you will get in the Lord ’ s good time .
These being the ground rules , the year ends with the liberals dishing it out and the administration dishing it back .
The administration , or what remains of it , is preparing to give ground in Syria and Afghanistan , which could be wise , but could be unwise , and the ones saying the latter are not liberals . Neither are they hawks or doves . They are of a disappearing avian species , the national security hard-noses .
There are those who say we should stay in Syria . There are others who say we should not , nor in Afghanistan .
There are those who say without General Jim Mattis , the administration loses one of its best minds , and the defense department its best secretary since George Marshall .
These are disagreements among hard-noses . Do not be deceived by liberals trying to score points by shoving their way into a dispute among hard-noses .
Mock them at your peril . They have kept America free . We owe them the X Article , the containment doctrine , the architecture of the ramparts of liberty .
It is perfectly true that we gave the peoples and tribes of the Middle East and South Asia more than they gave back . But the rule is to give with no thought of gratitude . Giving is its own reward .
No one ever claimed gifts are necessarily well managed . The madness of spending so much money , the even greater madness of spending American lives when clear cut victory was not the goal , verged on utter policy insanity . The sickening thought that men and women in charge of our government ’ s security policies persuaded themselves there were inadequate nationson those hard lands ruled by corrupt , cruel despots , that could be built into adequate ones , raises doubts about the durability of the universally admired American can-do .
At the very least we ought to admit there are things we can ’ t do . On this critical point , Donald Trump gives us the gift of honesty .
We can beat them but we can ’ t change them . Our gift was showing the Arabs ( and the Pashtuns ) that tyranny need not last for ever , as the profound and always-missed Fouad Ajami wrote . Too bad they spoiled it ; but let ’ s admit we did some enabling .
That is why President Donald Trump ’ s Mideast-South Asian policy reconsideration is intuitively respectable . He is giving the American people a true , and sincere , short-term gift : let ’ s stop bleeding because of failed policies .
But it is also a gift to the bad guys , thus an invitation to more trouble . That , by all accounts , is what General ( and Defense Secretary ) Jim Mattis tried to tell him . He did not listen , by all accounts . He listened , by some accounts , to tyrants who wish us ill , notably Recip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin . This , one has to admit — lotta admitin ’ goin ’ on — is flabbergasting .
There is nothing wrong with saying our foreign policy since the end of the Reagan administration has stunk . Rich in good intentions , it has been dirt poor in execution . That is a fair argument , a respectable position .
I , personally , would wager that Gen. Mattis and many others — Gen. Stanley McChrystal , for one — would agree with this position . Only they would add : yes , stop the waste and the bleeding . But find a way to not make a gift to bad , wicked regimes run by evil men .
And there is a way — there always is . That is the true American can-do . There are allies who will share the burden . There are desperate men yearning to be free , notably the Kurds , who will fight , if only we will help them . This is not a matter of entangling alliances , but of getting a job done , and the job is to keep America secure .
There are others , who are not favorable to freedom but who are desperate to keep their wealth and privileges , who can be told to man up and fight . Saudis , Qataris , Emeratis , Egyptians , Paks : I never understood why we could not , ever since the first Gulf War , get it across to these people that we are not fooled . We know they are treacherous thieves , child rapists , woman-killers , fanatical crazed Muslims , and we also know they need us . They either do what we say — police your neighborhoods , or we let them sink into their mean games and failures , until the Persians get them , if they have not by then got one another . But then of course , our honor is on the line .
Coalition of the willing ? Nice , idea , but sentimental . Coalition of the desperate would have worked better . The Emiratis provided some air power ( including female fighter pilots ) over Libya , and the Saudis have sent help to militia fighting the Persians and their allies in Syria . Decades ago they helped out against the Russians in Afghanistan , with Wahhabi strings attached . We could ’ a , should ’ a made them do better , and without Wahhabi commissars being part of the deal . Respect your allies , sure , and lean on your proxies .
It is not untypical of democratic government to have a good gift idea and then mismanage it . Perfectly sound in principle would be programs to give economic aid to Central American countries , creating growth in those places that will give their violence-plagued people incentives to stay home . This would complement border security , not replace it . We would have to expect much of that aid to be wasted and stolen ; but there is a slightly better chance of limiting that kind of damage if we do not pretend we are building nations where what we are dealing with is turf-wars among murderous oligarchies , criminal gangs , and plain ordinary bad people .
Conservatives criticize Great Society welfare-state policies as good intentions with perverse consequences . You create welfare dependency in the name of benevolence , and you end up with urban blight , irresponsible parents , gangsters , murder-a-minute neighborhoods . Another Trump gift , despite all the foolish heckling about white supremacist racism , is that he is the first president since the Great Society to have advanced the jobs-are-better-than-handouts doctrine that leaders of disadvantaged sectors have long preferred , only to be ignored by condescending liberals and race hustlers who prefer keeping the poor on their political plantations .
Note in this regard , by the way , that Chicago , often rather hastily denounced by conservatives as a city ruined by failed liberal policies , actually is today one of the best places in the country to live . Almost all the appalling crime and social dysfunction are concentrated in a few broken down zones . This validates the conservative critique of welfare state liberalism all the more , but you should know what you are talking about .
The contagion spreads into the very functioning of capitalism , of course , and hurts , if it does not kill , the goose that lays the golden eggs . The stock market , to take that classic example , self-corrects runs of irrational exuberance . But it also responds to political chaos . And there is little doubt that the December Dive on Wall Street is due at least in part to the chaos in the Trump administration . But it is due even more to the unthinking obstruction by politicians , and some civil servants and high officials , whose jobs are to make governments work . The markets sense that if these people overthrow an elected government of the Republic , and , goaded by their left-wing , begin implementing triple-strength steroid versions of Great Society socialism , it ’ s curtains for the greatest economy in history .
Trump , with justification moving to reverse nearly three decades of shoddy , selfish , divisive government , went about his declared and elected task with a lack of finesse that was in many ways refreshing . But now the standoff with a Democratic House , not the shutdown but the prospects of a slow-moving coup , is causing a very cold shower on the Street , and that is not good , though maybe it will have a jolting effect and make everyone get real . ( That is a wager I will not make . )
The obsession with the prez is a mean and mean-spirited gift , because it showcases the strength of our political system . The refusal of the liberals to respect democratic transitions of power , their obstruction of the government of the republic , would have tried the patience of a Solon . Utterly disproving the theses of the demagogic , nihilistic left , Donald Trump has not reacted in an authoritarian manner to their provocations and their resort to star-chamber tyranny . He has expressed frustration and anger , and why shouldn ’ t he ? The presidency comes with a bully pulpit . No one expected Donald Trump to write and speak like Abraham Lincoln . His recent predecessors have been vacuous , often misleading . He is in-your-face , but he is honest about what he wants .
Our democracy is strong and we Americans believe in it , even if we may find grounds to doubt whether this holds for the elites that govern us . Deplorables , indeed . Guns and prayers , indeed . I have to say I suddenly — and briefly , I am sure — found myself in the cheering section of young Miss Octavio-Cortez , when she asked by what right those boondoggling incompetent rascals whose club she is about to join should not have their paychecks docked , since they brought about a government shut-down .
Compare with liberal France . A bit too much arrogant self-satisfaction there , and bang , revolution , anarchy . Demonstrators throwing cobbles and iron bars at policemen , who are there to protect them . Immediately , talk of regime-in-crisis , desperate attempts to quickly buy everybody off at once ( including the cops ) . This is a solid republican regime ? Led by a global climate change true-believer ? Who is also an unreconstructed free migration liberal ? A bon entendeur salut , they say in France , go figure .
The enemy is within the gates , striking just days before Christmas on the square before a great cathedral . Instead acting consequently and stating clearly that he will bring fear to the other side , the French president lambasts little Hungary for trying to protect itself from such barbarism . Okay , fair ’ s fair , Viktor Orban ’ s policy of self-defined illiberal democracy has its problems too , as the wave of recent demonstrations reveals . Liberal or illiberal , Europe has little to teach us , who remain the last , best land of hope and refuge .
A Constitutional Republic , a gift forever , if we can keep it . As with our Republic , so with Christmas , the forever gift of hope that the Lord gave to the Gentiles , through a ragged young Jewish family , His own people .","Christmas is a time of gifts, and they may be great gifts or small gifts.

general_news,ABC News,0,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-north-korea-responsible-sony-hack/story?id=27677015,US Says North Korea Responsible for Sony Hack,,"Jonathan Karl, Pierre Thomas","Those who hacked Sony Pictures Entertainment - releasing a trove of emails and stealing personal data from company executives - were directed to do so by North Korean officials , a senior administration official told ███ .
The hackers have also threatened to attack theaters screening `` The Interview '' - a fictional comedy about two Americans who are asked to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un - leading several major chains to pull the film from their lineups and Sony to cancel its Christmas Day release date .
The U.S. used painstaking cyber-sleuthing to piece together what happened , the official said , noting that the individual or group behind the hack were not in North Korea . The official said U.S. intelligence and the FBI pulled all the stops out given the unprecedented nature of the attack that destroyed files , shut down work stations and exploited company secrets and strategy .
`` Sony Pictures has been the victim of an unprecedented criminal assault against our employees , our customers , and our business , '' Sony said in a statement provided to ███ . `` Those who attacked us stole our intellectual property , private emails , and sensitive and proprietary material , and sought to destroy our spirit and our morale – all apparently to thwart the release of a movie they did not like . ''
Last week , the FBI held a private meeting in New York with reps from across the entertainment industry to brief them on cyber-related threats against them . The Sony hack was not the only topic discussed , but it was a major one , sources said .
On Tuesday , Guardians of Peace , the group that has claimed responsibility for hacking Sony , posted a warning to theaters showing the movie and for the first time discussed `` The Interview '' by name rather than relatively vague references .
`` We will clearly show it to you at the very time and places 'The Interview ' [ will ] be shown , including the premier , how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to , '' the note released by the group of hackers reads . `` The world will be full of fear . Remember the 11th of September 2001 . ''

''","Those who hacked Sony Pictures Entertainment - releasing a trove of emails and stealing personal data from company executives - were directed to do so by North Korean officials, a senior administration official told ABC News.

The hackers have also threatened to attack theaters screening ""The Interview"" - a fictional comedy about two Americans who are asked to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un - leading several major chains to pull the film from their lineups and Sony to cancel its Christmas Day release date.

The U.S. used painstaking cyber-sleuthing to piece together what happened, the official said, noting that the individual or group behind the hack were not in North Korea. The official said U.S. intelligence and the FBI pulled all the stops out given the unprecedented nature of the attack that destroyed files, shut down work stations and exploited company secrets and strategy.

""Sony Pictures has been the victim of an unprecedented criminal assault against our employees, our customers, and our business,"" Sony said in a statement provided to ABC News. ""Those who attacked us stole our intellectual property, private emails, and sensitive and proprietary material, and sought to destroy our spirit and our morale – all apparently to thwart the release of a movie they did not like.""

Last week, the FBI held a private meeting in New York with reps from across the entertainment industry to brief them on cyber-related threats against them. The Sony hack was not the only topic discussed, but it was a major one, sources said.

On Tuesday, Guardians of Peace, the group that has claimed responsibility for hacking Sony, posted a warning to theaters showing the movie and for the first time discussed ""The Interview"" by name rather than relatively vague references.

""We will clearly show it to you at the very time and places 'The Interview' [will] be shown, including the premier, how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to,"" the note released by the group of hackers reads. ""The world will be full of fear. Remember the 11th of September 2001.""

The post adds that people should stay away from places where the movie is shown and ""whatever comes… all the world will denounce the SONY.""

A spokesperson for the National Security Council said it has offered assistance to Sony.

""The U.S. government is working tirelessly to bring the perpetrators of this attack to justice, and we are considering a range of options in weighing a potential response,"" said NSC spokesperson Bernadette Meehan.

It was the seismic event that almost no one saw coming .
When Donald Trump Donald John TrumpTrump faces high stakes in meeting with Erdoğan amid impeachment drama Democrats worry they do n't have right candidate to beat Trump Trump threatening to fire Mulvaney : report MORE announced his bid for the White House in June 2015 , the effort was widely dismissed as a self-promotional gambit by the New York property developer .

Trump ’ s detractors were sure he would come unstuck in the general election against Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonDemocrats worry they do n't have right candidate to beat Trump Krystal Ball credits Gabbard 's upswing in 2020 race to 'feckless ' Democratic establishment Outsider candidates outpoll insider candidates MORE — right up until he won on Nov. 8 , demolishing the “ blue wall ” that Democrats claimed to have in the Rust Belt and Upper Midwest .
Trump campaigned in a style that defied political norms and survived controversies that would have doomed other candidacies . A large swath of the population appears implacably opposed to him , which will create challenges from the moment he is inaugurated on Jan. 20 .
Still , Trump won the biggest prize in American politics on his first try . He is not to be underestimated .
The revelation that the CIA believed Russia had intervened in the presidential election with the express purpose of helping Trump win caused a massive furor in December .
In one sense , the CIA ’ s assessment was not much of a surprise . Russia had long been believed to be behind hacks of the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) and the private email account of Clinton ’ s campaign chairman , John Podesta . The Obama administration had publicly stated in October that it was confident the Russian government had directed the hacking .
The DNC hack led to the resignation of its chairwoman , Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( Fla. ) when it became apparent that staff members had favored Clinton over her left-wing primary challenger , Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersDemocrats worry they do n't have right candidate to beat Trump Overnight Health Care : Top health official defends contract payments to Trump allies | Vaping advocates confident Trump will turn from flavor ban | Sanders gets endorsement from nurses union Krystal Ball credits Gabbard 's upswing in 2020 race to 'feckless ' Democratic establishment MORE ( I-Vt. ) .
The Podesta hack caused further embarrassment , including to Wasserman Schultz ’ s temporary replacement , Donna Brazile . A leaked email showed that Brazile , who was then a CNN contributor , had given the Clinton campaign advance notice of a question the frontrunner might be asked at a townhall meeting in Flint , Mich .
Trump , meanwhile , has been deeply skeptical of the idea that Russian hackers sought to swing the election toward him . He called that narrative “ ridiculous ” in a Dec. 11 “ Fox News Sunday ” interview . His aides argued that Trump ’ s critics were trying to delegitimize his election win .
In the year ’ s closing days , President Obama announced the expulsion of 35 Russian operatives from the U.S , as well as a number of other measures in response to the alleged hacking .
Much to the chagrin of Clinton ’ s supporters , her use of a private email address and server while secretary of State made big headlines right up until Election Day .
Clinton ’ s use of the server had first been revealed by The New York Times in March 2015 . The story picked up pace in the first half of this year as an FBI investigation into the matter proceeded . In July , FBI director James Comey announced that no criminal charges would be brought against the Democrat , even as he criticized her and her aides for being “ extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive , highly classified information . ”
Clinton aides hoped they had put the matter to rest , but they got an unwelcome surprise 11 days before Election Day . Comey went public with details that more emails had been discovered that “ appear to be pertinent ” to the new investigation .
Those emails were apparently found during an unrelated investigation into Anthony Weiner , the disgraced former New York Congressman and estranged husband of one of Clinton ’ s closest aides , Huma Abedin .
Comey emerged again just two days before the election to say that the new emails had not changed his mind regarding charges against Clinton .
The effect of the late Comey disclosures will be discussed for years to come . Clinton told donors on a call days after her loss that his October intervention “ stopped our momentum . ”
Even amid the tumult of the presidential election , the vexing issue of shootings involving police officers remained at the forefront of the national debate .
Some cases rose to particular prominence , but it was a cascade of tragic events in early July that raised fears that the U.S. could be on the brink of serious disorder .
First , Alton Sterling was shot dead at close range while being held on the ground by police in Baton Rouge , La . on July 5 . Philando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer during a traffic stop in a suburb of St. Paul , Minn. , the following evening . Both Sterling and Castile were African-American .
Just one night later , at the end of an otherwise peaceful protest against police violence in Dallas , a man ambushed and shot at police officers , killing five and wounding nine . The shooter , Micah Xavier Johnson , had reportedly expressed hatred of police , and of white officers in particular .
In December , a mistrial was declared in the case of Michael Slager , the police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black man , Walter Scott , in North Charleston , S.C. Scott was running away from Slager at the time .
As of Dec. 30 , according to a database maintained by The Washington Post , 957 people have been shot and killed by police in the United States in 2016 . Preliminary figures from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund indicate that 64 police officers were killed in firearms-related incidents in the line of duty .
The sudden death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia in February kicked off a political fight that has yet to be resolved .
The loss of Scalia , a conservative and an “ originalist ” in his interpretation of the Constitution , could have altered the ideological complexion of the court .
The prospect of President Obama being able to give the court a liberal majority excited progressives — and horrified conservatives , for whom the fate of the court remained a rallying cry all the way to Election Day .
Obama nominated Merrick Garland the month after Scalia ’ s death . But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison ( Mitch ) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell protege emerges as Kentucky 's next rising star Hillicon Valley : Schumer questions Army over use of TikTok | Federal court rules against random searches of travelers ' phones | Groups push for election security funds in stopgap bill | Facebook 's new payment feature | Disney+ launch hit by glitches McConnell , GOP leaders say they wo n't be watching House impeachment hearing MORE ( R-Ky. ) had already asserted that he would not act on any nomination from Obama , stating that it was for the incoming president to fill the vacancy .
Liberals and Obama protested that this was pure obstructionism from McConnell . But the majority leader ’ s gamble paid off . Trump ’ s election made certain that a more conservative justice would be nominated to replace Scalia .
The fake news phenomenon hit a nadir in early December , when an armed man made his way to a popular Washington pizzeria . According to police , Edgar Welch was intent on investigating a fictitious conspiracy theory that the pizzeria was at the center of a child abuse ring linked to Clinton .
Welch allegedly fired two shots before being arrested . No one was injured , but the incident was serious enough to intensify worries about the fake news phenomenon .
The label has been applied both to conspiracy theories , such as the Clinton “ pizzagate ” fantasy , and to “ news ” that is produced by people , often based overseas , who know it is fictitious but seek to profit from it . Late in the year , Google and Facebook sought to crack down on purveyors of fake news from using their technology to sell ads .
Still , with Americans deeply distrustful of traditional media and increasingly reliant on social networks that often reinforce their existing views , it seems unlikely that “ fake news ” will disappear anytime soon .
In an end-of-year staff memo obtained by Business Insider , Buzzfeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith predicted that , in 2017 , “ fake news will become more sophisticated , and fake , ambiguous and spun-up stories will spread widely . ”
Even amid a year that had more than its fair share of violence and tragedy , the atrocity that unfolded at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando in June was at a different level .
The nightclub , which catered to a gay clientele , was attacked by Omar Matteen , a 29-year old armed with a semi-automatic rifle and a semi-automatic pistol .
Matteen killed 49 people , the worst mass shooting in recent America history . Shortly after the shooting began , Matteen made a 911 call in which he swore allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) . He was eventually killed at the scene by law enforcement .
President Obama described the attack as an “ act of terror and an act of hate. ” Donald Trump was widely criticized for a tweet in the immediate aftermath that began , “ Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism. ” The sheer horror of what happened in Orlando will be remembered long after the political back-and-forth is forgotten .
At the start of the year , Democrats had high hopes of seizing back control of the Senate , where they have been in the minority since the 2014 elections .
The Democrats netted two seats , three short of the five they needed to win the majority if a Republican won the White House . ( Had Clinton won , the Democrats would have needed to gain only four seats ) .
Trump proved to have much more significant coattails than most Democrats believed . Endangered GOP incumbents such as Sens . Pat Toomey and Ron Johnson Ronald ( Ron ) Harold JohnsonLindsey Graham basks in the impeachment spotlight Sunday shows — New impeachment phase dominates Rand Paul says Trump has 'every right ' to withhold Ukraine aid over corruption MORE held on in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin , respectively .
The only Democratic gains came in New Hampshire and Illinois , and the party now has to face a brutal 2018 calendar , where it will have to defend seats in 10 states that were won by Trump .
It was already apparent as 2016 dawned that Beltway pundits had underestimated Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) , the veteran left-winger who challenged Clinton for the Democratic nomination .
In the end , Sanders won 23 contests and more than 13 million votes . In the first battle , the Iowa caucuses , Sanders missed out by just a whisker on handing Clinton the kind of shock defeat that could have derailed her march to the nomination .
Sanders ’ s eventual loss to Clinton could not disguise the intensity of his appeal , especially to the Democratic grassroots .
His platform focused on income inequality and the broader idea that the system is rigged against working Americans . He promised a far more fundamental shift in politics than did Clinton — and the fact that millions of Democrats rallied to that flag is a lesson that the party establishment will ignore at its peril .
The Syrian civil war ground on through its fifth full year , with the overall death toll now estimated at anywhere between 300,000 and 500,000 people .
The government of Bashar al-Assad was aided by continued splintering among the forces opposed to him , which comprise hard-line Islamists , including ISIS , more moderate forces backed by the U.S. , and Kurds in the north of the country .

Trump campaigned in a style that defied political norms and survived controversies that would have doomed other candidacies. A large swath of the population appears implacably opposed to him, which will create challenges from the moment he is inaugurated on Jan. 20.

Still, Trump won the biggest prize in American politics on his first try. He is not to be underestimated.

Russian hacking

The revelation that the CIA believed Russia had intervened in the presidential election with the express purpose of helping Trump win caused a massive furor in December.

In one sense, the CIA’s assessment was not much of a surprise. Russia had long been believed to be behind hacks of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the private email account of Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta. The Obama administration had publicly stated in October that it was confident the Russian government had directed the hacking.

The DNC hack led to the resignation of its chairwoman, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.) when it became apparent that staff members had favored Clinton over her left-wing primary challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersDemocrats worry they don't have right candidate to beat Trump Overnight Health Care: Top health official defends contract payments to Trump allies | Vaping advocates confident Trump will turn from flavor ban | Sanders gets endorsement from nurses union Krystal Ball credits Gabbard's upswing in 2020 race to 'feckless' Democratic establishment MORE (I-Vt.).

The Podesta hack caused further embarrassment, including to Wasserman Schultz’s temporary replacement, Donna Brazile. A leaked email showed that Brazile, who was then a CNN contributor, had given the Clinton campaign advance notice of a question the frontrunner might be asked at a townhall meeting in Flint, Mich.

Trump, meanwhile, has been deeply skeptical of the idea that Russian hackers sought to swing the election toward him. He called that narrative “ridiculous” in a Dec. 11 “Fox News Sunday” interview. His aides argued that Trump’s critics were trying to delegitimize his election win.

In the year’s closing days, President Obama announced the expulsion of 35 Russian operatives from the U.S, as well as a number of other measures in response to the alleged hacking.

Hillary Clinton’s emails and the FBI

Much to the chagrin of Clinton’s supporters, her use of a private email address and server while secretary of State made big headlines right up until Election Day.

Clinton’s use of the server had first been revealed by The New York Times in March 2015. The story picked up pace in the first half of this year as an FBI investigation into the matter proceeded. In July, FBI director James Comey announced that no criminal charges would be brought against the Democrat, even as he criticized her and her aides for being “extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.”

Clinton aides hoped they had put the matter to rest, but they got an unwelcome surprise 11 days before Election Day. Comey went public with details that more emails had been discovered that “appear to be pertinent” to the new investigation.

Those emails were apparently found during an unrelated investigation into Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former New York Congressman and estranged husband of one of Clinton’s closest aides, Huma Abedin.

Comey emerged again just two days before the election to say that the new emails had not changed his mind regarding charges against Clinton.

The effect of the late Comey disclosures will be discussed for years to come. Clinton told donors on a call days after her loss that his October intervention “stopped our momentum.”

Violence and the police

Even amid the tumult of the presidential election, the vexing issue of shootings involving police officers remained at the forefront of the national debate.

Some cases rose to particular prominence, but it was a cascade of tragic events in early July that raised fears that the U.S. could be on the brink of serious disorder.

First, Alton Sterling was shot dead at close range while being held on the ground by police in Baton Rouge, La. on July 5. Philando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer during a traffic stop in a suburb of St. Paul, Minn., the following evening. Both Sterling and Castile were African-American.

Just one night later, at the end of an otherwise peaceful protest against police violence in Dallas, a man ambushed and shot at police officers, killing five and wounding nine. The shooter, Micah Xavier Johnson, had reportedly expressed hatred of police, and of white officers in particular.

In December, a mistrial was declared in the case of Michael Slager, the police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black man, Walter Scott, in North Charleston, S.C. Scott was running away from Slager at the time.

As of Dec. 30, according to a database maintained by The Washington Post, 957 people have been shot and killed by police in the United States in 2016. Preliminary figures from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund indicate that 64 police officers were killed in firearms-related incidents in the line of duty.

A vacancy on the Supreme Court

The sudden death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia in February kicked off a political fight that has yet to be resolved.

The loss of Scalia, a conservative and an “originalist” in his interpretation of the Constitution, could have altered the ideological complexion of the court.

The prospect of President Obama being able to give the court a liberal majority excited progressives — and horrified conservatives, for whom the fate of the court remained a rallying cry all the way to Election Day.

Obama nominated Merrick Garland the month after Scalia’s death. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell protege emerges as Kentucky's next rising star Hillicon Valley: Schumer questions Army over use of TikTok | Federal court rules against random searches of travelers' phones | Groups push for election security funds in stopgap bill | Facebook's new payment feature | Disney+ launch hit by glitches McConnell, GOP leaders say they won't be watching House impeachment hearing MORE (R-Ky.) had already asserted that he would not act on any nomination from Obama, stating that it was for the incoming president to fill the vacancy.

Liberals and Obama protested that this was pure obstructionism from McConnell. But the majority leader’s gamble paid off. Trump’s election made certain that a more conservative justice would be nominated to replace Scalia.

The rise of fake news

The fake news phenomenon hit a nadir in early December, when an armed man made his way to a popular Washington pizzeria. According to police, Edgar Welch was intent on investigating a fictitious conspiracy theory that the pizzeria was at the center of a child abuse ring linked to Clinton.

Welch allegedly fired two shots before being arrested. No one was injured, but the incident was serious enough to intensify worries about the fake news phenomenon.

The label has been applied both to conspiracy theories, such as the Clinton “pizzagate” fantasy, and to “news” that is produced by people, often based overseas, who know it is fictitious but seek to profit from it. Late in the year, Google and Facebook sought to crack down on purveyors of fake news from using their technology to sell ads.

Still, with Americans deeply distrustful of traditional media and increasingly reliant on social networks that often reinforce their existing views, it seems unlikely that “fake news” will disappear anytime soon.

In an end-of-year staff memo obtained by Business Insider, Buzzfeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith predicted that, in 2017, “fake news will become more sophisticated, and fake, ambiguous and spun-up stories will spread widely.”

Massacre in Orlando

Even amid a year that had more than its fair share of violence and tragedy, the atrocity that unfolded at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando in June was at a different level.

The nightclub, which catered to a gay clientele, was attacked by Omar Matteen, a 29-year old armed with a semi-automatic rifle and a semi-automatic pistol.

Matteen killed 49 people, the worst mass shooting in recent America history. Shortly after the shooting began, Matteen made a 911 call in which he swore allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). He was eventually killed at the scene by law enforcement.

President Obama described the attack as an “act of terror and an act of hate.” Donald Trump was widely criticized for a tweet in the immediate aftermath that began, “Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism.” The sheer horror of what happened in Orlando will be remembered long after the political back-and-forth is forgotten.

Republicans hold the Senate

At the start of the year, Democrats had high hopes of seizing back control of the Senate, where they have been in the minority since the 2014 elections.

It was not to be.

The Democrats netted two seats, three short of the five they needed to win the majority if a Republican won the White House. (Had Clinton won, the Democrats would have needed to gain only four seats).

Trump proved to have much more significant coattails than most Democrats believed. Endangered GOP incumbents such as Sens. Pat Toomey and Ron Johnson Ronald (Ron) Harold JohnsonLindsey Graham basks in the impeachment spotlight Sunday shows — New impeachment phase dominates Rand Paul says Trump has 'every right' to withhold Ukraine aid over corruption MORE held on in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, respectively.

The only Democratic gains came in New Hampshire and Illinois, and the party now has to face a brutal 2018 calendar, where it will have to defend seats in 10 states that were won by Trump.

Bernie empowers the left

It was already apparent as 2016 dawned that Beltway pundits had underestimated Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the veteran left-winger who challenged Clinton for the Democratic nomination.

In the end, Sanders won 23 contests and more than 13 million votes. In the first battle, the Iowa caucuses, Sanders missed out by just a whisker on handing Clinton the kind of shock defeat that could have derailed her march to the nomination.

Sanders’s eventual loss to Clinton could not disguise the intensity of his appeal, especially to the Democratic grassroots.

His platform focused on income inequality and the broader idea that the system is rigged against working Americans. He promised a far more fundamental shift in politics than did Clinton — and the fact that millions of Democrats rallied to that flag is a lesson that the party establishment will ignore at its peril.

The war in Syria

The Syrian civil war ground on through its fifth full year, with the overall death toll now estimated at anywhere between 300,000 and 500,000 people.

The government of Bashar al-Assad was aided by continued splintering among the forces opposed to him, which comprise hard-line Islamists, including ISIS, more moderate forces backed by the U.S., and Kurds in the north of the country.

The fact that Assad is backed by Russia and Iran has had times seemed to bring the situation to the brink of a full-scale proxy war. President Obama has resisted calls for full-on U.S. involvement, however.

That has drawn criticism from some Republicans, including Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCainSteve Schmidt: 'Overwhelming chance that Trump will dump Pence' for Haley Lindsey Graham basks in the impeachment spotlight Sanders proposes expanded Veterans Affairs services, B to rebuild infrastructure MORE (R-Ariz.) who in October accused the Obama administration of having “no strategy” on the conflict.

Assad scored a major victory in December, when his forces defeated the rebels in eastern Aleppo, previously a rebel stronghold.

At year’s end, a tentative ceasefire was in place between pro-Assad forces and some of the rebel groups, though Islamist forces were not party of that agreement. The U.S. had not been involved in the negotiation of that ceasefire, which was brokered primarily by Russia and Turkey.

general_news,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/28/16214600/trump-police-military-sessions,"Trump’s plan to give police easier access to military weapons, explained",2017-08-28,"German Lopez, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz, Theodore Schleifer, Li Zhou, Sean Collins, Umair Irfan","The Trump administration is taking steps to ensure more police officers can equip themselves with camouflage uniforms , bayonets , and even grenade launchers .
On Monday , President Donald Trump issued an executive order reversing rules by former President Barack Obama that restricted police departments ’ ability to obtain surplus military weapons . The Obama-era restrictions curtailed programs , such as the 1033 program , that effectively let police obtain excess military gear from federal agencies for free or through federal dollars .
Obama ’ s 2015 rules were a response to protests in Ferguson , Missouri , over the police shooting of Michael Brown , in which cops used military-grade equipment to counter the protests — a move that many critics at the time considered excessive , given that the demonstrations were mostly peaceful .
The Trump administration has argued that military equipment is necessary for police to do their jobs in a safe manner . “ I am here to announce that President Trump is issuing an executive order that will make it easier to protect yourselves and your communities , ” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said at a conference by the National Fraternal Order of Police on Monday .
The Obama administration ’ s restrictions weren ’ t about making the police ’ s job more difficult . They were about changing the mentality and reputation that still surrounds law enforcement — and , ultimately , pulling back the “ us versus them ” view that can make policing far too aggressive , contributing to distrust toward law enforcement in many US communities .
Obama worried that letting cops easily wield sniper rifles , wear camouflaged heavy armor , and drive in armored vehicles that resemble tanks contributed to that “ us versus them ” mentality . But Trump apparently isn ’ t so worried , driven by a firm belief — one that isn ’ t shared by many criminologists — that very aggressive policing is necessary to stop crime in America .
On a technical level , the Obama administration changes restricted and , in some cases , banned the use of certain kinds of military equipment . The gear , from special guns to grenade launchers to armored vehicles , was available through a variety of programs by the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security — originally to help combat drug cartels and terrorists , but now widely used in standard police operations , even protest responses .
And here is a list of the restricted equipment , which under the Obama rules had more requirements — training , data collection , and approval from local officials — for police to obtain :
Even with the restrictions in place , it remained fairly easy for police to obtain the weapons . Earlier this year , the US Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) announced it had obtained roughly $ 1.2 million in military equipment by setting up a sham police department with a bogus website and physical address . As Zina Merritt of the GAO explained to the Marshall Project and Wired , “ They never did any verification , like visit our ‘ location , ’ and most of it was by email . It was like getting stuff off of Ebay . ”
On a more practical level , the Obama rules weren ’ t just about which gear is available and how it ’ s obtained . As Radley Balko , a journalist and author of Rise of the Warrior Cop : The Militarization of America ’ s Police Forces , explained on Twitter , the restrictions were about shifting how both the police and public perceive the role of law enforcement .
“ The Obama … restrictions were about telling both cops and the communities they serve : The police are public servants , not an occupying force , ” Balko wrote . “ They ’ re there to protect and serve , not to harass and intimidate . It was a modest attempt to address the ‘ us vs. them ’ mentality . ”
Indeed , the Obama administration suggested as much through a 2015 report put out by its task force on policing . It emphasized “ minimizing the appearance of a military operation ” and “ avoiding provocative tactics. ” Task force member Susan Rahr noted :
In 2012 , we began asking the question , “ Why are we training police officers like soldiers ? ” Although police officers wear uniforms and carry weapons , the similarity ends there . The missions and rules of engagement are completely different . The soldier ’ s mission is that of a warrior : to conquer . The rules of engagement are decided before the battle . The police officer ’ s mission is that of a guardian : to protect . The rules of engagement evolve as the incident unfolds . Soldiers must follow orders . Police officers must make independent decisions . Soldiers come into communities as an outside , occupying force . Guardians are members of the community , protecting from within .
The task force wanted the Obama administration to draw a clear line between police ’ s “ guardian ” role and the military ’ s “ warrior ” role . The administration figured that one way to do that was by making it more difficult for police to obtain weapons that are seen by the public as tools of warriors instead of guardians .
The Trump administration obviously disagrees , focusing on arguments that not letting the police obtain military weapons makes their jobs more dangerous . They claim that police need the gear to combat criminals , such as drug cartels and terrorists , who can be just as heavily armed .
But this is also part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to unleash the police through a 1980s-style “ tough on crime ” framework .
Earlier this year , for example , Sessions ’ s Justice Department pulled back investigations of local and state police forces . The Obama administration aggressively pursued the investigations , finding that police departments often discriminated against minority residents and using the findings to push for reforms . Without these investigations , the federal government isn ’ t going to have as much of a role in ending police misconduct and discriminatory practices .
But Sessions , who admitted in February that he hadn ’ t even read the full reports from previous federal investigations into Chicago and Ferguson police , argued that the investigations created a chilling effect among police : By shining a bright spotlight on law enforcement , the investigations led cops to fear that they might be caught inadvertently doing something wrong — and such concerns led police to pull back from proactive tactics and other “ tough on crime ” policies that , from Sessions ’ s perspective , keep communities safe .
To Sessions , then , the primary worry isn ’ t whether police are breaking the law ; it ’ s whether police are doing everything in their power to stop lawbreaking from others .
In a speech given on the 99th day of the Trump administration , Sessions said as much : “ I have directed our department to develop strategies to support the thousands of law enforcement agencies across the country that seek to prevent crime and protect the public . And I have made clear that this Department of Justice will not sign consent decrees that will cost more lives by handcuffing the police instead of criminals and stopping lawful police procedures that have been proven to reduce crime . ”
Trump , for his part , has endorsed this view . He ran on a 1980s-style “ tough on crime ” campaign in which he said police should be far more aggressive than they are today , particularly by using the controversial “ stop and frisk ” strategy that a court struck down in New York City because it was used to target minority Americans .
Sometimes the Trump administration ’ s rhetoric defies reality . In April , Sessions ’ s Justice Department argued that “ New York City continues to see gang murder after gang murder , the predictable consequence of the city 's ‘ soft on crime ’ stance. ” This has been a common criticism among the right after a court ended the unconstitutional implementation of stop and frisk .
Yet following the end of stop and frisk , New York City ’ s crime rate fell to historic lows — suggesting that such aggressive tactics aren ’ t needed to keep communities safe .
Still , the overwhelming concern for the Trump administration is restraining police in any way — which , in their view , will lead to more crime .
Police need to repair community relations to do their jobs
Criminal justice experts argue , however , that police actually need to rebuild trust from their communities if they want to effectively combat crime .
There ’ s a longstanding criminological concept at play : “ legal cynicism. ” The idea is that the government will have a much harder time enforcing the law when large segments of the population don ’ t trust the government , the police , or the laws .
This is a major explanation for why predominantly minority communities tend to have more crime than other communities : After centuries of neglect and abuse , black and brown Americans are simply much less likely to turn to police for help — and that may lead a small but significant segment of these communities to resort to its own means , including violence , to solve interpersonal conflicts .
There ’ s research to back this up . A 2016 study , from sociologists Matthew Desmond of Harvard , Andrew Papachristos of Yale , and David Kirk of Oxford , looked at 911 calls in Milwaukee after incidents of police brutality hit the news .

Trump and Sessions seem unmoved by these concerns . Driven by the firm belief that an aggressive police force and “ tough on crime ” policies are necessary to stop crime , they ’ ve taken yet another step to unleash the police in America — and given cops easier access to tank-like vehicles and grenade launchers .","The Trump administration is taking steps to ensure more police officers can equip themselves with camouflage uniforms, bayonets, and even grenade launchers.

On Monday, President Donald Trump issued an executive order reversing rules by former President Barack Obama that restricted police departments’ ability to obtain surplus military weapons. The Obama-era restrictions curtailed programs, such as the 1033 program, that effectively let police obtain excess military gear from federal agencies for free or through federal dollars.

Obama’s 2015 rules were a response to protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police shooting of Michael Brown, in which cops used military-grade equipment to counter the protests — a move that many critics at the time considered excessive, given that the demonstrations were mostly peaceful.

The Trump administration has argued that military equipment is necessary for police to do their jobs in a safe manner. “I am here to announce that President Trump is issuing an executive order that will make it easier to protect yourselves and your communities,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said at a conference by the National Fraternal Order of Police on Monday.

The Obama administration’s restrictions weren’t about making the police’s job more difficult. They were about changing the mentality and reputation that still surrounds law enforcement — and, ultimately, pulling back the “us versus them” view that can make policing far too aggressive, contributing to distrust toward law enforcement in many US communities.

Obama worried that letting cops easily wield sniper rifles, wear camouflaged heavy armor, and drive in armored vehicles that resemble tanks contributed to that “us versus them” mentality. But Trump apparently isn’t so worried, driven by a firm belief — one that isn’t shared by many criminologists — that very aggressive policing is necessary to stop crime in America.

What Obama’s restrictions did

On a technical level, the Obama administration changes restricted and, in some cases, banned the use of certain kinds of military equipment. The gear, from special guns to grenade launchers to armored vehicles, was available through a variety of programs by the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security — originally to help combat drug cartels and terrorists, but now widely used in standard police operations, even protest responses.

Here is a list of the banned gear:

And here is a list of the restricted equipment, which under the Obama rules had more requirements — training, data collection, and approval from local officials — for police to obtain:

Even with the restrictions in place, it remained fairly easy for police to obtain the weapons. Earlier this year, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) announced it had obtained roughly $1.2 million in military equipment by setting up a sham police department with a bogus website and physical address. As Zina Merritt of the GAO explained to the Marshall Project and Wired, “They never did any verification, like visit our ‘location,’ and most of it was by email. It was like getting stuff off of Ebay.”

On a more practical level, the Obama rules weren’t just about which gear is available and how it’s obtained. As Radley Balko, a journalist and author of Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America’s Police Forces, explained on Twitter, the restrictions were about shifting how both the police and public perceive the role of law enforcement.

“The Obama … restrictions were about telling both cops and the communities they serve: The police are public servants, not an occupying force,” Balko wrote. “They’re there to protect and serve, not to harass and intimidate. It was a modest attempt to address the ‘us vs. them’ mentality.”

Indeed, the Obama administration suggested as much through a 2015 report put out by its task force on policing. It emphasized “minimizing the appearance of a military operation” and “avoiding provocative tactics.” Task force member Susan Rahr noted:

In 2012, we began asking the question, “Why are we training police officers like soldiers?” Although police officers wear uniforms and carry weapons, the similarity ends there. The missions and rules of engagement are completely different. The soldier’s mission is that of a warrior: to conquer. The rules of engagement are decided before the battle. The police officer’s mission is that of a guardian: to protect. The rules of engagement evolve as the incident unfolds. Soldiers must follow orders. Police officers must make independent decisions. Soldiers come into communities as an outside, occupying force. Guardians are members of the community, protecting from within.

The task force wanted the Obama administration to draw a clear line between police’s “guardian” role and the military’s “warrior” role. The administration figured that one way to do that was by making it more difficult for police to obtain weapons that are seen by the public as tools of warriors instead of guardians.

Why Trump and Sessions are doing this

The Trump administration obviously disagrees, focusing on arguments that not letting the police obtain military weapons makes their jobs more dangerous. They claim that police need the gear to combat criminals, such as drug cartels and terrorists, who can be just as heavily armed.

But this is also part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to unleash the police through a 1980s-style “tough on crime” framework.

Earlier this year, for example, Sessions’s Justice Department pulled back investigations of local and state police forces. The Obama administration aggressively pursued the investigations, finding that police departments often discriminated against minority residents and using the findings to push for reforms. Without these investigations, the federal government isn’t going to have as much of a role in ending police misconduct and discriminatory practices.

But Sessions, who admitted in February that he hadn’t even read the full reports from previous federal investigations into Chicago and Ferguson police, argued that the investigations created a chilling effect among police: By shining a bright spotlight on law enforcement, the investigations led cops to fear that they might be caught inadvertently doing something wrong — and such concerns led police to pull back from proactive tactics and other “tough on crime” policies that, from Sessions’s perspective, keep communities safe.

To Sessions, then, the primary worry isn’t whether police are breaking the law; it’s whether police are doing everything in their power to stop lawbreaking from others.

In a speech given on the 99th day of the Trump administration, Sessions said as much: “I have directed our department to develop strategies to support the thousands of law enforcement agencies across the country that seek to prevent crime and protect the public. And I have made clear that this Department of Justice will not sign consent decrees that will cost more lives by handcuffing the police instead of criminals and stopping lawful police procedures that have been proven to reduce crime.”

Trump, for his part, has endorsed this view. He ran on a 1980s-style “tough on crime” campaign in which he said police should be far more aggressive than they are today, particularly by using the controversial “stop and frisk” strategy that a court struck down in New York City because it was used to target minority Americans.

Sometimes the Trump administration’s rhetoric defies reality. In April, Sessions’s Justice Department argued that “New York City continues to see gang murder after gang murder, the predictable consequence of the city's ‘soft on crime’ stance.” This has been a common criticism among the right after a court ended the unconstitutional implementation of stop and frisk.

Yet following the end of stop and frisk, New York City’s crime rate fell to historic lows — suggesting that such aggressive tactics aren’t needed to keep communities safe.

Still, the overwhelming concern for the Trump administration is restraining police in any way — which, in their view, will lead to more crime.

Police need to repair community relations to do their jobs

Criminal justice experts argue, however, that police actually need to rebuild trust from their communities if they want to effectively combat crime.

There’s a longstanding criminological concept at play: “legal cynicism.” The idea is that the government will have a much harder time enforcing the law when large segments of the population don’t trust the government, the police, or the laws.

This is a major explanation for why predominantly minority communities tend to have more crime than other communities: After centuries of neglect and abuse, black and brown Americans are simply much less likely to turn to police for help — and that may lead a small but significant segment of these communities to resort to its own means, including violence, to solve interpersonal conflicts.

There’s research to back this up. A 2016 study, from sociologists Matthew Desmond of Harvard, Andrew Papachristos of Yale, and David Kirk of Oxford, looked at 911 calls in Milwaukee after incidents of police brutality hit the news.

They found that after the 2004 police beating of Frank Jude, 17 percent (22,200) fewer 911 calls were made in the following year compared with the number of calls that would have been made had the Jude beating never happened. More than half of the effect came from fewer calls in black neighborhoods. And the effect persisted for more than a year, even after the officers involved in the beating were punished. Researchers found similar impacts on local 911 calls after other high-profile incidents of police violence.

But crime still happened in these neighborhoods. As 911 calls dropped, researchers also found a rise in homicides. They noted that “the spring and summer that followed Jude’s story were the deadliest in the seven years observed in our study.”

That suggests that people were simply dealing with crime themselves. And although the researchers couldn’t definitively prove it, that might mean civilians took to their own — sometimes violent — means to protect themselves when they couldn’t trust police to stop crime and violence.

“An important implication of this finding is that publicized cases of police violence not only threaten the legitimacy and reputation of law enforcement,” the researchers write, but “they also — by driving down 911 calls — thwart the suppression of law breaking, obstruct the application of justice, and ultimately make cities as a whole, and the black community in particular, less safe.”

This concept is one reason the Obama administration put an emphasis on pulling back the police’s use of military weapons. By looking like an occupying force, cops can worsen relations with their community — leading to distrust, which potentially leads to more crime and violence.

That’s why, especially in the context of racial disparities in police use of force, experts say it’s important that police own up to their mistakes and take transparent steps to fix them.

“This is what folks who rail against the focus on police violence — and pull up against that, community violence — get wrong,” David Kennedy, a criminologist at John Jay College, told me last year. “What those folks simply don’t understand is that when communities don’t trust the police and are afraid of the police, then they will not and cannot work with police and within the law around issues in their own community. And then those issues within the community become issues the community needs to deal with on their own — and that leads to violence.”

Veteran journalist Cokie Roberts , who joined an upstart NPR in 1978 and left an indelible imprint on the growing network with her coverage of Washington politics before later going to ABC News , has died . She was 75 .

Washington , DC 20036 In lieu of flowers , those who wish to further honor the memory of Cokie may do so by making a contribution to the Children 's Inn at NIH : The Children 's Inn at NIH
Roberts died Tuesday because of complications from breast cancer , according to a family statement .
A bestselling author and Emmy Award winner , Roberts was one of NPR 's most recognizable voices and is considered one of a handful of pioneering female journalists — along with Nina Totenberg , Linda Wertheimer and Susan Stamberg — who helped shape the public broadcaster 's sound and culture at a time when few women held prominent roles in journalism .
Having so many female voices at a national broadcaster was nothing short of revolutionary in the 1970s , NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson recalled in an interview with The Daily Princetonian earlier this year .
`` [ W ] e called them the Founding Mothers of NPR , or sometimes we called them the Fallopian Club , '' she said .
Liasson said it was n't so much that NPR had a mission for gender equality but that the network 's pay , which was well below the commercial networks of the day , resulted in `` a lot of really great women who were in prominent positions there and who helped other women . ''
By the time Roberts joined ABC News in 1988 — while retaining a part-time role as a political commentator at NPR that she maintained until her death — women were increasingly commonplace at broadcast networks and newspapers .
Roberts , the daughter of former U.S. representatives , grew up walking the halls of Congress and absorbing the personalities , folkways and behind-the-scenes machinations of the nation 's capital . She became a seasoned Washington insider who developed a distinctive voice as a reporter and commentator .
In a 2017 interview with Kentucky Educational Television , Roberts reflected on her long career .
`` It is such a privilege — you have a front seat to history , '' she said . `` You do get used to it , and you should n't , because it is a very special thing to be able to be in the room ... when all kinds of special things are happening . ''
Although she was the only member of her immediate family not to run for Congress , Roberts considered her role as a journalist and political analyst as her way of giving back .
`` I do feel strongly that informing the voters about what 's going on , trying to explain it in ways that people can understand , and putting the issues out there is a form of participation , '' Roberts told KET .
Political journalist George Will , who worked with Roberts on ABC 's This Week , said Roberts was not just born to the political class but was a natural inhabitant .
`` She liked people on both sides of the aisle and had friends on both sides of the aisle , '' Will told NPR . `` If you do n't like the game of politics , I do n't see how you write about it well , '' he said . `` She liked the game of politics and she understood that it was a game . ''
Born in New Orleans as Mary Martha Corinne Morrison Claiborne Boggs , she was given the nickname Cokie by her brother , Thomas , who had trouble pronouncing Corinne .
Roberts ' father was Thomas Hale Boggs Sr. , a former Democratic majority leader of the House who served in Congress for more than three decades before he disappeared on a campaign flight in Alaska in 1972 . Her mother , Lindy Claiborne Boggs , took her husband 's seat and served for 17 years . Lindy Boggs also served as U.S. ambassador to the Vatican .
Roberts split her time between Louisiana and Washington as a child and attended Wellesley College in Massachusetts . Her first job was at the Washington television station WRC-TV , where she hosted a public affairs program called Meeting of Minds .

She married journalist Steven V. Roberts in 1966 . After holding a number of other broadcast jobs , she and her husband moved in the early 1970s to Athens , Greece , where he worked for The New York Times and she filed radio stories as a freelance correspondent for CBS .
In 1977 , Roberts and her family returned to Washington , where she took a job with a then-almost unknown NPR . She served as NPR 's congressional correspondent for more than 10 years . While in that role , she was also a contributor to PBS 's The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour .
Roberts left NPR in 1988 to become a political correspondent for ABC 's World News Tonight with Peter Jennings . She was also a regular fill-in anchor for Ted Koppel on Nightline . From 1992 to 2002 , Roberts co-anchored ABC News ' Sunday morning show This Week alongside Sam Donaldson .
Will said that although Washington is a `` town of short leases , '' with people constantly coming and going , Roberts represented the permanent Washington , a kind of figure who was constant through decades of political change : `` The Washington not often denounced by people who denounce Washington because they do n't know it exists , '' Will said . `` Cokie represented the durable , ongoing Washington that is a custodian of the manners of the city and the sociability of the city that makes it really function .

Roberts won numerous awards during her long career in journalism , including three Emmys and the Edward R. Murrow award . She was inducted into the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame . She was recognized by the American Women in Radio and Television as one of the 50 greatest women in the history of broadcasting .
`` Much of Cokie Roberts ' fame and credibility resides in her image as a rough-and-trouble woman capable of giving as good as she gets in the equally rough-and-tumble world of male dominated politics , '' Dan Nimmo wrote in Political Commentators in the United States in the 20th Century .
Roberts said she would often offer this advice to younger women navigating political journalism in Washington : `` Duck and file , '' Roberts said in an interview with the Television Academy Foundation .
`` Do n't get all involved in the politics of your institution , or competition in your institution . Just do your work and get it on the air , and then people will see if you 're good , '' she said .
Roberts was the author of six books , mostly recently Capital Dames : The Civil War and the Women of Washington , 1848-1868 , which examined the role of powerful women in the Civil War era .
As a commentator , Roberts sometimes walked a line that threatened to eclipse her role as a dispassionate journalist . In a February 2016 op-ed co-authored with her husband , they called on `` the rational wing '' of the Republican Party to stop the nomination of Donald Trump .
`` [ Trump ] is one of the least qualified candidates ever to make a serious run for the presidency , '' Roberts and her husband wrote . `` If he is nominated by a major party — let alone elected — the reputation of the United States would suffer a devastating blow around the world . ''
In interviews , Roberts often said she might have run for public office herself but thought she would spare her journalist husband the difficulty of what could be an awkward dynamic .
`` I have always felt semi-guilty about it . But I 've sort of assuaged my guilt by writing about it and feeling like I 'm educating people about the government and how to be good voters and good citizens , '' Roberts told The Washington Post in March .
`` In covering Congress , there 's plenty of times when I felt , you know , the mother line : I do n't care who started it , I 'm stopping it . So , to be in a position where you could do that , '' Roberts told the newspaper .
`` It 's a great luxury to sit on the outside and analyze , or even give your opinion about how it could be fixed , '' she said .

Roberts died Tuesday because of complications from breast cancer, according to a family statement.

A bestselling author and Emmy Award winner, Roberts was one of NPR's most recognizable voices and is considered one of a handful of pioneering female journalists — along with Nina Totenberg, Linda Wertheimer and Susan Stamberg — who helped shape the public broadcaster's sound and culture at a time when few women held prominent roles in journalism.

Having so many female voices at a national broadcaster was nothing short of revolutionary in the 1970s, NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson recalled in an interview with The Daily Princetonian earlier this year.

""[W]e called them the Founding Mothers of NPR, or sometimes we called them the Fallopian Club,"" she said.

Liasson said it wasn't so much that NPR had a mission for gender equality but that the network's pay, which was well below the commercial networks of the day, resulted in ""a lot of really great women who were in prominent positions there and who helped other women.""

By the time Roberts joined ABC News in 1988 — while retaining a part-time role as a political commentator at NPR that she maintained until her death — women were increasingly commonplace at broadcast networks and newspapers.

Roberts, the daughter of former U.S. representatives, grew up walking the halls of Congress and absorbing the personalities, folkways and behind-the-scenes machinations of the nation's capital. She became a seasoned Washington insider who developed a distinctive voice as a reporter and commentator.

In a 2017 interview with Kentucky Educational Television, Roberts reflected on her long career.

""It is such a privilege — you have a front seat to history,"" she said. ""You do get used to it, and you shouldn't, because it is a very special thing to be able to be in the room ... when all kinds of special things are happening.""

Although she was the only member of her immediate family not to run for Congress, Roberts considered her role as a journalist and political analyst as her way of giving back.

""I do feel strongly that informing the voters about what's going on, trying to explain it in ways that people can understand, and putting the issues out there is a form of participation,"" Roberts told KET.

Political journalist George Will, who worked with Roberts on ABC's This Week, said Roberts was not just born to the political class but was a natural inhabitant.

""She liked people on both sides of the aisle and had friends on both sides of the aisle,"" Will told NPR. ""If you don't like the game of politics, I don't see how you write about it well,"" he said. ""She liked the game of politics and she understood that it was a game.""

Born in New Orleans as Mary Martha Corinne Morrison Claiborne Boggs, she was given the nickname Cokie by her brother, Thomas, who had trouble pronouncing Corinne.

Roberts' father was Thomas Hale Boggs Sr., a former Democratic majority leader of the House who served in Congress for more than three decades before he disappeared on a campaign flight in Alaska in 1972. Her mother, Lindy Claiborne Boggs, took her husband's seat and served for 17 years. Lindy Boggs also served as U.S. ambassador to the Vatican.

Roberts split her time between Louisiana and Washington as a child and attended Wellesley College in Massachusetts. Her first job was at the Washington television station WRC-TV, where she hosted a public affairs program called Meeting of Minds.

She married journalist Steven V. Roberts in 1966. After holding a number of other broadcast jobs, she and her husband moved in the early 1970s to Athens, Greece, where he worked for The New York Times and she filed radio stories as a freelance correspondent for CBS.

In 1977, Roberts and her family returned to Washington, where she took a job with a then-almost unknown NPR. She served as NPR's congressional correspondent for more than 10 years. While in that role, she was also a contributor to PBS's The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour.

Roberts left NPR in 1988 to become a political correspondent for ABC's World News Tonight with Peter Jennings. She was also a regular fill-in anchor for Ted Koppel on Nightline. From 1992 to 2002, Roberts co-anchored ABC News' Sunday morning show This Week alongside Sam Donaldson.

Will said that although Washington is a ""town of short leases,"" with people constantly coming and going, Roberts represented the permanent Washington, a kind of figure who was constant through decades of political change: ""The Washington not often denounced by people who denounce Washington because they don't know it exists,"" Will said. ""Cokie represented the durable, ongoing Washington that is a custodian of the manners of the city and the sociability of the city that makes it really function.""

Roberts won numerous awards during her long career in journalism, including three Emmys and the Edward R. Murrow award. She was inducted into the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame. She was recognized by the American Women in Radio and Television as one of the 50 greatest women in the history of broadcasting.

""Much of Cokie Roberts' fame and credibility resides in her image as a rough-and-trouble woman capable of giving as good as she gets in the equally rough-and-tumble world of male dominated politics,"" Dan Nimmo wrote in Political Commentators in the United States in the 20th Century.

Roberts said she would often offer this advice to younger women navigating political journalism in Washington: ""Duck and file,"" Roberts said in an interview with the Television Academy Foundation.

""Don't get all involved in the politics of your institution, or competition in your institution. Just do your work and get it on the air, and then people will see if you're good,"" she said.

Roberts was the author of six books, mostly recently Capital Dames: The Civil War and the Women of Washington, 1848-1868, which examined the role of powerful women in the Civil War era.

As a commentator, Roberts sometimes walked a line that threatened to eclipse her role as a dispassionate journalist. In a February 2016 op-ed co-authored with her husband, they called on ""the rational wing"" of the Republican Party to stop the nomination of Donald Trump.

""[Trump] is one of the least qualified candidates ever to make a serious run for the presidency,"" Roberts and her husband wrote. ""If he is nominated by a major party — let alone elected — the reputation of the United States would suffer a devastating blow around the world.""

In interviews, Roberts often said she might have run for public office herself but thought she would spare her journalist husband the difficulty of what could be an awkward dynamic.

""I have always felt semi-guilty about it. But I've sort of assuaged my guilt by writing about it and feeling like I'm educating people about the government and how to be good voters and good citizens,"" Roberts told The Washington Post in March.

""In covering Congress, there's plenty of times when I felt, you know, the mother line: I don't care who started it, I'm stopping it. So, to be in a position where you could do that,"" Roberts told the newspaper.

""It's a great luxury to sit on the outside and analyze, or even give your opinion about how it could be fixed,"" she said.

In a statement Tuesday, former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama called Roberts ""a constant over forty years of a shifting media landscape and changing world, informing voters about the issues of our time and mentoring young journalists every step of the way.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Roberts' death was ""a great official loss for our nation and a deep personal loss for all who were blessed to call Cokie a friend.""

""Cokie Roberts was a trailblazer who forever transformed the role of women in the newsroom and in our history books,"" Pelosi said in a statement.

Roberts is survived by her husband of 53 years; her two children, Lee Roberts and Rebecca Roberts; and six grandchildren.

The anti-government occupation , which began on Saturday at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge , 30 miles ( 50 km ) south of the small town of Burns , was the latest skirmish over federal land management in large tracts of the West .

• Roughly 26 million people live in areas that are under a hurricane or tropical storm warning or watch, and the hurricane will likely cause billions of dollars in damage, CNN Weather's Dave Hennen said. The National Weather Service warned that some places could be uninhabitable for ""weeks or months.""

• The storm has killed at least 269 people in three Caribbean countries. The majority, 264 people, died in Haiti, said Civil Protection Service spokesman Joseph Edgard Celestin.

• Based on the latest projections , Matthew could make landfall in Florida as a Category 4 storm, or it could skirt the coast and head north before possibly heading back toward land.

Florida braces for direct hit

Scott told Floridians on the state's Atlantic coast that the question is not whether they will lose power, but for how long. More than 95,000 customers were without power throughout the state, according to the governor.

A direct hit by Matthew, he said, could lead to ""massive destruction"" on a level unseen since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Voluntary and mandatory evacuations in the state stretch from Miami to the Florida-Georgia border.

At least two counties are under curfew until 7 a.m. Saturday, officials announced. Orange and Volusia Counties on Thursday night instituted mandatory curfews. The curfews include Orlando and Daytona Beach.

People who stayed behind stocked up on supplies and boarded up windows, as there were numerous reports of county governments, schools, cruise lines and amusement parks closing. Many residents found long gas lines. But so far, the state isn't running short on supplies, Scott said.

Daytona Beach residents fill sandbags Thursday.

Airline passengers were urged to call before leaving for the airport. Florida airports had canceled hundreds of flights, most of them in Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Orlando. Fort Lauderdale closed its airport, airlines suspended operations in Miami, and Orlando's airport was slated to close at 8 p.m. Thursday, airport officials said.

Palm Beach residents cleared many grocery store shelves ahead of the storm. Yet despite all the warnings, West Palm Beach Mayor Jeri Muoio said not everyone is listening, even with mandatory evacuation orders in place.

""More people are staying than leaving. It's very concerning. When the winds really pick up, we will not be sending (emergency responders) out,"" she said.

With the eye of Hurricane Matthew pushing north, Miami-Dade County will restart some services, including public transit, on Friday morning, Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez announced.

The mayor said evacuation shelters would close Friday.

'Hurricane party inside'

In Daytona Beach, Mayor Derrick Henry urged residents against being emboldened by years without a direct hit from a hurricane.

Even so, CNN found Daniel Myara, who has lived in the city for 25 years, barricading his business, Cruisin Cafe, with plywood and screws.

He's not going anywhere. In fact, a sign outside declares his bar open: ""Honk for hurricane party inside.""

He's been working for three days and in that time has seen the price for a sheet of plywood jump from $15 to $40, he said.

Cocoa Beach resident David Daley told CNN affiliate WKMG he felt safe in his condominium.

""I wanted to get a bird's-eye view of the action and maybe see the pier one last time and get some before and after shots,"" Daley told the station. ""I'm not worried; I am being realistic... I live in a solid concrete condo. I'm pretty secure.""

Mandatory evacuations in South Carolina

Cars packed highways in South Carolina, where officials gave mandatory evacuation orders for several counties.

Close to half a million people were expected to have evacuated by Thursday, said Kim Stenson, director of South Carolina Emergency Management.

The South Carolina Department of Transportation changed the directions of eastbound traffic lanes to accommodate the exodus of people leaving coastal cities like Charleston.

As thousands fled inland, some people said they were staying put. Charleston residents boarded up businesses and prepared to hunker down.

Georgia governor: 'Remain calm, be prepared'

Gov. Nathan Deal has declared a state of emergency in 30 counties near the coast and ordered evacuations for all counties east of Interstate 95.

Of special concern is Tybee Island, a low-lying island east of Savannah, which is also under mandatory evacuation orders. ""Remain calm, be prepared and make informed, responsible decisions,"" Deal said.

In Savannah, Mayor Eddie DeLoach warned those who stay that they'd be on their own.

""If you decide to ride it out, do not expect us to be there to help you. We will not risk the lives of our emergency responders to save those who refused to heed this evacuation call,"" he said in a statement.

Atlanta Motor Speedway, which hosts NASCAR races, tweeted that evacuees could set up in its campground.

general_news,Breitbart News,2,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/05/30/transgender-girl-wins-kenosha-court-case/,"Judges Say Parents, School Officials Must Obey ‘Transgender’ Teenager",2017-05-30,Neil Munro,"The federal constitution requires that school officials submit to the demands of a teenage girl who wants to change her sex to become a boy , says a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit .
The judges say that Kenosha Unified School District violated federal law and the Constitution because the teenager ’ s “ gender identity ” as a “ transgender boy ” is more important than the popular laws , civic customs and scientific consensus which recognize that girls and boys , men and women , are biologically and socially different even as they are also complementary and legally equal .
The court ’ s ruling in Whitaker v. Kenosha likely will be sent to the U.S. Supreme Court , which will likely decide in 2018 whether the new idea of “ gender identity ” will replace society ’ s distinctions between girls and boys , and between men and women .
Throughout the judges ’ 35-page , May 3o decision , the judges fully accepted the claim by the girl ’ s lawyers that people can change from male to female and back again by changing their “ gender identity ” and declaring themselves to be “ transgender . ”
So the three progressive judges also dismissed as “ sheer conjecture ” the concerns by school officials that the privacy of many teenagers and children would be compromised if they are forced to share bathrooms and shower rooms with opposite-sex teenagers . The judges also confidentially insisted that “ Ash , ” the teenage girl –who is not an adult — has “ well-documented ” concerns that her mental health would be damaged if school officials did not validate her claim to be a boy .
The judges ’ concern for the teenager ’ s immediate well-being did not also include any concern about the girl ’ s decision to irreparably harm her body and her well-being with drugs , hormones , and surgery while trying to live as a member of the opposite sex in a society where very few people want romantic or sexual relationships with transsexuals .
Instead , the judges fully supported the young girl ’ s high-risk decision by offering several skilled legal arguments about why society should defer to the far-reaching demands described by her lawyers at the Transgender Law Center , headquartered in Oakland , Calif. For example , the judges argued that the law supports the girl ’ s claim because other judges say it does :
Title IX [ of federal law ] provides that no person “ shall , on the basis of sex , be excluded from participation in , be denied the benefits of , or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance… . [ But ] the Sixth Circuit noted that Price Waterhouse established that the prohibition on sex discrimination “ encompasses both the biological differences between men and women , and gender discrimination , that is , discrimination based on a failure to conform to stereotypical gender norms .
The Title IX laws were written by Congress to reduce discrimination against members of both sexes . But the law can be changed , said the judges , because Congress did not explicitly say the laws do not cover people who want to change their sex :
… the School District argues that this [ Title IX ] reasoning flies in the face of Title IX , as Congress has not explicitly added transgender status as a protected characteristic to either Title VII or Title IX [ anti-discrimination laws ] , despite having opportunities to do so . … [ But in another lawsuit ] The Supreme Court has rejected this argument , stating that congressional inaction “ lacks persuasive significance because several equally tenable inferences may be drawn from such inaction , including the inference that the existing legislation already incorporated the offered change. ” … Therefore , Congressional inaction is not determinative .
Wisconsin ’ s law plainly says that school officials must treat children according to their legal sex . In response , the judges described the state law as really complicated , and different from other states ’ laws , so the girl gets the benefit of the just-created doubt :
while it is true that in Wisconsin an individual may only change his or her designated sex on a birth certificate after completing a surgical reassignment … this is not universally the case . For example , as Ash ’ s counsel pointed out during oral argument , in Minnesota , an individual may amend his or her birth certificate to reflect his or her gender identity without surgical reassignment … Therefore , a student who is born in Minnesota and begins his transition there , obtaining a modified birth certificate as part of the process , could move to Kenosha and be permitted to use the boys ’ restroom in one of the School District ’ s schools even though he retains female anatomy .
The school must comply with the girl ’ s choice because other schoolkids did not start a political movement to protest the girl ’ s choice , say the judges :
Ash used the bathroom for nearly six months without incident . The School District has not produced any evidence that any students have ever complained about Ash ’ s presence in the boys ’ restroom .
But numerous polls show the public wants to preserve legal and social distinctions between the two equal and complementary sexes , such as single-sex bathrooms and single-sex sports leagues . So the judges just steal several bases by insisting — but not explaining why or how — that a person ’ s personal choice of their “ gender identity ” determines their legal sex much more than the nature of their male or female body . That redefinition of “ sex ” into “ gender ” allows the judges to claim that distinctions between boys and girls will be protected if boys who have the gender identity of boys are forced to share bathrooms with the girl who says she has the “ gender identity ” of a boy , regardless of the plausibility and permanence of the girl ’ s claim :
Although the School District argues that implementing an inclusive policy will result in the demise of gender‐segregated facilities in schools , the amici note that this has not been the case . In fact , these administrators have found that allowing transgender students to use facilities that align with their gender identity has actually reinforced the concept of separate facilities for boys and girls .
But the judges are also happy to drop the “ gender ” term and instead use “ sex ” when it suits their purposes . So they say the schools ’ effort to protect the privacy of kids is related to sex , and is therefore in violation of a 1996 Supreme Court decision about sex — not gender . That case was written by progressive Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who declared that only “ exceedingly persuasive ” claims can survive claims of sex discrimination :
the School District argues that since it treats all boys and girls the same , it does not violate the Equal Protection Clause . This is untrue . Rather , the School District treats transgender students like Ash , who fail to conform to the sex‐based stereotypes associated with their assigned sex at birth , differently . These students are disciplined under the School District ’ s bathroom policy if they choose to use a bathroom that conforms to their gender identity . This places the burden on the School District to demonstrate that its justification for its bathroom policy is not only genuine , but also “ exceedingly persuasive ” … This burden has not been met here .
What all of this means is that the three judges wanted to write a decision that fully supports the “ gender identity ” ideology , no matter how much harm it causes to children , teenagers , adults , civic society , democracy , and the law . If the judges had opposed the ideology — which could destroy all single-sex institutions , such as women ’ s sports leagues or women ’ s shelters — they would have found an argument to gently reject the girl ’ s claims , and told her to graduate high school in a few days without having gotten her courtroom victory over the school principal .
If the judges had opposed the gender ideology — whose advocates wish to destroy all single-sex institutions , such as women ’ s bathrooms , sports leagues or shelters — they would have found an argument to gently reject the girl ’ s claims , and told her to graduate high school without having gotten her courtroom victory over the school principal .
But the ideology is far more aggressive than a 17-year-old girl . Far example , even though far fewer than one percent of Americans try to live as members of the opposite sex , the gender-identity push has attacked the nation ’ s long-standing social rules for single-sex bathrooms and shelters for battered women , sports leagues for girls , hiking groups for boys , K-12 curricula and university speech codes , religious freedoms , free speech , the social status of women , parents ’ rights in childrearing , practices to help teenagers , women ’ s expectations of beauty , culture and civic society , scientific research , prison safety , civic ceremonies , school rules , men ’ s sense of masculinity , law enforcement , and children ’ s sexual privacy .
Polls and surveys show this transgender ideology has some sympathy from roughly one-quarter of Americans , but former President Obama has admitted twice that his push for “ transgender rights ” hurt Hillary Clinton ’ s 2016 race .","The federal constitution requires that school officials submit to the demands of a teenage girl who wants to change her sex to become a boy, says a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.

The judges say that Kenosha Unified School District violated federal law and the Constitution because the teenager’s “gender identity” as a “transgender boy” is more important than the popular laws, civic customs and scientific consensus which recognize that girls and boys, men and women, are biologically and socially different even as they are also complementary and legally equal.

The court’s ruling in Whitaker v. Kenosha likely will be sent to the U.S. Supreme Court, which will likely decide in 2018 whether the new idea of “gender identity” will replace society’s distinctions between girls and boys, and between men and women.

Throughout the judges’ 35-page, May 3o decision, the judges fully accepted the claim by the girl’s lawyers that people can change from male to female and back again by changing their “gender identity” and declaring themselves to be “transgender.”

So the three progressive judges also dismissed as “sheer conjecture” the concerns by school officials that the privacy of many teenagers and children would be compromised if they are forced to share bathrooms and shower rooms with opposite-sex teenagers. The judges also confidentially insisted that “Ash,” the teenage girl –who is not an adult — has “well-documented” concerns that her mental health would be damaged if school officials did not validate her claim to be a boy.

The judges’ concern for the teenager’s immediate well-being did not also include any concern about the girl’s decision to irreparably harm her body and her well-being with drugs, hormones, and surgery while trying to live as a member of the opposite sex in a society where very few people want romantic or sexual relationships with transsexuals.

Instead, the judges fully supported the young girl’s high-risk decision by offering several skilled legal arguments about why society should defer to the far-reaching demands described by her lawyers at the Transgender Law Center, headquartered in Oakland, Calif. For example, the judges argued that the law supports the girl’s claim because other judges say it does:

Title IX [of federal law] provides that no person “shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance…. [But] the Sixth Circuit noted that Price Waterhouse established that the prohibition on sex discrimination “encompasses both the biological differences between men and women, and gender discrimination, that is, discrimination based on a failure to conform to stereotypical gender norms.

The Title IX laws were written by Congress to reduce discrimination against members of both sexes. But the law can be changed, said the judges, because Congress did not explicitly say the laws do not cover people who want to change their sex:

… the School District argues that this [Title IX] reasoning flies in the face of Title IX, as Congress has not explicitly added transgender status as a protected characteristic to either Title VII or Title IX [anti-discrimination laws], despite having opportunities to do so. … [But in another lawsuit] The Supreme Court has rejected this argument, stating that congressional inaction “lacks persuasive significance because several equally tenable inferences may be drawn from such inaction, including the inference that the existing legislation already incorporated the offered change.” … Therefore, Congressional inaction is not determinative.

Doesn’t “lash out” suggest you’re striking the first blow?

Segal: Millennials are saddled with student loan debt for colleges with skyrocketing costs

Exploitative unpaid internships only way to work in your field, he says. Why work for free?

Segal: Faith in government falling, but millennials cannot stand on the sidelines

There is a Washington adage that if you don't help write the menu, you might end up on it. And make no mistake: The classes of 2014 that walked across graduation stages recently just provided more young people available to be served for lunch.

Despite positive news about America's reduced 6.3% unemployment rate in April, it turns out the jobless rate for 18- to 29-year-olds is 9.1%. If you include ""discouraged workers,"" or those who have given up looking for work, unemployment for 18- to 29-year-olds is 15.5% . The unemployment rate for young African-Americans is even worse: 16.6%, and if you add discouraged workers, it's a whopping 23.3%.

Matthew Segal

With job opportunities scarce, employers feel little pressure to raise wages. Unpaid internships are pervasive, and the allure of ""experience"" in their chosen field is enough to entice eager young people to work for free, unless their parents can't afford to subsidize them. Those young people must either accumulate additional debt while working unpaid internships or look toward minimum wage positions, which are becoming more the norm, and less the teenage avocation to score some extra cash.

Pistorius ' defense team told Sky News that he would likely serve 10 months , or one-sixth of the term handed down by Judge Thokozile Masipa , before being released to serve the remaining time under house arrest . However , a spokesman for South Africa 's National Prosecuting Authority said that the man once known as `` The Blade Runner '' would likely serve 20 months behind bars , before stating that such matters were `` not for the NPA to decide . ''
Judge Masipa also handed the double-amputee a three-year suspended sentence on a firearms charge . She ordered that sentence to be wholly suspended for five years on condition that Pistorius is not found guilty of another firearm offense .
Masipa last month convicted Pistorius of culpable homicide , but acquitted him of murder after he testified he mistook Steenkamp for a nighttime intruder .
Masipa based the sentence on what she called the `` gross negligence '' of Pistorius , who shot Reeva Steenkamp multiple times through a toilet cubicle door in his home early on the morning of Feb. 14 , 2013 . Pistorius had testified that the shooting was an accident because he mistook his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder .
`` The following is what I consider is a sentence that is fair and just both to society and the accused , '' Masipa said as she announced her decision .
She asked Pistorius to stand as she delivered the sentence , and the world-famous disabled runner faced her with his hands clasped in front of him . Pistorius then left the Pretoria courtroom down a flight of stairs that lead to holding cells . His sentence starts immediately and he was taken straight to the cells , a spokesman for the NPA told The Associated Press .
`` Having regard to the circumstances in the matter , I am of the view that a non-custodial sentence would send the wrong message to the community , '' Masipa said . `` On the other hand , a long sentence would also not be appropriate either , as it would lack the element of mercy .
`` What may appear to be justice to the general public may not be justice . Society can not always get what they want . ''
Steenkamp 's mother , June , told Sky News that the sentence provided a measure of closure , but added that full closure was not possible `` unless you can magic her back '' .
Nathi Mncube , the prosecution spokesman , said his office is disappointed in the culpable homicide conviction and has not yet decided whether to appeal the sentence .
`` We have not made up our minds whether we 're going to appeal it or not , '' he said . He added that there was an `` appetite '' to appeal but that prosecutors have 14 days to review their options .
`` We are satisfied with the fact that he will be serving some time in prison , '' he said .
He said he thought the South African public would be satisfied because their justice system had been shown to be `` functional . ''
`` It 's not only about vengeance but it is about making sure that there is a fair and just process , '' he said .
Masipa had a range of options for Pistorius ' punishment . She could have issued a suspended sentence and a fine , meaning Pistorius would not have gone to jail . She could also have ordered him to go under house arrest or she could have sent him to prison for up to 15 years .
Pistorius ' lawyers had argued for a three-year period of correctional supervision , where the runner would have been under house arrest . Prosecutors asked the judge to send him to prison for at least 10 years .
The courtroom was packed , reflecting heightened media and public interest ahead of the sentencing . Police officers stood guard in the aisles .
Before proceedings started , Dr. Lore Hartzenberg , a psychologist , held Pistorius ' hand and spoke softly to him . Hartzenberg had testified for the defense that Pistorius was a `` broken man '' after killing his girlfriend and had suffered emotionally and financially .
`` I just wanted to bestow a little bit of inner happiness on Oscar , '' said the supporter , who added that she thought he had lost a lot of self-respect .

Lakeisha N. Holloway appeared “ stoic ” when cops encountered her soon after the 1996 Oldsmobile sedan she was driving plowed into a crowd on the Las Vegas Strip multiple times – all while a young child was sitting in the backseat .
“ She didn ’ t appear to be distressed due to her actions , ” Sheriff Joe Lombardo said during a Monday news conference .
Holloway was booked Monday on charges including murder , first-degree child abuse or neglect and failing to stop at the scene of an accident , according to Clark County Detention Center records .
Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said he anticipated also filing numerous counts of attempted murder . The charge of fleeing the scene is a felony and , as of Oct. 1 , is a non-probationable offense .
Authorities said Sunday they “ know this was not an act of terrorism , ” though Lombardo did leave some wiggle room on Monday .
“ As of now we do not believe it to be an act of terrorism , ” he said , noting that officials were not “ 100 percent ruling out the possibility ” and are working with the FBI .
“ The act is going to be very hard to explain at face value , ” said Lombardo , who reiterated that whatever the ultimate classification , cops believe the carnage was “ an intentional act . ”
Lombardo also suggested a falling out with the child ’ s father could be a possible motive , though he said authorities believed the father was living in Dallas .
“ At some point we believe she was attempting to make her way that direction through Las Vegas , ” Lombardo said .
But Holloway never made it out of the city following a horrific scene on the Strip that she ’ s accused of creating .
The driver “ went up and off these streets , two or possible three times , ” Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Lt. Dan McGrath said . The suspect then allegedly drove off before being apprehended outside the Tuscany Casino . After Holloway pulled into the casino lot , Lombardo said , she left her child in the car , approached a valet and told him “ she ran over some individuals on Las Vegas Boulevard . ”
Holloway did not demonstrate signs of being under the influence of alcohol , Lombardo said , though a police expert believed she was under the influence of “ some sort of stimulant. ” Results of a blood test are pending .
Part of the reason Lombardo said he can ’ t discount terrorism as a motive is Holloway ’ s murky background . Investigators believe she ’ s originally from the Oregon area , but otherwise have hit roadblocks .
Holloway was convicted of operating a vehicle without driving privileges and driving uninsured in December 2011 , according to Oregon court records obtained by oregonlive.com .
A woman named Lakeisha Holloway , and fitting the description of the woman booked in Las Vegas , was profiled in an Oregon paper , The Skanner , in 2012 after she won a CARE Role Model award . That article details Holloway ’ s struggles in high school , including being homeless during her freshman year . Holloway also described her mother ’ s battles with alcohol .

Lakeisha N. Holloway appeared “stoic” when cops encountered her soon after the 1996 Oldsmobile sedan she was driving plowed into a crowd on the Las Vegas Strip multiple times – all while a young child was sitting in the backseat.

“She didn’t appear to be distressed due to her actions,” Sheriff Joe Lombardo said during a Monday news conference.

Holloway was booked Monday on charges including murder, first-degree child abuse or neglect and failing to stop at the scene of an accident, according to Clark County Detention Center records.

Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said he anticipated also filing numerous counts of attempted murder. The charge of fleeing the scene is a felony and, as of Oct. 1, is a non-probationable offense.

He said seeking the death penalty was “a consideration.”

Authorities said Sunday they “know this was not an act of terrorism,” though Lombardo did leave some wiggle room on Monday.

“As of now we do not believe it to be an act of terrorism,” he said, noting that officials were not “100 percent ruling out the possibility” and are working with the FBI.

“The act is going to be very hard to explain at face value,” said Lombardo, who reiterated that whatever the ultimate classification, cops believe the carnage was “an intentional act.”

Lombardo also suggested a falling out with the child’s father could be a possible motive, though he said authorities believed the father was living in Dallas.

“At some point we believe she was attempting to make her way that direction through Las Vegas,” Lombardo said.

But Holloway never made it out of the city following a horrific scene on the Strip that she’s accused of creating.

The driver “went up and off these streets, two or possible three times,” Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Lt. Dan McGrath said. The suspect then allegedly drove off before being apprehended outside the Tuscany Casino. After Holloway pulled into the casino lot, Lombardo said, she left her child in the car, approached a valet and told him “she ran over some individuals on Las Vegas Boulevard.”

Holloway did not demonstrate signs of being under the influence of alcohol, Lombardo said, though a police expert believed she was under the influence of “some sort of stimulant.” Results of a blood test are pending.

Part of the reason Lombardo said he can’t discount terrorism as a motive is Holloway’s murky background. Investigators believe she’s originally from the Oregon area, but otherwise have hit roadblocks.

Holloway was convicted of operating a vehicle without driving privileges and driving uninsured in December 2011, according to Oregon court records obtained by oregonlive.com.

A woman named Lakeisha Holloway, and fitting the description of the woman booked in Las Vegas, was profiled in an Oregon paper, The Skanner, in 2012 after she won a CARE Role Model award. That article details Holloway’s struggles in high school, including being homeless during her freshman year. Holloway also described her mother’s battles with alcohol. The Skanner piece noted that Halloway wanted to pursue a career in forestry service.

A Facebook page for a woman believed to be Halloway shows images of a newborn daughter in 2012 and a photo of the Paris Hotel & Casino in October 2012 – more than three years before she’s suspected of driving into a crowd of people outside that structure with that child in the vehicle.

President Trump defended the idea of buying Greenland — derided by critics within the United States and rejected by Denmark, which controls it — in part by saying the idea first came from President Harry Truman.

Is that so?

The short answer:

Yes — but it's complicated.

The long answer:

Trump's acknowledgment that he really has been talking about the United States buying Greenland — and that he was offended when Denmark's prime minister called the idea ""absurd"" — were the jaw-dropping coda from an Aug. 16 report in The Wall Street Journal.

The newspaper reported that the Greenland idea has been a pet project of Trump's for some time. Once it broke into the open, Trump not only owned up to the idea, but said he was wounded when Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen rejected it as beneath consideration.

""I thought the prime minister's statement ... was nasty,"" Trump said on Wednesday. ""It was not a nice way of doing it. She could have just said 'no, we'd rather not do it' ... they can't say 'how absurd.' ""

Trump sought to make the case that his plan to buy Greenland was not, in fact, absurd, because he wasn't the first to come up with the idea.

The administration of President Harry Truman pitched a sale to Copenhagen in 1946, in a story told in documents contained in the National Archives and revealed in 1991 by The Associated Press.

But the Truman administration did so under Cold War secrecy and no one learned about it for decades. There was no open bid and rejection as with Trump's attempt.

From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic

The situation in Truman's time also was very different for other reasons.

A dangerous chill was settling between the United States and the Soviet Union following the conclusion of war in Europe. Truman and his Soviet counterparts were arranging pieces on a strategic chessboard for what would become the Cold War.

That's why, according to the AP's account of the National Archives papers, Truman's advisers prized the geographic advantage Greenland could afford to defend against Soviet strategic bombers that might fly over the Arctic Circle toward targets in North America.

The United States opened negotiations with Denmark about using Greenland, and at one point, the American side proposed buying the island outright for $100 million in gold and the rights to a patch of Alaskan oil.

All this took place in confidence but even then — as now — the idea shocked the Danes. Here's how the AP's W. Dale Nelson described the National Archive documents' account of the exchange:

Ultimately, the U.S. and Danish governments agreed on other ways to incorporate Greenland into America's defenses.

Washington's use of global diplomacy was able to get the access the Truman administration wanted without an outright sale, and Greenland remains a self-governing overseas territory of Denmark.

NATO, Project Iceworm and the Thule Monitor

One milestone was the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949, in which the United States and Denmark were founding allies. NATO's goal was for Western European countries to stand together with the United States against the Soviet Union; an attack on one would be considered an attack on them all.

Another was with bilateral agreements between the United States and Denmark over access to Greenland.

In the 1960s, the U.S. Army explored using glacial ice on the island as the base for strategic missiles aimed at the Soviet Union.

Although it ultimately didn't deploy any missiles, the Army did build a top secret, nuclear-powered base on the ice pack as part of that project. The base, Camp Century, was abandoned and sank and one day it could be in danger of being exposed by melting ice.

Strategic Air Command also used Thule Air Base, on the northwest side of the island, as an important outpost in the strategic contest with the Soviets.

A quarter of a century ago , the curtain was lowered on the 75-year experiment in “ building socialism ” in the country where it all began following the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia , led by Vladimir Lenin in November 1917 .
Some historians have estimated that as many as 200 million people worldwide may have died as part of the 20th century dream of creating a collectivist “ paradise on earth. ” The attempt to establish a comprehensive socialist system in many parts of the world over the last 100 years has been one of the cruelest and most brutal episodes in human history . Making a new “ better world ” was taken to mean the extermination , liquidation , and mass murder of all those who the socialist revolutionary leaders declared to be “ class enemies , ” including the families and even the children of “ enemies of the people . ”
The evil of the Soviet system is that it was cruelty for a purpose . It has been calculated by Russian and Western historians who had limited access to the secret archives of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the KGB ( the Soviet secret police ) in the 1990s that as many as 68 million innocent , unarmed men , women , and children may have been killed in Soviet Russia alone over those nearly 75 years of communist rule in the Soviet Union .
A purpose . To make a new Soviet man and a new Soviet society . This required the destruction of everything that had gone before and entailed the forced creation of a new civilization , as conjured up in the minds of those who had appointed themselves the creators of this brave new world .
In the minds of those like Felix Dzerzhinsky , Lenin ’ s close associate and founder of the Soviet secret police , violence was an act of love . So much did they love the vision of the blissful communist future to come that they were willing to sacrifice all the traditional conceptions of humanity and morality to bring their utopia to fruition .
Thus , in a publication issued in 1919 by the newly formed Soviet secret police , the Cheka ( later the NKVD and then the KGB ) , it was proclaimed :
We reject the old systems of morality and ‘ humanity ’ invented by the bourgeoisie to oppress and exploit the ‘ lower classes. ’ Our morality has no precedent , and our humanity is absolute because it rests on a new ideal . Our aim is to destroy all forms of oppression and violence . To so , everything is permitted , for we are the first to raise the sword not to oppress races and reduce them to slavery , but to liberate humanity from its shackles … Blood ? Let blood flow like water ! Let blood stain forever the black pirate ’ s flag flown by the bourgeoisie , and let our flag be blood-red forever ! For only through the death of the old world can we liberate ourselves from the return of those jackals .
The famous sociologist Pitirim A. Sorokin was a young professor in Petrograd ( later Leningrad , and now St. Petersburg ) in 1920 , as the Russian Civil War that firmly established communist rule in Russia was coming to its end . He kept an account of daily life during those years , which he published many years later under the title Leaves from a Russian Diary – and Thirty Years After ( 1950 ) .
The machine of the Red Terror works incessantly . Every day and every night , in Petrograd , Moscow , and all over the country the mountain of the dead grows higher … Everywhere people are shot , mutilated , wiped out of existence … Every night we hear the rattle of trucks bearing new victims . Every night we hear the rifle fire of executions , and often some of us hear from the ditches , where the bodies are flung , faint groans and cries of those who did not die at once under the guns . People living near these places begin to move away . They can not sleep … Getting up in the morning , no man or woman knows whether he will be free that night . Leaving one ’ s home , one never knows whether he will return . Sometimes a neighborhood is surrounded and everyone caught out of his house without a certificate is arrested … Life these days depends entirely on luck .
This murderous madness never ended . In the 1930s , during the time of the Great Purges instituted by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin to wipe out all “ enemies of the revolution ” through mass executions , millions were sent to the Gulag prisons that stretched across all of the Soviet Union to be worked to death as slave labor to “ build socialism . ”
Before being sent to their deaths or to the forced labor camps , tens of thousands would be interrogated and cruelly tortured for confessions of non-existent crimes , imaginary anti-Soviet conspiracies , and false accusations against others .
Stalin personally sent instructions to the Soviet secret police that stated that to obtain confessions from the accused , “ the NKVD was given permission by the Central Committee [ of the Communist Party ] to use physical influence … as a completely correct and expedient method ” of interrogation .
When Stalin was told that this method was bringing forth the desired results , he told the NKVD interrogators , “ Give them the works until they come crawling to you on their bellies with confessions in their teeth. ” Then , in another purge , this one after World War II , Stalin simplified the instructions even more : “ Beat , beat and , once again , beat . ”
Thousands of the victims wrote letters to Stalin from their exile and hardships in the labor camps , all of them were persuaded that it had all been a terrible mistake . If only the great and good Comrade Stalin knew , he would set it all right and they would be freed and restored as good , loyal Soviet citizens ready to once again work to “ build socialism . ”
But Stalin knew . He personally signed off on tens of thousands of death warrants and orders for tens of thousands more to be sent to their horrifying fates in the Gulag camps .
Dmitri Volkogonov , a Soviet general-turned-historian , gained access to many of the closed Soviet archives in the 1980s and wrote a biography of Stalin , titled Triumph and Tragedy ( 1991 ) , meaning Stalin ’ s “ triumph ” to power and the resulting “ tragedy ” for the Soviet people . Volkogonov told a Western correspondent at the time :
I would come home from working in Stalin ’ s archives , and I would be deeply shaken . I remember coming home after reading through the day of December 12 , 1938 . He signed thirty lists of death sentences that day , altogether about five thousand people , including many he personally knew , his friends … This is not what shook me . It turned out that , having signed these documents , he went to his personal theater very late that night and watched two movies , including “ Happy Guys , ” a popular comedy of the time . I simply could not understand how , after deciding the fate of several thousand lives , he could watch such a movie . But I was beginning to realize that morality plays no role for dictators . That ’ s when I understood why my father was shot , why my mother died in exile , why millions of people died .
Soviet central planning even had quotas for the number of such enemies of the people to be killed in each region of the Soviet Union , as well as the required numbers to be rounded up to be sent to work in the labor camps in the frigid wastelands of the Siberia and the Arctic Circle or the scorching deserts of Soviet Central Asia .
A Russian lawyer who had access to some of the formerly closed Soviet archives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the 1990s said at the time :
Recently I read a Central Committee document from 1937 that said the Voronezh secret police , according to the ‘ regional plan , ’ repressed in the ‘ first category , ’ nine thousand people – which means these people were executed . And for no reason , of course . Twenty-nine thousand were repressed in the ‘ second category – meaning they were sent to labor camps . The local first secretary [ of the Communist Party ] , however , writes that there are still more Trotskyites and kulaks who remain ‘ unrepressed. ’ He is saying that the plan was fulfilled but the plan was not enough ! And so he asked that it be increased by eight thousand . Stalin writes back , ‘ No increase to nine thousand ! ’ The sickness of it . Its ’ as if they were playing poking [ and upping the ante in tragic human lives ] .
In the last years of the Soviet Union , a Russian historian took Washington Post correspondent David Remnick to the Donskoi Monastery in Moscow , which was used in the 1930s as a burial ground for the thousands regularly killed on Stalin ’ s orders in the capital of the Red Empire .
In his book Lenin ’ s Tomb : The Last Days of the Soviet Empire ( 1993 ) , Remnick told what the Russian historian explained :
See this gate ? … Well , every night trucks stacked with bodies came back here and dumped them in a heap . They ’ d already been shot in the back of the head – you bleed less that way … They stacked the bodies in old wooden ammunition crates . The workers stoked up the underground ovens – right in through the doors – to about twelve thousand degrees centigrade . To make things nice and official they even had professional witnesses who counter-signed the various documents . When the bodies were burned they were reduced to ash and some chips of bone , maybe some teeth . They then buried the ashes in a pit … When the purges [ of the 1930s ] were at their peak … the furnaces worked all night and the domes of the churches were covered with ash . There was a fine dust of ash on the snow .
The Kalitnikovsky Cemetery in Moscow also served as a dumping ground for thousands of tortured and executed bodies in the 1930s .
In the purges , every dog in town came to this place . That smell you smell now was three times as bad ; blood was in the air . People would lean out of their windows and puke all night and the dogs howled until dawn . Sometimes they ’ d find a dog with an arm or a leg walking through the graveyard .
Enemies of Socialism Sent to Torture in the Mental Ward
The nightmare of the socialist experiment , however , did not end with Stalin ’ s death in 1953 . Its form merely changed in later decades . As head of the KGB in the 1970s , Yuri Andropov ( who later was General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union after Leonid Brezhnev ’ s death in 1982 ) , accepted a new theory in Soviet psychiatry which said opposition to the socialist regime was a sign of mental illness .
Why ? Because only the mentally disturbed would resist the logic and the truth of Marxian dialectical determinism and its “ proof ” that socialism and communism were the highest and most humane stage of social development . Those who criticized the system or wanted to reform or overthrow the Soviet socialist regime were mentally sick and required psychiatric treatment .
In his book Russia and the Russians ( 1984 ) , former Moscow bureau chief for the Washington Post Kevin Klose told the story of Alexei Nikitin , a coal mine worker who complained to the Soviet government about the safety and health environment in the mines of the Soviet Union . He was arrested , tried , and found guilty of subversion and committed to a Soviet mental institution .
Various drugs were prescribed as a treatment to bring him to his proper socialist senses . Explained Kevin Klose :
Of all the drugs administered [ at the mental institution ] to impose discipline , sulfazine stood at the pinnacle of pain … ‘ People injected with sulfazine were groaning , sighing with pain , cursing the psychiatrists and Soviet power , cursing with everything in their hearts , ’ Alexei told us . ‘ The people go into horrible convulsions and get completely disoriented . The body temperature rises to 40 degrees centigrade [ 104 degrees Fahrenheit ] almost instantly , and the pain is so intense they can not move from their beds for three days . Sulfazine is simply a way to destroy a man completely . If they torture you and break your arms , there is a certain specific pain and you somehow can stand it . But sulfazine is like a drill boring into your body that gets worse and worse until it ’ s more than you can stand . It ’ s impossible to endure . It is worse than torture , because , sometimes , torture may end . But this kind of torture may continue for years. ’ Sulfazine normally was ‘ prescribed ’ in a ‘ course ’ of injections of increasing strength over a period that might last up to two months … The doctors had many other drugs with which to control and punish . Most of them eventually were used on Alexei … At the end of two months , Nikitin was taken off sulfazine but regular doses of … other disorienting drugs continued the entire time he was imprisoned .
The significance of these accounts is not their uniqueness but , rather , their monotonous repetition in every country in which socialism was imposed upon a society . In country after country , death , destruction , and privation followed in the wake of socialism ’ s triumph . Socialism ’ s history is a story of crushing tyranny and oceans of blood .
As the Soviet mathematician and dissident Igor Shafarevich , who spent many years in the Gulag slave labor camps for his opposition to the communist regime , said in his book The Socialist Phenomenon ( 1980 ) :
Most socialist doctrines and movements are literally saturated with the mood of death , catastrophe , and destruction … One could regard the death of mankind as the final result to which the development of socialism leads .
That 20th-century socialism would lead to nothing but this outcome was understood at the time of the Bolshevik victory in Russia . It was clearly expressed by the greatest intellectual opponent of socialism during the last 100 years , the Austrian economist , Ludwig von Mises .
Near the end of his famous 1922 treatise Socialism : An Economic and Sociological Analysis , Mises warned :
Socialism is not in the least what is pretends to be . It is not the pioneer of a better and finer world , but the spoiler of what thousands of years of civilization have created . It does not build , it destroys . For destruction is the essence of it . It produces nothing , it only consumes what the social order based on private ownership in the means production has created … Each step leading towards Socialism must exhaust itself in the destruction of what already exists .
When voices are once again heard calling for socialism – even by a recent candidate for the Democratic Party nomination for U.S. President or on university campuses around the country – it is important , no , it is crucial , that the history and reality of socialism-in-practice in those parts of the world where it was most thoroughly imposed and implemented , as in the Soviet Union , be remembered and fully understood .
If we do not , well , history has its own ways of repeating itself .

A quarter of a century ago, the curtain was lowered on the 75-year experiment in “building socialism” in the country where it all began following the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, led by Vladimir Lenin in November 1917.

He kept an account of daily life during those years, which he published many years later under the title Leaves from a Russian Diary – and Thirty Years After (1950).

Here is one of his entries from 1920:

The machine of the Red Terror works incessantly. Every day and every night, in Petrograd, Moscow, and all over the country the mountain of the dead grows higher … Everywhere people are shot, mutilated, wiped out of existence … Every night we hear the rattle of trucks bearing new victims. Every night we hear the rifle fire of executions, and often some of us hear from the ditches, where the bodies are flung, faint groans and cries of those who did not die at once under the guns. People living near these places begin to move away. They cannot sleep … Getting up in the morning, no man or woman knows whether he will be free that night. Leaving one’s home, one never knows whether he will return. Sometimes a neighborhood is surrounded and everyone caught out of his house without a certificate is arrested … Life these days depends entirely on luck.

This murderous madness never ended. In the 1930s, during the time of the Great Purges instituted by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin to wipe out all “enemies of the revolution” through mass executions, millions were sent to the Gulag prisons that stretched across all of the Soviet Union to be worked to death as slave labor to “build socialism.”

Before being sent to their deaths or to the forced labor camps, tens of thousands would be interrogated and cruelly tortured for confessions of non-existent crimes, imaginary anti-Soviet conspiracies, and false accusations against others.

Stalin personally sent instructions to the Soviet secret police that stated that to obtain confessions from the accused, “the NKVD was given permission by the Central Committee [of the Communist Party] to use physical influence … as a completely correct and expedient method” of interrogation.

When Stalin was told that this method was bringing forth the desired results, he told the NKVD interrogators, “Give them the works until they come crawling to you on their bellies with confessions in their teeth.” Then, in another purge, this one after World War II, Stalin simplified the instructions even more: “Beat, beat and, once again, beat.”

Thousands of the victims wrote letters to Stalin from their exile and hardships in the labor camps, all of them were persuaded that it had all been a terrible mistake. If only the great and good Comrade Stalin knew, he would set it all right and they would be freed and restored as good, loyal Soviet citizens ready to once again work to “build socialism.”

Stalin’s Personal Hand in Building Socialism through Blood

But Stalin knew. He personally signed off on tens of thousands of death warrants and orders for tens of thousands more to be sent to their horrifying fates in the Gulag camps.

Dmitri Volkogonov, a Soviet general-turned-historian, gained access to many of the closed Soviet archives in the 1980s and wrote a biography of Stalin, titled Triumph and Tragedy (1991), meaning Stalin’s “triumph” to power and the resulting “tragedy” for the Soviet people. Volkogonov told a Western correspondent at the time:

I would come home from working in Stalin’s archives, and I would be deeply shaken. I remember coming home after reading through the day of December 12, 1938. He signed thirty lists of death sentences that day, altogether about five thousand people, including many he personally knew, his friends … This is not what shook me. It turned out that, having signed these documents, he went to his personal theater very late that night and watched two movies, including “Happy Guys,” a popular comedy of the time. I simply could not understand how, after deciding the fate of several thousand lives, he could watch such a movie. But I was beginning to realize that morality plays no role for dictators. That’s when I understood why my father was shot, why my mother died in exile, why millions of people died.

Soviet central planning even had quotas for the number of such enemies of the people to be killed in each region of the Soviet Union, as well as the required numbers to be rounded up to be sent to work in the labor camps in the frigid wastelands of the Siberia and the Arctic Circle or the scorching deserts of Soviet Central Asia.

A Russian lawyer who had access to some of the formerly closed Soviet archives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the 1990s said at the time:

Recently I read a Central Committee document from 1937 that said the Voronezh secret police, according to the ‘regional plan,’ repressed in the ‘first category,’ nine thousand people – which means these people were executed. And for no reason, of course. Twenty-nine thousand were repressed in the ‘second category – meaning they were sent to labor camps. The local first secretary [of the Communist Party], however, writes that there are still more Trotskyites and kulaks who remain ‘unrepressed.’ He is saying that the plan was fulfilled but the plan was not enough! And so he asked that it be increased by eight thousand. Stalin writes back, ‘No increase to nine thousand!’ The sickness of it. Its’ as if they were playing poking [and upping the ante in tragic human lives].

The Victims of Socialism Literally Reduced to Burnt Ash

In the last years of the Soviet Union, a Russian historian took Washington Post correspondent David Remnick to the Donskoi Monastery in Moscow, which was used in the 1930s as a burial ground for the thousands regularly killed on Stalin’s orders in the capital of the Red Empire.

In his book Lenin’s Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire (1993), Remnick told what the Russian historian explained:

See this gate? … Well, every night trucks stacked with bodies came back here and dumped them in a heap. They’d already been shot in the back of the head – you bleed less that way … They stacked the bodies in old wooden ammunition crates. The workers stoked up the underground ovens – right in through the doors – to about twelve thousand degrees centigrade. To make things nice and official they even had professional witnesses who counter-signed the various documents. When the bodies were burned they were reduced to ash and some chips of bone, maybe some teeth. They then buried the ashes in a pit … When the purges [of the 1930s] were at their peak … the furnaces worked all night and the domes of the churches were covered with ash. There was a fine dust of ash on the snow.

The Kalitnikovsky Cemetery in Moscow also served as a dumping ground for thousands of tortured and executed bodies in the 1930s.

That same Russian historian told Remnick:

In the purges, every dog in town came to this place. That smell you smell now was three times as bad; blood was in the air. People would lean out of their windows and puke all night and the dogs howled until dawn. Sometimes they’d find a dog with an arm or a leg walking through the graveyard.

Enemies of Socialism Sent to Torture in the Mental Ward

The nightmare of the socialist experiment, however, did not end with Stalin’s death in 1953. Its form merely changed in later decades. As head of the KGB in the 1970s, Yuri Andropov (who later was General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union after Leonid Brezhnev’s death in 1982), accepted a new theory in Soviet psychiatry which said opposition to the socialist regime was a sign of mental illness.

Why? Because only the mentally disturbed would resist the logic and the truth of Marxian dialectical determinism and its “proof” that socialism and communism were the highest and most humane stage of social development. Those who criticized the system or wanted to reform or overthrow the Soviet socialist regime were mentally sick and required psychiatric treatment.

In his book Russia and the Russians (1984), former Moscow bureau chief for the Washington Post Kevin Klose told the story of Alexei Nikitin, a coal mine worker who complained to the Soviet government about the safety and health environment in the mines of the Soviet Union. He was arrested, tried, and found guilty of subversion and committed to a Soviet mental institution.

Various drugs were prescribed as a treatment to bring him to his proper socialist senses. Explained Kevin Klose:

Of all the drugs administered [at the mental institution] to impose discipline, sulfazine stood at the pinnacle of pain … ‘People injected with sulfazine were groaning, sighing with pain, cursing the psychiatrists and Soviet power, cursing with everything in their hearts,’ Alexei told us. ‘The people go into horrible convulsions and get completely disoriented. The body temperature rises to 40 degrees centigrade [104 degrees Fahrenheit] almost instantly, and the pain is so intense they cannot move from their beds for three days. Sulfazine is simply a way to destroy a man completely. If they torture you and break your arms, there is a certain specific pain and you somehow can stand it. But sulfazine is like a drill boring into your body that gets worse and worse until it’s more than you can stand. It’s impossible to endure. It is worse than torture, because, sometimes, torture may end. But this kind of torture may continue for years.’ Sulfazine normally was ‘prescribed’ in a ‘course’ of injections of increasing strength over a period that might last up to two months … The doctors had many other drugs with which to control and punish. Most of them eventually were used on Alexei … At the end of two months, Nikitin was taken off sulfazine but regular doses of … other disorienting drugs continued the entire time he was imprisoned.

The significance of these accounts is not their uniqueness but, rather, their monotonous repetition in every country in which socialism was imposed upon a society. In country after country, death, destruction, and privation followed in the wake of socialism’s triumph. Socialism’s history is a story of crushing tyranny and oceans of blood.

Socialism as the Ideology of Death and Destruction

As the Soviet mathematician and dissident Igor Shafarevich, who spent many years in the Gulag slave labor camps for his opposition to the communist regime, said in his book The Socialist Phenomenon (1980):

Most socialist doctrines and movements are literally saturated with the mood of death, catastrophe, and destruction … One could regard the death of mankind as the final result to which the development of socialism leads.

That 20th-century socialism would lead to nothing but this outcome was understood at the time of the Bolshevik victory in Russia. It was clearly expressed by the greatest intellectual opponent of socialism during the last 100 years, the Austrian economist, Ludwig von Mises.

Near the end of his famous 1922 treatise Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis, Mises warned:

Socialism is not in the least what is pretends to be. It is not the pioneer of a better and finer world, but the spoiler of what thousands of years of civilization have created. It does not build, it destroys. For destruction is the essence of it. It produces nothing, it only consumes what the social order based on private ownership in the means production has created … Each step leading towards Socialism must exhaust itself in the destruction of what already exists.

When voices are once again heard calling for socialism – even by a recent candidate for the Democratic Party nomination for U.S. President or on university campuses around the country – it is important, no, it is crucial, that the history and reality of socialism-in-practice in those parts of the world where it was most thoroughly imposed and implemented, as in the Soviet Union, be remembered and fully understood.

If we do not, well, history has its own ways of repeating itself.

As the Ebola crisis unfolds here in the United States, it’s becoming painfully obvious why the American people can’t trust their own government. Mind you, any federal government isn’t exactly an entity anyone should trust completely, yet Americans understand that while politics will always unleash certain shenanigans, in general there had been a sense that people in Washington and our various agencies at least had our best interests in mind.

Unfortunately, that sentiment has become, well, sentimental.

On Sept. 16, President Obama had a news conference about Ebola at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta. After the president noted, “We have to act fast.

Officials warn there is a chance of `` life-threatening inundation from rising water '' over the next 48 hours as Florence heads for the US East Coast .
With sustained winds of about 140mph ( 225km/h ) , the weather system is currently a category four storm .
It could make landfall on Friday , near Wilmington , North Carolina .
Virginia , Maryland , Washington DC , and North and South Carolina have all declared states of emergency .
`` This storm is a monster , '' North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news conference on Tuesday . `` It 's big and it 's vicious .
Hurricane Florence was 670 miles ( 1,078km ) south-east of Cape Fear , in North Carolina , as of 23:00 Atlantic Standard Time on Tuesday ( 03:00 GMT Wednesday ) , according to the latest National Hurricane Center update .
The update says Florence - which is moving north-west at about 17mph ( 28km/h ) - is expected to strengthen on Tuesday night and on Wednesday .
`` While some weakening is expected on Thursday , Florence is forecast to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through landfall , '' it says .
Florence is expected to slow down considerably by late Thursday into Friday .
The National Weather Service predicts potential storm surges of up to 13ft ( 4m ) on the coasts along with dangerously large swells and rip currents .
Hurricane-force winds will extend outward up to 60 miles from the centre and tropical-storm-force winds up to 175 miles .
Rainfall could be up to 25in ( 64cm ) in some areas . This could worsen if , as some meteorologists predict , Florence stalls after it makes landfall .
The office of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam predicted `` catastrophic inland flooding , high winds and possible widespread power outages '' .
The chief meteorologist for WCBD-TV in South Carolina , Rob Fowler , told the BBC that Florence was getting bigger , and those even 100 miles away would feel the impact .
He said Florence could rival the impact of Hurricane Hugo , which wreaked $ 7bn ( £5.3bn ) in damage and claimed 49 lives in 1989 .
It is also likely to affect the Brunswick Nuclear Plant in Southport , North Carolina , which is just a few miles from where Florence is expected to make landfall .
Mandatory evacuations have been ordered in parts of South Carolina , North Carolina and Virginia , affecting more than a million people .
South Carolina 's Governor Henry McMaster initially ordered the entire coastline of his state to leave . However , the order was later confined to the northern coast .
Residents of affected areas have been flocking to stores to stock up on essentials .
John Johnson , a hardware store manager in Charleston , South Carolina , told AFP news agency there had been a `` nonstop '' rush on batteries , flashlights , plastic tarpaulins and sandbags .
Some petrol stations were running dry as customers filled up .
Curtis Oil , a fuel distributor in Chesterfield , South Carolina , said it had been `` overwhelmed with requests by state agencies and everybody else '' .
US President Donald Trump has signed declarations of emergency for both North Carolina and South Carolina , freeing up federal money and resources for the storm response .
Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday , Mr Trump said the government would spare `` no expense '' in responding to Hurricane Florence , adding the storm was `` tremendously big and tremendously wet '' .
Mr Trump also spoke of the US response to the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico as `` one of the best jobs that has ever been done '' , describing it as an `` incredible , unsung success '' .
The description is in stark contrast to the assessment of Carmen Yulin Cruz , the mayor of the Puerto Rican capital , San Juan , who described Mr Trump 's response to the disaster as a `` stain on his presidency '' after officials revised the death toll last month .
The toll now stands at an estimated 2,975 people - nearly 50 times the earlier figure of 64 .
That number includes those who were killed directly by Hurricane Maria , as well as those who died in the six months following the storm as a result of poor healthcare provision and a lack of electricity and clean water .
Repeated power cuts also led to an increased number of deaths from diabetes and sepsis .
The US government has a National Flood Insurance Programme ( NFIP ) that helps pay for flood coverage in high-risk zones across the country .
The programme , which is billions of dollars in debt , has been up for renewal several times - Congress ' next deadline to re-authorise the NFIP is 30 November .
While some wind damage may be covered by regular homeowners ' insurance , flooding is a different story .
In the US , flood protection policies from private providers are often very expensive , largely because it is difficult to assess a home 's flood risk .
These policies also take 30 days to kick in , meaning any homeowners without coverage in the Carolinas now will not be able to insure their property before Florence hits .
According to the Insurance Information Institute , 14 % of Americans living in the southern states had flood insurance as of 2016 .

Mandatory evacuations have been ordered in parts of South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia, affecting more than a million people.

South Carolina's Governor Henry McMaster initially ordered the entire coastline of his state to leave. However, the order was later confined to the northern coast.

Residents of affected areas have been flocking to stores to stock up on essentials.

John Johnson, a hardware store manager in Charleston, South Carolina, told AFP news agency there had been a ""nonstop"" rush on batteries, flashlights, plastic tarpaulins and sandbags.

Some petrol stations were running dry as customers filled up.

Curtis Oil, a fuel distributor in Chesterfield, South Carolina, said it had been ""overwhelmed with requests by state agencies and everybody else"".

What has President Trump said so far?

US President Donald Trump has signed declarations of emergency for both North Carolina and South Carolina, freeing up federal money and resources for the storm response.

Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr Trump said the government would spare ""no expense"" in responding to Hurricane Florence, adding the storm was ""tremendously big and tremendously wet"".

Mr Trump also spoke of the US response to the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico as ""one of the best jobs that has ever been done"", describing it as an ""incredible, unsung success"".

The description is in stark contrast to the assessment of Carmen Yulin Cruz, the mayor of the Puerto Rican capital, San Juan, who described Mr Trump's response to the disaster as a ""stain on his presidency"" after officials revised the death toll last month.

The toll now stands at an estimated 2,975 people - nearly 50 times the earlier figure of 64.

That number includes those who were killed directly by Hurricane Maria, as well as those who died in the six months following the storm as a result of poor healthcare provision and a lack of electricity and clean water.

Repeated power cuts also led to an increased number of deaths from diabetes and sepsis.

Why are people worried about flood insurance?

The US government has a National Flood Insurance Programme (NFIP) that helps pay for flood coverage in high-risk zones across the country.

The programme, which is billions of dollars in debt, has been up for renewal several times - Congress' next deadline to re-authorise the NFIP is 30 November.

While some wind damage may be covered by regular homeowners' insurance, flooding is a different story.

In the US, flood protection policies from private providers are often very expensive, largely because it is difficult to assess a home's flood risk.

These policies also take 30 days to kick in, meaning any homeowners without coverage in the Carolinas now will not be able to insure their property before Florence hits.

According to the Insurance Information Institute, 14% of Americans living in the southern states had flood insurance as of 2016.

Is Florence the only storm?

No. On the opposite side of the country, officials in Hawaii are warning residents and tourists to brace for the arrival of Tropical Storm Olivia.

Forecasters say Olivia - with current wind speeds of 65mph - will make landfall on Wednesday morning.

As many as 365 people were injured in the quake that struck at 3:36 a.m. Wednesday , Italy 's civil protection service announced . At least 470 aftershocks have since rattled the area , triggering more damage to centuries-old buildings in Amatrice . One aftershock had a magnitude of 5.1 .
After a night of uninterrupted , flood-lit search efforts , firefighters and rescue crews worked in teams around the hard-hit area in central Italy , pulling chunks of cement , rock and metal from mounds of rubble where homes once stood , searching for signs of life .
One rescue effort focused on the Hotel Roma in Amatrice , famous for the Amatriciana bacon and tomato pasta sauce that brings food lovers to this medieval hilltop town each August for its food festival .
Amatrice 's mayor had initially said 70 guests were in the crumbled hotel ahead of this weekend 's festival , but rescue workers later halved that estimate and the owner said most guests had managed to escape .
Firefighters ' spokesman Luca Cari said one body had been pulled out of the hotel rubble just before dawn after five were extracted earlier but searches continued there and elsewhere .
`` We 're still in a phase that allows us to hope we 'll find people alive , '' Cari said , noting that in the 2009 earthquake in nearby L'Aquila , one survivor was pulled out after 72 hours .
Rescuers refused to say when their work would shift from saving lives to recovering bodies .
`` We will work relentlessly until the last person is found , and make sure no one is trapped , '' said Lorenzo Botti , a rescue team spokesman .
Worst affected by the quake were the tiny towns of Amatrice and Accumoli near Rieti , 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) northeast of Rome , and Pescara del Tronto , 25 kilometers ( 15 miles ) further to the east .
Italy 's civil protection agency reported the death toll had risen to 241 early Thursday with at least 264 others hospitalized . Most of the dead -- 184 -- were in Amatrice . Authorities revised downward an earlier figure of 247 after one of the affected areas corrected its toll .
A Spaniard and five Romanians were among the dead , according to their governments .
There is no clear estimate of the missing since the area was flooded with summer vacationers . The Romanian government alone said 11 of its citizens were missing .
Emergency services set up tent cities around the quake-devastated towns to accommodate the homeless , housing about 1,200 people overnight . In Amatrice , 50 elderly people and children spent the night inside a local sports facility .
`` It 's not easy for them , '' said civil protection volunteer Tiziano De Carolis , who was helping to care for about 350 homeless in Amatrice . `` They have lost everything : the work of an entire life , like those who have a business , a shop , a pharmacy , a grocery store . From one day to another , they discovered everything they had was destroyed . ''
As the search effort continued , the soul-searching began as Italy once again confronted the responsibilities that come with having the highest seismic hazard in Western Europe . At the same time , the country has countless picturesque medieval villages but its anti-seismic building codes are n't applied to old buildings and often are n't respected when new ones are built .
`` In a country where in the past 40 years there have been at least eight devastating earthquakes ... the only lesson we have learned is to save lives after the fact , '' columnist Sergio Rizzo wrote in Thursday 's Corriere della Sera . `` We are far behind in the other lessons . ''
Some experts estimate that 70 percent of Italy 's buildings are n't built to anti-seismic standards , though not all are in high-risk areas . After every major quake , proposals are made to improve , but they often languish in Italy 's thick bureaucracy and chronic funding shortages . It 's no small task to secure thousands of ancient towns and newer structures built before codes were passed or later in violation of them .
Premier Matteo Renzi , visiting the quake-affected zone Wednesday , promised to rebuild `` and guarantee a reconstruction that will allow residents to live in these communities , to relaunch these beautiful towns that have a wonderful past that will never end . ''
Geologists were surveying the damage Thursday to determine which buildings were still inhabitable , while Culture Ministry teams were also fanning out to assess the damage of some of the region 's cultural treasures , especially its medieval-era churches .
Italian news reports Thursday said prosecutors investigating the quake were looking in particular into the collapse of Amatrice 's `` Romolo Capranica '' school -- restored in 2012 using funds set aside after the last major quake struck central Italy in 2009 .
In recent quakes , some of these more modern buildings -- many of them public institutions -- have been the deadliest : the university dormitory that collapsed in the 2009 L'Aquila quake , killing 11 students ; the elementary school that crumbled in San Giuliano di Puglia in 2002 , killing 27 children -- the town 's entire first-grade class .
In Italy , major quakes are often followed by criminal charges being filed against architects , builders and officials responsible for public works if the buildings crumble .
In the case of the L'Aquila quake , prosecutors also put six geologists on trial for allegedly having failed to adequately warn residents about the temblor . Their convictions were ultimately overturned on appeal .
While the government was already looking ahead to reconstruction , rescue workers on the ground still had days and weeks of work ahead of them .
In hard-hit Pescara del Tronto , firefighter Franco Mantovan said Thursday that crews knew of three residents still under the rubble but in a hard-to-reach area .
On Wednesday evening there , about 17 hours after the quake struck , firefighters pulled a 10-year-old girl alive from a crumbled home .
`` You can hear something under here . Quiet , quiet , '' one rescue worker said , before soon urging her on : `` Come on , Giulia , come on , Giulia . ''
But in many other cases , wails of grief rang out when bodies emerged .
`` Unfortunately , 90 percent we pull out are dead , but some make it , that 's why we are here , '' said Christian Bianchetti , a volunteer who was working in Amatrice .","Rescue crews aided by sniffer dogs dug through crumbled homes in Italy Thursday looking for earthquake survivors as the death toll reached 250 and officials anguished over how to secure their ancient towns and modern cities from the country's highly seismic terrain.

""They have lost everything: the work of an entire life, like those who have a business, a shop, a pharmacy, a grocery store. From one day to another, they discovered everything they had was destroyed.""

As the search effort continued, the soul-searching began as Italy once again confronted the responsibilities that come with having the highest seismic hazard in Western Europe. At the same time, the country has countless picturesque medieval villages but its anti-seismic building codes aren't applied to old buildings and often aren't respected when new ones are built.

""In a country where in the past 40 years there have been at least eight devastating earthquakes ... the only lesson we have learned is to save lives after the fact,"" columnist Sergio Rizzo wrote in Thursday's Corriere della Sera. ""We are far behind in the other lessons.""

Some experts estimate that 70 percent of Italy's buildings aren't built to anti-seismic standards, though not all are in high-risk areas. After every major quake, proposals are made to improve, but they often languish in Italy's thick bureaucracy and chronic funding shortages. It's no small task to secure thousands of ancient towns and newer structures built before codes were passed or later in violation of them.

Premier Matteo Renzi, visiting the quake-affected zone Wednesday, promised to rebuild ""and guarantee a reconstruction that will allow residents to live in these communities, to relaunch these beautiful towns that have a wonderful past that will never end.""

Geologists were surveying the damage Thursday to determine which buildings were still inhabitable, while Culture Ministry teams were also fanning out to assess the damage of some of the region's cultural treasures, especially its medieval-era churches.

Italian news reports Thursday said prosecutors investigating the quake were looking in particular into the collapse of Amatrice's ""Romolo Capranica"" school -- restored in 2012 using funds set aside after the last major quake struck central Italy in 2009.

In recent quakes, some of these more modern buildings -- many of them public institutions -- have been the deadliest: the university dormitory that collapsed in the 2009 L'Aquila quake, killing 11 students; the elementary school that crumbled in San Giuliano di Puglia in 2002, killing 27 children -- the town's entire first-grade class.

In Italy, major quakes are often followed by criminal charges being filed against architects, builders and officials responsible for public works if the buildings crumble.

In the case of the L'Aquila quake, prosecutors also put six geologists on trial for allegedly having failed to adequately warn residents about the temblor. Their convictions were ultimately overturned on appeal.

While the government was already looking ahead to reconstruction, rescue workers on the ground still had days and weeks of work ahead of them.

In hard-hit Pescara del Tronto, firefighter Franco Mantovan said Thursday that crews knew of three residents still under the rubble but in a hard-to-reach area.

On Wednesday evening there, about 17 hours after the quake struck, firefighters pulled a 10-year-old girl alive from a crumbled home.

""You can hear something under here. Quiet, quiet,"" one rescue worker said, before soon urging her on: ""Come on, Giulia, come on, Giulia.""

Cheers broke out when she was pulled out.

But in many other cases, wails of grief rang out when bodies emerged.

""Unfortunately, 90 percent we pull out are dead, but some make it, that's why we are here,"" said Christian Bianchetti, a volunteer who was working in Amatrice.

The killings have aggravated tensions between police , City Hall , and protesters who have staged regular demonstrations since a Staten Island grand jury refused to indict an officer earlier this month in connection with the death of 43-year-old Eric Garner . Amateur video appeared to show the officer putting Garner in a chokehold while questioning him over the sale of untaxed cigarettes .
`` We are in a very difficult moment . Our focus has to be on these families , '' de Blasio said Monday at police headquarters . `` I think it 's a time for everyone to put aside political debates , put aside protests , put aside all of the things that we will talk about in all due time . ''
However , the Rev . Al Sharpton told Reuters late Monday that de Blasio 's request was too `` ill-defined '' to heed .
`` Is a vigil a protest ? Is a rally ? '' Sharpton asked .

''","Activist groups in New York City have rejected a call by Mayor Bill de Blasio to hold off on any new demonstrations until after the funerals of two NYPD officers who were ambushed and murdered Saturday in Brooklyn.

The killings have aggravated tensions between police, City Hall, and protesters who have staged regular demonstrations since a Staten Island grand jury refused to indict an officer earlier this month in connection with the death of 43-year-old Eric Garner. Amateur video appeared to show the officer putting Garner in a chokehold while questioning him over the sale of untaxed cigarettes.

""We are in a very difficult moment. Our focus has to be on these families,"" de Blasio said Monday at police headquarters. ""I think it's a time for everyone to put aside political debates, put aside protests, put aside all of the things that we will talk about in all due time.""

However, the Rev. Al Sharpton told Reuters late Monday that de Blasio's request was too ""ill-defined"" to heed.

""Is a vigil a protest? Is a rally?"" Sharpton asked.

Another group, The Answer Coalition, said it would go ahead with a long-planned march Tuesday evening, and denounced the mayor for what it called an ""outrageous"" attempt to chill free speech. The New York Post reported that a few dozen protesters staged a ""die-in"" at Grand Central Terminal before marching toward Times Square.

""We will not let recent tragic moments derail this movement,"" one protester shouted. ""This is the revolution and we will not be repressed.""

We spent 2014 talking over and over again about some big problems, like policing practices, sexual violence and climate change. What if we spend 2015 talking about effective solutions?

Racial bias in policing

There's overwhelming data that black men are more likely to suffer racial profiling and violence at the hands of police. We had devastating example after example this year. Eric Garner, John Crawford, Michael Brown, Akai Gurley, Tamir Rice and more. This is a ridiculously long list of unarmed black men killed by police. The list should give us pause.

In Boston, for instance, African-Americans make up 24% of the population but 63% of those stopped and frisked by police.

The problem of rape culture

In 2014, we spent a great deal of effort arguing about rape stories. A huge Rolling Stone article about an alleged gang rape at the University of Virginia fell apart. Over a dozen women came forward alleging that Bill Cosby had sexually molested or raped them. Cosby denied the allegations.

Climate change is real

Detroit's historic bankruptcy case is entering the home stretch. The crucial, final trial phase begins Tuesday in a Detroit courtroom.

The trial will decide the fate of a plan to wipe out billions of dollars in debt and help Detroit emerge from bankruptcy as a new, revitalized city.

This trial is a big deal, but don't expect anything with lots of courtroom drama. For one thing, it's federal bankruptcy court — and there's no jury.

The case revolves around a document: Detroit's 400-page ""plan of adjustment"" laying out how, and how much, the city plans to pay off its thousands of creditors and restructure Detroit going forward.

Lawyers will dissect and argue the plan point by point. In the end, Judge Steven Rhodes will decide if it complies with Chapter 9 of the U.S. bankruptcy code, the chapter dealing with municipal bankruptcies.

One of the biggest issues is whether the plan is even feasible, says Laura Bartell, a bankruptcy law professor at Wayne State University.

""That's going to be probably the crux of the confirmation hearing,"" Bartell says. ""Does this plan work? Is the city of Detroit going to be viable if this plan is confirmed and implemented?""

A 'Grand Bargain' To Keep Art In Detroit

In the months leading up to this trial, Detroit and its creditors have been working hard to hash out deals in mediation. In most cases, they've reached settlements that are now part of the plan.

The biggest one, dubbed the ""grand bargain,"" is a deal meant to protect the city's retirees and preserve its world-class art collection.

Inside Rivera Court at the Detroit Institute of Arts, digital tablets help museumgoers decipher what they're seeing on the walls: Diego Rivera's breathtaking murals depicting scenes from Detroit's industrial heyday.

The murals are among the biggest treasures in a museum chock-full of magnificent art, some of it purchased many years ago by a much larger, wealthier city. Some of Detroit's biggest creditors insist that the city should either mortgage or sell those pieces to pay them off. But that's precisely what the grand bargain is supposed to prevent.

Private foundations, philanthropists and the state of Michigan have pledged more than $800 million toward the grand bargain to save the art. That money would be used to pay off Detroit's biggest creditor group: city retirees.

In return, retirees give up any legal challenge to the plan of adjustment, and the museum's collection is transferred to a charitable trust, where creditors can't touch it.

Most retirees would still have to take some pension cuts. But facing the possibility of much deeper ones, a majority approved the grand bargain.

But bond insurer Syncora voted against that bargain. It stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars if the plan of adjustment is confirmed.

Bartell says in cases with dissenting creditors, the bankruptcy code requires the city to prove it doesn't ""unfairly discriminate"" against them. Bartell says the plan does clearly discriminate in favor of retirees, but the question is whether that's unfair. She doesn't think so.

""These are people who are not financial institutions,"" Bartell says. ""These are city of Detroit retirees.""

Other legal scholars disagree — but at trial's end, only Rhodes' interpretation matters.

The Prospect Of 'Two Detroits'

Detroit's bankruptcy is resonating far beyond the courtroom. Bond insurers like Syncora aren't the only ones arguing that the city's plan is unfair.

Detroit made global headlines again this summer, this time over water. The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department allowed more than $100 million in delinquent bills to accumulate.

The department recently launched an aggressive, controversial effort to shut off water to customers who owed more than $150. Critics worldwide slammed the move as inhumane.

To some, it was more evidence that the burden of Detroit's ""restructuring"" falls mostly on its majority poor, black population.

Civil rights lawyer Alice Jennings argues that it's part of a larger effort to ""make Detroit into a more gentrified city,"" and worries about ""two Detroits"" emerging: ""a Detroit where there is poverty, where there is sickness, where there is no ability to gain the basic requirements of life, and then a very affluent sector.""

Later this month, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan will likely take back control of the city from a state-appointed emergency manager. He has promised to steer clear of the old, bad habits that created the country's largest-ever municipal bankruptcy.

While there's no question that Detroit will emerge a changed city, there are concerns about whether the changes will be sustainable and just who will benefit most from a new Detroit.",www.npr.org,center,a6BvX1KX0boS1TlW

Millions of Americans are still grappling with debt they 've accumulated since the recession hit . And new numbers out Monday show many are having a tougher time than you might think .
One in 10 working Americans between the ages of 35 and 44 are getting their wages garnished . That means their pay is being docked — often over an old credit card debt , medical bill or student loan .
That striking figure comes out of a collaboration between NPR and ProPublica . The reporting offers the first available national numbers on wage garnishment .
Back in 2009 , Kevin Evans was one of millions of Americans blindsided by the recession . He had a 25-year career selling office furniture , but suddenly , companies stopped buying furniture . His income collapsed . He sold his three-bedroom home outside Kansas City that he could no longer afford .
For the next several years he worked a string of low-wage jobs : at a lumber yard , at a 24-hour fitness center . He rented a room from a friend . He never collected unemployment . But with a daughter in college and basic living expenses , he ended up with a $ 7,000 credit card debt that he says he could n't pay . Evans , 58 , had fallen from middle-class life into basic subsistence living .
Then late last year , he found a better-paying , full-time customer service job in Springfield , Mo . Things were finally getting better , until early this year , when he opened his paycheck and found a quarter of it missing . His credit card lender , Capital One , had garnished his wages .
Twice a month , whether he could afford it or not , 25 percent of his pay — the legal limit — would go to his debt , which had ballooned with interest and fees to more than $ 15,000 . `` It was a roundhouse from the right that just knocks you down and out , '' Evans says .
The recession and its aftermath have fueled an explosion of cases like Evans ' . Creditors and collectors have pursued struggling cardholders and other debtors in court , securing judgments that allow them to seize a chunk of even meager earnings . The financial blow can be devastating — more than half of U.S. states allow creditors to take a quarter of after-tax wages . But despite the rise in garnishments , the number of Americans affected has remained unknown .
At the request of ProPublica , ADP , the nation 's largest payroll services provider , undertook a study of payroll records for 13 million employees . ADP 's report , released Monday , shows that among employees in the prime working ages of 35 to 44 who had their wages garnished in 2013 , roughly half , unsurprisingly , owed child support . But a sizable number had their earnings docked for consumer debts , such as credit cards , medical bills and student loans .
Actually , for workers earning $ 25,000 to $ 40,000 a year , more people were garnished for consumer debt than for child support . This marks a dramatic change . In the past , the vast majority of wage garnishments went to secure child support payments or to collect on unpaid taxes . In recent years , though , debt collectors have been filing millions of lawsuits against people for just basic consumer debt : medical bills , student loans and credit card debt .
Extended to the entire population of U.S. employees , ADP 's findings indicate that 4 million workers — about 3 percent of all employees — had wages taken for a consumer debt in 2013 . People in some geographic regions and income groups had twice that rate of garnishment .
Carolyn Carter of the National Consumer Law Center says these findings are `` alarming . ''
`` States and the federal government should look on reforming our wage garnishment laws with some urgency , '' she says .
The increase in consumer debt seizures is `` a big change , '' largely invisible to researchers because of the lack of data , says Michael Collins , faculty director of the Center for Financial Security at the University of Wisconsin , Madison . The potential financial hardship imposed by these seizures and their sheer number should grab the attention of policymakers , he says . `` It is something we should care about . ''
ADP 's study , the first large-scale look at how many employees are having their wages garnished and why , reveals what has been a hidden burden for working-class families . Wage seizures were most common among middle-aged , blue-collar workers and lower-income employees .
Nearly 5 percent of those earning between $ 25,000 and $ 40,000 per year had a portion of their wages diverted to pay down consumer debts alone in 2013 , ADP found . More people in that income group were garnished to pay off consumer debt than to pay child support .
Perhaps due to the struggling economy in the region , the rate was highest in the Midwest . There , more than 6 percent of employees earning between $ 25,000 and $ 40,000 — 1 in 16 — had wages seized over consumer debt . Employees in the Northeast had the lowest rate . The statistics were not broken down by race .
Currently , debtors ' fates depend significantly on where they happen to live . State laws vary widely . Four states — Texas , Pennsylvania , North Carolina and South Carolina — largely prohibit wage garnishment stemming from consumer debt .
Most states , however , allow creditors to seize a quarter of a debtor 's wages — the highest rate permitted under federal law . Evans had the misfortune to live in Missouri , which not only allows creditors to seize 25 percent , but also allows them to continue to charge a high interest rate even after a judgment .
A Note About Garnishment In Missouri Missouri provides a protection for a head of household with dependent children which caps the garnishment rate at 10 percent of a worker 's paycheck . But Kevin Evans did n't qualify for that — or even know about it . And the burden is on the debtor to know about such exemptions and ask for a lower garnishment rate . It is legal for debt collectors to seize 25 percent of people 's paychecks in Missouri even if they are head of household until the debtor objects and asks for the exemption .
By early 2010 , Evans had fallen so far behind that Capital One suspended his card . For months , he made monthly $ 200 payments toward his $ 7,000 debt , according to statements reviewed by NPR and ProPublica . But by this time , the payments barely kept pace with the interest piling on at 26 percent . In 2011 , when Evans could no longer keep up , Capital One filed suit . Court records show that Evans was served a summons , but he says he did n't understand that the stack of paperwork he received included a summons with a hearing date to appear in court .
If Evans had lived in neighboring Illinois , the interest rate on his debt would have dropped to below 10 percent after his creditor had won a judgment in court . But in Missouri , creditors can continue to add the contractual rate of interest for the life of the debt , so Evans ' bill kept mounting . Missouri law also allowed Capital One to tack on a $ 1,200 attorney fee . Some other states cap such fees to no more than a few hundred dollars .
Evans has involuntarily paid over $ 6,000 this year on his old debt , an average of about $ 480 each paycheck , but he still owes more than $ 10,000 . `` It 's my debt . I want to pay it , '' Evans says . But `` I need to come up with large quantities of money so I do n't just keep getting pummeled . ''
Capital One says in a statement that legal action is always a last resort . The company says it tried to work with Evans but that he was unable to keep up with the payments on a payment plan that he had agreed to .
Companies can also seize funds from a borrower 's bank account . There is no data on how frequently this happens , even though it is a common recourse for collectors . Among the people interviewed by NPR and ProPublica who were having their wages garnished , more often than not , debt collectors had also made attempts to seize money from their bank accounts . Some people we interviewed say they had stopped keeping money in banks as a result .
The garnishment process for most debts begins in local courts . A company can file suit as soon as a few months after a debtor falls behind . A ProPublica review of court records in eight states shows the bulk of lawsuits are filed by just a few types of creditors and companies . Besides major credit card lenders such as Capital One , medical debt is a major source of such suits . High-cost lenders who deal in payday and installment loans also file suits by the thousands . And finally , an outsized portion comes from debt buyers — companies that purchase mostly unpaid credit card bills .
When these creditors and collectors go to court , they are almost always represented by an attorney . Defendants — usually in tough financial straits or unfamiliar with the court system — almost never are .
In Clay County , Mo. , where Capital One brought its suit against Evans in 2011 , only 7 percent of defendants in debt collection cases have their own attorneys , according to ProPublica 's review of state court data . Often the debtors do n't show up to court at all : The most common outcome of a debt collection lawsuit in Missouri ( and any other state ) is a judgment by default .
Millions of debt collection lawsuits are filed every year in local courts . In 2011 , for instance , the year Capital One went to court against Evans , more than 100,000 such suits were filed in Missouri alone .
Despite these numbers , creditors and debt collectors say they only pursue lawsuits and garnishments against consumers after other collection attempts fail . `` Litigation is a very high-cost mechanism for trying to collect a debt , '' says Rob Foehl , general counsel at the Association of Credit and Collection Professionals . `` It 's really only a small percentage of outstanding debts that go through the process .

Experts in garnishment say they 've seen a clear shift in the type of debts that are pursued . A decade ago , child support accounted for the overwhelming majority of pay seizures , said Amy Bryant , a consultant who advises employers on payroll issues and has written a book on garnishment laws .

The burden was enough to prompt the American Payroll Association to request in 2011 that the Uniform Law Commission draft a model state law on wage garnishment .

Millions of Americans are still grappling with debt they've accumulated since the recession hit. And new numbers out Monday show many are having a tougher time than you might think.

One in 10 working Americans between the ages of 35 and 44 are getting their wages garnished. That means their pay is being docked — often over an old credit card debt, medical bill or student loan.

That striking figure comes out of a collaboration between NPR and ProPublica. The reporting offers the first available national numbers on wage garnishment.

A 'Roundhouse' Punch

Back in 2009, Kevin Evans was one of millions of Americans blindsided by the recession. He had a 25-year career selling office furniture, but suddenly, companies stopped buying furniture. His income collapsed. He sold his three-bedroom home outside Kansas City that he could no longer afford.

For the next several years he worked a string of low-wage jobs: at a lumber yard, at a 24-hour fitness center. He rented a room from a friend. He never collected unemployment. But with a daughter in college and basic living expenses, he ended up with a $7,000 credit card debt that he says he couldn't pay. Evans, 58, had fallen from middle-class life into basic subsistence living.

Then late last year, he found a better-paying, full-time customer service job in Springfield, Mo. Things were finally getting better, until early this year, when he opened his paycheck and found a quarter of it missing. His credit card lender, Capital One, had garnished his wages.

Twice a month, whether he could afford it or not, 25 percent of his pay — the legal limit — would go to his debt, which had ballooned with interest and fees to more than $15,000. ""It was a roundhouse from the right that just knocks you down and out,"" Evans says.

The recession and its aftermath have fueled an explosion of cases like Evans'. Creditors and collectors have pursued struggling cardholders and other debtors in court, securing judgments that allow them to seize a chunk of even meager earnings. The financial blow can be devastating — more than half of U.S. states allow creditors to take a quarter of after-tax wages. But despite the rise in garnishments, the number of Americans affected has remained unknown.

High Garnishment Rates In The Midwest

ADP's study, the first large-scale look at how many employees are having their wages garnished and why, reveals what has been a hidden burden for working-class families. Wage seizures were most common among middle-aged, blue-collar workers and lower-income employees.

Nearly 5 percent of those earning between $25,000 and $40,000 per year had a portion of their wages diverted to pay down consumer debts alone in 2013, ADP found. More people in that income group were garnished to pay off consumer debt than to pay child support.

A new war on drugs.

At a time when most Americans support legalization, 2017 could be bad news for those in favor of legal weed.

Donald Trump has commented that legalization should be up to the states, but he's been appointing anti-marijuana lawmakers to key positions in his cabinet. The most notable of these is Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who's been tapped as Attorney General. Sessions has long opposed legalization and has criticized both the Obama administration and the Department of Justice for not enforcing federal marijuana laws.

The national debt.

When Donald Trump is sworn into office, he'll be inheriting a debt that has nearly doubled under President Obama. In early 2017, the national debt is set to hit a staggering $20 trillion. And estimates from the Committee for a Responsible Budget say Trump's policy proposals will add another $5.3 trillion over the next four years.

Attacks on Free Trade.

Globalisation and free trade have lifted millions out of poverty and has raised living standards across the United States. Yet we enter 2017 with both Democrats and Republicans questioning the fundamental value of free markets, a new administration promising to inject itself into the affairs of private companies, and a president openly threatening a costly trade war with China.

Fake news and free speech.

Hillary Clinton called fake news an ""epidemic"" at a recent public event and said that the trend ""can have real world consequences.""

Those consequences now include Facebook testing new plug-ins to limit misinformation and partnering with fact-checking groups to root out any false news items—causing fears of censorship on the popular social media platform.

Expanded surveillance powers.

The FBI, NSA, and CIA are most likely going to get expanded surveillance powers under a Trump administration.

Some of these changes are already happening. A new rule approved this fall allows federal agents with a single search warrant to hack millions of Americans' computers or smartphones at once.

And the United Kingdom just approved the Investigatory Powers bill which gives the UK's global surveillance program authorities power to create a new government database that will store the web history of every citizen in the country.

Perot , who won19 percent of the vote as a third-party candidate in 1992 , died early Tuesday at his home in Dallas surrounded by his family , family spokesman James Fuller said . The native-born Texan , who made his billions by founding Electronic Data Systems Corp. , was seen by admirers as a patriot who served his country well before his two failed bids for the White House . In 1979 , he financed a private commando raid to free two EDS employees being held in a prison in Iran . He was also a tireless advocate for Vietnam veterans .
In 1992 , Perot spent more than $ 60 million of his own money to run against incumbent President George H.W . Bush and challenger Bill Clinton , promising to bring his business acumen to the nation 's finances . Some Republicans blamed him for Bush 's loss , noting he pulled the largest percentage of votes for a third-party candidate since former President Theodore Roosevelt 's 1912 bid .
Perot 's second campaign four years later fizzled , as he gathered just 8 percent of the vote , and the Reform Party that he founded and hoped to build into a national political force began to fall apart .
However , Perot 's ideas on trade and deficit reduction remained part of the political landscape . He blamed both major parties for running up a huge federal budget deficit and letting American jobs to be sent to other countries . The movement of U.S. jobs to Mexico , he said , created a `` giant sucking sound . ''
Perot continued to speak out about federal spending for many years . In 2008 , he launched a website to highlight the nation 's debt with a ticker that tracked the rising total , a blog and a chart presentation .
Henry Ross Perot was born in Texarkana on June 27 , 1930 . His father was a cotton broker ; his mother a secretary . Perot said his family survived the Depression relatively well through hard work and by managing their money carefully .
Young Perot 's first job was delivering papers in a poor , mostly black part of town from his pony , Miss Bee . Perot said when the newspaper tried to cut his commission , he complained to the publisher — and won . He said he learned to take problems straight to the top .
From Texarkana , Perot went to the U.S . Naval Academy even though he had never been on a ship or seen the ocean . After the Navy , Perot joined International Business Machines in 1955 and quickly became a top salesman . In his last year at IBM , he filled his sales quota for the year in January .
In 1962 , with $ 1,000 from his wife , Margot , Perot founded Electronic Data Systems . Hardware accounted for about 80 % of the computer business , Perot said , and IBM was n't interested in the other 20 % , including services .
Many of the early hires at EDS were former military men , and they had to abide by Perot 's strict dress code — white shirts , ties , no beards or mustaches — and long work days . Many had crew cuts , like Perot .
The company 's big break came in the mid-1960s when the federal government created Medicare and Medicaid , the health programs for seniors , the disabled and the poor . States needed help in running the programs , and EDS won contracts — starting in Texas — to handle the millions of claims .
EDS first sold stock to the public in 1968 , and overnight , Perot was worth $ 350 million . His fortune doubled and tripled as the stock price rose steadily .
In 1984 , he sold control of the company to General Motors Corp. for $ 2.5 billion and received $ 700 million in a buyout . In 2008 , EDS was sold to Hewlett-Packard Co .
Perot went on to establish another computer-services company , Perot Systems Corp . He retired as CEO in 2000 and was succeeded by his son , Ross Perot Jr . In 2009 , Dell Inc. bought Perot Systems .
In September 2011 , Forbes magazine estimated Perot 's wealth at $ 3.5 billion and ranked him No . 91 on its list of richest Americans .","Self-made billionaire Ross Perot, who ran for president in 1992 and 1996, has died at age 89 after a five-month battle with leukemia, the Dallas Morning News reported.

The movement of U.S. jobs to Mexico, he said, created a ""giant sucking sound.""

Perot continued to speak out about federal spending for many years. In 2008, he launched a website to highlight the nation's debt with a ticker that tracked the rising total, a blog and a chart presentation.

Henry Ross Perot was born in Texarkana on June 27, 1930. His father was a cotton broker; his mother a secretary. Perot said his family survived the Depression relatively well through hard work and by managing their money carefully.

Young Perot's first job was delivering papers in a poor, mostly black part of town from his pony, Miss Bee. Perot said when the newspaper tried to cut his commission, he complained to the publisher — and won. He said he learned to take problems straight to the top.

From Texarkana, Perot went to the U.S. Naval Academy even though he had never been on a ship or seen the ocean. After the Navy, Perot joined International Business Machines in 1955 and quickly became a top salesman. In his last year at IBM, he filled his sales quota for the year in January.

In 1962, with $1,000 from his wife, Margot, Perot founded Electronic Data Systems. Hardware accounted for about 80% of the computer business, Perot said, and IBM wasn't interested in the other 20%, including services.

Many of the early hires at EDS were former military men, and they had to abide by Perot's strict dress code — white shirts, ties, no beards or mustaches — and long work days. Many had crew cuts, like Perot.

The company's big break came in the mid-1960s when the federal government created Medicare and Medicaid, the health programs for seniors, the disabled and the poor. States needed help in running the programs, and EDS won contracts — starting in Texas — to handle the millions of claims.

EDS first sold stock to the public in 1968, and overnight, Perot was worth $350 million. His fortune doubled and tripled as the stock price rose steadily.

In 1984, he sold control of the company to General Motors Corp. for $2.5 billion and received $700 million in a buyout. In 2008, EDS was sold to Hewlett-Packard Co.

Perot went on to establish another computer-services company, Perot Systems Corp. He retired as CEO in 2000 and was succeeded by his son, Ross Perot Jr. In 2009, Dell Inc. bought Perot Systems.

In September 2011, Forbes magazine estimated Perot's wealth at $3.5 billion and ranked him No. 91 on its list of richest Americans.

Some believe Islamic extremists have gone to school on special operations forces . The classroom is the U.S. media .
Special operations forces ’ three most recent attempts to rescue American hostages failed . Last year , SEALs attempted a beach insertion to capture a terrorist leader in Somalia but were spotted and repelled . There was also the horrific loss of SEALs in a helicopter shoot-down that some family members believe was an ambush .
For years , the basics for rescue and terrorist targeting have remained intact : insertion by silenced helicopter or boat to , or near , a target ; and fast-roping or running to the end point . The objective is complete tactical surprise by the best commandos in the world , enhanced by goggles that let them see through the darkness .
But as one veteran of the special operations community said , “ We ’ ve got one way of doing things , and the enemy is on to it because they ’ ve published these news reports and movies and all the rest of it . It ’ s time for some new tactics because the old ones are not working anymore . ”
Retired Rear Adm. George Worthington , once the Navy ’ s top SEAL , was asked whether members of al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have gone to school on special operations tactics .
“ Movies , ” he said . “ All they need to do is get the movies . ”
It was a reference to Hollywood ’ s realistic depiction of counterterrorism operations , especially the hunt for Osama bin Laden .
Kenneth McGraw , a spokesman for U.S. Special Operations Command in Tampa , Florida , said , “ USSOCOM has a robust lessons learned program and SOF units are constantly reviewing the results of operations to determine if changes need to be made to training , doctrine , or tactics , techniques and procedures . ”
The May 2011 SEAL Team 6 raid that killed bin Laden attracted an unprecedented spotlight to how hostage rescues and targeted insertions are conducted .
In the immediate aftermath , the White House leaked copious timelines . The CIA helped Hollywood make a movie . A former SEAL on the raid wrote a detailed book .
Navy SEALs and the Army ’ s crack hostage rescuers , Delta Force , had conducted scores of similar raids against terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Iraq , but the details remained “ black. ” No post-operation leaks or readouts surfaced .
The most recent failure happened Dec. 5 in Yemen ’ s southern Shabwa region . A mission to rescue American photojournalist Luke Somers failed the previous month . When commandos arrived at an al Qaeda cave hideout , Somers had been moved .
The same terrorist modus operandi occurred this summer in Syria . When Delta Force operatives arrived at the Islamic State compound , the hostages had been transferred .
Islamists clearly have learned the abilities of U.S. intelligence and commandos . Perhaps they also have learned the practice of Hezbollah terrorists in Beirut in the 1980s when prisoners did not stay in one place for long .
Last year , SEAL Team 6 raiders were forced to retreat after a lookout for the al Qaeda-linked group al-Shabab spotted them around a compound in Somalia holding its military commander — the mission ’ s target .
On Dec. 5 , nearly 40 SEAL Team 6 members did not attempt an overhead insertion , as was conducted at bin Laden ’ s compound in Abbottabad , Pakistan . Instead , they touched down about 6 miles away in two Ospreys , which fly as fixed-wing aircraft and land and take off vertically like a helicopter .
Then , dumb luck , or an alert guard , intervened . As the special operations team approached 100 yards away , the guard picked that time to go outside .
“ He was just outside the compound , ” the special operations community source said . “ When they take a piss , they kneel down . They ’ re Muslims , and they don ’ t stand erect like we do . He was down kind of flat-footed , pissing , behind a bush and saw these guys coming and he yelled . He was unarmed , but he yelled to the guys inside and then ran in . ”
Fighters from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula quickly shot and killed Somers and a South African hostage , Pierre Korkie . Minutes later , the SEAL team engaged and killed most of those in the compound . The mission failed , but all SEALs returned to base safely .
Said the source , “ There ’ s no good answer to this issue except we ’ ve kind of relied on one technique . That ’ s helicopter insertion and then either coming right down on top of target or way off and then walking the last 4 or 5 miles . Millions have been spent on silencing them and keeping them stealthy . And cooling off the exhaust so they don ’ t give off a thermal signature . You wouldn ’ t believe the programs they spend money on to try to do those things . ”
SEAL Team 6 used specially configured MH-60 Black Hawk helicopters to penetrate Pakistani airspace in the bin Laden raid and arrived over the compound undetected .
As for changing tactics , Adm. Worthington said he was “ not sure how you go about doing that . ”
“ You have to get someplace , ” he said . “ There ’ s several ways to do it . Sea . Air . Land , if you will . Every operation is a different one . It ’ s an equal-opportunity battlefield . They get to shoot back . They see the ‘ ops ’ go bad on them , they figure out how to fix it . ”
One person who warned early on that Islamic terrorists would go to school on leaked tactics is former Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates . He ran the Pentagon the night bin Laden was killed .
In his memoir , “ Duty , ” Mr. Gates said that on that May 2011 night he warned the White House not to gab about details .
“ I reminded everyone that the techniques , tactics , and procedures the SEALs had used in the Bin Laden operation were used every night in Afghanistan and elsewhere in hunting down terrorists and other enemies , ” he wrote . “ It was therefore essential that we agree not to release any operational details of the raid . That we killed him , I said , is all we needed to say . Everybody in that room agreed to keep mum on details .
“ That commitment lasted about five hours . The initial leaks came from the White House and CIA . They just couldn ’ t wait to brag and to claim credit . ”
Mr. Gates became so enraged that he used an expletive to convey to Mr. Obama ’ s national security director the need to shut up — to no avail .
A tragedy befell SEAL Team 6 later that year . A CH-47 Chinook helicopter was shot down while on a mission to back up Army Rangers in Afghanistan . All 38 onboard , including 15 SEAL Team 6 members , were killed .
The families of some of the dead believe the mission was compromised by Afghan informants . The Taliban fighter who fired the deadly rocket-propelled grenade was stationed on a dwelling ’ s turret not far from the landing zone , which the U.S. had not used before .
A Pentagon official told Congress there was no evidence the shooter was tipped off .
Larry Johnson , a former CIA hand and counterterrorism official at the State Department , said hostage rescue headquarters is now the White House and no longer an interagency process .
“ We ’ re more incompetent , ” Mr. Johnson said . “ The entire national security apparatus for dealing with hostage incidents and kidnapping has basically been dismantled under Obama . It ’ s all being done over at the White House . And instead of bringing in people who have genuine experience in this area , it ’ s all being played from the standpoint of domestic politics . ”
Mr. Johnson noted that an international aid group said it was close to obtaining Korkie ’ s release and had discussed the negotiations with unidentified Americans in Yemen . The White House and State Department said they were unaware .
The Pentagon said the Dec. 5 mission was quickly drawn up and approved by President Obama in response to intelligence that al Qaeda planned to kill Somers the next day .","In the secretive special operations community, officials are debating whether to tweak tactics for daring and risky missions involving hostage rescue and terrorist targeting that have been compromised by years of detailed news accounts and Hollywood portrayals.

But with their foundation pouring billions of dollars into global development , in effect the two are in the ( highly data-driven ) prediction business : placing bets on which investments will change the world the most . In their annual letter , released today , the two hazard some fairly specific guesses about the biggest changes in the world over the next 15 years , from cutting the number of childhood deaths in half and reducing deaths in childbirth by two-thirds to eradicating polio and a farming revolution to make Africa self-sufficient .
It ’ s not a sure thing , of course , though when we spoke recently , Bill Gates insisted that , barring “ nuclear war or asteroid strike or gigantic epidemic that comes along , ” his bets had “ a very good chance. ” Sure , he allowed , many of the most optimistic predictions—those Jetsons-era dreams of flying saucers and a jetpack for every kid—take much longer than their promoters expect . To boost the chances , many of the most specific of the innovations touted by the Gateses are rooted in new technology or advances in the science of global health . “ A lot of prediction is overoptimistic in the short run , but then because of science and the ability of getting the exemplars to be copied by others , 15 years gives us a chance to do virtually all these things , ” he said . “ There are elements in there like polio eradication that we expect to be done literally within the next three years . ”
And like all smart pundits , they have based many of their bets on applying models that already work elsewhere in a bigger , broader way . “ Look , on the childhood and mortality numbers that we ’ re talking about , you know , childhood mortality has been cut in half in the last 15 years , ” Melinda Gates pointed out in the interview . “ And just in the last five years , Rwanda ’ s seen the steepest decline in childhood mortality in the history of the world . And we know what they did in Rwanda . We know the health system that they set up , we know the vaccines that were delivered , we know how they ’ re going about doing it . Ethiopia is literally copying that system and everybody ’ s iterating on it . So we ’ ll be able to see those similar declines in other countries . ”
Bill Gates , who has remained the world ’ s richest man , according to Forbes , while giving away his billions , did allow that “ you wouldn ’ t bet all your money ” on achieving each of his predictions ( he said the two-thirds reduction in maternal mortality was “ one of the riskier ones ” ) , but still , he argued , there are a bunch of world-changing slam dunks out there for the doing . With that in mind , ███ Magazine asked 15 other big thinkers and doers for their idea of what will change the world the most in the next 15 years . We got back lots of inspiration—from the transformative power of opening up national borders to the commercialization of the human genome—and one dyspeptic dissenter . Read on , for a sense of the possible in the planet of 2030 .
By Alec Ross , senior fellow at the Columbia University School of International & Public Affairs
Fifteen years from now , everybody reading this will live , on average , two years longer than their current life expectancy because of the commercialization of genomics . The price of mapping an individual ’ s genetic material has fallen from $ 2.7 billion to below $ 10,000 , and it continues to fall .
Omniscience into the makeup and operation of the 3 billion base pairs of genetic code in each of our bodies will allow for tests to be developed that will find cancer cells at 1 percent of the size of what can be detected by an MRI today . It will allow for personalized prevention and treatment programs for nearly every illness , and will make today ’ s medical practices look medieval by comparison .
Of course , all of this will benefit the wealthy before it becomes affordable and available to everybody . That is the cruel reality of many of the innovations to come . They will make people live longer , healthier lives—but not everybody , and not all at once .
Human rights abuse thrives on secrecy . Pretending to respect rights is a key element of legitimacy for governments and even most armed groups . Occasionally an entity like the Islamic State publicizes its atrocities , but most hide them because they are shameful . Communication innovations make it harder to cover up . Back when news had to travel by sailing ship , an atrocity could be ancient history before most people heard of it . Only large , long-lasting abuses like the slave trade could be tackled . The emergence of the telephone and then the Internet enabled us to learn more quickly about abuses and to take steps to curb them while action still made a difference . But we still largely depended on the media to get word out widely , and photographs and video were harder still to obtain and disseminate .
Today , social media , growing Internet access and broader bandwidth have made it easier to spotlight abuse . The proliferation of smartphones means that someone is frequently able to video or photograph abuse , and the rise of social media and broadband makes it easy to disseminate the visual evidence . Shining a spotlight has never been easier . Some abusers will simply brave the public-relations disaster , but many will want to avoid it , generating more pressure for them to refrain from or stop abuse . Governments know this , which is why they are trying to increase electronic surveillance of the Internet and crack down on those using it to publicize their misdeeds . Activists , in turn , are developing new ways to circumvent surveillance and protect themselves . At stake in this cat-and-mouse game is not simply Internet freedom but the effectiveness of a powerful tool to protect all rights .
By Nancy Birdsall , president of the Center for Global Development
The breakthrough that can change the world is not a new technology or a new business process or even a new policy . It is the outcome of every girl , by the age of about 10 , even in the poorest countries , internalizing thoroughly the option of controlling her fertility and thus her future : whether , who and when she marries , what education she can hope for and when , what work and career she can have . A world in which every girl everywhere at age 10 is even vaguely aware of that option ( and her brothers and her father get it , too ) is a world transformed : safer , richer and happier .
On the one hand , the option of completely safe and low-cost fertility control ( and the associated idea of women ’ s and men ’ s liberation from assumed roles throughout life ) is not anymore new in much of the world . On the other hand , it has not gone the last mile to 10-year-old girls in parts of Africa and the Middle East and South Asia . In this century , as with all new ideas and new knowledge , there ’ s no stopping its continued spread even in the harshest settings . The question is only whether conventional barriers will slow its spread , or renewed ambition to liberate women everywhere will accelerate its spread . Renewed ambition ought to embrace as fundamental access to modern contraception wherever it is still limited . After all : Is it only coincidence that the women ’ s liberation movement in the West took off in the late 1960s , at the same time as the contraceptive pill became available ?

Estonia is offering foreigners its digital ID cards—called e-residency—giving people anywhere in the world the ability to sign contracts , send secure authenticated email , encrypt documents and access government services all across the European Union .

To boost the chances, many of the most specific of the innovations touted by the Gateses are rooted in new technology or advances in the science of global health. “A lot of prediction is overoptimistic in the short run, but then because of science and the ability of getting the exemplars to be copied by others, 15 years gives us a chance to do virtually all these things,” he said. “There are elements in there like polio eradication that we expect to be done literally within the next three years.”

And like all smart pundits, they have based many of their bets on applying models that already work elsewhere in a bigger, broader way. “Look, on the childhood and mortality numbers that we’re talking about, you know, childhood mortality has been cut in half in the last 15 years,” Melinda Gates pointed out in the interview. “And just in the last five years, Rwanda’s seen the steepest decline in childhood mortality in the history of the world. And we know what they did in Rwanda. We know the health system that they set up, we know the vaccines that were delivered, we know how they’re going about doing it. Ethiopia is literally copying that system and everybody’s iterating on it. So we’ll be able to see those similar declines in other countries.”

Bill Gates, who has remained the world’s richest man, according to Forbes, while giving away his billions, did allow that “you wouldn’t bet all your money” on achieving each of his predictions (he said the two-thirds reduction in maternal mortality was “one of the riskier ones”), but still, he argued, there are a bunch of world-changing slam dunks out there for the doing. With that in mind, Politico Magazine asked 15 other big thinkers and doers for their idea of what will change the world the most in the next 15 years. We got back lots of inspiration—from the transformative power of opening up national borders to the commercialization of the human genome—and one dyspeptic dissenter. Read on, for a sense of the possible in the planet of 2030.

Genes as commerce

By Alec Ross, senior fellow at the Columbia University School of International & Public Affairs

Fifteen years from now, everybody reading this will live, on average, two years longer than their current life expectancy because of the commercialization of genomics. The price of mapping an individual’s genetic material has fallen from $2.7 billion to below $10,000, and it continues to fall.

Omniscience into the makeup and operation of the 3 billion base pairs of genetic code in each of our bodies will allow for tests to be developed that will find cancer cells at 1 percent of the size of what can be detected by an MRI today. It will allow for personalized prevention and treatment programs for nearly every illness, and will make today’s medical practices look medieval by comparison.

Of course, all of this will benefit the wealthy before it becomes affordable and available to everybody. That is the cruel reality of many of the innovations to come. They will make people live longer, healthier lives—but not everybody, and not all at once.

The democratization of media to fight rights abuses

By Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch

Human rights abuse thrives on secrecy. Pretending to respect rights is a key element of legitimacy for governments and even most armed groups. Occasionally an entity like the Islamic State publicizes its atrocities, but most hide them because they are shameful. Communication innovations make it harder to cover up. Back when news had to travel by sailing ship, an atrocity could be ancient history before most people heard of it. Only large, long-lasting abuses like the slave trade could be tackled. The emergence of the telephone and then the Internet enabled us to learn more quickly about abuses and to take steps to curb them while action still made a difference. But we still largely depended on the media to get word out widely, and photographs and video were harder still to obtain and disseminate.

Today, social media, growing Internet access and broader bandwidth have made it easier to spotlight abuse. The proliferation of smartphones means that someone is frequently able to video or photograph abuse, and the rise of social media and broadband makes it easy to disseminate the visual evidence. Shining a spotlight has never been easier. Some abusers will simply brave the public-relations disaster, but many will want to avoid it, generating more pressure for them to refrain from or stop abuse. Governments know this, which is why they are trying to increase electronic surveillance of the Internet and crack down on those using it to publicize their misdeeds. Activists, in turn, are developing new ways to circumvent surveillance and protect themselves. At stake in this cat-and-mouse game is not simply Internet freedom but the effectiveness of a powerful tool to protect all rights.

Women controlling their fertility

By Nancy Birdsall, president of the Center for Global Development

The breakthrough that can change the world is not a new technology or a new business process or even a new policy. It is the outcome of every girl, by the age of about 10, even in the poorest countries, internalizing thoroughly the option of controlling her fertility and thus her future: whether, who and when she marries, what education she can hope for and when, what work and career she can have. A world in which every girl everywhere at age 10 is even vaguely aware of that option (and her brothers and her father get it, too) is a world transformed: safer, richer and happier.

On the one hand, the option of completely safe and low-cost fertility control (and the associated idea of women’s and men’s liberation from assumed roles throughout life) is not anymore new in much of the world. On the other hand, it has not gone the last mile to 10-year-old girls in parts of Africa and the Middle East and South Asia. In this century, as with all new ideas and new knowledge, there’s no stopping its continued spread even in the harshest settings. The question is only whether conventional barriers will slow its spread, or renewed ambition to liberate women everywhere will accelerate its spread. Renewed ambition ought to embrace as fundamental access to modern contraception wherever it is still limited. After all: Is it only coincidence that the women’s liberation movement in the West took off in the late 1960s, at the same time as the contraceptive pill became available?

Digital ID cards

By Edward Lucas, senior editor for energy, commodities and natural resources at the Economist

Estonia is offering foreigners its digital ID cards—called e-residency—giving people anywhere in the world the ability to sign contracts, send secure authenticated email, encrypt documents and access government services all across the European Union. This “Estonian Express” card will do for our travels on the Internet what Amex did for real world travel in the 1970s. It is backed by a biometric check and state-of-the-art symmetric key 2048-bit encryption. Estonians take the freedom and security this brings for granted. Now foreigners can enjoy it too. I was given the first one.

What started out as a proposed prisoner swap between the United States and Cuba turned into a historic shift in relations between the two countries, one devised during secret meetings abroad and resulting in the re-establishment of diplomatic relations after more than five decades.

The two countries, separated by just 90 miles of water, once had the world on the brink of nuclear war, an episode that prompted 50 years of a U.S. economic embargo on the island and anti-American rage from Cuban President Fidel Castro. Now, the countries are preparing to open embassies in each other's capitals and increase the flow of people and capital between them.

At the White House on Wednesday, President Obama called the move an end to ""an outdated approach that, for decades, has failed to advance our interests."" In Havana, Cuban President Raúl Castro, who took over the country when his brother fell ill in 2008, welcomed the new ties to the United States while acknowledging numerous issues remained.

The deal was finalized when two Americans had returned home from Cuban prisons.

Also on the travel list: (6) religious activities; (7) public performances, clinics, workshops, athletic and other competitions, and exhibitions; (8) support for the Cuban people; (9) humanitarian projects; (10) activities of private foundations or research or educational institutes; (11) exportation, importation or transmission of information or information materials; and (12) certain export transactions that may be considered for authorization under existing regulations and guidelines.

""The policy changes make it easier for Americans to provide business training for private Cuban businesses and small farmers and provide other support for the growth of Cuba's nascent private sector,"" said an administration statement.

Obama has instructed Kerry to begin immediate talks about re-establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba, including the reopening of an American Embassy in Havana and high-level visits between government officials.

For his part, Kerry said he is looking forward ""to being the first secretary of State in 60 years to visit Cuba."" The White House did not rule out a visit to Cuba by Obama himself in the future.

Gross' imprisonment had been an obstacle to talks about improving U.S.-Cuban relations, including the possibility of easing or even ending the American economic embargo against Cuba.

Cuba arrested Gross for trying to set up an Internet access system while working as a subcontractor with the U.S. Agency for International Development. The communist state, which regards USAID programs as attempts to undermine its government, sentenced Gross to 15 years in prison.",www.usatoday.com,center,qzx59gC0mggXBnpq

The executive , identified by the Wall Street Journal as Morrie Tobin , was being investigated as part of a separate financial fraud case and gave investigators enough information that they were able to identify William Rick Singer as the mastermind of the plot , the official said .
Tobin faced two charges of securities fraud for his role in a pump-and-dump scheme involving the manipulation of stock from two companies he secretly owned . The Securities and Exchange Commission said the stock from both of those companies was artificially inflated for Tobin 's own profit .
He told investigators that Rudolph `` Rudy '' Meredith , the head women 's soccer coach at Yale University , had sought a bribe in return for getting his daughter into the Ivy League school , the Wall Street Journal reported .
The coach conspired with Singer to accept bribes in exchange for designating Yale applicants as recruits for the team , according to a court filing . Meredith could n't be reached for comment .
What followed after that initial tip was a yearlong investigation that culminated with the arrest of Meredith and other coaches ; parents , including actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin ; cogs in the alleged scam , such as Mark Riddell , accused of taking tests for others or fixing scores ; and the mastermind of the plot , Singer .
Tobin has not been charged in the college admissions scam case but , the WSJ reports that he is awaiting sentencing in the securities fraud case in which he signed a plea agreement in November .
The details of the investigation , first reported by the Wall Street Journal , bring into focus the effort by law enforcement to collect evidence against Singer , who made $ 25 million by running a scheme in which he bribed coaches and university administrators to designate the students as recruited athletes and also fixed SAT and ACT test scores .
`` I created a side door , '' Singer said in federal court on Tuesday as he pleaded guilty to four counts related to the multimillion dollar scam and admitted the case against him was accurate . `` So that was what made it so attractive to so many families is I created a guarantee . ''
Investigators followed the transfers of money and eventually landed on Singer , the law enforcement official told CNN . Singer , knowing he was caught and facing a mountain of evidence , agreed to work with investigators in September , Assistant US Attorney Eric Rosen said Tuesday .
Singer was instructed to continue meeting with parents , this time wearing a wire , and to follow through on agreements he was already working on , the official said . Investigators knew this was the busy season for Singer : Students were declaring schools and taking the standardized tests .
Parents were also looking to guarantee their children 's entrance into schools .
Singer admitted during his hearing that he told the father of one prospective candidate that he was wearing a wire and that they should n't say anything illegal .
`` You have n't done anything wrong yet so please do n't say anything that would be harmful to you guys because you have n't done anything , which was absolutely illegal , '' Singer said . Prosecutors said in court that Singer had warned several clients that if they received a call from him , it would most likely be recorded .
Singer had obstructed justice with at least six families who had either taken part in the scam or were planning to do it , prosecutors said .
Both Huffman and Loughlin have made their initial court appearances and were released after posting bond . They will appear separately before a judge in Boston on March 29 .
Meredith , the former Yale soccer coach , is expected to go before a judge on March 28 . He has not yet entered a plea .
Riddell , who is a counselor at a private school in Florida , is scheduled to appear in court in April . He has not yet entered a plea .
`` I want to communicate to everyone that I am profoundly sorry for the damage I have done and grief I have caused those as a result of my needless actions . '' Riddell said in a statement provided by his attorney . `` I understand how my actions contributed to a loss of trust in the college admissions process . I assume full responsibility for what I have done . ''
`` This case is about the widening corruption of elite college admissions through the steady application of wealth combined with fraud , '' said US Attorney Andrew Lelling . `` There can be no separate college admission system for the wealthy , and I 'll add that there will not be a separate criminal justice system either .

The aggrieved might “exercise covert avoidance, quietly cutting off relations with the offender without any confrontation” or “conceptualize the problem as a disruption to their relationship and seek only to restore harmony without passing judgment.” In the most serious cases, they might call police rather than initiating violence themselves. “For offenses like theft, assault, or breach of contract, people in a dignity culture will use law without shame,” the authors observe. “But in keeping with their ethic of restraint and toleration, it is not necessarily their first resort, and they might condemn many uses of the authorities as frivolous.

President Donald Trump , worried about spurning his most loyal supporters who bonded with him over his 2016 demands for a border wall , is digging deeper into a partial government shutdown that is stretching into an 11th day with no clear way out .
The Democratic presidential race is already firing up following Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren 's announcement in the dying hours of 2018 that she is launching an exploratory committee -- the first step toward a campaign for the party 's nomination .
There was an ominous feel to the holidays given the dark cloud hanging over Trump because of special counsel Robert Mueller , whose findings could take the nation down the bitter road to impeachment in the year to come .
But the President does n't just have to worry about Mueller . Democrats are days away from taking control of the House of Representatives and inaugurating a novel challenge for Trump 's presidency -- congressional oversight .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 265 points to close 2018 , in a sleepy session compared to the stomach-churning instability that produced the worst year for stocks in a decade and could fuel economic uncertainty that could play into the 2020 race .
And as always , there are signs of instability and chaos in the White House , with confusion over Trump 's exact position on a border wall and his planned Syria troop withdrawal , while key staff vacancies were unfilled .
Trump stayed at home , often largely alone in the White House over the Christmas and New Year 's break , tweeting at Democrats but with no real political movement evident over the shutdown . Often the aim seemed to be to talk solely to his political base -- a trend that is likely to go on all year .
`` I 'm in the Oval Office . Democrats , come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security , including the wall . You voted yes in 2006 and 2013 . One more yes , but with me in office , I 'll get it built , and Fast ! '' Trump tweeted on Monday afternoon .
It 's unclear how Trump plans to get out of the partial shutdown that has hit hundreds of thousands of federal workers , since Democrats are disinclined to grant funding for his border wall .
He could have avoided the shutdown altogether had he agreed to sign on to a stopgap measure that passed the Senate last month and would have kept government open in the short term , but would not have funded the wall .
But the President backtracked under pressure from conservatives in the House and right-wing media commentators like Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh .
So to climb down now would risk similar condemnation and the possibility of a weakening of support among base voters on whom he depends for political viability , given his decision not to try to broaden his 2016 coalition .
With a weak but stable political standing -- between 40 % and 45 % approve of the job he 's doing in most polls -- the President clearly understands that he needs to engineer a series of base-pleasing fights this year to keep his political foundation intact .
But as Democrats take over the House , they have little incentive to bail the President out -- at least until there is evidence that his tactic of branding them weak on border security is causing them political damage .
After all , Trump won election by saying Mexico , not US taxpayers , would pay for the wall . And he said he would be proud to shut down the government over the wall in a notorious Oval Office clash with Democratic leaders .
The next move in the saga will come later in the week , when Democrats put the ball back in the Republican court .
The soon-to-be Democrat-controlled House is expected to vote on six Senate spending bills and a stopgap measure to reopen the Homeland Security Department at its current funding levels until February 8 , a Democratic aide told CNN Monday .
Although the temporary measure would maintain the current $ 1.3 billion in border security money , Senate GOP Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he wo n't move any legislation until Trump signs off .
Warren took the first plunge of the front-running Democratic pack , giving her a head start on the first quarter fundraising race that will be used to assess the viability of the top contenders . She is likely to find the field crowded very soon .
The Massachusetts senator carved out populist economic ground with her opening message , stressing her humble roots and wholesome family background and accusing billionaires and corporations of attacking the middle class .
Warren 's strengths include long crusades against big banks and Wall Street titans , as Democrats seek a candidate that can loosen Trump 's hold on working-class voters in the industrial Midwest in 2020 .
`` Corruption is poisoning our democracy , '' Warren said in a web video filmed in her kitchen , and then hit out at `` bigotry and fear '' in a sidelong reference to Trump .
Pundits are already questioning , however , whether Warren has missed her moment , will be viewed as too old at 69 , or will be seen as too white at a time when a youthful and ethnic transformation is taking place in the Democratic Party .
Her effort to defuse Trump 's attacks over her claims to Native American heritage last year with a DNA test was widely seen as botched and damaging to her candidacy by Beltway insiders .
Still , Warren has a jump on other rivals , possibly including California Sen. Kamala Harris , New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and former Vice President Joe Biden .
The stirring Democratic race will also give Trump something he has long lacked , but loves -- a new enemy that he can use to define his own re-election bid and a genuine opening onto the campaign trail , where he excels .
The jockeying for position among Democrats and how the candidates respond to withering fire from Trump will define the first year of the 2020 campaign .
Trump 's campaign , transition , inaugural committee and presidency are under active investigation . So are his business , the Trump Organization , and his defunct charity , the Trump Foundation . The President was indirectly implicated by New York prosecutors overseen by his own Justice Department in directing criminal attempts to subvert campaign finance laws .
Predictions that Mueller would wrap up his investigation into alleged election collusion with Russia and possible presidential obstruction of justice by the end of 2018 turned out to be wide of the mark .
But every week that went by late last year brought more bad news for Trump and signs Mueller is closing in on the President following a flurry of legal filings , court moves and convictions , and guilty pleas against close Trump associates .
Questions swirl around Trump 's longtime political adviser Roger Stone , about , among other things , what he knew about WikiLeaks email dumps and when he knew it . And people even closer to Trump , such as his son Don Jr. and son-in-law Jared Kushner , can not be sure they are in the clear , although all , including the President , profess innocence and downplay Mueller 's investigation .
Rising pressure on the White House may have prompted Trump 's lawyer Rudy Giuliani to escalate the effort to discredit the special counsel over the holiday .
`` My ultimatum is put up or shut up , Bob , '' Giuliani said on `` Fox and Friends '' on Sunday .
`` What do you have ? There are those of us who believe you do n't have anything on collusion , '' he continued . `` And by the way , it 's not a crime . So what the heck are you doing ? ''
Despite such defiance , Mueller could have the most fateful impact on the political year if he concludes that Trump has something to answer for in a report that could put the entire presidency in peril .
The first half of Trump 's term has generated unprecedented turmoil , turnover and chaos in the West Wing . There 's no reason to think that changes now .
The President enters the new year more liberated from `` adults in the room '' than ever , and freer to follow his impulses . What that means became clear late last year , with his sudden Twitter announcement of a full troop withdrawal from Syria with the words `` they are coming back now . ''
The President 's willingness to follow his gut was also reflected in his lurch into a government shutdown .
Yet in the days since , his improvisational governing style has sparked strategic confusion about his intentions on both issues .
After meeting the President for lunch on Sunday , South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham appeared to signal that Trump was having a change of heart at least about the pace of withdrawals from Syria .
On Monday , Trump hit out at comments by his departing chief of staff , John Kelly , who had suggested in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that the concept of a concrete wall had been abandoned long ago .
But before Christmas , the President tweeted that the wall would in fact be made up of `` artistically designed steel slats '' that border agents could see through .
The confusion is yet another sign that the President 's often shifting positions and goals -- which he sees as the key to keeping his foes off balance -- will mean another year of political whiplash in Washington .","(CNN) The New Year is only a few hours old, but the political forces that are likely to shape a turbulent 2019 are already in play.

Shutting government to please the base

Trump stayed at home, often largely alone in the White House over the Christmas and New Year's break, tweeting at Democrats but with no real political movement evident over the shutdown. Often the aim seemed to be to talk solely to his political base -- a trend that is likely to go on all year.

""I'm in the Oval Office. Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the wall. You voted yes in 2006 and 2013. One more yes, but with me in office, I'll get it built, and Fast!"" Trump tweeted on Monday afternoon.

So both sides are staring at a dead end.

Warren took the first plunge of the front-running Democratic pack, giving her a head start on the first quarter fundraising race that will be used to assess the viability of the top contenders. She is likely to find the field crowded very soon.

The Massachusetts senator carved out populist economic ground with her opening message, stressing her humble roots and wholesome family background and accusing billionaires and corporations of attacking the middle class.

The stirring Democratic race will also give Trump something he has long lacked, but loves -- a new enemy that he can use to define his own re-election bid and a genuine opening onto the campaign trail, where he excels.

The jockeying for position among Democrats and how the candidates respond to withering fire from Trump will define the first year of the 2020 campaign.

It's always Mueller time

A reminder of where we were before the holiday.

Trump's campaign, transition, inaugural committee and presidency are under active investigation. So are his business, the Trump Organization, and his defunct charity, the Trump Foundation. The President was indirectly implicated by New York prosecutors overseen by his own Justice Department in directing criminal attempts to subvert campaign finance laws.

Predictions that Mueller would wrap up his investigation into alleged election collusion with Russia and possible presidential obstruction of justice by the end of 2018 turned out to be wide of the mark.

But every week that went by late last year brought more bad news for Trump and signs Mueller is closing in on the President following a flurry of legal filings, court moves and convictions, and guilty pleas against close Trump associates.

And people even closer to Trump, such as his son Don Jr. and son-in-law Jared Kushner, cannot be sure they are in the clear, although all, including the President, profess innocence and downplay Mueller's investigation.

Rising pressure on the White House may have prompted Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani to escalate the effort to discredit the special counsel over the holiday.

""My ultimatum is put up or shut up, Bob,"" Giuliani said on ""Fox and Friends"" on Sunday.

""What do you have? There are those of us who believe you don't have anything on collusion,"" he continued. ""And by the way, it's not a crime. So what the heck are you doing?""

Despite such defiance, Mueller could have the most fateful impact on the political year if he concludes that Trump has something to answer for in a report that could put the entire presidency in peril.

Turmoil in the West Wing

The first half of Trump's term has generated unprecedented turmoil, turnover and chaos in the West Wing. There's no reason to think that changes now.

The President enters the new year more liberated from ""adults in the room"" than ever, and freer to follow his impulses. What that means became clear late last year, with his sudden Twitter announcement of a full troop withdrawal from Syria with the words ""they are coming back now.""

The President's willingness to follow his gut was also reflected in his lurch into a government shutdown.

Yet in the days since, his improvisational governing style has sparked strategic confusion about his intentions on both issues.

After meeting the President for lunch on Sunday, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham appeared to signal that Trump was having a change of heart at least about the pace of withdrawals from Syria.

On Monday, Trump hit out at comments by his departing chief of staff, John Kelly, who had suggested in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that the concept of a concrete wall had been abandoned long ago.

But before Christmas, the President tweeted that the wall would in fact be made up of ""artistically designed steel slats"" that border agents could see through.

The confusion is yet another sign that the President's often shifting positions and goals -- which he sees as the key to keeping his foes off balance -- will mean another year of political whiplash in Washington.",www.cnn.com,left,PzdijtYhvpFOvS03

USA TODAY

Shoppers hit stores Friday for the annual national frenzy, drawn by deals on electronics, video games and toys, or just a chance to get out with the family, but some malls seemed less crowded this year, as buyers either made their trek after Thanksgiving dinner or opted to stay home and buy online.

Shoppers who preferred the brick-and-mortar stores came looking for great deals. Others came for the buzz of holiday music and excited crowds. Still others hoped to use the Black Friday spotlight to draw attention to non-shopping issues, such as anger about the killing of a black teenager in Chicago or to push for raising minimum wages.

In what has become something of a Black Friday tradition around the country, at least two punchouts were reported in Kentucky at separate shopping malls, one in Louisville and one in Florence, the New York Daily News reports.

Star Wars is going to take over holiday shopping

The first took place Thursday night, with two men punching and slapping each other before knocking over a female shopper at Louisville's Mall St. Matthews. A police officer finally broke up the melee, which was shared on social media.

The second incident occurred Friday morning, the Daily News reports, in a scuffle caught on video. Security measures have been beefed up at many malls and stores to cope with the rush of crowds, particularly after a Walmart worker was trampled to death at a store on Long Island in 2008.

The National Retail Federation said it expected about 99.8 million people to shop on Black Friday and 135.8 million at some point in the four-day weekend. The trade group also expected sales for November and December to rise 3.7%.

Online sales on Thanksgiving grew 26% over last year, driven heavily by mobile devices, which accounted for 40% of online sales, according to IBM Watson Trend, which tracks spending by monitoring millions of transactions from retail websites.

While shopping is the top draw for the annual event, in Chicago, protesters used the high-profile occasion to express their anger over the release of a police dash-cam video this week that showed a white Chicago police officer shooting a black teenager 16 times last year. The officer has been charged with first-degree murder.

Despite cold drizzle, the third day of protests drew hundreds of marchers who blocked traffic along Michigan Avenue in the heart of one of the city's busiest shopping districts.

In New York City, Walmart workers and their supporters protested outside the apartment of Alice Walton, daughter of Walmart founder Sam Walton. The protest concluded 15 days of fasting, organizers say. The number of days reflects the call for pay of $15 an hour and full-time work.

The annual Black Friday ritual played out nationwide:

• In Rehoboth Beach, Del., Tanger Outlets extended Black Friday hours overnight. But the extra hours did little to abate the crowds of shoppers who filled the three shopping malls by mid-morning, many driving in circles for 20 minutes or more in search of parking.

Karol and Randy Kolb of Strasburg, Va., made a trip to the outlets as part of their holiday getaway to Ocean City, Md., not for any bargains or deals. ""We already have all our Christmas shopping done,"" Randy said. ""We came for the people watching.""

• In Denver, at the upscale Cherry Creek Shopping Center, where an inch of snow had fallen, large crowds of mostly young women lined up outside H&M and the Victoria's Secret Pink stores. As is its custom, H&M staff distributed coupons to the first people line. What was Krista Gwidt of Denver going to buy? ""A hundred dollars of something,"" she said with a smile, clutching her $100-off coupon.

• Even small stores got in on the act. In Montclair, N.J. South Moon Under, a trendy clothing shop, opened an hour earlier at 9 am and planned to close an hour later at 9 pm. Dana Bursik, assistant manager at South Moon Under, said that business had been good. ""We always do Black Friday sales,"" she said. ""This is my third and its been better each year.""

• In Vauxhall, N.J., the fog-shrouded parking lot outside a Target was a virtual ghost town just after 6 a.m. Friday with fewer than two dozens cars. Inside, some aisles had more red-garbed store employees than customers.

People will move between countries, even when governments restrict travel and trade. And that kind of travel becomes almost impossible to track.

There is no more effective way to protect the United States against additional Ebola cases than to address this outbreak at the source in West Africa. That’s what our international response—including the stepped-up measures the president announced last month—will do.

We know how to stop Ebola: by isolating and treating patients, tracing and monitoring their contacts, and breaking the chains of transmission.

New year, new state laws.

A slew of state laws take effect at the turn of the calendar – ranging from minimum wage changes to pink hunting gear to a mandatory cursive writing curriculum. One state will even begin paying people to relocate for remote work.

A few of the more notable changes:

Minimum wages will increase

At the start of the new year, 19 states and 21 cities will increase their minimum wage, according to the National Employment Law Project. About 17 million people from New York to California will have received pay bumps, the project estimates, once additional minimum wage increases are phased in throughout the year.

Illinois hunters can wear bright pink

Hunting enthusiasts in Illinois have a new wardrobe choice. In addition to bright orange, hunters can wear bright pink in 2019 to meet safety requirements during gun deer seasons.

The bill passed unanimously in both state chambers. The new color option is supposed to help hunters see each other and prevent accidents among those hunting upland game with a firearm. Previously, hunters were limited to orange hats and upper outer garments displaying a minimum of 400 square inches of orange.

Vermont will pay remote workers to move there

Remote workers who relocate to Vermont can apply for up to $10,000 from the state government, starting Tuesday.

To promote economic growth, Vermont will cover expenses related to moving and working from home or a co-working space, including computer software and hardware. The state will give up to $125,000 to qualified applicants in 2019 on a first-come, first-served basis.

California requires pet stores to sell only rescued animals

Only dogs, cats and rabbits from shelters or rescue groups can be sold at pet stores in California, beginning Tuesday. If pet store owners don't follow the law, including posting where the pet came from on its cage, they will pay up to a $500 fine.

Hawaii legalizes medically assisted suicide

Following six other states and Washington, D.C., Hawaii will allow doctors to provide fatal prescription medicine to terminally ill patients who make several requests.

Two health care providers must confirm a patient's diagnosis and decision-making ability. A counselor must verify if depression or other conditions prevent the patient from making an informed decision.

Ohio requires kids to learn cursive

Ohio decided that cursive isn't obsolete. A law will require students to write legibly in cursive by the end of fifth grade. The handwriting instructional materials must be part of school curriculum by July 1.

Tennessee bans 'sanctuary' policies

Under a law prohibiting jurisdictions and law enforcement from adopting ""sanctuary"" immigration policies, officials may be forced to work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

No cities in the state formally hold a “sanctuary city” status, according to the Memphis Commercial Appeal, a member of the USA TODAY Network. One county sheriff's office may have to reverse its policy on refusing to detain people suspected of living in the country without documentation.

Massachusetts raises legal smoking age

USATODAY



NAPA, Calif. — A strong earthquake that rocked Northern California's scenic Napa wine country early Sunday injured more than 100 people, sent brick and concrete tumbling from historic buildings and triggered fires and power outages.

Officials said at least 15 buildings were left uninhabitable, and many more awaited further evaluation. State transportation officials inspected highways and bridges and declared them safe for travel.

The magnitude-6.0 earthquake struck around 3:20 a.m.. For some residents, the temblor revived memories of the last big quake to strike the San Francisco Bay Area 25 years ago, which did major damage.

Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for Napa, Solano, and Sonoma counties. Schools in Napa Valley were ordered closed Monday.

Mike Parness, city manager, said 15 or 16 buildings in the central downtown were ""red tagged"" after inspectors found damage left them too dangerous for people to enter. Several dozen other buildings were awaiting further evaluation.

""We've got a lot of workers out checking out homes and buildings,'' Parness said.

In the city's downtown section, a 10-foot chunk of brick and concrete was shaken from the corner of the old county courthouse building. Big pieces of rubble littered the lawn and street in front of the building.

Largest Napa quake since Loma Prieta

The quake was centered near American Canyon about 6 miles southwest of Napa, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. It's the largest quake to hit the Napa Valley region near San Francisco since the Loma Prieta temblor in 1989.

At least three people were reported in critical condition following quake injuries, officials said. One of them, a 13-year-old boy injured by a falling fireplace, was airlifted to the University of California-Davis hospital for surgery.

Jack LaRochelle, public works director of the city of about 77,000 people, said 30 water mains were broken and requiring repairs.

After the initial shock wore off, an almost festive air prevailed in the city with tourists on rented bicycles riding through closed streets. At one point so many people were sending photos from their mobile phones that cellular systems were overwhelmed.

Most of the heavily damaged buildings were in the older, central area of town. Newer homes and buildings away from the center of city city suffered less damage, but many were without power, officials said.



That lack of power meant some residents who rely on well water were unable to get water.

John Furtado headed into Napa to look for water. ""But we're doing fine overall. It's just some minor damage. A couple bottles of wine broke,'' he said.

Many injured during clean-up

Kelly Huston, a deputy director with the California Office of Emergency Services, said there were no reports of fatalities, but dozens were taken to local hospitals. Most injuries, he anticipated, would be from falling objects and debris.



Napa's local hospital, Queen of the Valley Medical Center, treated 172 patients Sunday and admitted 13, CEO Walt Mickens said. Most were treated for cuts and bruises, while at least three were admitted for broken bones and two for heart attacks.

""Now it appears we're treating people (injured while) cleaning up,"" hospital spokeswoman Vanessa deGier said Sunday afternoon.

64,000 without power

At least 64,000 people were without power at some point, state emergency officials said. By evening power had been restored to all but 17,000 customers, according to Pacific Gas & Electric, the largest power provider in the area.

Napa Police Capt. Steve Potter said the area's 911 system was briefly overwhelmed by calls that came in shortly after the quake, but the system quickly came back.

Four children were among 12 people killed in a fire at an apartment building in the Bronx borough of New York.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the fire was the deadliest in the city for at least 25 years. The victims include a one-year-old child, he added.

The cause of the fire, on Prospect Avenue, near Fordham University and the Bronx Zoo, is not yet clear.

More than 160 firefighters helped bring the blaze under control.

Residents who managed to escape huddled outside in bitterly cold conditions. The Red Cross handed out blankets to those on the street, as some residents fled the building without shoes or coats.

Hurricane Matthew, a powerful storm that is threatening the Atlantic coast from Florida to South Carolina, could deliver a potentially devastating economic wallop to one of the country’s most vibrant regions.

The hurricane, which has been downgraded slightly to a Category 3 storm, has been crawling slowly along the Florida coastline that is bringing sustained winds up to 120 mph and the threat of an 11-foot wall of water.

“This is a highly populated, economically developed part of the country,” says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics.

Zandi estimates that total economic losses could be in the tens of billions of dollars and even rival the nearly $70 billion in damage wrought by Hurricane Sandy. Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research, offered a more conservative appraisal, projecting about $25 billion in storm damage.

In hurricanes dating to 1989, about two-thirds of economic losses can be traced to property damage while a third is due to lost economic output, Zandi says.

In Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, nearly 1.4 million residential properties with a reconstruction value of $287 billion were at risk from the storm, according to real estate research firm CoreLogic.

But hurricanes typically don’t harm a nation’s economic growth. And much of the losses in the region are later offset. Most damaged homes, businesses and infrastructure are repaired or rebuilt, generating economic activity. And at least some of the disruptions to retail and other businesses are made up in the following weeks and months as consumers release pent-up demand.

But rebuilding in the wake of Matthew could be particularly challenging because contractors are grappling with a severe shortage of construction workers, Zandi says.

And South Florida’s tourism industry already has been beset by a decline in visitors from its top three international sources — Canada, Brazil and the United Kingdom — because of struggling economies and falling currencies in those regions that make trips to the U.S. more expensive, says Sean Snaith economics professor at the University of Central Florida.

Friedman says studies show presence of phones can cut our thinking ability in workplace
In 2015 , keep the phone away as you try to concentrate on your work , he says
Imagine that after a routine medical exam your doctor delivers some devastating news : Since your last checkup your cognitive performance has plummeted .
Your ability to connect with others has eroded . And your memory for everyday events is no longer operating as it once did .
But as it turns out , there is a cure and it wo n't cost you a penny . The treatment is simple .

Friedman says studies show presence of phones can cut our thinking ability in workplace

In 2015, keep the phone away as you try to concentrate on your work, he says

Imagine that after a routine medical exam your doctor delivers some devastating news: Since your last checkup your cognitive performance has plummeted.

Your ability to connect with others has eroded. And your memory for everyday events is no longer operating as it once did.

But as it turns out, there is a cure and it won't cost you a penny. The treatment is simple.

Would you follow the doctor's advice?

Both sides argue that the current system of higher education is deeply flawed:



“All of those wealthy parents indicted yesterday stand accused of breaking the law. But they were also pretty obviously responding to incentives. If a society turns getting into one of the top 25 schools in the country into the Willie Wonka ticket, the Holy Grail, the alchemical formula — the one thing that parents believe will ensure their children will have a happy, financially comfortable, and successful life — then people will go to absurd and illegal lengths to get it.”

Jim Geraghty, National Review



“It’s not just that higher education is literally prohibitively expensive… It’s not just that admission to an élite college—more than the education a student receives there—provides the foundation of future wealth by creating or, more often, reinforcing social connections. It’s not just that every college in the country, including public schools, makes decisions about infrastructure, curriculum development, hiring, and its very existence on the basis of fund-raising and money-making logic. It’s not just that the process of getting into college grows more stressful—and, consequently, more expensive—with every passing year. It’s not just that the process itself is fundamentally rigged and everyone knows this. It’s all of it.”

Masha Gessen, The New Yorker



“Meritocracy is an illusion—long before an application shows up at a school, the system is legitimately stacked in favor of the wealthy. Kids who aren’t from privileged backgrounds are at a steep disadvantage… Now here, with the government’s case, comes a wave of high net worth parents who allegedly aren’t even making a pretense of their children earning admission—mom and dad are just going to pay, and they’ll pay this underbelly of surrogates allegedly willing to make it happen, because the surrogates want the money, and they know the system is rigged.”

Jason Gay, Wall Street Journal



“The behavior described in this alleged fraud should be punished. But on a broader and more basic level, the case also sheds light on deep inequities in our college admissions system. Because if someone can get their kid into Harvard by buying a building, let alone by committing any of the alleged acts emerging from this case, the scandal isn't just what's illegal, but what's legal as well… There is a separate system of justice for the wealthy. There's also a separate admission system for rich people that's quite legal. But maybe with this indictment, we'll get just a bit closer to changing that unfair status quo.”

`` Mr. Brokaw 's comments are more than just out-of-touch musings , '' the letter said . `` Mr. Brokaw 's comments are part of a legacy of anti-Latino sentiment that is spreading freely in 2019 . ''

`` I feel terrible a part of my comments on Hispanics offended some members of that proud culture , '' he said at the beginning of a series of tweets .
The veteran newsman also said he has `` worked hard to knock down false stereotypes , '' and pointed out that he said in his final comment on Sunday 's `` Meet the Press '' that all sides have to work harder .
Criticism erupted after Brokaw , 78 , commented on Hispanics and assimilation during Sunday 's broadcast of `` Meet the Press . '' He said on the show that his view on assimilation is one he 's been sharing `` for a long time . ''
`` You know , they ought not to be just codified in their communities but make sure that all their kids are learning to speak English , and that they feel comfortable in the communities , '' he said during Sunday 's segment . `` And that 's going to take outreach on both sides [ Republican and Democrat ] , frankly .

`` It really was a punch in the gut to a lot of people , '' he said . `` It was not only factually incorrect , it was also xenophobia in action . ''

As expected , Florence has slowed on its approach to North Carolina and South Carolina , where it 's expected to make landfall late Thursday or early Friday , bombarding communities with torrential rain , high winds and deadly storm surge until Saturday .
Hurricane winds could linger for 24 hours or more , sweeping away trees and power lines while dumping 20 to 30 inches of rain in some coastal areas , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) said . Isolated totals of 40 inches are possible .
Florence was driving sustained winds of 110 mph on Wednesday night and , earlier in the day , had created waves up to 83 feet , the hurricane center said , with the first tropical winds sweeping ashore before noon .
The approach of Florence has put more than 10 million people under storm watches and warnings across three states .
Along the coasts areas , more than 1 million people have been ordered to evacuate . Duke Energy warned that up to 75 percent of its 4 million customers in the Carolinas could lose power .
`` This is not going to be a glancing blow , '' Federal Emergency Management Agency 's Jeff Byard said . `` This is going to be a Mike Tyson punch to the Carolina coast . ''
More : 'Storm of a lifetime ' : storm surge , extreme winds and torrents of rain
The storm , as of 11 p.m. EDT , was about 280 miles east-southeast of Wilmington , North Carolina , and 325 miles east-southeast of Myrtle Beach , South Carolina , moving northwest at 17 mph .
The National Weather Service in Wilmington warned that Florence `` will likely be the storm of a lifetime for portions of the Carolina coast . ''
The NHC stressed that tropical-storm force winds arriving Thursday morning would make outside preparations `` difficult or dangerous . ''
`` Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion , '' the NHC bulletin warned .
After an earlier flirtation with up the coast toward Virginia , the southern turn brings Georgia into the path of the storm . Gov . Nathan Deal declared an emergency Wednesday for all 159 counties . But North Carolina remained a primary target , and Gov . Roy Cooper has ordered an unprecedented evacuation of the state 's barrier islands .
The storm surge alone will flood tens of thousands of structures , Cooper said Wednesday .

Hurricane Florence was downgraded to Category 2 late Wednesday night but remained a clear danger to the East Coast with ""life-threatening"" storm surge and rainfall in the forecast.

As expected, Florence has slowed on its approach to North Carolina and South Carolina, where it's expected to make landfall late Thursday or early Friday, bombarding communities with torrential rain, high winds and deadly storm surge until Saturday.

Hurricane winds could linger for 24 hours or more, sweeping away trees and power lines while dumping 20 to 30 inches of rain in some coastal areas, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. Isolated totals of 40 inches are possible.

Florence was driving sustained winds of 110 mph on Wednesday night and, earlier in the day, had created waves up to 83 feet, the hurricane center said, with the first tropical winds sweeping ashore before noon.

The approach of Florence has put more than 10 million people under storm watches and warnings across three states.

Along the coasts areas, more than 1 million people have been ordered to evacuate. Duke Energy warned that up to 75 percent of its 4 million customers in the Carolinas could lose power.

""This is not going to be a glancing blow,"" Federal Emergency Management Agency's Jeff Byard said. ""This is going to be a Mike Tyson punch to the Carolina coast.""

The storm, as of 11 p.m. EDT, was about 280 miles east-southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina, and 325 miles east-southeast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, moving northwest at 17 mph.

The National Weather Service in Wilmington warned that Florence ""will likely be the storm of a lifetime for portions of the Carolina coast.""

The NHC stressed that tropical-storm force winds arriving Thursday morning would make outside preparations ""difficult or dangerous.""

""Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,"" the NHC bulletin warned.

After an earlier flirtation with up the coast toward Virginia, the southern turn brings Georgia into the path of the storm. Gov. Nathan Deal declared an emergency Wednesday for all 159 counties. But North Carolina remained a primary target, and Gov. Roy Cooper has ordered an unprecedented evacuation of the state's barrier islands.

The storm surge alone will flood tens of thousands of structures, Cooper said Wednesday.

""Every county and every person in North Carolina needs to stay alert and to take this storm seriously,"" Cooper said.

Not everyone was fleeing. In Wilmington, James Waters said he surfed Wednesday morning and was going to stay at his grandparents’ house just across the water from the islands.

“My grandparents are staying, so I figured I would stay and help them,” Waters said. “We’ve been through some hurricanes before. They say this one is supposed to be really bad.”

President Donald Trump again warned people to heed storm warnings on Wednesday, saying Hurricane Florence ""is going to be one of the biggest"" to ever hit the East Coast or the United States as a whole.

There is ""a big situation confronting us,"" Trump said during a White House reception for Congressional Medal of Honor recipients and their families. Trump said his administration is in close contact with state and emergency management officials.

""God bless everybody, and be careful,"" Trump said.

Outside Wilmington, less than two miles from the coast, the Trinity Grove nursing home has stocked extra food, medicine and water for some 100 residents, who will shelter in place.

The facility was built to withstand 140 mile per hours wind, says John Frye, the executive director.

Kay Torrens, 88, who has lived for 25 years in Trinity Grove with her 87-year-old husband, Leo, says she is heading to Virginia to stay with relatives, leaving the facility for the first time ever — and without Leo.

“He’s in good hands. Why would I not trust it?” Torrens said. “I wouldn’t leave him if it wasn’t safe.”

According to Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director , the percentage of people who feel good about the current status of the country , `` has been ticking up the last few times we asked the question .

There is no question that the CNN/ORC survey is out of step of most polls that depict the American public in a fearful and dour mood .

Authorities attributed the magnitude of casualties to the staggering speed with which the fire struck Paradise. Wind-driven flames roared through town so swiftly that residents were forced to flee for their lives. Some victims were found in or around the burned-out wreckage of their vehicles.

Anna Dise, a resident of Butte Creek Canyon west of Paradise, told KRCR TV her father, Gordon Dise, 66, died when he ran back inside to gather belongings and their house collapsed on him.

Dise said she could not flee in her car because the tires had melted. To survive, she hid overnight in a neighbor’s pond with her dogs.

“It was so fast,” Dise recounted of the fire. “I didn’t expect it to move so fast.”

Storms continued to move through Texas and Oklahoma, bringing tornadoes and dumping torrential rains that led to deadly flooding.

Authorities in Oklahoma say four people have died as a result of the storms this weekend. During a press conference, Houston Mayor Annise Parker said authorities had recovered the bodies of at least two people in that city. According to media reports, four other people were killed in weather-related incidents in Texas and at least 12 people are missing.

President Obama called the flooding ""terrible,"" and said he spoke with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott this morning.

""I assured Gov. Abbott that he could count on the help of the federal government,"" he said. ""We have FEMA personnel already on the ground. They are coordinating with Texas emergency management authorities and I will anticipate that there will be some significant requests made to Washington. My pledge to him is that we will expedite those requests.""

Obama also signed a disaster declaration for Oklahoma.

The New York Times reports:

"" 'It had been raining here for weeks, a lovely wet spring after years of drought. The ground was saturated,' said [Louie Bond], a magazine editor and former editor of Wimberley's newspaper. 'The cypress trees along the river are stripped down to bare toothpicks.'

""In Oklahoma, weekend storms killed two people: a firefighter in Claremore, near Tulsa, who was swept into a storm drain Sunday, and a Tulsa woman who died Saturday after her automobile hydroplaned on a highway.""

The Weather Channel reports that some parts of Texas, which if you remember were suffering through a drought not long ago, have received more than 20 inches of rain this month.

Houston got more than 10 inches of rain last night. The Houston Chronicle reports that caused water to pool in city streets and even on highways. Interstate 10, a major east-west thoroughfare in the city was closed this morning and Twitter users sent pictures of cars apparently floating across Interstate 45:

Parker said that while large parts of the city were ""high and dry,"" some highways and neighborhoods were still unappeasable. The Houston mayor called on residents to stay home if they could.

Forecasts call for this weather pattern to continue.

Bizarre details from a nearly 270-page complaint started to trickle out Tuesday , sparking a variety of reactions online .
California resident William Rick Singer was pinpointed as the `` ringleader '' of the scandal , allegedly helping wealthy parents get their children admitted to some of the nation ’ s most elite schools — such as Yale , Georgetown , Stanford , University of Southern California , among others — through bribes , according to unsealed court documents . Some individuals purportedly paid close to $ 6.5 million to secure a place for their children in top tier schools .
FELICITY HUFFMAN , LORI LOUGHLIN AMONG 50 SNARED IN ELITE COLLEGE CHEATING SCAM , AUTHORITIES SAY
Prosecutors said parents paid Singer from 2011 through last month to bribe coaches and administrators to fill slots the universities allocated for new players with his clients ' children , regardless of their athletic ability . Singer also allegedly hired ringers to take college entrance exams and paid off insiders at testing centers to alter students ' scores , according to charging documents .
Read on for some of the most eyebrow-raising events surrounding the case that have captured people 's attention .
In an email discussing her daughter 's approval to receive extra time to take the SAT , Huffman allegedly used the “ Scooby Doo ” phrase “ Ruh Ro ” in an email .
“ Ruh Ro ! Looks like [ my daughter ’ s high school ] wants to provide own proctor , ” she allegedly wrote in an email forwarded to Singer from her daughter ’ s high school counselor .
Huffman and her husband , actor William H. Macy , were accused of taking advantage of the SAT and ACT . Macy was not among those charged Tuesday .
The two parents allegedly helped their daughter with her college admission by making a “ purported charitable contribution of $ 15,000 ... to participate in the college entrance exam cheating scheme , ” the documents said . “ Huffman later made arrangements to pursue the scheme a second time , for her younger daughter , before deciding not to do so . ''
Though authorities said most of the students did n't know their admission to the school was due to a bribe , the children and their parents took part in the scheme in some cases .

In one exchange , however , one of Singer ’ s clients says her daughter is “ not stupid ” and purportedly proceeds to ask : “ How do you do this without telling the kids what you ’ re doing ? ”

The problem ? The student ’ s school apparently did n't have a lacrosse team .","""Desperate Housewives"" star Felicity Huffman and “Full House” alum Lori Loughlin were allegedly among the 50 charged in what is said to be the biggest college admissions scam ever prosecuted by the U.S. Justice Department — but the star-studded suspects aren't the only details that have intrigued the public.

Bizarre details from a nearly 270-page complaint started to trickle out Tuesday, sparking a variety of reactions online.

California resident William Rick Singer was pinpointed as the ""ringleader"" of the scandal, allegedly helping wealthy parents get their children admitted to some of the nation’s most elite schools — such as Yale, Georgetown, Stanford, University of Southern California, among others — through bribes, according to unsealed court documents. Some individuals purportedly paid close to $6.5 million to secure a place for their children in top tier schools.

Prosecutors said parents paid Singer from 2011 through last month to bribe coaches and administrators to fill slots the universities allocated for new players with his clients' children, regardless of their athletic ability. Singer also allegedly hired ringers to take college entrance exams and paid off insiders at testing centers to alter students' scores, according to charging documents.

Read on for some of the most eyebrow-raising events surrounding the case that have captured people's attention.

Huffman's alleged use of “Ruh Ro!” in an email

In an email discussing her daughter's approval to receive extra time to take the SAT, Huffman allegedly used the “Scooby Doo” phrase “Ruh Ro” in an email.

“Ruh Ro! Looks like [my daughter’s high school] wants to provide own proctor,” she allegedly wrote in an email forwarded to Singer from her daughter’s high school counselor.

Huffman and her husband, actor William H. Macy, were accused of taking advantage of the SAT and ACT. Macy was not among those charged Tuesday.

The two parents allegedly helped their daughter with her college admission by making a “purported charitable contribution of $15,000...to participate in the college entrance exam cheating scheme,” the documents said. “Huffman later made arrangements to pursue the scheme a second time, for her younger daughter, before deciding not to do so.""

""She’s not stupid""

Though authorities said most of the students didn't know their admission to the school was due to a bribe, the children and their parents took part in the scheme in some cases.

In one exchange, however, one of Singer’s clients says her daughter is “not stupid” and purportedly proceeds to ask: “How do you do this without telling the kids what you’re doing?”

Creating a fake athletic profile for a “lacrosse player""

In another excerpt from the complaint, Singer, on a call with a client, allegedly spoke about creating a “fake athletic profile” for his client’s son.

The problem? The student’s school apparently didn't have a lacrosse team.

The legislation , known as Assembly Bill 5 ( AB5 ) , was passed in the state Assembly and now heads to Democratic California Gov . Gavin Newsom 's desk .

AB5 would require gig economy workers to be reclassified as employees instead of contractors . The bill passed in the state Assembly in a 61-16 vote , Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez ( D-San Diego ) , the bill 's author , said in a statement . That 's after the bill passed in the state Senate on Tuesday .
Uber and Lyft maintain that AB5 wo n't immediately change independent contractors into employees . Tony West , Uber 's chief legal officer , said on a call with reporters that the bill builds on legal tests already established in California around how drivers should be classified . West said drivers may not necessarily fall under the new rules laid out in AB5 .
`` Under that three-part test , arguably the highest bar is that a company must prove that contractors are doing work 'outside the usual course ' of its business , '' West said . `` Several previous rulings have found that drivers ' work is outside the usual course of Uber 's business , which is serving as a technology platform for several different types of digital marketplaces .

The headline in newspapers one recent weekend read like an April Fool’s joke, but it wasn’t April 1. The Obama administration announced it wants to provide a little more juice to the now-lackluster housing market by bending the home lending rules to make it easier for banks to make loans and marginal buyers to take on a mortgage.

One of the big changes: The Federal Housing Finance Agency will lower down payment requirements from an already absurdly low 5 percent to a ridiculously low 3 percent on many loans that are eligible for federal mortgage insurance assistance.

Here we go again.

Maybe the Obama Democrats should start running billboards across the country announcing: “Uncle Sam is back in the subprime lending game.”

Is the Obama administration actively trying to create the conditions for another housing collapse? What everyone who follows the housing market knows full well is this: The major reason for the millions of home foreclosures during the meltdown was the policy of low down payments on home loans.

One study by researchers at the University of Texas in Dallas looked at some 30 million mortgages issued before the bubble burst and found that “[t]he evidence strongly suggests that the single most important factor is whether the homeowner has negative equity in a house” — i.e., whether they paid a high or low down payment. This study found the down payment was a much stronger prediction of whether a loan would end up in default than the credit score of the borrower.

As the housing bubble kept inflating from 2001 to 2006, aspiring homeowners could walk into a bank or a branch of Countrywide Financial and walk out with home loans with as low as 2.5 percent or 3 percent down payment (including closing costs, which also could be financed through the loan). The Wall Street Journal, Investor’s Business Daily and other free marketeers warned of the insane risk that taxpayers were underwriting on almost $1 trillion in mortgages. They were shouted down as alarmists.

Back then the laws of financial gravity seemed to have been suspended, and when home prices went up, they stayed up. Even if the home ended in foreclosure, with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration providing a near 100 percent taxpayer repayment guarantee on more than 80 percent of the mortgages, there was little downside in issuing very risky loans. Underwriting standards flew out the window. The Bush administration celebrated year after year of rising homeownership rates. Everyone was getting fat and happy.

When prices did start to comply with the laws of gravity and collapsed back to earth in 2007, millions of homeowners were underwater. Many lost 20 percent, 30 percent and sometimes 50 percent on the value of the house — especially in then-red-hot markets such as Florida, Nevada, Arizona and California. Thanks to low down payments, these families suddenly were under water on their mortgages, owing more than the house was worth. With little skin in the game, borrowers walked away from the house, sent the lender the keys (“jingle mail,” as it was called) and let taxpayers take the fall.

Boy, did we. Fannie and Freddie ended up needing more than a $100 billion taxpayer bailout.

So Washington tightened the lending rules. No more “predatory loans,” then-Rep. Barney Frank, Massachusetts Democrat, and his gang declared, which was like saying to lenders: Remember those loans we were encouraging you to make last year? No more of that. The feds even sued banks for making loans the government enticed them to issue in the first place.

Amazingly, Fannie, Freddie and the Federal Housing Administration are again insuring between 90 percent and 95 percent of all new mortgages. Taxpayers are back on the hook for hundreds of billions in new mortgages.

Even those lifelines aren’t enough for the homebuilders, the Realtors, the mortgage banks and left-wing advocacy groups for the poor such as the Center for Responsible Lending.

Now we will get 3 percent down payment mortgages again with taxpayer guarantees. Whoopee. The Federal Housing Finance Agency might even suspend some of the rules that had required higher fees on riskier loans. All of this makes about as much sense as injecting Ebola virus into blood supplies.

The way to prevent another catastrophic housing bubble is obvious. The feds shouldn’t be lowering down payments — they should be raising them. Foreclosures would be a rarity if we went back to the sensible old rule of 20 percent down. Studies show that almost none of the mortgages with 20 percent down went belly up.

The housing lobby protests this rule will price moderate-income buyers out of the market. Wrong. It simply means instead of buying a $250,000 house they can’t afford, they are going to have to buy the $175,000 house they can afford. Homeownership is a very worthy goal, but we don’t do any family or community a favor by pushing buyers into a home they are going to lose.

None of these lessons from the last crisis have taken hold in Washington. The best and the brightest in President Obama’s camp want to roll the dice again and lower, not raise, down payments and ease the credit rules at banks. When sensible people protest this insanity, critics call us fear mongers. That, too, is what the housing lobby said on the eve of the previous housing crisis.

With more than $ 40 billion in assets , the Gates Foundation works on a dizzying array of issues , from eradicating polio to feeding the world to treating HIV to stopping climate change to reforming the US education system .
Gates has also been working , in recent years , on increasing diversity in the technology industry . “ If you [ only ] have products created by white guys in their 20s , you ’ re gon na miss the mark , ” she says .
I sat down with Gates at South by Southwest for an interview that covered a lot of ground . We talked , among other things , about bioterrorism , climate change , the culture of Silicon Valley , the Damore memo about gender and technology , the future of food , the problems money can and can ’ t solve , what makes America culturally distinct , and more . You can listen to the whole interview on my podcast , The Ezra Klein Show . A transcript , edited for length and clarity , follows .
You made a comment about the need for diversity in technology that I wanted to hear you expand on . You said , “ Who ’ s going to be taking care of our elderly two generations from now ? It ’ s going to be AI . But do you want all males in their early 20s and 30s creating the AI that ’ s gon na take care of you when you ’ re older ? ”
What would happen if that AI was created by all males in their 20s and 30s ?
I don ’ t think they ’ d fully understand the needs of older people . You have to spend time in that community to understand what their needs are . I think you would miss a big part of the empathy gene .
The way you treat a young child versus an 18-year-old , 22-year-old , 30-year-old , versus an elderly person , is pretty different . You use a lot of empathy when you ’ re trying to bring a child up and teach them , and it ’ s tricky because you have to use a lot of positivity even when what you ’ re trying to do is correct behavior . But [ it ’ s ] the same thing with an elderly person . It ’ s a horrible thing when you start to lose a little bit of your sight , or you can ’ t drive anymore , and that was your rite of passage when you were younger . I think if you have these products that are created by white guys in their 20s , you ’ re just gon na miss the mark on both empathy and the actual needs of the elderly and what they ’ re facing .
The counterargument you hear to this is “ Well , what we want to do , above all , is hire the best people. ” That feels to me like the real point of friction right now , this question of whether diversity is something people are prioritizing because they ’ re politically correct or because it is something they need to build the best products .
They ’ re leaving opportunities off the table . There ’ s good research now that shows your products are better , you ’ re gon na reach more markets , if you have diversity at the table . Think of the way women use certain tools online versus men . They ’ re often very , very different .
Here ’ s a great example . There was an idea to connect people to nannies and babysitters that came from a female founder . She ran it across Sand Hill Road [ where the big venture capital firms are ] , and nobody understood it . Here ’ s another one that ’ s actually been extraordinarily successful that Ben Horowitz has invested in : hair weaves for black women . It ’ s an enormous market . When that founder went and ran it across Sand Hill Road , the guys totally didn ’ t get it . Ben Horowitz did , and he invested in it . Guess where he grew up ? He went to Berkeley , has an African-American wife .
When you think about the changing demographics we ’ re seeing in this nation , when you think about the workforce today and dual-income families now , it ’ s completely different than when I grew up back in the 1960s . By 2044 , what we call minorities today in our country , when you add them all up , they will be the majority . If you don ’ t have diversity at the table , there ’ s no chance you ’ re gon na see it . You ’ re just not . If you ’ re a VC and you ’ re about deal flow , you ’ re missing all kind of deals , because the deals you ’ re investing in are what you ’ ve known before .
One of the things you ’ ve spoken about is that when you went to school in the 1980s , women got about 37 percent of computer science degrees and 37 percent of law degrees . Women get now 47 percent of the law degrees , but in computer science , it ’ s gone down to 18 percent . What do you think is behind that ?
I dug through the data , and nobody actually knows the answer , but the thesis is that , when I was a kid , all the games were pretty gender-neutral . I played Pong , I played Breakout , I played the adventure games , but when gaming became very combative , and it became about guns and fighting , girls weren ’ t interested in them , and women weren ’ t interested in them .
The people who were interested in creating them were men , so more men poured in , more games came out like that , and women went , “ Oh , so many men in this industry , not interested. ” We know that women , even today , who make it through computer science undergraduate degrees and then go to work for one of the big companies — Google , Amazon , Facebook , Microsoft — they will tell you that if they join a team that ’ s all male , they ’ re just not as comfortable . They will seek out the teams that have two or three women because it makes an enormous difference in how they feel and how they perform .
I see this , and I have data from all over the world . We see this on the village level with women . When 10 women get together , they start to get their voice . They start to demand their rights ; they start to band together to save or to get loans . We see it at the CEO and board level in the United States . You put one woman on a board , nothing is going to change . She assimilates . You put two or three women on a board , they start asking the hard questions . “ Why is it like this ? Why aren ’ t we creating more of this ? What is going on ? What ’ s the latest culture survey ? What does the data say ? ”
I ’ d like you to unpack that gaming idea for me , because I haven ’ t heard this before . I think the counterargument somebody would naturally come up with is , “ Well , is that because men just like video games more ? ”
There ’ s this idea that men are object-oriented and women are people-oriented , and that what you ’ re seeing is a reflection of intrinsic differences within the genders that lead to this divergence . Because law , medicine , these were also exclusionary cultures . The culture of surgeons can be a tough culture to break into . Yet there ’ s some critical mass that happened there .
Even if you look at US surgeons or law partners , women are just now breaking that glass ceiling , and that ’ s because we have this preponderance [ of ] women coming up . To your question , what causes that ?
We have to look at pathways in . If you are Google , Amazon , Microsoft , Facebook , you ’ re hiring from the Ivy Leagues . You ’ re hiring white guys from a particular kind of school , because that ’ s what you know and that ’ s what you see .
There are more pathways into biology at all kinds of universities . You could go to Harvard Medical School even if you went to the University of Georgia , University of Florida .
We have to make sure that colleges craft that first course so it ’ s welcoming to women . In math , or in the sciences and in computer science , we know that women don ’ t like just theoretical problems , but if you open up that first computer science course and it has real-world problems , more women both sign up and stay in computer science afterward .
What did you make of the Jamie Damore memo at Google ?
I don ’ t think it was accurate at all . Will we ever get to 50/50 women in computer science and men ? Maybe not . But you might get to 40 percent . If we get that far , we will be better off than we are , but we can ’ t be where we are today . That just makes no sense .
There ’ s a feeling among many folks in the technology industry that there is a stultifying political correctness descending . Y Combinator ’ s Sam Altman has written about this . People feel that you used to be able to bat around almost any idea , and that was part of what made the American technology sector so great , but now , as people move into this space and try to diversify it , there is a boundary on the conversation that is dangerous . What is your response when you hear that ?
That ’ s called an old boys ’ network . That ’ s a club . I don ’ t like clubs . I mean , come on . You take the walls down , you democratize something , it ’ s better for everybody .
I am not about political correctness . I am not about window dressing . None of those things are gon na work . I ’ m about , how do we take the tools we have and create leverage ?
I say , “ Okay , less than 2 percent of VC funding goes to women ; 0.2 percent of VC funding goes to women of color . Is there a problem there ? Yes. ” What I ’ m doing is not just using my voice ; I ’ m moving my money , and I want a return on my money . I ’ m not doing this for social impact . I want a return , but we ’ re overindexing for women and people of color , and let ’ s see what happens .
Absolutely . If you want peace and security in the world , you don ’ t want a bomb showing up on our doorstep , or bioterrorism event , you don ’ t want Ebola on our doorstep ; you want to create markets and more jobs , yeah . Our voice in the world holds an outsized impact . We need to step up and recognize that and take responsibility for that , and then take the right actions .
When I see what ’ s going on in Nairobi , Kenya — I was just there in January , and their own innovations hubs , they ’ re creating products that not only serve Kenyans , that serve 10 other countries in Africa . When you look at the billionaires who are just starting to come out in Africa , it ’ s because they ’ ve created markets . If we want markets , let ’ s not just think about the United States ; let ’ s create markets , and make the world better for other people , and sell our products out there .
I think the American conversation about what is possible has become narrowed over time . You go back 50 years and the organizing precept was that America ’ s vision of liberal democracy could defeat communism . I don ’ t think when we imagine our role in the world now that there ’ s a shared vision of what we are trying to help create .
Here ’ s my question for you , and you can answer it however you hear it . What world is possible in 2030 ? How will we know if we have succeeded ?
Childhood mortality ’ s been cut in half since 1990 . Cut in half ! That is a phenomenal number . It ’ s going to get cut in half again by 2030 . Maternal deaths , they can get cut substantially .
Another metric is stunting . Stunting is when you ’ re not the right height for your age . If you go back to the statistics in London closer to the turn of the century , people were much , much shorter because they didn ’ t have all the right nutrition . Today in the United States , you see very little stunting .
We have metrics from all over the world where stunting is still happening . You get out of your car in Ethiopia and you don ’ t even have to get the data . You can see the stunting . These kids just aren ’ t nearly as tall as they should be .
One of the things we ’ re working on as a foundation is drought-resistant seeds and flood-resistant seeds , because who ’ s gon na be most affected by climate change ? It ’ s the poor farmers around the world , and when you ’ re out in the fields , they ’ ll talk to you about the rains coming later , coming less often , and , when they come , flooding .
I think infant mortality , maternal mortality , can the world feed itself , and are we getting down the emissions that lead up to climate change ? Are we seeing a good downward trajectory on that ? I think those are four of the big metrics .
When I hear people make the case for pessimism , that case often resolves down to climate change . Why , given the trends on climate change , are you optimistic ?
That ’ s really gon na come down to , “ Do we get inventions that we can invent our way out of some of those things ? ” Warren Buffett always likes to remind us — he ’ s 87 at this point , he ’ s a huge font of wisdom — that back in the time when it was the horse and buggy and we started having cities , you would ’ ve thought we were all gon na drown in shit , and we invented our way out of that problem . When I think about what ’ s coming with autonomous vehicles and what ’ s already starting to be on the road , think about if those were all electric cars !
I struggle with this . I tend to have a lot of faith , when I look back over the past couple of hundred years , that we will innovate our way out of problems . But sometimes I think , “ Is that just the short span of time in which I ’ ve been alive ? Is that letting hope stand in for a plan ? ” How do you know when betting on innovation is a bet that is realistic versus just a way to talk yourself out of being afraid of the problem ?
Bill and I have been at this work now , in the foundation , for 17 years , and I see the numbers in child mortality . I see it when I go out to the developing world . I see the science inside the foundation . I sat in a meeting on Thursday where these scientists have hit on something where it looks like , in probably seven years , we won ’ t have to fertilize plants anymore . For the developing world , where most people in Africa are still subsistence farmers , holy smokes .
If I told you what I see that ’ s coming in HIV or malaria — malaria ’ s been around since the time of the Egyptians , okay ? It ’ s been with us forever , and it ’ s a parasitic disease , it ’ s very hard . We actually have a chance of getting rid of malaria in my lifetime .
Are you talking here about the CRISPR gene drive approach ? When you say what you ’ re seeing coming , what are you seeing coming ? How are we going to destroy malaria ?
We ’ re modifying mosquitoes so they will , in one or two generations , not carry malaria . The females are all the ones that carry malaria . Males don ’ t carry malaria . We can modify the males who mate with the females to become sterile , and over a couple generations , there are not enough males to mate with females , and so you crash the population .
Speaking of gene editing , there are days when I wonder if this period in history will not be remembered for Donald Trump , or whatever else is going on , but that this will be remembered as the period in which we figured out how to take control of the genome and take control of our own evolution , for better or maybe for worse . Is that me having too much Gattaca in the back of my head ?
No . What we ’ re gon na be able to do with the genome , and then with precision medicine and artificial intelligence , we ’ re on the tip of the cusp of where we might go . That ’ s why the ethics pieces in this are deeply important . Bill and I often have this kind of fun debate of , “ If you were entering any field now and you had your choice of going into any field , what field would you go in ? ” He and I both would go into the cross between biology and computer science . What is gon na happen in those fields , we ’ re only beginning .
Take the spread of disease around the world . People go work in a forest somewhere , we couldn ’ t figure out why the malaria kept coming back in the village after we ’ d eliminated it , well there ’ s a forest kind of malaria . Now we can do modeling of the mosquitoes and how they move around , what distance they go . We can look at GPS data to see how people are moving around , and then you can apply very specific tools ; bed nets in a certain area of malaria , medicines in a certain area . Eventually , hopefully , a vaccine ; eventually you ’ ll be able to release mosquitoes , genetically modified mosquitoes .
We haven ’ t even done the machine learning piece on that yet . Then you cross that with the biology of what we ’ re learning about the human body . What we don ’ t know yet about our guts is mind-blowing . What we are just learning about the gut microbiome , and , to be frank , but the vaginal microbiome .
We don ’ t know why certain people in the world uptake HIV quicker , why certain women contract it more from men . It ’ s not just about the population and the amount of sex that ’ s happening ; it actually has something to do with their vaginal microbiome , we ’ ve just recently learned .
No one has ever really done a full-scale study of breast milk . One of the things that we just hit on that we ’ re learning is the human body sends messages to the child ’ s immune system through breast milk . Who knew that ?
Let me ask you about a place where some of these trends converge . As we pull people and countries out of poverty , they buy more cars , they eat a lot more meat . How do you keep rising prosperity globally , which hopefully we will continue to see more of , from becoming a runaway climate problem ?
Okay , well , the biggest problem is if you get overpopulation . Bill and I had this false assumption . We thought that as more children survive , a parent is going to have more of them . Luckily , the converse is true . When parents see that two of their children will survive in the developing world and grow up to be healthy , they naturally bring down the number of children they have .
I think if we bring the population down , we make it voluntary , then , to be honest , it ’ s not going to matter what car you sell them . In 10 years , you ’ re gon na be selling them a car that doesn ’ t have a motor , right ? You ’ re gon na be selling them an electric car . One of the things Bill ’ s been very vocal about is he ’ s working with some VC companies on meatless meat . It ’ s all plant-based . Eventually , I think , we will get taste in meat down to a point where people will eat a plant-based meat and feel like , “ Hey , this is just as good as the meat I ’ m eating . ”
What are the biggest global risks in the next 10 years ? What are the things that you are afraid of ?
A bioterrorist event could spread so quickly , and we are so unprepared for it . So unprepared .
Yeah . Think about how global the US is . If you had something that could spread fast , and you brought it into New York , and especially if it ’ s what we call latent — you don ’ t see whatever the disease was for even 24 or 48 hours — think of the number of people that leave New York every day and go all over the world . We ’ re an interconnected world .
That ’ s why I don ’ t like to answer it , and I don ’ t talk about it very much .
Over the course of your travels , what have you come to believe is culturally distinct about America ?
I don ’ t really think the US is as culturally distinct as we think we are . Honestly . I think we think more of ourselves than we should . When I travel around the world , the thing that has struck me time and time and time again is how similar we are .
I meet people of all income levels in countries all over the world — we are so the same . We care about many of the same things . We care about our children , we care about our safety , we care about having some economic opportunity so that we can rise to our fullest potential , as can our kids . It ’ s the same anywhere I go .
I if ask a man or a woman farmer who lives a mile and a half out on a dirt road , and I say to them , “ Okay , what are your hopes and dreams for your family ? ” they always talk about education for their kids , always . I think , “ God , that ’ s the same thing my parents wanted for me , it ’ s the same thing I want for my kids . ”
We think we ’ re so unique , and we ’ re not . To be frank , we ’ re lucky . We ’ re lucky . If you grew up in this country , to have the road infrastructure that we have , to have our health system — which is imperfect , but for the most part , most people have access to decent health here — we ’ re lucky .
I want to ask you about a way in which your experience has been unique . You are one of the richest human beings who has ever lived , and that happened at a certain moment in your life . As you ’ ve gone through that experience , what problems in your life have you found that money can solve , and what problems can it not solve ?
I grew up in a very middle-income family in Dallas , Texas . I have three siblings . It was very difficult for my parents to put us through college . We could see that , but they were insistent that all four of us would go to college and they would figure out a way to pay for it , which is a very powerful message from your parents .
As I ’ ve come into this situation that I can ’ t believe I find myself in , the thing that I always come back to is it ’ s about your values . Values , values , values . Everything that I am about is about trying to live out my values and trying to teach my kids our values , and to question , do we have the right values ? Are we living up to those ? I don ’ t think that changes . Low , middle , or high income , if you have good values and you live and teach those , you ’ re gon na get off track here and there , your kids are gon na get off track here and there , but you ’ re gon na be basically okay .
One thing when you ’ re wealthy is you have lots of choices in life about who will serve up what to you , how you spend your time . You see some of those kids are actually very unhealthy , because the parents aren ’ t home , they ’ re busy out doing other things . I really try to make sure our kids have a diverse set of friends , and we ’ re lucky enough to be able to travel . They have gotten to go on safari in Kenya , but boy have they spent a lot of time seeing poverty in Kenya , and South Africa , and Tanzania , because to me , it ’ s important they see the whole world , not this little just pinprick of where they live in Seattle .
What are three books you ’ ve read over the years that you would recommend that others read ?
I would say Sapiens , for sure . Love that book . Cry , the Beloved Country , by Alan Paton , definitely changed some of my views about the world . And then the other one I would say — my husband and I often read books and then pass them to each other , and this one is currently his favorite book , so I ’ m reading it , and I ’ m loving it , but I ’ m only a quarter way through : Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker .","Melinda Gates is the co-founder and co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the largest private foundation in the United States. With more than $40 billion in assets, the Gates Foundation works on a dizzying array of issues, from eradicating polio to feeding the world to treating HIV to stopping climate change to reforming the US education system.

Gates has also been working, in recent years, on increasing diversity in the technology industry. “If you [only] have products created by white guys in their 20s, you’re gonna miss the mark,” she says.

I sat down with Gates at South by Southwest for an interview that covered a lot of ground. We talked, among other things, about bioterrorism, climate change, the culture of Silicon Valley, the Damore memo about gender and technology, the future of food, the problems money can and can’t solve, what makes America culturally distinct, and more. You can listen to the whole interview on my podcast, The Ezra Klein Show. A transcript, edited for length and clarity, follows.

Ezra Klein

You made a comment about the need for diversity in technology that I wanted to hear you expand on. You said, “Who’s going to be taking care of our elderly two generations from now? It’s going to be AI. But do you want all males in their early 20s and 30s creating the AI that’s gonna take care of you when you’re older?”

What would happen if that AI was created by all males in their 20s and 30s?

Melinda Gates

I don’t think they’d fully understand the needs of older people. You have to spend time in that community to understand what their needs are. I think you would miss a big part of the empathy gene.

The way you treat a young child versus an 18-year-old, 22-year-old, 30-year-old, versus an elderly person, is pretty different. You use a lot of empathy when you’re trying to bring a child up and teach them, and it’s tricky because you have to use a lot of positivity even when what you’re trying to do is correct behavior. But [it’s] the same thing with an elderly person. It’s a horrible thing when you start to lose a little bit of your sight, or you can’t drive anymore, and that was your rite of passage when you were younger. I think if you have these products that are created by white guys in their 20s, you’re just gonna miss the mark on both empathy and the actual needs of the elderly and what they’re facing.

Ezra Klein

The counterargument you hear to this is “Well, what we want to do, above all, is hire the best people.” That feels to me like the real point of friction right now, this question of whether diversity is something people are prioritizing because they’re politically correct or because it is something they need to build the best products.

Melinda Gates

They’re leaving opportunities off the table. There’s good research now that shows your products are better, you’re gonna reach more markets, if you have diversity at the table. Think of the way women use certain tools online versus men. They’re often very, very different.

Here’s a great example. There was an idea to connect people to nannies and babysitters that came from a female founder. She ran it across Sand Hill Road [where the big venture capital firms are], and nobody understood it. Here’s another one that’s actually been extraordinarily successful that Ben Horowitz has invested in: hair weaves for black women. It’s an enormous market. When that founder went and ran it across Sand Hill Road, the guys totally didn’t get it. Ben Horowitz did, and he invested in it. Guess where he grew up? He went to Berkeley, has an African-American wife.

When you think about the changing demographics we’re seeing in this nation, when you think about the workforce today and dual-income families now, it’s completely different than when I grew up back in the 1960s. By 2044, what we call minorities today in our country, when you add them all up, they will be the majority. If you don’t have diversity at the table, there’s no chance you’re gonna see it. You’re just not. If you’re a VC and you’re about deal flow, you’re missing all kind of deals, because the deals you’re investing in are what you’ve known before.

Ezra Klein

One of the things you’ve spoken about is that when you went to school in the 1980s, women got about 37 percent of computer science degrees and 37 percent of law degrees. Women get now 47 percent of the law degrees, but in computer science, it’s gone down to 18 percent. What do you think is behind that?

Melinda Gates

I dug through the data, and nobody actually knows the answer, but the thesis is that, when I was a kid, all the games were pretty gender-neutral. I played Pong, I played Breakout, I played the adventure games, but when gaming became very combative, and it became about guns and fighting, girls weren’t interested in them, and women weren’t interested in them.

The people who were interested in creating them were men, so more men poured in, more games came out like that, and women went, “Oh, so many men in this industry, not interested.” We know that women, even today, who make it through computer science undergraduate degrees and then go to work for one of the big companies — Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft — they will tell you that if they join a team that’s all male, they’re just not as comfortable. They will seek out the teams that have two or three women because it makes an enormous difference in how they feel and how they perform.

I see this, and I have data from all over the world. We see this on the village level with women. When 10 women get together, they start to get their voice. They start to demand their rights; they start to band together to save or to get loans. We see it at the CEO and board level in the United States. You put one woman on a board, nothing is going to change. She assimilates. You put two or three women on a board, they start asking the hard questions. “Why is it like this? Why aren’t we creating more of this? What is going on? What’s the latest culture survey? What does the data say?”

Ezra Klein

I’d like you to unpack that gaming idea for me, because I haven’t heard this before. I think the counterargument somebody would naturally come up with is, “Well, is that because men just like video games more?”

There’s this idea that men are object-oriented and women are people-oriented, and that what you’re seeing is a reflection of intrinsic differences within the genders that lead to this divergence. Because law, medicine, these were also exclusionary cultures. The culture of surgeons can be a tough culture to break into. Yet there’s some critical mass that happened there.

Melinda Gate

Even if you look at US surgeons or law partners, women are just now breaking that glass ceiling, and that’s because we have this preponderance [of] women coming up. To your question, what causes that?

We have to look at pathways in. If you are Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, you’re hiring from the Ivy Leagues. You’re hiring white guys from a particular kind of school, because that’s what you know and that’s what you see.

There are more pathways into biology at all kinds of universities. You could go to Harvard Medical School even if you went to the University of Georgia, University of Florida.

We have to make sure that colleges craft that first course so it’s welcoming to women. In math, or in the sciences and in computer science, we know that women don’t like just theoretical problems, but if you open up that first computer science course and it has real-world problems, more women both sign up and stay in computer science afterward.

Ezra Klein

What did you make of the Jamie Damore memo at Google?

Melinda Gates

I don’t think it was accurate at all. Will we ever get to 50/50 women in computer science and men? Maybe not. But you might get to 40 percent. If we get that far, we will be better off than we are, but we can’t be where we are today. That just makes no sense.

Ezra Klein

There’s a feeling among many folks in the technology industry that there is a stultifying political correctness descending. Y Combinator’s Sam Altman has written about this. People feel that you used to be able to bat around almost any idea, and that was part of what made the American technology sector so great, but now, as people move into this space and try to diversify it, there is a boundary on the conversation that is dangerous. What is your response when you hear that?

Melinda Gates

That’s called an old boys’ network. That’s a club. I don’t like clubs. I mean, come on. You take the walls down, you democratize something, it’s better for everybody.

I am not about political correctness. I am not about window dressing. None of those things are gonna work. I’m about, how do we take the tools we have and create leverage?

I say, “Okay, less than 2 percent of VC funding goes to women; 0.2 percent of VC funding goes to women of color. Is there a problem there? Yes.” What I’m doing is not just using my voice; I’m moving my money, and I want a return on my money. I’m not doing this for social impact. I want a return, but we’re overindexing for women and people of color, and let’s see what happens.

What the world could look like in 2030

Ezra Klein

Is there a self-interested case for American foreign aid?

Melinda Gates

Absolutely. If you want peace and security in the world, you don’t want a bomb showing up on our doorstep, or bioterrorism event, you don’t want Ebola on our doorstep; you want to create markets and more jobs, yeah. Our voice in the world holds an outsized impact. We need to step up and recognize that and take responsibility for that, and then take the right actions.

When I see what’s going on in Nairobi, Kenya — I was just there in January, and their own innovations hubs, they’re creating products that not only serve Kenyans, that serve 10 other countries in Africa. When you look at the billionaires who are just starting to come out in Africa, it’s because they’ve created markets. If we want markets, let’s not just think about the United States; let’s create markets, and make the world better for other people, and sell our products out there.

Ezra Klein

I think the American conversation about what is possible has become narrowed over time. You go back 50 years and the organizing precept was that America’s vision of liberal democracy could defeat communism. I don’t think when we imagine our role in the world now that there’s a shared vision of what we are trying to help create.

One of the things we’re working on as a foundation is drought-resistant seeds and flood-resistant seeds, because who’s gonna be most affected by climate change? It’s the poor farmers around the world, and when you’re out in the fields, they’ll talk to you about the rains coming later, coming less often, and, when they come, flooding.

I think infant mortality, maternal mortality, can the world feed itself, and are we getting down the emissions that lead up to climate change? Are we seeing a good downward trajectory on that? I think those are four of the big metrics.

Ezra Klein

When I hear people make the case for pessimism, that case often resolves down to climate change. Why, given the trends on climate change, are you optimistic?

Melinda Gates

That’s really gonna come down to, “Do we get inventions that we can invent our way out of some of those things?” Warren Buffett always likes to remind us — he’s 87 at this point, he’s a huge font of wisdom — that back in the time when it was the horse and buggy and we started having cities, you would’ve thought we were all gonna drown in shit, and we invented our way out of that problem. When I think about what’s coming with autonomous vehicles and what’s already starting to be on the road, think about if those were all electric cars!

Ezra Klein

I struggle with this. I tend to have a lot of faith, when I look back over the past couple of hundred years, that we will innovate our way out of problems. But sometimes I think, “Is that just the short span of time in which I’ve been alive? Is that letting hope stand in for a plan?” How do you know when betting on innovation is a bet that is realistic versus just a way to talk yourself out of being afraid of the problem?

Bill and I have been at this work now, in the foundation, for 17 years, and I see the numbers in child mortality. I see it when I go out to the developing world. I see the science inside the foundation. I sat in a meeting on Thursday where these scientists have hit on something where it looks like, in probably seven years, we won’t have to fertilize plants anymore. For the developing world, where most people in Africa are still subsistence farmers, holy smokes.

If I told you what I see that’s coming in HIV or malaria — malaria’s been around since the time of the Egyptians, okay? It’s been with us forever, and it’s a parasitic disease, it’s very hard. We actually have a chance of getting rid of malaria in my lifetime.

Ezra Klein

We can modify the males who mate with the females to become sterile, and over a couple generations, there are not enough males to mate with females, and so you crash the population.

Where the next breakthroughs will come from

Ezra Klein

Speaking of gene editing, there are days when I wonder if this period in history will not be remembered for Donald Trump, or whatever else is going on, but that this will be remembered as the period in which we figured out how to take control of the genome and take control of our own evolution, for better or maybe for worse. Is that me having too much Gattaca in the back of my head?

Melinda Gates

No. What we’re gonna be able to do with the genome, and then with precision medicine and artificial intelligence, we’re on the tip of the cusp of where we might go. That’s why the ethics pieces in this are deeply important. Bill and I often have this kind of fun debate of, “If you were entering any field now and you had your choice of going into any field, what field would you go in?” He and I both would go into the cross between biology and computer science. What is gonna happen in those fields, we’re only beginning.

Ezra Klein

Tell me a bit about that.

Melinda Gates

Take the spread of disease around the world. People go work in a forest somewhere, we couldn’t figure out why the malaria kept coming back in the village after we’d eliminated it, well there’s a forest kind of malaria. Now we can do modeling of the mosquitoes and how they move around, what distance they go. We can look at GPS data to see how people are moving around, and then you can apply very specific tools; bed nets in a certain area of malaria, medicines in a certain area. Eventually, hopefully, a vaccine; eventually you’ll be able to release mosquitoes, genetically modified mosquitoes.

We haven’t even done the machine learning piece on that yet. Then you cross that with the biology of what we’re learning about the human body. What we don’t know yet about our guts is mind-blowing. What we are just learning about the gut microbiome, and, to be frank, but the vaginal microbiome.

We don’t know why certain people in the world uptake HIV quicker, why certain women contract it more from men. It’s not just about the population and the amount of sex that’s happening; it actually has something to do with their vaginal microbiome, we’ve just recently learned.

No one has ever really done a full-scale study of breast milk. One of the things that we just hit on that we’re learning is the human body sends messages to the child’s immune system through breast milk. Who knew that?

Ezra Klein

Let me ask you about a place where some of these trends converge. As we pull people and countries out of poverty, they buy more cars, they eat a lot more meat. How do you keep rising prosperity globally, which hopefully we will continue to see more of, from becoming a runaway climate problem?

Melinda Gates

Okay, well, the biggest problem is if you get overpopulation. Bill and I had this false assumption. We thought that as more children survive, a parent is going to have more of them. Luckily, the converse is true. When parents see that two of their children will survive in the developing world and grow up to be healthy, they naturally bring down the number of children they have.

I think if we bring the population down, we make it voluntary, then, to be honest, it’s not going to matter what car you sell them. In 10 years, you’re gonna be selling them a car that doesn’t have a motor, right? You’re gonna be selling them an electric car. One of the things Bill’s been very vocal about is he’s working with some VC companies on meatless meat. It’s all plant-based. Eventually, I think, we will get taste in meat down to a point where people will eat a plant-based meat and feel like, “Hey, this is just as good as the meat I’m eating.”

Ezra Klein

What are the biggest global risks in the next 10 years? What are the things that you are afraid of?

Melinda Gates

A bioterrorism event. Definitely. Most definitely.

Ezra Klein

Why is that at the top of your list?

Melinda Gates

A bioterrorist event could spread so quickly, and we are so unprepared for it. So unprepared.

Ezra Klein

Even now?

Melinda Gates

Yeah. Think about how global the US is. If you had something that could spread fast, and you brought it into New York, and especially if it’s what we call latent — you don’t see whatever the disease was for even 24 or 48 hours — think of the number of people that leave New York every day and go all over the world. We’re an interconnected world.

Ezra Klein

That is a genuinely scary answer to that question.

That’s why I don’t like to answer it, and I don’t talk about it very much.

America is less distinct than we think

Ezra Klein

Over the course of your travels, what have you come to believe is culturally distinct about America?

Melinda Gates

I don’t really think the US is as culturally distinct as we think we are. Honestly. I think we think more of ourselves than we should. When I travel around the world, the thing that has struck me time and time and time again is how similar we are.

I meet people of all income levels in countries all over the world — we are so the same. We care about many of the same things. We care about our children, we care about our safety, we care about having some economic opportunity so that we can rise to our fullest potential, as can our kids. It’s the same anywhere I go.

I if ask a man or a woman farmer who lives a mile and a half out on a dirt road, and I say to them, “Okay, what are your hopes and dreams for your family?” they always talk about education for their kids, always. I think, “God, that’s the same thing my parents wanted for me, it’s the same thing I want for my kids.”

We think we’re so unique, and we’re not. To be frank, we’re lucky. We’re lucky. If you grew up in this country, to have the road infrastructure that we have, to have our health system — which is imperfect, but for the most part, most people have access to decent health here — we’re lucky.

Ezra Klein

I want to ask you about a way in which your experience has been unique. You are one of the richest human beings who has ever lived, and that happened at a certain moment in your life. As you’ve gone through that experience, what problems in your life have you found that money can solve, and what problems can it not solve?

Melinda Gates

I grew up in a very middle-income family in Dallas, Texas. I have three siblings. It was very difficult for my parents to put us through college. We could see that, but they were insistent that all four of us would go to college and they would figure out a way to pay for it, which is a very powerful message from your parents.

As I’ve come into this situation that I can’t believe I find myself in, the thing that I always come back to is it’s about your values. Values, values, values. Everything that I am about is about trying to live out my values and trying to teach my kids our values, and to question, do we have the right values? Are we living up to those? I don’t think that changes. Low, middle, or high income, if you have good values and you live and teach those, you’re gonna get off track here and there, your kids are gonna get off track here and there, but you’re gonna be basically okay.

One thing when you’re wealthy is you have lots of choices in life about who will serve up what to you, how you spend your time. You see some of those kids are actually very unhealthy, because the parents aren’t home, they’re busy out doing other things. I really try to make sure our kids have a diverse set of friends, and we’re lucky enough to be able to travel. They have gotten to go on safari in Kenya, but boy have they spent a lot of time seeing poverty in Kenya, and South Africa, and Tanzania, because to me, it’s important they see the whole world, not this little just pinprick of where they live in Seattle.

Ezra Klein

What are three books you’ve read over the years that you would recommend that others read?

Melinda Gates

I would say Sapiens, for sure. Love that book. Cry, the Beloved Country, by Alan Paton, definitely changed some of my views about the world. And then the other one I would say — my husband and I often read books and then pass them to each other, and this one is currently his favorite book, so I’m reading it, and I’m loving it, but I’m only a quarter way through: Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker.",www.vox.com,left,Ac1aMd78dBuJ3wma

A 13-year-old Wisconsin girl missing since her parents were discovered shot dead in their home three months ago has been found, malnourished and dirty, after fleeing her captor in a remote community.

Jayme Closs escaped a remote house on Thursday, fleeing on foot to be found by a woman who was walking her dog. The 13-year-old was taken into police custody after the woman stopped at a nearby home to call police. She was reunited with her family on Friday after talking to investigators.

Investigators named the suspect as Jake Thomas Patterson, 21, and announced kidnapping and murder charges on Friday. Police said Patterson planned his actions and took steps to keep himself from being seen.

Patterson was found down the road from the house from which Jayme escaped and was arrested based on a description of his vehicle the teenager was able to provide, police said. Authorities believe he was out looking for the girl when he was taken into custody.

The Barron county sheriff, Chris Fitzgerald, said investigators were still trying to determine what Jayme had experienced and establish why Patterson appeared to have been determined to abduct her.

“The will of a kid to survive – it’s unthinkable,” said Fitzgerald, who was emotional after spending 88 days trying to find the teenager.

Fitzgerald said that as of Friday morning, there was no indication Patterson had a relationship with the family, nor was there evidence he had social media contact with Jayme. He said Patterson did have a tie to Jayme’s hometown, Barron, but would not elaborate on the connection. He also said Patterson had changed his appearance before the attack and abduction in October and had shaved his head so that he wouldn’t leave hair behind.

“This case remains very active as we stand before you today,” said Fitzgerald.

Despite receiving thousands of tips concerning Jayme’s disappearance, police said the search was made more difficult by steps the suspect took to keep himself from being seen by police and the public.

“It’s a remote area, there isn’t a lot of houses in that area,” Fitzgerald said. “He not only concealed his identity from us, it appears he concealed her from other people, also his friends.”

Investigators questioned Patterson, who is unemployed and has no criminal history locally or in the state of Wisconsin, on Friday morning. The house in which Jayme had most recently been held was searched.

Investigators said it was not yet clear if Jayme had been in the same house for the entire three months of her disappearance or if she was abused by her captor.

The local district attorney’s office said it planned to issue a criminal complaint next week.

Sue Allard, Jayme’s aunt, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune she could barely express her joy after hearing the news on Thursday night.

“Praise the Lord,” Allard said, between sobs. “It’s the news we’ve been waiting on for three months. I can’t wait to get my arms around her. I just can’t wait.”

Police said they were not looking for additional suspects and that no one else had been found in the residence from which Jayme escaped.

Gertie , it seemed , kept escaping from her yard . Neighbors , concerned for the goat , took the animal into custody – or , in the owner ’ s eyes , kidnapped her .
But it wasn ’ t until Mr. Costello arrived on the scene that the real complication arose : The owner admitted that he had illegally “ just smoked a joint . ”
Costello , the Atlanta Police Department ’ s officer of the year , kept his wits about him , solved the spat , and chose not to cart the pot-smoking goatherd into the precinct .
“ I don ’ t care what the guy does in his own house , but that a goat can cause such a commotion in a community , well , maybe there ’ s something we , as a police department , can help with there , ” he said of his intervention .
Sure , it was the kind of moment that most Americans don ’ t ever see : a well-trained officer using discretion and courtesy to turn a potentially tense situation into one where , in the end , there are smiles and a sense of resolution .
Yet there is something deeper in the simple exchange . Even at a time when cops say they feel under siege amid perceptions of anti-police bias , a study released this week underscores evolving attitudes among police officers . It suggests the nature of police work in America might be beginning to shift from the militarized force geared to the get-tough-on-crime 1990s to a sense of “ policing by consent ” amid historically low crime .
The Pew Research Center ’ s “ Behind the Badge ” survey of 8,000 police officers shows that while racial attitudes persist – especially in how events and suspicions are perceived – a solid majority of police officers are aligned with the general public on the root causes of discontent , including the need for more training , tougher discipline toward rogue cops , emphasis on de-escalation , decriminalization of recreational drugs , and broader societal focus on mental health .
“ The situation on the ground is improving … in part because of the scrutiny policing has been getting , ” says Jack Glaser , a social psychologist at University of California at Berkeley .
That scrutiny has also created tension . Three of 4 sworn officers said declining relations with minority communities has made officers less willing to stop and question suspects and use force when they deem necessary .
“ There ’ s a perception that police are less likely to do the marginal additional policing that suppresses crime – the getting out of your car at two in the morning and saying to a group of guys , ‘ Hey , what are you doing here ? ’ ” Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said last year .
Two-thirds said they have been verbally abused by a member of the community during the past month . But 8 of 10 also say they have been thanked by a member of the community .
Gratitude toward police officers “ is at the highest level we ’ ve seen it since 9/11 , ” says Bill Johnson , executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations .
Mr. Johnson says that trend reflects that “ police departments in general are willing to accept and profit by constructive criticism , ” but it also suggests that “ the public don ’ t want a surrender of public safety on our streets . ”
Instead , “ they ’ re searching for a level of confidence that police are [ treating all citizens ] in an ethical and just manner . ”
Finding that right balance has led to confusion at the beat level about what officers are really out there doing . A few years ago , a sign outside a Cleveland precinct that said `` Forward Operating Base '' seemed natural . Today , equating a tough American neighborhood with a war-torn Afghan village seems inappropriate , at least according to a Department of Justice report that cited the sign .
“ From the officers ' perspectives , most of what they 're doing is patrolling and responding to calls for service , ” says Professor Glaser .
What ’ s coming to the fore is “ the perspective of people in the community , particularly blacks , where most of their contact with the police is unpleasant ( being stopped , questioned , or searched ) . Even casual , non-enforcement contacts with police are likely unpleasant for minorities because they know they are regarded with greater suspicion . ”
That has spread the idea that sometimes less can be more in policing . For example , New York City has backed off its “ stop and frisk ” policy , which allowed officers to stop people based only on minimal suspicions . Crime has continued to drop even after the program was curtailed .
Indeed , the debate over militarized versus “ consent ” -style policing is helping police officers properly define what constitutes a good stop – meaning one which actually solves or prevents a crime .
“ Police training needs to be better in terms of helping officers understand when it is or is not appropriate to stop and question someone , ” says Delores Jones-Brown , a criminologist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and author of “ Policing and Minority Communities : Bridging the gap . ”
There are signs that understanding could be growing . Nine of 10 officers say it ’ s at least somewhat important to understand the people and culture of their beats in order to actually be effective crime-fighters . Only 3 of 10 view their patrol areas as hostile territories , with the majority of cops believing that at least some of the residents of those neighborhoods share their values .
“ In the long term , these [ attitude shifts ] will be reflected in improved public attitudes toward the police , ” says Glaser , in an email . “ But we shouldn ’ t expect this to be instantaneous . Just as police stereotypes of minorities as prone to crime and violence are hard to attenuate , so will public perceptions of police be . ”","On a sunny day last fall, Atlanta Police Officer Mike Costello had to decide whether a goat rescue mission would turn into a drug sting.

Costello, the Atlanta Police Department’s officer of the year, kept his wits about him, solved the spat, and chose not to cart the pot-smoking goatherd into the precinct.

“I don’t care what the guy does in his own house, but that a goat can cause such a commotion in a community, well, maybe there’s something we, as a police department, can help with there,” he said of his intervention.

Sure, it was the kind of moment that most Americans don’t ever see: a well-trained officer using discretion and courtesy to turn a potentially tense situation into one where, in the end, there are smiles and a sense of resolution.

Yet there is something deeper in the simple exchange. Even at a time when cops say they feel under siege amid perceptions of anti-police bias, a study released this week underscores evolving attitudes among police officers. It suggests the nature of police work in America might be beginning to shift from the militarized force geared to the get-tough-on-crime 1990s to a sense of “policing by consent” amid historically low crime.

The Pew Research Center’s “Behind the Badge” survey of 8,000 police officers shows that while racial attitudes persist – especially in how events and suspicions are perceived – a solid majority of police officers are aligned with the general public on the root causes of discontent, including the need for more training, tougher discipline toward rogue cops, emphasis on de-escalation, decriminalization of recreational drugs, and broader societal focus on mental health.

“The situation on the ground is improving … in part because of the scrutiny policing has been getting,” says Jack Glaser, a social psychologist at University of California at Berkeley.

Finding a balance

That scrutiny has also created tension. Three of 4 sworn officers said declining relations with minority communities has made officers less willing to stop and question suspects and use force when they deem necessary.

“There’s a perception that police are less likely to do the marginal additional policing that suppresses crime – the getting out of your car at two in the morning and saying to a group of guys, ‘Hey, what are you doing here?’ ” Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said last year.

Two-thirds said they have been verbally abused by a member of the community during the past month. But 8 of 10 also say they have been thanked by a member of the community.

Gratitude toward police officers “is at the highest level we’ve seen it since 9/11,” says Bill Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations.

Mr. Johnson says that trend reflects that “police departments in general are willing to accept and profit by constructive criticism,” but it also suggests that “the public don’t want a surrender of public safety on our streets.”

Instead, “they’re searching for a level of confidence that police are [treating all citizens] in an ethical and just manner.”

Finding that right balance has led to confusion at the beat level about what officers are really out there doing. A few years ago, a sign outside a Cleveland precinct that said ""Forward Operating Base"" seemed natural. Today, equating a tough American neighborhood with a war-torn Afghan village seems inappropriate, at least according to a Department of Justice report that cited the sign.

“From the officers' perspectives, most of what they're doing is patrolling and responding to calls for service,” says Professor Glaser.

What’s coming to the fore is “the perspective of people in the community, particularly blacks, where most of their contact with the police is unpleasant (being stopped, questioned, or searched). Even casual, non-enforcement contacts with police are likely unpleasant for minorities because they know they are regarded with greater suspicion.”

Can less be more?

That has spread the idea that sometimes less can be more in policing. For example, New York City has backed off its “stop and frisk” policy, which allowed officers to stop people based only on minimal suspicions. Crime has continued to drop even after the program was curtailed.

Indeed, the debate over militarized versus “consent”-style policing is helping police officers properly define what constitutes a good stop – meaning one which actually solves or prevents a crime.

“Police training needs to be better in terms of helping officers understand when it is or is not appropriate to stop and question someone,” says Delores Jones-Brown, a criminologist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and author of “Policing and Minority Communities: Bridging the gap.”

There are signs that understanding could be growing. Nine of 10 officers say it’s at least somewhat important to understand the people and culture of their beats in order to actually be effective crime-fighters. Only 3 of 10 view their patrol areas as hostile territories, with the majority of cops believing that at least some of the residents of those neighborhoods share their values.

“In the long term, these [attitude shifts] will be reflected in improved public attitudes toward the police,” says Glaser, in an email. “But we shouldn’t expect this to be instantaneous. Just as police stereotypes of minorities as prone to crime and violence are hard to attenuate, so will public perceptions of police be.”",www.csmonitor.com,center,gQWt7SFyL5VurO5A

By using the president ’ s pardon powers and shortening the prison sentences of 330 prison inmates convicted of drug crimes , he made Thursday the biggest use of clemency by a president in a single day in US history — breaking a record he himself set earlier in the week .
It ’ s the culmination of a year-long effort to use the president ’ s clemency power to get hundreds of people — most of them nonviolent drug offenders — out of prison sooner . And it tops off another presidential record : With 1,927 people granted some form of clemency , Obama has used his clemency powers more than any president since Harry Truman ( excluding Gerald Ford ’ s clemency for thousands of Vietnam War draft dodgers ) .
Depending on how you look at it , Obama ’ s effort in the twilight of his presidency is either a historic act of criminal justice reform — or too little too late . Obama ’ s rejected thousands of petitions for reduced sentences , and there are still thousands more waiting for review — and the Trump administration , under Attorney General–nominee Jeff Sessions , is extremely unlikely to give them a second look .
The Thursday actions are the last batch of clemency approvals that Obama will grant . But while it ’ s now clear that Obama ’ s done something very significant indeed , it ’ s also near-certain that it will , in some ways , fall short .
The president ’ s power of clemency — which includes both officially absolving people with criminal convictions of their crimes ( pardons ) and reducing sentences of people currently incarcerated ( commutations ) — is established in the Constitution , and it ’ s very broad . So even though pardons and commutations are given to individual people , it ’ s arguably the most direct tool the president has to reduce mass incarceration if he so chooses .
In the last year of his presidency , Obama has stepped up to the plate . He ’ s used the pardon power to reduce more sentences than any other president — thanks almost entirely to his administration ’ s actions over the past year .
Obama ’ s been a critic of mass incarceration , or at least of disproportionate sentences for drug crimes ( which are the most common type of crime among federal prisoners ) , since he came into office . But for the first several years of his presidency , he was historically stingy in using the pardon power to help prisoners he claimed were serving unfair sentences .
The change from then to now is a story of how easy it is for a single federal official to slow down a process — and how hard it is for a single official to speed it up .
For the first term of his presidency , the head of the Office of the Pardon Attorney was a “ tough-on-crime ” holdover from the George W. Bush administration . The chief pardon attorney was so resistant to pardoning federal prisoners that in at least one case he withheld relevant evidence that would have made a pardon applicant look better when presenting the application to Obama for review .
In early 2014 , the Obama administration decided it would do a 180 on the pardon office — and try to use it as a way to affirmatively get people out of prison . It replaced the pardon attorney with a prisoners rights advocate , and encouraged thousands of federal prisoners who ’ d been sentenced under now-obsolete laws or policies to apply to get their sentences reduced to current levels .
The applications came in . The approvals did not . It turned out that using the pardon power to grant big batches of commutations wasn ’ t just a matter of who was at the head of the pardon office , but how willing Department of Justice leadership and the White House were to take risks . ( When politicians are afraid that just one person they release can go on to commit another crime , it makes it hard to release anyone at all . )
In early 2016 , the pardon attorney Obama had hired to oversee the commutation push quit — with a letter making it clear that she didn ’ t feel the administration was keeping its promises on clemency . Days after her resignation , the commutations picked up . And they ’ ve barely stopped since .
Thousands of prisoners are still waiting — and President Trump is unlikely to help
Obama didn ’ t approve all the petitions he got . As of late December , nearly 14,000 applications for commutations ( many of them submitted per the White House ’ s 2014 request ) were still pending , along with more than 2,000 applications for full pardons . And the administration had already formally denied more than 16,000 petitions .
Obama could have approved every one of those applications , and it would still be a drop in the mass incarceration bucket — since his actions focused mostly on drug offenders . While about half of federal prisoners are incarcerated for drug crimes , prison sentences for drugs aren ’ t the biggest cause of mass incarceration in the US as a whole : Only about 16 percent of state prisoners , who make up about 87 percent of the overall prison population , are in for drug crimes . So a focus on reducing prison sentences for other crimes , including violent ones , is likely needed to truly end mass incarceration .
And Obama ’ s clemency actions only captured a fraction of federal inmates . As of 2015 , there were around 92,000 federal prisoners in for drug crimes , and more than 100,000 in for other crimes — far more inmates than Obama ’ s nearly 2,000 clemency approvals reached .
Even among drug offenders , Obama has reduced fewer prison sentences than the US Sentencing Commission did by reducing the recommended baseline for federal drug prisoners — a move that has already let out thousands of prisoners before their original release dates . And by commuting sentences rather than pardoning people , the president has released ex-prisoners into a world where their criminal records can still stop them from getting jobs , public housing , or the vote .
But most people would agree being out of prison without those things is still better than being in prison without them . The thousands of people who are waiting to hear about their commutations certainly believe that . So does the Obama administration .
President-elect Trump ran on a “ tough on crime ” platform . He indirectly attacked Obama ’ s attempts at clemency — and by “ indirectly ” I mean “ exaggerated it to the point of lying , ” excoriating Obama for releasing “ thousands ” of “ violent criminals . ”
Sessions , Trump ’ s nominee for attorney general , is likewise a crime hawk . He ’ s criticized Obama ’ s use of the pardon power as a violation of the “ rule of law. ” It ’ s extremely unlikely that he ’ s going to turn around , once in office , and continue a policy that he vocally opposed .
Some criminal justice reformers have urged Obama to commute sentences for whole categories of prisoners , to make the biggest possible impact before turning the executive branch over to people whose views on criminal justice are so different from his own . Others have just urged him to get through the stack of applications at the pardon office quicker .
Obama did the second , but it didn ’ t go in the way reformers would like — it ’ s resulted in thousands of rejections . And it now seems clear he won ’ t do the first . Obama will leave office having helped nearly 2,000 individuals — but will leave many more languishing behind bars .","A day before leaving office, President Barack Obama broke one of his own records.

The Thursday actions are the last batch of clemency approvals that Obama will grant. But while it’s now clear that Obama’s done something very significant indeed, it’s also near-certain that it will, in some ways, fall short.

Obama’s last-minute clemency push

The president’s power of clemency — which includes both officially absolving people with criminal convictions of their crimes (pardons) and reducing sentences of people currently incarcerated (commutations) — is established in the Constitution, and it’s very broad. So even though pardons and commutations are given to individual people, it’s arguably the most direct tool the president has to reduce mass incarceration if he so chooses.

In the last year of his presidency, Obama has stepped up to the plate. He’s used the pardon power to reduce more sentences than any other president — thanks almost entirely to his administration’s actions over the past year.

Obama’s been a critic of mass incarceration, or at least of disproportionate sentences for drug crimes (which are the most common type of crime among federal prisoners), since he came into office. But for the first several years of his presidency, he was historically stingy in using the pardon power to help prisoners he claimed were serving unfair sentences.

The change from then to now is a story of how easy it is for a single federal official to slow down a process — and how hard it is for a single official to speed it up.

For the first term of his presidency, the head of the Office of the Pardon Attorney was a “tough-on-crime” holdover from the George W. Bush administration. The chief pardon attorney was so resistant to pardoning federal prisoners that in at least one case he withheld relevant evidence that would have made a pardon applicant look better when presenting the application to Obama for review.

In early 2014, the Obama administration decided it would do a 180 on the pardon office — and try to use it as a way to affirmatively get people out of prison. It replaced the pardon attorney with a prisoners rights advocate, and encouraged thousands of federal prisoners who’d been sentenced under now-obsolete laws or policies to apply to get their sentences reduced to current levels.

The applications came in. The approvals did not. It turned out that using the pardon power to grant big batches of commutations wasn’t just a matter of who was at the head of the pardon office, but how willing Department of Justice leadership and the White House were to take risks. (When politicians are afraid that just one person they release can go on to commit another crime, it makes it hard to release anyone at all.)

In early 2016, the pardon attorney Obama had hired to oversee the commutation push quit — with a letter making it clear that she didn’t feel the administration was keeping its promises on clemency. Days after her resignation, the commutations picked up. And they’ve barely stopped since.

Thousands of prisoners are still waiting — and President Trump is unlikely to help

Obama didn’t approve all the petitions he got. As of late December, nearly 14,000 applications for commutations (many of them submitted per the White House’s 2014 request) were still pending, along with more than 2,000 applications for full pardons.

While about half of federal prisoners are incarcerated for drug crimes, prison sentences for drugs aren’t the biggest cause of mass incarceration in the US as a whole: Only about 16 percent of state prisoners, who make up about 87 percent of the overall prison population, are in for drug crimes. So a focus on reducing prison sentences for other crimes, including violent ones, is likely needed to truly end mass incarceration.

And Obama’s clemency actions only captured a fraction of federal inmates. As of 2015, there were around 92,000 federal prisoners in for drug crimes, and more than 100,000 in for other crimes — far more inmates than Obama’s nearly 2,000 clemency approvals reached.

Even among drug offenders, Obama has reduced fewer prison sentences than the US Sentencing Commission did by reducing the recommended baseline for federal drug prisoners — a move that has already let out thousands of prisoners before their original release dates. And by commuting sentences rather than pardoning people, the president has released ex-prisoners into a world where their criminal records can still stop them from getting jobs, public housing, or the vote.

But most people would agree being out of prison without those things is still better than being in prison without them. The thousands of people who are waiting to hear about their commutations certainly believe that. So does the Obama administration.

The Trump administration likely will not.

President-elect Trump ran on a “tough on crime” platform. He indirectly attacked Obama’s attempts at clemency — and by “indirectly” I mean “exaggerated it to the point of lying,” excoriating Obama for releasing “thousands” of “violent criminals.”

Sessions, Trump’s nominee for attorney general, is likewise a crime hawk. He’s criticized Obama’s use of the pardon power as a violation of the “rule of law.” It’s extremely unlikely that he’s going to turn around, once in office, and continue a policy that he vocally opposed.

Some criminal justice reformers have urged Obama to commute sentences for whole categories of prisoners, to make the biggest possible impact before turning the executive branch over to people whose views on criminal justice are so different from his own. Others have just urged him to get through the stack of applications at the pardon office quicker.

Obama did the second, but it didn’t go in the way reformers would like — it’s resulted in thousands of rejections. And it now seems clear he won’t do the first. Obama will leave office having helped nearly 2,000 individuals — but will leave many more languishing behind bars.",www.vox.com,left,galHAgVExxrDSnR5

Secretary of State John Kerry has also been instructed to review Cuba 's place on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list , potentially paving the the way a lift on certain economic and political sanctions .
The revised relationship between the U.S. and Cuba comes ahead of the March 2015 Summit of the Americas , where the island country is set to participate for the first time .

While only Congress can formally overturn the five decades-long embargo , the White House has some authorities to liberalize trade and travel to the island .
The 1996 Helms-Burton Act , which enshrined the embargo into legislation , allows for the President to extend general or specific licenses through a presidential determination , which could be justified as providing support for the Cuban people or democratic change in Cuba . Both Presidents Clinton and Obama exercised such authority to ease certain provisions of the regulations implementing the Cuba sanctions program .
In an effort to boost the nascent Cuban private sector , the President will also allow expanded commercial sales and exports of goods and services to Cuba , particularly building materials for entrepreneurs and private residences , and allow greater business training , as well as permit greater communications hardware and services to go to the island .
Other announced changes permit U.S. and Cuban banks to build relationships and travelers to use credit and debit cards . U.S. travelers will be allowed to import up to $ 400 worth of goods from Cuba , including $ 100 in alcohol and tobacco -- even Cuban cigars . Remittances by Americans to their families back in Cuba will also be increased to approximately $ 2,000 per quarter .
Officials stressed the moves were not being undertaken to prop up the Castro regime , but rather to encourage further reforms on the island .
`` None of this is seen as a reward . All of this is seen as a way of promoting change in Cuba because everything we have done in the past has demonstrably failed , '' another senior administration official said . `` This is not the U.S. government saying Cuba has gotten so much better . It is still an authoritarian state and we still have profound differences with this government . ''
`` But if we hope for change with Cuba , we must try for a different approach . And we believe that considerably more engagement with the Cuban people and the Cuban government is the way to do that , '' the official said , adding that the United States `` will not for a moment lessen our support for improvement in human rights . ''
To that end , Cuba has agreed to release 53 political prisoners from a list of names provided by the United States . At least one of the prisoners has already been released . Havana has also agreed to permit significant access by its citizens to the Internet and allow the International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations human rights officials back on the island for the first time in years .
Talks on a deal began between senior White House and Cuban officials last year and happened in fits and starts , officials said . The officials praised the role the Vatican played as guarantor of the process .
Officials would not reveal the name of the U.S. intelligence source , but officials said he was the individual who revealed to the U.S. the Wasp network , which included the Cuban Five .
`` He was a very important hero , '' the U.S. official said .
The moves are far more sweeping than the last action Obama took toward Cuba in January 2011 , when he eased restrictions on travel to and from the island . Relations have been largely frozen since Gross ' conviction and the White House has made his release a condition of improved ties .
In 2013 , Obama drew praise from advocates of changing U.S. policy toward Cuba when he said the U.S. had to be `` creative '' and `` thoughtful '' about fostering change on the island .
`` The notion that the same policies that we put in place in 1961 would somehow still be as effective as they are today , in the age of the Internet and Google and world travel , does n't make sense , '' Obama said at a November 2013 fundraiser in Florida . `` We have to continue to update our policies .

USA TODAY

Late in his life, George H.W. Bush pondered just who he would want to see first in heaven.

The nation's 41st president took the question posed by granddaughter Jenna Bush Hager in an interview for NBC’s ""Today"" seriously, turning it over in his mind. If Barbara Bush, his wife of seven decades, died before he did, he would want to start with her, he decided. And the mother he adored, Dorothy Walker Bush.

And Robin.

He had a picture in his mind’s eye of how he hoped his daughter would appear to him – as the chubby, vivacious 3-year-old she had been before she was diagnosed with leukemia in 1953. Until that day, he had never heard of the disease that would kill her six months later.

The illness and death of Pauline Robinson Bush would be threaded through the life of her father and her mother. The experience taught them a terrible lesson about the ways the innocent can be caught and crushed by life's unfairness. It left a stamp about what matters, and what doesn’t. It fueled George Bush's determination to do something big in life, beyond the oil business he was building in Texas. After he became president decades later, it helped shape his policies toward the epidemic of HIV/AIDS.

Robin’s illness tested her parents’ marriage, then strengthened it.

The young couple’s response to that crisis forged a template they followed through the ebbs and flows of their long union, at 73 years the longest of any president and first lady in U.S. history.

A day-by-day look at the official schedule to honor President George H.W. Bush

George H.W. Bush left both a liberal and conservative legacy at the Supreme Court

One rule: No crying

When Robin was being treated at New York's Sloan Kettering Memorial Hospital, Barbara Bush set one rule: No crying in her room. Her mother didn’t want the little girl unsettled by seeing the adults in her life in tears.

George Bush, a man of open emotion, found it almost impossible to comply. Again and again, he told Robin he had to go to the bathroom, then stepped into the hallway to regain his composure.

“We used to laugh and wonder if Robin thought he had the weakest bladder in the world,” Barbara Bush said later. “Not true. He just had the most tender heart.”

George Bush knew how hard it was on Barbara to be the stoic, to be the one in control. Years later, he wrote a revealing aside in a letter to a constituent in his congressional district who had been diagnosed with cancer. “Someone had to look into Robin’s eyes and give her comfort and love,” he said, “and somehow, Paul, I didn’t have the guts.”

When Robin died, Barbara was the one who collapsed into sorrow, and George Bush was the one who took charge. “Time after time during the next six months,” she said, “George would put me together again.”

The pattern of one stepping up when the other was struggling – and of being able to switch those roles between them – sustained the couple during times of political defeat and personal pain from then on.

That was the defining experience Barbara Bush chose to talk about at the Republican National Convention in 1988, a moment of political triumph as her husband was nominated for president. She noted in passing her husband’s impressive résumé, the stints in Congress and at the United Nations and the CIA and the vice presidency. Then she turned to their personal tragedy.

“The hardest thing we ever faced together was the loss of a child,” she said, her voice thickening as she worked to keep her emotions in check. “I was very strong over the months we were trying to save her – at least, I thought I was. Maybe I was just pretending. But when she was gone, I fell apart. But George wouldn’t let me retreat into my grief. He held me in his arms, and he made me share it and accept that his sorrow was as great as my own.""

The stigma of disease

During her treatment in New York, Robin was allowed to go home to Midland, Texas, for one last visit. Even some family friends were afraid to visit, worried that the then-mysterious disease might be catching.

“When Robin got sick, people avoided us like the plague,” Barbara Bush said in an interview last year with this writer for a biography. Her voice was marked more by sorrow than anger, all these years later. “Even my close friends.”

When Bush became president, HIV/AIDS faced a stigma of its own, one laced with discriminatory attitudes toward homosexuality. The Reagan White House had done little to address the emerging crisis.

Bush delivered a speech on AIDS in March 1990, his first major attempt to address the subject. He called for the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control to go “on a wartime footing” to combat the disease.

“When our own daughter was dying of leukemia, we asked the doctor the same question every HIV family must ask – why, why this was happening to our beautiful little girl?” Bush said in the speech. He had seen friends die of AIDS, he went on. “There is only one way to deal with an individual who is sick: with dignity, compassion, care, confidentiality, and without discrimination.”

It was the only time during his presidency that Bush mentioned Robin by name in his public remarks. In the privacy of his diaries, he sometimes noted her birthdays. In affectionate letters to his wife, he repeated a phrase that Robin coined: “I love you more than tongue can tell.”

On the day in October 1987 that he announced he would run for president, the election that would cap his career, Bush was thinking about the daughter he had lost. “Bar looks beautiful,” he wrote in his diary, then added, “Thirty-four years ago today, Robin died.”

After a memorial service at the National Cathedral in Washington and a funeral at St. Martin’s Episcopal Church in Houston, George Bush will be laid to rest in a wooded grove near his presidential library in College Station, Texas. He will be buried Thursday beside the grave of Barbara Bush.

And next to Robin.

The Boy Scouts of America doubled down Wednesday on its quest to become the scouting organization of choice for boys and girls, announcing it will drop ""Boy"" from the name of its signature program.

But the decision didn't impress the Girl Scout organization, which noted no new, ""girl specific"" programming.

“Girl Scouts is the premier leadership development organization for girls,” Sylvia Acevedo, CEO of Girl Scouts of the USA, said in a statement. “We are, and will remain, the first choice for girls and parents.""

Both groups, which have been at odds since the Boy Scouts decided to open its doors to girls, have been struggling with declining membership.

The umbrella organization will retain its name, Boy Scouts of America or BSA. The term Cub Scouts, for kids 7-10 years old, is gender neutral and also will go unchanged. Boy Scouts, which includes kids from 10 to 17, will become Scouts BSA in February.

Chief Scout Executive Mike Surbaugh unveiled the group's ""Scout Me In"" marketing campaign aimed at promoting inclusiveness. “As we enter a new era for our organization, it is important that all youth can see themselves in Scouting in every way possible,"" Surbaugh said.

Change has been coming quickly to the iconic if shrinking organization. In October, it announced it would provide programs for girls. Several months before that, the group announced it would accept and register transgender youths into its organization.

In 2015, it ended its ban on gay leaders.

Cub Scouts will formally accept girls starting this summer. Surbaugh said more than 3,000 girls nationwide already enrolled in the BSA’s Early Adopter Program and are participating in Cub Scouts before the full launch.

Allowing girls into the organization allows busy families to consolidate programs for their kids, BSA says. Most of the actual Cub packs and Scout troops, however, will be single gender. Girls and boys can work toward the prestigious title of Eagle Scout.

“Cub Scouts is a lot of fun, and now it’s available to all kids,” said Stephen Medlicott, BSA marketing director. “That’s why we love ‘Scout Me In’ — because it speaks to girls and boys and tells them, ‘This is for you. We want you to join!’ ”

Boy Scouts of America claims almost 2.3 million members, down from 2.6 million five years ago. That includes Venturing and Sea Scouting programs, the latter allowing membership up to 21 years of age. In its peak years, BSA had more than 4 million participants.

Adults play a major role in the program: Almost 1 million adult volunteers serve as the backbone of the organization.

It's too early to determine what impact the aggressive BSA effort to recruit girls will have on the Girl Scouts, an organization best known for its lucrative annual cookie sales. The organization, founded two years after Boy Scouts, currently claims a membership of about 1.8 million.

The Girl Scouts list a series of efforts designed to ""stay ahead of the pack of youth organizations."" That includes 23 new merit badges focusing on outdoors and STEM (science, technology, engineering and math). And last month, the organization unveiled a LinkedIn network aimed tapping a major resource — the group's 50 million alums.

One New York law-firm co-chairman allegedly paid $ 75,000 to an admissions consultant so his daughter could fly to Los Angeles and take the ACT in a private room last December , accompanied by a proctor who had been paid to correct her errors .
Another family allegedly made a $ 400,000 contribution to a sham charity in 2016 , with a portion of the funds funneled to the then-head tennis coach at Georgetown University , in exchange for having their daughter tagged as a recruited athlete . She was admitted to the school .
Joseph Bonavolonta , special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Boston field office , described on Tuesday a “ culture of corruption and greed that created an uneven playing field for students trying to get into these schools the right way , through hard work , good grades and community service . ”
The sprawling case , the result of a 10-month multiagency federal investigation dubbed Operation Varsity Blues that led to charges against actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin , lays bare a privileged world of high anxiety and high net worth . Operating in a universe where high school graduates are expected to go on to top colleges , a rejection letter isn ’ t an option .
But with many selective schools boasting record high application volume and record low admission rates—in the low single digits at Stanford University and some Ivy League institutions—admission is far from a sure thing for even the most privileged or qualified .
Beyond paying for legitimate test-prep courses or donating to their alma maters in the hopes of getting a leg up—common practice in some circles—the 33 parents named in federal indictments Tuesday allegedly funneled at least $ 25 million through a fraudulent college-counseling service to get their children into colleges including Yale University , Stanford and University of California , Los Angeles .
Those charged Tuesday include Ms. Huffman of “ Desperate Housewives ” and Ms. Loughlin of “ Full House ” ; Gordon Caplan , co-chairman of New York law firm Willkie Farr ; former Pacific Investment Management Co. Chief Executive Douglas Hodge ; and Greg Abbott , CEO of International Dispensing Corp .
Also charged was Bill McGlashan , founder and managing partner of TPG Growth , the arm of the private-equity firm that invests in fast-growing companies such as Airbnb Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc .
TPG said Mr. McGlashan was placed on administrative leave . A PIMCO spokesman declined to comment about Mr. Hodge ’ s alleged involvement in the scheme .
Prosecutors said the college-counseling operation , which played out from 2011 until last month , involved paying admissions-test administrators to help students raise their test scores by either having someone else take the test , or correcting answers before they were submitted . Prosecutors also said some of the people bribed varsity coaches and administrators to admit their children as recruited athletes .
Prosecutors said it appeared the universities themselves weren ’ t involved in the scheme .
The ringleader , college-counseling consultant William Rick Singer , pleaded guilty Tuesday to racketeering conspiracy and other crimes . He admitted facilitating the fraud through the Edge College & Career Network LLC , also known as the Key , in Newport Beach , Calif. Mr. Singer would likely face 15 to 19.5 years in prison under sentencing guidelines .
Ms. Loughlin , who was named as a defendant with her husband , the fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli , allegedly paid bribes totaling $ 500,000 in exchange for having their two daughters designated as recruits to the University of Southern California ’ s crew team , even though neither participated in the sport . Ms. Loughlin hadn ’ t yet been arrested as of Tuesday afternoon .
Ms. Huffman and her spouse—actor William H. Macy , who isn ’ t named as a defendant—allegedly paid $ 15,000 to work with the admissions consultant and help one daughter cheat on the SAT in late 2017 ; Ms. Huffman , who was arrested Tuesday , considered doing the same for her younger daughter but decided against it , according to the affidavit .
A representative for Ms. Loughlin declined to comment . Ms. Huffman couldn ’ t be reached for comment .
The investigation , by the Justice Department , FBI and Internal Revenue Service , began in May . U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said it remains active , and more parents and coaches could be charged .
Mr. Singer says on his firm ’ s website that he set up his business 25 years ago to help students navigate the tricky world of college admissions . It is dotted with testimonials to his good work .
In court Tuesday , Mr. Singer admitted it was a sham , but a seductive one for his wealthy clients . Some students can gain admissions through the “ front door , ” where students get into college on merit , or the “ back door ” where parents make hefty donations to increase chances of admission . His path offered better odds , he said .
A photo allegedly submitted to the University of Southern California , showing an applicant allegedly playing water polo ; the photo is actually of another person .
“ I created a side door—a sure thing , ” he said . “ That is what made it so attractive—I created a guarantee . ”
Mr. Singer said Tuesday he would have clients ’ children seek doctors ’ notes claiming learning disabilities or other issues , which would allow them to take SAT or ACT tests at sites where Mr. Singer could install a proctor who had been paid to either take tests on the students ’ behalf or correct wrong answers . He said he bribed test administrators working with sites in Houston and Los Angeles , and parents would fly their children in to take the tests .
A photo allegedly submitted to the University of Southern California , showing a college applicant allegedly pole-vaulting , though the image actually shows someone else .
Those services generally went for $ 15,000 to $ 75,000 , according to prosecutors , with proctors receiving a small cut .
Two test administrators for the ACT and College Board were charged in the racketeering conspiracy .
Mr. Caplan , a top private-equity lawyer , is among those who allegedly tried the side door . He allegedly paid Mr. Singer $ 75,000 to have another person take the ACT for his daughter in December , asking that she get a score in the low 30s out of a possible 36—he didn ’ t want it to be so high as to seem suspicious , according to a conversation recorded by law enforcement .
Mr. Caplan said in another recorded call in July , “ I ’ m not worried about the moral issue here . I ’ m worried about the , if she ’ s caught doing that , you know , she ’ s finished . ”
Willkie Farr had no comment , and Mr. Caplan didn ’ t respond to an emailed request for comment .
Mr. Singer also allegedly helped parents work with college coaches to claim admission spots reserved for recruited athletes , staging photos of the teens playing sports or photo-shopping their faces onto stock photos of young athletes and creating fake credentials showing their athletic prowess .
The coaches who allegedly received payments then used the athletic profiles to persuade others at the schools to admit the students , Mr. Lelling said . Most of the coaches both gave money to their sports programs and kept some for themselves , he said .
Coaches and at least one administrator participated in the scheme , prosecutors said . Those charged with racketeering included the former head men ’ s and women ’ s tennis coach at Georgetown ; a senior associate athletic director , water polo and women ’ s soccer coaches at USC ; the men ’ s soccer coach at UCLA ; and the Wake Forest University women ’ s volleyball coach .
Wake Forest put its head volleyball coach on administrative leave and retained outside counsel , USC announced an internal investigation and a broad review of its admissions processes , and the University of Texas in Austin placed its men ’ s tennis coach on administrative leave .
Prosecutors said the head women ’ s soccer coach at Yale accepted a $ 400,000 bribe in exchange for admitting a candidate as a recruited athlete , even though she allegedly didn ’ t even play competitive soccer . After the student was admitted , her parents paid Mr. Singer $ 1.2 million , including about $ 900,000 to his charity , which purported to help underserved youth but funneled funds to bribe college officials .
Yale said it is the victim of a crime and would continue to cooperate with the probe .
Georgetown ’ s former tennis coach didn ’ t respond to requests for comment , nor did the Yale soccer coach Rudy Meredith or USC water polo coach Jovan Vavic .
John Vandemoer , the 41-year-old former head sailing coach at Stanford University , pleaded guilty Tuesday to one count of racketeering conspiracy . Prosecutors said there were no allegations he kept the money for himself . According to court records , during the summer of 2017 and the following May , Mr. Vandemoer agreed to designate two of Mr. Singer ’ s clients as recruits in return for payments , including one of $ 500,000 , to the Stanford sailing program .
Neither student ended up going to Stanford , but Mr. Singer still allegedly paid $ 160,000 to the sailing program , according to prosecutors . Mr. Vandemoer agreed with Mr. Singer that the payment “ would serve as a ‘ deposit ’ for a future student ’ s purported recruitment , ” the federal documents allege .
In a statement Tuesday , Stanford said Mr. Vandemoer has been terminated and neither student attended the school .
Prosecutors alleged that Mr. Singer ’ s nonprofit organization , Key Worldwide Foundation , was used as a front for many of the bribes .
Mr. Abbott of International Dispensing and his wife , Marcia , were both charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud . Mr. Abbott said his family had spoken to the FBI about the alleged cheating scandal , and on Tuesday called the situation “ insane . ”
Mr. Abbott allegedly made a $ 50,000 donation to Mr. Singer ’ s charity last April in exchange for having someone correct their daughter ’ s answers after she finished taking the ACT , according to an affidavit filed in the case . Prosecutors said the money was wired from an Abbott Family Foundation brokerage account .
Another donation , for $ 75,000 , was made in September , allegedly in exchange for helping the daughter cheat on SAT mathematics and literature subject tests .
“ Literally , we were involved with this guy for our daughter to help out with college counseling and he gets f— arrested , ” Mr. Abbott said . “ We didn ’ t know he was doing this s— . ”
Mr. Abbott said the counseling service had a “ sketchy setup ” in hindsight but had been recommended to the family .
“ A network of New York City mothers use this guy and they all say he ’ s the best , ” he said . “ He ruined chances of kids getting into school who did years and years of work to get into school on their own . ”
In some cases , the students weren ’ t aware of what their parents had paid for or that Mr. Singer had hired someone to correct their answers on standardized tests to improve their scores .
“ It was so funny ’ cause the kids will call me and say , ‘ Maybe I should do that again . I did pretty well , and if I took it again , I ’ ll do better even. ’ Right ? And they just have no idea that they didn ’ t even get the score that they thought they got , ” Mr. Singer said , according to the affidavit .

Are human beings , on average , becoming healthier , richer , safer ? And if they ’ re not , why not ? And how can we do better ?
Each year , the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation releases its annual Goalkeepers Report . The publication is thick with charts and graphs , metrics and statistics . And usually , it ’ s optimistic — global poverty , infant mortality , and a host of other key measures have dashed toward decency in recent years , and the Gateses have sought to make sure the public knows that progress is being made .
The 2018 edition , however , started on a tougher note . “ Optimism requires being candid about the hard problems that still need to be solved , ” the Gateses write . “ That ’ s what this year ’ s Goalkeepers Data Report aims to do : confront a pressing yet neglected challenge , and identify some of the most promising strategies to meet it . ”
“ To put it bluntly , ” they continue , “ decades of stunning progress in the fight against poverty and disease may be on the verge of stalling . This is because the poorest parts of the world are growing faster than everywhere else ; more babies are being born in the places where it ’ s hardest to lead a healthy and productive life . ”
The Gateses are talking specifically here about Africa . “ Africa as a whole is projected to nearly double in size by 2050 , which means that even if the percentage of poor people on the continent is cut in half , the number of poor people stays the same , ” they write .
There is no topic in the philanthropic world more fraught than population growth . The history of efforts to analyze and address it is filled with bad predictions and , worse , cruel solutions . As development expert Alex Ezeh writes elsewhere in the report , “ population issues are so difficult to talk about that the development community has been ignoring them for years . ”
The Gateses , though , are trying to take a different approach to the issue . Rather than seeing a population problem in the demographic projections , they ’ re framing it as a poverty problem — and , for that matter , an opportunity .
“ There ’ s been a lot of discussion about what happens if large numbers of young people in the poorest countries are denied opportunities to build better lives , ” they write . “ People worry about insecurity , instability , and mass migration . We wish they would also recognize young people ’ s enormous potential to drive growth . They are the activists , innovators , leaders , and workers of the future . ”
With an endowment of more than $ 50 billion , the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is , by far , the largest foundation in the world . What it does matters , and so the ideas that power its work matter .
I spoke to Bill Gates for my podcast , The Ezra Klein Show . We discussed the geographic and political forces that have held Africa back ; whether economic development brings political freedom ; the risk posed by artificial intelligence ; how we should weight future human lives ; whether philanthropists should worry about animal suffering ; and much more . The full audio is here . A transcript of our conversation , edited for length and clarity , follows .
You often make a point , in my experience , of pushing an optimistic narrative in the face of an increasingly pessimistic culture . But in the new Goalkeepers report , you begin by writing , “ To put it bluntly , decades of stunning progress in the fight against poverty and disease may be on the verge of stalling. ” Why is that ?
Well , the point there is that the dramatic decline of 26 percent of the world ’ s population being in extreme poverty down to 9 percent , a lot of that came because Asian countries — first China and then later India , Indonesia , and Pakistan and Bangladesh — did a reasonable job of governance . They invested in health . They invested in agricultural productivity . They improved their education systems , and so they lifted a lot of their population out of extreme poverty .
As you look at the projection out through 2050 , the portion of people in extreme poverty will overwhelmingly be on one continent , which is Africa . It means that unless we do a good job in those countries where an increasing portion of the births are taking place , we won ’ t see anywhere near that decline that we saw over the last 25 years .
I think that raises the big background question to this report , which I wanted to understand your framework on : Why do you believe , at this point in history , that Africa is poorer than Asia or Europe or North America ?
Well , Africa , of course , is not nearly as poor as it was in the past . The number of kids in education , the childhood survival rate , there has been quite a bit of improvement there . But in Africa , the geography is tough . The disease burden is tough . The ecosystems are very , very different .
Asia , Europe , and the United States , those Northern Hemisphere areas , they developed in terms of getting rid of disease , being able to have infrastructure for very efficient transport , and having more than enough food to feed the population . They got into a virtuous cycle of high education , high discovery , high innovation , and generally quite strong governance .
In Africa , there was colonialism , which certainly held those countries back . There ’ s the geography that makes moving things across the country very difficult . The rivers aren ’ t as navigable . Because you ’ re equatorial , you don ’ t have winters where the pathogens get killed off . Equatorial regions have things like malaria in a very different way than other parts of the world .
Now , South Africa , Botswana — there are parts of the continent that have gotten themselves up to this middle-income level . But particularly if you look at the central areas — Northern Nigeria , [ the ] Democratic Republic of Congo — the level of development there is not very high at all . It ’ s mostly subsistence farming , very little infrastructure , very little resources for the government , and very little capacity to build up even the basic health and education systems .
Can you talk a little bit about that interaction between geography and disease burdens and land usability and then institutional and economic development ?
There is a type of poverty trap where if your economy doesn ’ t develop , then it ’ s very hard to bootstrap those things . Africa , in particular , it ’ s hard to move physical goods around . Europe was very lucky in that you could move things by sea . They built up canal systems . Some mountains caused a challenge , but the transport cost was fairly low , and you had this temperate zone area that extended all the way into Asia . That ’ s why they use this term Eurasia , where a lot of development , including the initial Industrial Age , gets going .
At that time , the same educational things are not happening in Africa . There ’ s not that same level of investment . You don ’ t have the notion of a nation-state that you belong to as a key organizing principle so you can scale up and make these kinds of investments .
The temperate zone countries got way , way ahead . Now , when we have some equatorial countries like Malaysia or parts of India that are actually having economic development , that ’ s a fantastic thing . But it ’ s still very predictive whether you are temperate or tropical how well you will have done in economic development .
If we can take those parasitic diseases and the low agricultural productivity and malaria , if we can get rid of those and , through aid , get some bootstrap in terms of the infrastructure , health , and education , then you can get the uplift . Asia , where the geography and disease burden isn ’ t quite as bad , has provided an example . I ’ ve taken to African leaders many times the book How Asia Works , which talks about the progression starting with agricultural productivity as a key bootstrap to get to middle-income levels .
Do you see the Asia story as primarily a story of institutional development ?
Well , institutions are a huge part of the mix , but you can only get there if you have the resources , either locally raised or through donors , that you ’ re creating the health care system and the education system and the roads and telling farmers what to do .
Take India in the 1960s and ’ 70s . There were a lot of investments as the Green Revolution crops came along ; the agricultural productivity more than doubled . It was very timely because a lot of people had expected mass starvation in Asia as their population growth had stayed high into those decades . But in fact , the institutional capacity , the roads , the new seeds , came together and actually , nutritional levels actually went up during that time period . Asia is a huge source of learning about what can go on in Africa .
There are African exemplars . Ethiopia starts out 20 years ago as one of the very , very poorest countries . When you thought about famine in Africa , Somalia and Ethiopia are the two countries that would come to mind . Now Ethiopia , although it still can have droughts with weather variability , it ’ s now feeding itself because that agricultural productivity has gone up . They ’ re an exemplar in this human capital equation . They ’ ve really thought about local resources , donor money , and the health and education systems there are constantly improving . That ’ s over 90 million people that really are following the path that should get them to middle income and self-sufficiency .
The human capital piece of this , I think , is really important . One of the most striking statistics in the report to me was that a third of African children are stunted . Can you talk about what stunting means ?
Yeah , stunting formally is that your height is substantially below what it should be for your age . Unfortunately , it also means that you haven ’ t had access to nutrition . So not just your stature or your height but also your overall physical capacity and your mental capacity isn ’ t anywhere near what it would be if you ’ d had proper nutrition .
This is very , very important to solve because if you don ’ t get that nutritional piece right , then your investments in educating that kid — both for the kid individually and for the country — aren ’ t going to create the economic payoff that you expect . It ’ s a huge area of focus , and we actually have some leads on how we have to change the diet , what micronutrients might be missing , to get the physical and mental capacity up to its full potential .
I want to ask a question that ’ s going to reveal how dumb I am about all this . This seems like a problem that is reasonably straightforward to solve , making sure children have enough protein and enough micronutrients to reach a non-stunted level of development . Why has the world not solved it ?
Going out and finding those kids who are falling behind and weighing them and then making sure they have these supplemental foods is actually fairly difficult . Targeted delivery to children that are out in very rural areas requires a level of sophistication that ’ s even beyond getting vaccinations out to the children .
We have countries like Ethiopia and Tanzania that get well over 90 percent of their kids the vaccines where this effort to go out and find those kids that are falling behind isn ’ t done . I ’ m optimistic about this problem , but it ’ s been one of the toughest . There aren ’ t as many exemplars in getting stunting down at a low level of income as there are the overall reduction in childhood death where just getting your vaccine coverage up gives you dramatic gains in that measure .
It sounds like for this problem and for a lot of the others , what ’ s most important is for the governance institutions and economic institutions to strengthen . The difference between the quality of governance in , say , China and Nigeria , to say nothing of Nigeria and South Korea , is huge . Is that a problem that the philanthropy community doesn ’ t know how to tackle ? Or is it a problem that it doesn ’ t seem like it is the philanthropy community ’ s right or responsibility to tackle ?
You ’ re absolutely right . Poor governance is a huge block to these issues . However , if you wait , usually you only get really good governance once a country is middle-income . When you have a leader like [ Paul ] Kagame in Rwanda who appoints good people and really cares about these results , it ’ s a fantastic thing . Now , neither Ethiopia [ nor ] Rwanda checks every box of excellent government . It ’ s likely that those countries , until they get to middle-income status , won ’ t have all those characteristics . Neither did South Korea and many other countries . We wish we knew how to help even more with governments . We know it ’ s very , very important .
When I heard discussions of changing governance structures to drive economic growth 10 , 15 years ago , they were more optimistic in this way : There was a belief that you needed something that was much more like the American model . Free markets , free minds .
But now we ’ ve seen the rise of China and a lot of other countries that have induced very rapid development through market-oriented but authoritarian governance structures . If you ’ re a developing economy and you ’ re looking at what is a model , I think for all kinds of reasons , there have begun to be more questions about America ’ s political systems , but also China has become a very powerful exemplar .
You brought up Kagame in Rwanda , who has both done some remarkable things in terms of governance and the economy and has also , as I understand it , become much more authoritarian . Do you worry that the governance model that countries are beginning to look to for economic growth is much less of a model that prizes other kinds of freedom ?
It ’ s important to separate out the economic model of development from that political model . There are no examples of countries who ’ ve grown their economy on a broad-based basis without using market-based pricing .
Whatever the political model is , this willingness to reduce corruption , to get the health and education system working well , that makes a huge difference . Taiwan , when it developed , it was an autocracy . Korea , when it developed , it was under a dictator . Then they progressed to more democratic forms of government . Now , China certainly raises the question that now that they ’ re middle-income level , will their political model progress or not ? That ’ s a valid question and important in terms of the rights of the people in those countries .
But economic development isn ’ t quite as stringent . It ’ s more about taking a long-term view and making these human capital investments .
How much are political rights intertwined with economic development ? The argument that has long been made is often an economic self-interest argument — if you don ’ t have these things , you ’ re not gon na have these other things .
There ’ s never been as strong a coupling between economic growth and democratic freedoms as we ’ d all like . China grew dramatically faster than India did . Now , India ’ s a very good story . It ’ s growing ; the health statistics are improving ; it ’ s on quite a good path . But it ’ s not even close to what happened in China , what happened in South Korea , what happened in Taiwan . The human freedom argument is going to have to be made on its own .
With the Goalkeepers construct , the idea is : Is all this innovation continuing to help the poorest countries , people in extreme poverty ? At least once a year , there ’ s a question about did we let HIV spread and create a disaster there ? Did we continue to innovate malaria so we could stay ahead of drug resistance ? Why do we still have places left where over 15 percent of the kids die before the age of 5 ? What ’ s it gon na take for those remaining areas to get below that ? There ’ s progress and then there ’ s progress with equity . Goalkeepers is a focus on that “ with equity ” part .
I want to ask you a question about the far-off future . One of the things that has become powerful in the effective altruism movement is the idea that we should be much more concerned about existential planetary-level risk because the weight of future human lives is so dramatic .
My colleague Dylan Matthews puts it in this way that I think is pretty stark , which is that if humanity lasts as long as the dinosaurs did , then about 8 quadrillion people will live total . That means over 99.99 percent of all the humans who ’ ll ever live have yet to be born . If that ’ s true , then even very small reductions in the danger of those future lives not happening begins to outweigh large improvements in the value of life now . I ’ m curious how you think about weighing that far-off future against the present we live in .
Well , the people in the future will have more knowledge and more resources than we have today . They ’ ll understand what those emerging problems look like .
If you said there was a philanthropist 500 years ago that said , “ I ’ m not gon na feed the poor , I ’ m gon na worry about existential risk , ” I doubt their prediction would have made any difference in terms of what came later . You got to have a certain modesty . Even understanding what ’ s gon na go on in a 50-year time frame I would say is very , very difficult .
If somebody thinks there ’ s a magic thing they can do today that helps all those future lives , in a free economy , they have a chance to build whatever it is they think does that . We do have a few things like climate change where you want to invest today to involve problems tomorrow . I ’ m always a little surprised there ’ s not more engagement on that issue . Pandemic risk , weapons of mass destruction .
But there ’ s not many that we can identify . There ’ s not many that we really understand with clarity , and so somebody who says , “ Okay , let ’ s just let a million people die of malaria because I ’ m building this temple that will help people a million years from now , ” I wonder what the heck they ’ re building that temple out of .
A lot of people have become very focused on the question of AI risk . I ’ m curious how you weight that as a risk to future human life ?
And so they think that ’ s more important than kids dying of malaria ?
I don ’ t want to say more important . I don ’ t want to put words in other people ’ s mouths , but as I understand it , the idea is there are a lot of good people working on malaria , and AI is so dangerous that it ’ s better for people on the margin to be working on AI risk now than to be—
But most of those people aren ’ t working on AI risk . They ’ re actually accelerating progress in AI .
No , they like working on AI . Working on AI is fun . If they think what they ’ re doing is reducing the risk of AI , I haven ’ t seen that proof of that . They have a model . Some people want to go to Mars . Some people want to live forever . Philanthropy has got a lot of heterogeneity in it . If people bring their intelligence , some passion , overall , it tends to work out . There ’ s some dead ends , but every once in a while , we get the Green Revolution or new vaccines or models for how education can be done better . It ’ s not something where the philanthropists all homogenize what they ’ re doing . Even in the Giving Pledge , we celebrate the diversity of causes that people are investing in .
Related to that , how do you weight animal suffering ? We know animals are sentient . We know , as human beings , we ’ ve gotten more technologically advanced . We ’ ve been able to raise them in what are , on the one hand , more efficient , but on the other hand , more cruel , ways for meat . As we get richer and 10 billion people are alive , there ’ s going to be a larger demand for them . How do you think about the moral weight of chickens and pigs and cows and other kinds of suffering creatures in the future we ’ re building ?
Well , because of climate change , I ’ m involved in a number of efforts to create meat-equivalent products without using animals . Impossible Foods , Beyond Meat , Memphis Meats , a number of things . There actually is some progress there .
In the meantime , the foundation is now the biggest funder of new vaccines to improve animal health . Livestock is very important in terms of the diet issues or the economic value that you create out of the agricultural sector . I do think , over time , artificial meat will get popular . Then people can say , “ Is it sad that there ’ s less cows alive ? ” I personally don ’ t have a good metric of what type of cow life is better that it happened versus better that it didn ’ t happen . But there ’ s a lot of benefits that accrue to creating these meat-like products in a different way .
Do you think we should worry about , from a philanthropic view or moral view , the suffering along the way ? You were talking about developing vaccines and genetic strains that make animals more productive and able to live in some of these conditions . But I think there ’ s certainly an argument that making them more able to live in these conditions is creating lives of such suffering that there ’ s an immoral , or at least amoral , dimension to it as well .
Well , I think vaccinating the animals is hard to argue against . You ’ re preventing what are bad diseases for these animals , and you ’ re extending their lifetime . It ’ s just like vaccines for humans .","Is the world becoming a better place? Are human beings, on average, becoming healthier, richer, safer? And if they’re not, why not? And how can we do better?

Each year, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation releases its annual Goalkeepers Report. The publication is thick with charts and graphs, metrics and statistics. And usually, it’s optimistic — global poverty, infant mortality, and a host of other key measures have dashed toward decency in recent years, and the Gateses have sought to make sure the public knows that progress is being made.

The 2018 edition, however, started on a tougher note. “Optimism requires being candid about the hard problems that still need to be solved,” the Gateses write. “That’s what this year’s Goalkeepers Data Report aims to do: confront a pressing yet neglected challenge, and identify some of the most promising strategies to meet it.”

“To put it bluntly,” they continue, “decades of stunning progress in the fight against poverty and disease may be on the verge of stalling. This is because the poorest parts of the world are growing faster than everywhere else; more babies are being born in the places where it’s hardest to lead a healthy and productive life.”

The Gateses are talking specifically here about Africa. “Africa as a whole is projected to nearly double in size by 2050, which means that even if the percentage of poor people on the continent is cut in half, the number of poor people stays the same,” they write.

There is no topic in the philanthropic world more fraught than population growth. The history of efforts to analyze and address it is filled with bad predictions and, worse, cruel solutions. As development expert Alex Ezeh writes elsewhere in the report, “population issues are so difficult to talk about that the development community has been ignoring them for years.”

The Gateses, though, are trying to take a different approach to the issue. Rather than seeing a population problem in the demographic projections, they’re framing it as a poverty problem — and, for that matter, an opportunity.

“There’s been a lot of discussion about what happens if large numbers of young people in the poorest countries are denied opportunities to build better lives,” they write. “People worry about insecurity, instability, and mass migration. We wish they would also recognize young people’s enormous potential to drive growth. They are the activists, innovators, leaders, and workers of the future.”

With an endowment of more than $50 billion, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is, by far, the largest foundation in the world. What it does matters, and so the ideas that power its work matter.

I spoke to Bill Gates for my podcast, The Ezra Klein Show. We discussed the geographic and political forces that have held Africa back; whether economic development brings political freedom; the risk posed by artificial intelligence; how we should weight future human lives; whether philanthropists should worry about animal suffering; and much more. The full audio is here. A transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.

But in the new Goalkeepers report, you begin by writing, “To put it bluntly, decades of stunning progress in the fight against poverty and disease may be on the verge of stalling.” Why is that?

It’s a huge area of focus, and we actually have some leads on how we have to change the diet, what micronutrients might be missing, to get the physical and mental capacity up to its full potential.

Ezra Klein

I want to ask a question that’s going to reveal how dumb I am about all this. This seems like a problem that is reasonably straightforward to solve, making sure children have enough protein and enough micronutrients to reach a non-stunted level of development. Why has the world not solved it?

Bill Gates

Going out and finding those kids who are falling behind and weighing them and then making sure they have these supplemental foods is actually fairly difficult. Targeted delivery to children that are out in very rural areas requires a level of sophistication that’s even beyond getting vaccinations out to the children.

We have countries like Ethiopia and Tanzania that get well over 90 percent of their kids the vaccines where this effort to go out and find those kids that are falling behind isn’t done. I’m optimistic about this problem, but it’s been one of the toughest. There aren’t as many exemplars in getting stunting down at a low level of income as there are the overall reduction in childhood death where just getting your vaccine coverage up gives you dramatic gains in that measure.

But economic development isn’t quite as stringent. It’s more about taking a long-term view and making these human capital investments.

Ezra Klein

How much are political rights intertwined with economic development? The argument that has long been made is often an economic self-interest argument — if you don’t have these things, you’re not gonna have these other things.

There’s never been as strong a coupling between economic growth and democratic freedoms as we’d all like. China grew dramatically faster than India did. Now, India’s a very good story. It’s growing; the health statistics are improving; it’s on quite a good path. But it’s not even close to what happened in China, what happened in South Korea, what happened in Taiwan.

I’m curious how you think about weighing that far-off future against the present we live in.

Well, the people in the future will have more knowledge and more resources than we have today. They’ll understand what those emerging problems look like.

If you said there was a philanthropist 500 years ago that said, “I’m not gonna feed the poor, I’m gonna worry about existential risk,” I doubt their prediction would have made any difference in terms of what came later. You got to have a certain modesty. Even understanding what’s gonna go on in a 50-year time frame I would say is very, very difficult.

If somebody thinks there’s a magic thing they can do today that helps all those future lives, in a free economy, they have a chance to build whatever it is they think does that. We do have a few things like climate change where you want to invest today to involve problems tomorrow. I’m always a little surprised there’s not more engagement on that issue. Pandemic risk, weapons of mass destruction.

But there’s not many that we can identify. There’s not many that we really understand with clarity, and so somebody who says, “Okay, let’s just let a million people die of malaria because I’m building this temple that will help people a million years from now,” I wonder what the heck they’re building that temple out of.

Ezra Klein

A lot of people have become very focused on the question of AI risk. I’m curious how you weight that as a risk to future human life?

Bill Gates

And so they think that’s more important than kids dying of malaria?

Ezra Klein

I don’t want to say more important. I don’t want to put words in other people’s mouths, but as I understand it, the idea is there are a lot of good people working on malaria, and AI is so dangerous that it’s better for people on the margin to be working on AI risk now than to be—

Bill Gates

But most of those people aren’t working on AI risk. They’re actually accelerating progress in AI.

Ezra Klein

Well, it may be a guilt-oriented thing as well.

No, they like working on AI. Working on AI is fun. If they think what they’re doing is reducing the risk of AI, I haven’t seen that proof of that. They have a model. Some people want to go to Mars. Some people want to live forever. Philanthropy has got a lot of heterogeneity in it. If people bring their intelligence, some passion, overall, it tends to work out. There’s some dead ends, but every once in a while, we get the Green Revolution or new vaccines or models for how education can be done better. It’s not something where the philanthropists all homogenize what they’re doing. Even in the Giving Pledge, we celebrate the diversity of causes that people are investing in.

Related to that, how do you weight animal suffering? We know animals are sentient. We know, as human beings, we’ve gotten more technologically advanced. We’ve been able to raise them in what are, on the one hand, more efficient, but on the other hand, more cruel, ways for meat. As we get richer and 10 billion people are alive, there’s going to be a larger demand for them. How do you think about the moral weight of chickens and pigs and cows and other kinds of suffering creatures in the future we’re building?

Bill Gates

Well, because of climate change, I’m involved in a number of efforts to create meat-equivalent products without using animals. Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat, Memphis Meats, a number of things. There actually is some progress there.

In the meantime, the foundation is now the biggest funder of new vaccines to improve animal health. Livestock is very important in terms of the diet issues or the economic value that you create out of the agricultural sector. I do think, over time, artificial meat will get popular. Then people can say, “Is it sad that there’s less cows alive?” I personally don’t have a good metric of what type of cow life is better that it happened versus better that it didn’t happen. But there’s a lot of benefits that accrue to creating these meat-like products in a different way.

Ezra Klein

Do you think we should worry about, from a philanthropic view or moral view, the suffering along the way? You were talking about developing vaccines and genetic strains that make animals more productive and able to live in some of these conditions. But I think there’s certainly an argument that making them more able to live in these conditions is creating lives of such suffering that there’s an immoral, or at least amoral, dimension to it as well.

Bill Gates

Well, I think vaccinating the animals is hard to argue against. You’re preventing what are bad diseases for these animals, and you’re extending their lifetime. It’s just like vaccines for humans.

John Glenn of Ohio spoke in Akron at a memorial service for Judith Resnik , one of the astronauts lost in the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger .
Both Senator Glenn and Ms. Resnik were Ohio natives . He knew her – when applying to be an astronaut , she had sought him out and asked what qualities NASA was looking for . She ’ d visited him in his Senate office after her first space flight .
Glenn told the crowd at Firestone High – Resnik ’ s alma mater – that he ’ d come not to mourn but to celebrate her life . “ Let ’ s never forget the last words that came from that spacecraft : ‘ Go at throttle up , ’ ” he said .
“ Those words are far more than a courageous epitaph , ” Glenn said . “ They are America ’ s history . They are America ’ s destiny . And they will turn tragedy into triumph once again . ”
Throttle up . Perhaps no two words better define the life of John Glenn himself , who passed away Thursday in Columbus , Ohio . A war hero , test pilot , space pioneer , and a Buckeye political icon , Glenn lived life like he flew , stick back and nose climbing , looking at the stars .
Consider his famous Mercury space flight of Feb. 20 , 1962 . As hard is it may be to believe today , there were no real computers in his crammed Friendship 7 capsule . Glenn had to take manual control when systems malfunctioned . He completed only three of eight planned earth orbits .
Then a light indicated the capsule ’ s protective heat shield might be loose . Houston ground control ordered that retro rockets strapped around the shield not be jettisoned , to provide extra protection during the fiery descent into the atmosphere .
Flaming chunks of metal flew by Glenn ’ s window as he plunged towards earth . He didn ’ t know if they were extra bits of rocket or the crucial shield . They were the former . He lived .
“ That was a real fireball , boy , ” said Glenn to ground control after the incident was over .
Or look at his entry to electoral politics . He ran for an Ohio Senate seat in 1970 , but lost the Democratic primary to Howard Metzenbaum . In 1974 he tried again , and again faced Metzenbaum in the primary . Metzenbaum gave a speech in which he charged that Glenn , who ’ d served in the military and then worked for NASA , had never held a “ real job . ”
Umbrage was taken . In a debate , Glenn ripped into his opponent . He noted that he ’ d been a Marine for 23 years , through two wars and 149 missions . His plane had been hit by antiaircraft fire 12 times . Then he ’ d been an original member of the space program . His life , not his checkbook , had always been on the line .
“ You go with me on Memorial Day coming up , and you stand in Arlington National Cemetery , where I have more friends than I ’ d like to remember , and you watch those waving flags . You stand there , and you think about this nation , and you tell me that those people didn ’ t have a job , ” said Glenn .
He won , and served as an Ohio Senator for 25 years , leaving office on Jan. 2 , 1999 .
He was not a natural politician , as events proved . He ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 1984 as a centrist but lost to the liberal Minnesotan Walter Mondale . But he was a natural aviator . The sky was his element . Speed was his companion .
As a small boy growing up in small New Concord , Ohio , in the 1920s he ’ d hold a small plane with a propeller out the window of the car as his dad drove and watch the prop spin . When he got a little older he ’ d build his own models – flying ones , constructed methodically of balsa and tissue and glue and rubber bands .
“ I ’ d fly them , and they ’ d crash , and I ’ d repair them and fly them again , they ’ d crash , ” Glenn said in a 1997 NASA oral history .
He thought he ’ d never learn to really fly . It was too expensive . But when he attended Muskingum College in New Concord , Ohio , World War II was approaching . The US government started a program that helped young men with flight training in small light planes . Glenn learned in a Taylorcraft with a 65-horsepower Lycoming engine .
“ I thought that was too good a chance to miss , and so I took that , ” he said in 1997 .
He would fly small planes all his life . For decades , he and his wife Annie commuted from Washington to Ohio in their twin-engine Beechcraft Baron . He finally sold it in 2012 because it was getting more difficult for the couple to clamber in . At the time , he was 90 .
After Pearl Harbor , the young Glenn quickly volunteered for service . He was in flight training for a year and then flying close-support missions as a Marine pilot in the Pacific . He accumulated 3,000 hours in the iconic gull-wing Corsair fighter .
After World War II , he decided to stay in the military . He was good at flying , he thought . He checked out on jets , volunteered to fly with the Air Force ( as a Marine on loan ) and ended up in Korea , flying F-86s against MiGs .
Tactics were still from World War II , or even World War I . Aircraft were still armed with guns . They didn ’ t have radars . Everything was visual . But jet speed was much faster . If you were flying 500 miles per hour towards an opponent , and the opponent was doing the same thing towards you , the closing speed was 1,000 miles per hour .
“ There was lots of real wild flying , ” Glenn noted in 1997 .
Glenn shot down three MiGs in the last nine days of the war . After the armistice , he ended up a test pilot at Patuxent Naval Air Station on the Chesapeake Bay . In 1957 he flew an F8U-Crusader in “ Project Bullet , ” the first supersonic transcontinental flight . He made it from New York to California in just a tick over three hours and 23 minutes .
Then came NASA . As a test pilot with combat experience in superior physical condition ( he could still do 75 pushups at age 75 ) , Glenn was a natural pick as a member of the first group of American astronauts , the Mercury 7 .
As depicted by author Tom Wolfe in his book “ The Right Stuff , ” Glenn was somewhat pious , a sober and more politically-minded member of the astronaut corps who scolded some of the others about escapades he thought might look bad if they got into the press .
“ He looked like a balding and slightly tougher version of the cutest-looking freckle-faced country boy you ever saw , ” Wolfe wrote .
Glenn later said he thought Wolfe ’ s portrait of him and the others was pretty accurate , though the conflict was exaggerated . He had little use for the movie version of the book , though , labeling it “ lousy . ”
He lobbied for the nation ’ s first space flight . Perhaps he lobbied a bit too hard – the honor went to Alan Shepard . Gus Grissom was next . But Glenn was the first American to orbit the earth , following the Soviet Gherman Titov .
The impact of Glenn ’ s feat was tremendous . Crowds jammed into public spaces to watch the flight ’ s progress en masse on still-novel television screens . Studying the effects of weightlessness was one of Glenn ’ s main tasks – for instance , he had a tiny eye test chart he had to read off every 20 minutes , to see if his vision was affected .
“ Zero G , and I feel fine , ” he said in orbit .
At a time when it seemed the Soviet Union might run away with the space race , the US was back in the game . Glenn was the hero the nation needed . He addressed a joint session of Congress . Four million people cheered as he and Annie rode up the canyons of Manhattan in a convertible for a ticker-tape parade .
He wanted to go back . He quickly asked to get back in line for another flight , but NASA kept putting him off . Decades passed before he learned that President John F. Kennedy had asked he be grounded , lest the nation lose one of its biggest astronaut celebrities .
In fact , Glenn knew the Kennedys well . He was particularly friendly with Bobby Kennedy . The astronaut considered RFK to be an interesting and intensely curious person . During one river rafting trip , Kennedy went around the camp fire and asked each person there how many real friends – people they could trust with their money and secrets – each person had .
“ I think this questioning nature , maybe , is one of the hallmarks or the common denominators among all great men , or many great men , anyway , ” said Glenn in an oral history interview for the Kennedy Library in 1969 .
It was at a dinner at RFK ’ s Hickory Hill mansion outside D.C. that the younger Kennedy urged him to run for office . The idea appealed to Glenn – particularly if he could count on Kennedy money and support .
The astronaut mounted an abortive Senate run in 1964 . An injury in a bathroom fall led him to pull out of the race . Glenn then worked for Royal Crown cola and real estate management firms .
In 1968 , the famous Glenn campaigned with Bobby in the Democratic presidential primaries . He was in the Ambassador Hotel when Sirhan Sirhan killed Kennedy on June 5 . The next day Glenn accompanied six of Kennedy ’ s children back to their Hickory Hill home , and informed the offspring that had stayed home of their father ’ s demise . It was , he later said , the hardest thing he ever had to do .
As a senator himself Glenn moved from Kennedyesque liberalism toward more centrist positions . He developed into something of an expert on defense and arms control . His 1984 presidential run was half-hearted , in the eyes of some experts . Underfunded and underthought , it ended $ 2 million in debt .

Glenn finally returned to space in 1998 . He insisted to NASA officials that he would be the perfect subject to investigate the effects of launch and weightlessness on older astronauts .

Dreaming in the back seat

As a small boy growing up in small New Concord, Ohio, in the 1920s he’d hold a small plane with a propeller out the window of the car as his dad drove and watch the prop spin.

general_news,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/3/8706323/college-professor-afraid,"I'm a liberal professor, and my liberal students terrify me",2015-06-03,Edward Schlosser,"I ’ m a professor at a midsize state school . I have been teaching college classes for nine years now . I have won ( minor ) teaching awards , studied pedagogy extensively , and almost always score highly on my student evaluations . I am not a world-class teacher by any means , but I am conscientious ; I attempt to put teaching ahead of research , and I take a healthy emotional stake in the well-being and growth of my students .
Things have changed since I started teaching . The vibe is different . I wish there were a less blunt way to put this , but my students sometimes scare me — particularly the liberal ones .
Not , like , in a person-by-person sense , but students in general . The student-teacher dynamic has been reenvisioned along a line that ’ s simultaneously consumerist and hyper-protective , giving each and every student the ability to claim Grievous Harm in nearly any circumstance , after any affront , and a teacher ’ s formal ability to respond to these claims is limited at best .
In early 2009 , I was an adjunct , teaching a freshman-level writing course at a community college . Discussing infographics and data visualization , we watched a flash animation describing how Wall Street ’ s recklessness had destroyed the economy .
The video stopped , and I asked whether the students thought it was effective . An older student raised his hand .
” What about Fannie and Freddie ? ” he asked . “ Government kept giving homes to black people , to help out black people , white people didn ’ t get anything , and then they couldn ’ t pay for them . What about that ? ”
I gave a quick response about how most experts would disagree with that assumption , that it was actually an oversimplification , and pretty dishonest , and isn ’ t it good that someone made the video we just watched to try to clear things up ? And , hey , let ’ s talk about whether that was effective , okay ? If you don ’ t think it was , how could it have been ?
The next week , I got called into my director ’ s office . I was shown an email , sender name redacted , alleging that I “ possessed communistical [ sic ] sympathies and refused to tell more than one side of the story. ” The story in question wasn ’ t described , but I suspect it had do to with whether or not the economic collapse was caused by poor black people .
My director rolled her eyes . She knew the complaint was silly bullshit . I wrote up a short description of the past week ’ s class work , noting that we had looked at several examples of effective writing in various media and that I always made a good faith effort to include conservative narratives along with the liberal ones .
Along with a carbon-copy form , my description was placed into a file that may or may not have existed . Then ... nothing . It disappeared forever ; no one cared about it beyond their contractual duties to document student concerns . I never heard another word of it again .
That was the first , and so far only , formal complaint a student has ever filed against me .
This isn ’ t an accident : I have intentionally adjusted my teaching materials as the political winds have shifted . ( I also make sure all my remotely offensive or challenging opinions , such as this article , are expressed either anonymously or pseudonymously ) . Most of my colleagues who still have jobs have done the same . We ’ ve seen bad things happen to too many good teachers — adjuncts getting axed because their evaluations dipped below a 3.0 , grad students being removed from classes after a single student complaint , and so on .
I once saw an adjunct not get his contract renewed after students complained that he exposed them to “ offensive ” texts written by Edward Said and Mark Twain . His response , that the texts were meant to be a little upsetting , only fueled the students ’ ire and sealed his fate . That was enough to get me to comb through my syllabi and cut out anything I could see upsetting a coddled undergrad , texts ranging from Upton Sinclair to Maureen Tkacik — and I wasn ’ t the only one who made adjustments , either .
I am frightened sometimes by the thought that a student would complain again like he did in 2009 . Only this time it would be a student accusing me not of saying something too ideologically extreme — be it communism or racism or whatever — but of not being sensitive enough toward his feelings , of some simple act of indelicacy that ’ s considered tantamount to physical assault . As Northwestern University professor Laura Kipnis writes , “ Emotional discomfort is [ now ] regarded as equivalent to material injury , and all injuries have to be remediated. ” Hurting a student ’ s feelings , even in the course of instruction that is absolutely appropriate and respectful , can now get a teacher into serious trouble .
In 2009 , the subject of my student ’ s complaint was my supposed ideology . I was communistical , the student felt , and everyone knows that communisticism is wrong . That was , at best , a debatable assertion . And as I was allowed to rebut it , the complaint was dismissed with prejudice . I didn ’ t hesitate to reuse that same video in later semesters , and the student ’ s complaint had no impact on my performance evaluations .
In 2015 , such a complaint would not be delivered in such a fashion . Instead of focusing on the rightness or wrongness ( or even acceptability ) of the materials we reviewed in class , the complaint would center solely on how my teaching affected the student ’ s emotional state . As I can not speak to the emotions of my students , I could not mount a defense about the acceptability of my instruction . And if I responded in any way other than apologizing and changing the materials we reviewed in class , professional consequences would likely follow .
I wrote about this fear on my blog , and while the response was mostly positive , some liberals called me paranoid , or expressed doubt about why any teacher would nix the particular texts I listed . I guarantee you that these people do not work in higher education , or if they do they are at least two decades removed from the job search . The academic job market is brutal . Teachers who are not tenured or tenure-track faculty members have no right to due process before being dismissed , and there ’ s a mile-long line of applicants eager to take their place . And as writer and academic Freddie DeBoer writes , they don ’ t even have to be formally fired — they can just not get rehired . In this type of environment , boat-rocking isn ’ t just dangerous , it ’ s suicidal , and so teachers limit their lessons to things they know won ’ t upset anybody .
The real problem : a simplistic , unworkable , and ultimately stifling conception of social justice
This shift in student-teacher dynamic placed many of the traditional goals of higher education — such as having students challenge their beliefs — off limits . While I used to pride myself on getting students to question themselves and engage with difficult concepts and texts , I now hesitate . What if this hurts my evaluations and I don ’ t get tenure ? How many complaints will it take before chairs and administrators begin to worry that I ’ m not giving our customers — er , students , pardon me — the positive experience they ’ re paying for ? Ten ? Half a dozen ? Two or three ?
This phenomenon has been widely discussed as of late , mostly as a means of deriding political , economic , or cultural forces writers don ’ t much care for . Commentators on the left and right have recently criticized the sensitivity and paranoia of today ’ s college students . They worry about the stifling of free speech , the implementation of unenforceable conduct codes , and a general hostility against opinions and viewpoints that could cause students so much as a hint of discomfort .
It ’ s not just that students refuse to countenance uncomfortable ideas — they refuse to engage them , period .
I agree with some of these analyses more than others , but they all tend to be too simplistic . The current student-teacher dynamic has been shaped by a large confluence of factors , and perhaps the most important of these is the manner in which cultural studies and social justice writers have comported themselves in popular media . I have a great deal of respect for both of these fields , but their manifestations online , their desire to democratize complex fields of study by making them as digestible as a TGIF sitcom , has led to adoption of a totalizing , simplistic , unworkable , and ultimately stifling conception of social justice . The simplicity and absolutism of this conception has combined with the precarity of academic jobs to create higher ed ’ s current climate of fear , a heavily policed discourse of semantic sensitivity in which safety and comfort have become the ends and the means of the college experience .
This new understanding of social justice politics resembles what University of Pennsylvania political science professor Adolph Reed Jr. calls a politics of personal testimony , in which the feelings of individuals are the primary or even exclusive means through which social issues are understood and discussed . Reed derides this sort of political approach as essentially being a non-politics , a discourse that “ is focused much more on taxonomy than politics [ which ] emphasizes the names by which we should call some strains of inequality [ ... ] over specifying the mechanisms that produce them or even the steps that can be taken to combat them. ” Under such a conception , people become more concerned with signaling goodness , usually through semantics and empty gestures , than with actually working to effect change .
Herein lies the folly of oversimplified identity politics : while identity concerns obviously warrant analysis , focusing on them too exclusively draws our attention so far inward that none of our analyses can lead to action . Rebecca Reilly Cooper , a political philosopher at the University of Warwick , worries about the effectiveness of a politics in which “ particular experiences can never legitimately speak for any one other than ourselves , and personal narrative and testimony are elevated to such a degree that there can be no objective standpoint from which to examine their veracity. ” Personal experience and feelings aren ’ t just a salient touchstone of contemporary identity politics ; they are the entirety of these politics . In such an environment , it ’ s no wonder that students are so prone to elevate minor slights to protestable offenses .
( It ’ s also why seemingly piddling matters of cultural consumption warrant much more emotional outrage than concerns with larger material implications . Compare the number of web articles surrounding the supposed problematic aspects of the newest Avengers movie with those complaining about , say , the piecemeal dismantling of abortion rights . The former outnumber the latter considerably , and their rhetoric is typically much more impassioned and inflated . I ’ d discuss this in my classes — if I weren ’ t too scared to talk about abortion . )
The press for actionability , or even for comprehensive analyses that go beyond personal testimony , is hereby considered redundant , since all we need to do to fix the world ’ s problems is adjust the feelings attached to them and open up the floor for various identity groups to have their say . All the old , enlightened means of discussion and analysis —from due process to scientific method — are dismissed as being blind to emotional concerns and therefore unfairly skewed toward the interest of straight white males . All that matters is that people are allowed to speak , that their narratives are accepted without question , and that the bad feelings go away .
So it ’ s not just that students refuse to countenance uncomfortable ideas — they refuse to engage them , period . Engagement is considered unnecessary , as the immediate , emotional reactions of students contain all the analysis and judgment that sensitive issues demand . As Judith Shulevitz wrote in the New York Times , these refusals can shut down discussion in genuinely contentious areas , such as when Oxford canceled an abortion debate . More often , they affect surprisingly minor matters , as when Hampshire College disinvited an Afrobeat band because their lineup had too many white people in it .
At the very least , there ’ s debate to be had in these areas . Ideally , pro-choice students would be comfortable enough in the strength of their arguments to subject them to discussion , and a conversation about a band ’ s supposed cultural appropriation could take place alongside a performance . But these cancellations and disinvitations are framed in terms of feelings , not issues . The abortion debate was canceled because it would have imperiled the “ welfare and safety of our students. ” The Afrofunk band ’ s presence would not have been “ safe and healthy. ” No one can rebut feelings , and so the only thing left to do is shut down the things that cause distress — no argument , no discussion , just hit the mute button and pretend eliminating discomfort is the same as effecting actual change .
In a New York Magazine piece , Jonathan Chait described the chilling effect this type of discourse has upon classrooms . Chait ’ s piece generated seismic backlash , and while I disagree with much of his diagnosis , I have to admit he does a decent job of describing the symptoms . He cites an anonymous professor who says that “ she and her fellow faculty members are terrified of facing accusations of triggering trauma. ” Internet liberals pooh-poohed this comment , likening the professor to one of Tom Friedman ’ s imaginary cab drivers . But I ’ ve seen what ’ s being described here . I ’ ve lived it . It ’ s real , and it affects liberal , socially conscious teachers much more than conservative ones .
If we wish to remove this fear , and to adopt a politics that can lead to more substantial change , we need to adjust our discourse . Ideally , we can have a conversation that is conscious of the role of identity issues and confident of the ideas that emanate from the people who embody those identities . It would call out and criticize unfair , arbitrary , or otherwise stifling discursive boundaries , but avoid falling into pettiness or nihilism . It wouldn ’ t be moderate , necessarily , but it would be deliberate . It would require effort .
In the start of his piece , Chait hypothetically asks if “ the offensiveness of an idea [ can ] be determined objectively , or only by recourse to the identity of the person taking offense. ” Here , he ’ s getting at the concerns addressed by Reed and Reilly-Cooper , the worry that we ’ ve turned our analysis so completely inward that our judgment of a person ’ s speech hinges more upon their identity signifiers than on their ideas .
A sensible response to Chait ’ s question would be that this is a false binary , and that ideas can and should be judged both by the strength of their logic and by the cultural weight afforded to their speaker ’ s identity . Chait appears to believe only the former , and that ’ s kind of ridiculous . Of course someone ’ s social standing affects whether their ideas are considered offensive , or righteous , or even worth listening to . How can you think otherwise ?
Feminists and anti-racists recognize that identity does matter . This is indisputable . If we subscribe to the belief that ideas can be judged within a vacuum , uninfluenced by the social weight of their proponents , we perpetuate a system in which arbitrary markers like race and gender influence the perceived correctness of ideas . We can ’ t overcome prejudice by pretending it doesn ’ t exist . Focusing on identity allows us to interrogate the process through which white males have their opinions taken at face value , while women , people of color , and non-normatively gendered people struggle to have their voices heard .
But we also destroy ourselves when identity becomes our sole focus . Consider a tweet I linked to ( which has since been removed . See editor ’ s note below . ) , from a critic and artist , in which she writes : “ When ppl go off on evo psych , its always some shady colonizer white man theory that ignores nonwhite human history . but ‘ science ’ . Ok ... Most ‘ scientific thought ’ as u know it isnt that scientific but shaped by white patriarchal bias of ppl who claimed authority on it . ”
This critic is intelligent . Her voice is important . She realizes , correctly , that evolutionary psychology is flawed , and that science has often been misused to legitimize racist and sexist beliefs . But why draw that out to questioning most “ scientific thought ” ? Can ’ t we see how distancing that is to people who don ’ t already agree with us ? And tactically , can ’ t we see how shortsighted it is to be skeptical of a respected manner of inquiry just because it ’ s associated with white males ?
This sort of perspective is not confined to Twitter and the comments sections of liberal blogs . It was born in the more nihilistic corners of academic theory , and its manifestations on social media have severe real-world implications . In another instance , two female professors of library science publicly outed and shamed a male colleague they accused of being creepy at conferences , going so far as to openly celebrate the prospect of ruining his career . I don ’ t doubt that some men are creepy at conferences — they are . And for all I know , this guy might be an A-level creep . But part of the female professors ’ shtick was the strong insistence that harassment victims should never be asked for proof , that an enunciation of an accusation is all it should ever take to secure a guilty verdict . The identity of the victims overrides the identity of the harasser , and that ’ s all the proof they need .
This is terrifying . No one will ever accept that . And if that becomes a salient part of liberal politics , liberals are going to suffer tremendous electoral defeat .
Debate and discussion would ideally temper this identity-based discourse , make it more usable and less scary to outsiders . Teachers and academics are the best candidates to foster this discussion , but most of us are too scared and economically disempowered to say anything . Right now , there ’ s nothing much to do other than sit on our hands and wait for the ascension of conservative political backlash — hop into the echo chamber , pile invective upon the next person or company who says something vaguely insensitive , insulate ourselves further and further from any concerns that might resonate outside of our own little corner of Twitter .
Update : After a discussion with a woman whose tweet was quoted in the story , the editors of this piece agreed that some of the conclusions drawn in the article misrepresented her tweet and the article was revised . The woman requested anonymity because she said she was receiving death threats as a result of the story , so her name has been removed . Unfortunately , threats are a horrible reality for many women online and a topic we intend to report on further .","I’m a professor at a midsize state school. I have been teaching college classes for nine years now. I have won (minor) teaching awards, studied pedagogy extensively, and almost always score highly on my student evaluations. I am not a world-class teacher by any means, but I am conscientious; I attempt to put teaching ahead of research, and I take a healthy emotional stake in the well-being and growth of my students.

Things have changed since I started teaching. The vibe is different. I wish there were a less blunt way to put this, but my students sometimes scare me — particularly the liberal ones.

Not, like, in a person-by-person sense, but students in general. The student-teacher dynamic has been reenvisioned along a line that’s simultaneously consumerist and hyper-protective, giving each and every student the ability to claim Grievous Harm in nearly any circumstance, after any affront, and a teacher’s formal ability to respond to these claims is limited at best.

What it was like before

In early 2009, I was an adjunct, teaching a freshman-level writing course at a community college. Discussing infographics and data visualization, we watched a flash animation describing how Wall Street’s recklessness had destroyed the economy.

The video stopped, and I asked whether the students thought it was effective. An older student raised his hand.

”What about Fannie and Freddie?” he asked. “Government kept giving homes to black people, to help out black people, white people didn’t get anything, and then they couldn’t pay for them. What about that?”

I gave a quick response about how most experts would disagree with that assumption, that it was actually an oversimplification, and pretty dishonest, and isn’t it good that someone made the video we just watched to try to clear things up? And, hey, let’s talk about whether that was effective, okay? If you don’t think it was, how could it have been?

The rest of the discussion went on as usual.

The next week, I got called into my director’s office. I was shown an email, sender name redacted, alleging that I “possessed communistical [sic] sympathies and refused to tell more than one side of the story.” The story in question wasn’t described, but I suspect it had do to with whether or not the economic collapse was caused by poor black people.

My director rolled her eyes. She knew the complaint was silly bullshit. I wrote up a short description of the past week’s class work, noting that we had looked at several examples of effective writing in various media and that I always made a good faith effort to include conservative narratives along with the liberal ones.

Along with a carbon-copy form, my description was placed into a file that may or may not have existed. Then ... nothing. It disappeared forever; no one cared about it beyond their contractual duties to document student concerns. I never heard another word of it again.

That was the first, and so far only, formal complaint a student has ever filed against me.

Now boat-rocking isn’t just dangerous — it’s suicidal

This isn’t an accident: I have intentionally adjusted my teaching materials as the political winds have shifted. (I also make sure all my remotely offensive or challenging opinions, such as this article, are expressed either anonymously or pseudonymously). Most of my colleagues who still have jobs have done the same. We’ve seen bad things happen to too many good teachers — adjuncts getting axed because their evaluations dipped below a 3.0, grad students being removed from classes after a single student complaint, and so on.

I once saw an adjunct not get his contract renewed after students complained that he exposed them to “offensive” texts written by Edward Said and Mark Twain. His response, that the texts were meant to be a little upsetting, only fueled the students’ ire and sealed his fate. That was enough to get me to comb through my syllabi and cut out anything I could see upsetting a coddled undergrad, texts ranging from Upton Sinclair to Maureen Tkacik — and I wasn’t the only one who made adjustments, either.

I am frightened sometimes by the thought that a student would complain again like he did in 2009. Only this time it would be a student accusing me not of saying something too ideologically extreme — be it communism or racism or whatever — but of not being sensitive enough toward his feelings, of some simple act of indelicacy that’s considered tantamount to physical assault. As Northwestern University professor Laura Kipnis writes, “Emotional discomfort is [now] regarded as equivalent to material injury, and all injuries have to be remediated.” Hurting a student’s feelings, even in the course of instruction that is absolutely appropriate and respectful, can now get a teacher into serious trouble.

In 2009, the subject of my student’s complaint was my supposed ideology. I was communistical, the student felt, and everyone knows that communisticism is wrong. That was, at best, a debatable assertion. And as I was allowed to rebut it, the complaint was dismissed with prejudice. I didn’t hesitate to reuse that same video in later semesters, and the student’s complaint had no impact on my performance evaluations.

In 2015, such a complaint would not be delivered in such a fashion. Instead of focusing on the rightness or wrongness (or even acceptability) of the materials we reviewed in class, the complaint would center solely on how my teaching affected the student’s emotional state. As I cannot speak to the emotions of my students, I could not mount a defense about the acceptability of my instruction. And if I responded in any way other than apologizing and changing the materials we reviewed in class, professional consequences would likely follow.

I wrote about this fear on my blog, and while the response was mostly positive, some liberals called me paranoid, or expressed doubt about why any teacher would nix the particular texts I listed. I guarantee you that these people do not work in higher education, or if they do they are at least two decades removed from the job search. The academic job market is brutal. Teachers who are not tenured or tenure-track faculty members have no right to due process before being dismissed, and there’s a mile-long line of applicants eager to take their place. And as writer and academic Freddie DeBoer writes, they don’t even have to be formally fired — they can just not get rehired. In this type of environment, boat-rocking isn’t just dangerous, it’s suicidal, and so teachers limit their lessons to things they know won’t upset anybody.

The real problem: a simplistic, unworkable, and ultimately stifling conception of social justice

This shift in student-teacher dynamic placed many of the traditional goals of higher education — such as having students challenge their beliefs — off limits. While I used to pride myself on getting students to question themselves and engage with difficult concepts and texts, I now hesitate. What if this hurts my evaluations and I don’t get tenure? How many complaints will it take before chairs and administrators begin to worry that I’m not giving our customers — er, students, pardon me — the positive experience they’re paying for? Ten? Half a dozen? Two or three?

This phenomenon has been widely discussed as of late, mostly as a means of deriding political, economic, or cultural forces writers don’t much care for. Commentators on the left and right have recently criticized the sensitivity and paranoia of today’s college students. They worry about the stifling of free speech, the implementation of unenforceable conduct codes, and a general hostility against opinions and viewpoints that could cause students so much as a hint of discomfort.

It’s not just that students refuse to countenance uncomfortable ideas — they refuse to engage them, period.

I agree with some of these analyses more than others, but they all tend to be too simplistic. The current student-teacher dynamic has been shaped by a large confluence of factors, and perhaps the most important of these is the manner in which cultural studies and social justice writers have comported themselves in popular media. I have a great deal of respect for both of these fields, but their manifestations online, their desire to democratize complex fields of study by making them as digestible as a TGIF sitcom, has led to adoption of a totalizing, simplistic, unworkable, and ultimately stifling conception of social justice. The simplicity and absolutism of this conception has combined with the precarity of academic jobs to create higher ed’s current climate of fear, a heavily policed discourse of semantic sensitivity in which safety and comfort have become the ends and the means of the college experience.

This new understanding of social justice politics resembles what University of Pennsylvania political science professor Adolph Reed Jr. calls a politics of personal testimony, in which the feelings of individuals are the primary or even exclusive means through which social issues are understood and discussed. Reed derides this sort of political approach as essentially being a non-politics, a discourse that “is focused much more on taxonomy than politics [which] emphasizes the names by which we should call some strains of inequality [ ... ] over specifying the mechanisms that produce them or even the steps that can be taken to combat them.” Under such a conception, people become more concerned with signaling goodness, usually through semantics and empty gestures, than with actually working to effect change.

Herein lies the folly of oversimplified identity politics: while identity concerns obviously warrant analysis, focusing on them too exclusively draws our attention so far inward that none of our analyses can lead to action. Rebecca Reilly Cooper, a political philosopher at the University of Warwick, worries about the effectiveness of a politics in which “particular experiences can never legitimately speak for any one other than ourselves, and personal narrative and testimony are elevated to such a degree that there can be no objective standpoint from which to examine their veracity.” Personal experience and feelings aren’t just a salient touchstone of contemporary identity politics; they are the entirety of these politics. In such an environment, it’s no wonder that students are so prone to elevate minor slights to protestable offenses.

(It’s also why seemingly piddling matters of cultural consumption warrant much more emotional outrage than concerns with larger material implications. Compare the number of web articles surrounding the supposed problematic aspects of the newest Avengers movie with those complaining about, say, the piecemeal dismantling of abortion rights. The former outnumber the latter considerably, and their rhetoric is typically much more impassioned and inflated. I’d discuss this in my classes — if I weren’t too scared to talk about abortion.)

The press for actionability, or even for comprehensive analyses that go beyond personal testimony, is hereby considered redundant, since all we need to do to fix the world’s problems is adjust the feelings attached to them and open up the floor for various identity groups to have their say. All the old, enlightened means of discussion and analysis —from due process to scientific method — are dismissed as being blind to emotional concerns and therefore unfairly skewed toward the interest of straight white males. All that matters is that people are allowed to speak, that their narratives are accepted without question, and that the bad feelings go away.

So it’s not just that students refuse to countenance uncomfortable ideas — they refuse to engage them, period. Engagement is considered unnecessary, as the immediate, emotional reactions of students contain all the analysis and judgment that sensitive issues demand. As Judith Shulevitz wrote in the New York Times, these refusals can shut down discussion in genuinely contentious areas, such as when Oxford canceled an abortion debate. More often, they affect surprisingly minor matters, as when Hampshire College disinvited an Afrobeat band because their lineup had too many white people in it.

When feelings become more important than issues

At the very least, there’s debate to be had in these areas. Ideally, pro-choice students would be comfortable enough in the strength of their arguments to subject them to discussion, and a conversation about a band’s supposed cultural appropriation could take place alongside a performance. But these cancellations and disinvitations are framed in terms of feelings, not issues. The abortion debate was canceled because it would have imperiled the “welfare and safety of our students.” The Afrofunk band’s presence would not have been “safe and healthy.” No one can rebut feelings, and so the only thing left to do is shut down the things that cause distress — no argument, no discussion, just hit the mute button and pretend eliminating discomfort is the same as effecting actual change.

In a New York Magazine piece, Jonathan Chait described the chilling effect this type of discourse has upon classrooms. Chait’s piece generated seismic backlash, and while I disagree with much of his diagnosis, I have to admit he does a decent job of describing the symptoms. He cites an anonymous professor who says that “she and her fellow faculty members are terrified of facing accusations of triggering trauma.” Internet liberals pooh-poohed this comment, likening the professor to one of Tom Friedman’s imaginary cab drivers. But I’ve seen what’s being described here. I’ve lived it. It’s real, and it affects liberal, socially conscious teachers much more than conservative ones.

If we wish to remove this fear, and to adopt a politics that can lead to more substantial change, we need to adjust our discourse. Ideally, we can have a conversation that is conscious of the role of identity issues and confident of the ideas that emanate from the people who embody those identities. It would call out and criticize unfair, arbitrary, or otherwise stifling discursive boundaries, but avoid falling into pettiness or nihilism. It wouldn’t be moderate, necessarily, but it would be deliberate. It would require effort.

Today’s ill-informed critics of Churchill would be speaking German if he had not led the fight against Hitler.

But where many on the left are concerned, an ounce of sin washes away a lifetime of heroism. Churchill said mean things about people; this is apparently more important than the fact that he successfully led Great Britain through the most dangerous time in her history, stewarding that tiny island nation not only through Dunkirk and the Battle of Britain, but fighting on alone against the ever-increasing tsunami of Hitlerian power.

The war on the history of the West isn’t merely a difference of opinion, to be glossed over with a few words about bipartisanship. America is divided right now between two groups: those who believe that America and the West are fundamentally good and worth fighting for, despite their myriad historic shortcomings; and those who believe that America and the West are fundamentally evil and racist, steeped in structural power imbalances. A house divided against itself cannot stand; those who care for their homes cannot declare unity with arsonists.

general_news,USA TODAY,1,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/22/president-trump-police-surplus-military-gear-fizzles/536228002/,Trump executive order fails to boost flow of military gear to local police departments,2018-04-22,,"The amount of surplus military equipment sent to local police departments across the nation has sharply declined in recent months despite an executive order President Trump signed that was intended to increase those transfers , a ███ analysis has found .
Shipments of military gear in the first three months of 2018 fell by half compared with the same period last year , Department of Defense data show . The amount of armored vehicles , high-caliber rifles and other equipment measured by dollar value also slid .
Trump ’ s executive order , signed last August , rescinded limits imposed on the program by the Obama administration after the battlefield-style response to the Ferguson , Mo. , riots in 2014 caused an uproar . Some police officials said they are approaching the program cautiously despite robust support from Trump .
“ If you have a long rifle or you have a military vehicle , it looks bad , ” said Sgt . Stephen Wells , a spokesman for the Kern County Sheriff ’ s Office in California , which ordered about 90 military items from the Pentagon in 2015 but only one last year . “ We ’ re not an occupying force . ”
Since 1991 , the program has recycled about $ 6.8 billion in military equipment purchased by federal taxpayers .
It came under scrutiny amid the riots in Ferguson that followed the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by police . Images of officers wearing tactical gear standing alongside armored vehicles flashed across network news and drew bipartisan criticism in Congress .
In response , Obama placed limits on some kinds of equipment in 2015 . The show of force , Obama said then , opened a rift between the police and the community at a time when both would have benefited from better relations .
But Trump administration officials said the restrictions went too far , limiting police from obtaining equipment that could help them meet modern challenges . Trump ’ s order was touted by those officials at the time as a way to increase the flow of “ lifesaving gear ” to police .
Announcing the order last year , Attorney General Jeff Sessions criticized Obama for the limits and vowed that the Trump administration would not “ put superficial concerns above public safety . ”
The data show a bump in shipments in September , the month immediately following Trump 's action , but that appears to have been an anomaly . The average monthly value of military gear shipped to local departments in 2016 was just over $ 17 million . So far this year , the average monthly value stands at $ 5.2 million .
A White House spokeswoman referred questions to the Justice Department . A spokeswoman at Justice referred questions to the Defense Department .
A spokeswoman for the Defense Logistics Agency , which oversees the program , said this year 's decline is “ likely due to those … items not being available . ”
The spokeswoman , Michelle McCaskill , described the change ushered in by Trump 's executive order as `` minimal . ''
But while some police departments are more aware of the public relations concerns associated with the equipment , Wells and others suggested that local law enforcement is unlikely to abandon the program entirely .

USA TODAY

The amount of surplus military equipment sent to local police departments across the nation has sharply declined in recent months despite an executive order President Trump signed that was intended to increase those transfers, a USA TODAY analysis has found.

Shipments of military gear in the first three months of 2018 fell by half compared with the same period last year, Department of Defense data show. The amount of armored vehicles, high-caliber rifles and other equipment measured by dollar value also slid.

Trump’s executive order, signed last August, rescinded limits imposed on the program by the Obama administration after the battlefield-style response to the Ferguson, Mo., riots in 2014 caused an uproar. Some police officials said they are approaching the program cautiously despite robust support from Trump.

“If you have a long rifle or you have a military vehicle, it looks bad,” said Sgt. Stephen Wells, a spokesman for the Kern County Sheriff’s Office in California, which ordered about 90 military items from the Pentagon in 2015 but only one last year. “We’re not an occupying force.”

Since 1991, the program has recycled about $6.8 billion in military equipment purchased by federal taxpayers.

It came under scrutiny amid the riots in Ferguson that followed the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by police. Images of officers wearing tactical gear standing alongside armored vehicles flashed across network news and drew bipartisan criticism in Congress.

In response, Obama placed limits on some kinds of equipment in 2015. The show of force, Obama said then, opened a rift between the police and the community at a time when both would have benefited from better relations.

But Trump administration officials said the restrictions went too far, limiting police from obtaining equipment that could help them meet modern challenges. Trump’s order was touted by those officials at the time as a way to increase the flow of “lifesaving gear” to police.

Announcing the order last year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions criticized Obama for the limits and vowed that the Trump administration would not “put superficial concerns above public safety.”

The data show a bump in shipments in September, the month immediately following Trump's action, but that appears to have been an anomaly. The average monthly value of military gear shipped to local departments in 2016 was just over $17 million. So far this year, the average monthly value stands at $5.2 million.

A White House spokeswoman referred questions to the Justice Department. A spokeswoman at Justice referred questions to the Defense Department.

A spokeswoman for the Defense Logistics Agency, which oversees the program, said this year's decline is “likely due to those … items not being available.”

The spokeswoman, Michelle McCaskill, described the change ushered in by Trump's executive order as ""minimal.""

But while some police departments are more aware of the public relations concerns associated with the equipment, Wells and others suggested that local law enforcement is unlikely to abandon the program entirely. The equipment, he said, remains crucial for dangerous situations such as an active shooter.

By far the most common item transferred to police last year were military rifles, followed by weapon sights and night-vision goggles.

Attention to appearances

James Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, said he believes Trump’s order has put police across the nation in a stronger position. Both Trump and Sessions closely aligned with rank-and-file police during the presidential campaign.

Pasco speculated that the drop-off is a coincidence, though he also acknowledged that some local political leaders have been reluctant to embrace the program with zeal.

“If there’s a spate of additional unrest, then I predict that there’ll be a greater demand,” he said.

Critics pounced on the program again last year when the Government Accountability Office created a fictitious agency and obtained more than 100 military items worth $1.2 million, including night-vision goggles and simulated pipe bombs.

USA TODAY’s analysis focused exclusively on equipment the Department of Defense altered, or “demilitarized,” before transferring it to a local government. That means rifles, armored trucks, night-vision sniper scopes and other war-fighting equipment was included, but not radios, boots and printers.

The Project on Government Oversight, a Washington-based watchdog group, predicted last fall that Trump’s order would have little effect on the shipments. The more significant change, experts said, has been on how the government oversees the program.

“Trump did not make a huge difference in what is or is not allowed, despite statements from some in the administration,” said Peter Tyler, a senior policy analyst with the group. “Mostly what the Obama-era order did was put in some very helpful accountability steps.”

Rick Myers, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, said he was not surprised Trump's order didn't result in a sustained increase in demand. The problem with the program isn't the equipment, he said, but how some departments used it.

Gun Rights

One new Illinois law will extend the current 72-hour waiting period for purchasing handguns to all firearms; another will allow relatives or law officers to ask courts to remove guns from people believed to be a danger to themselves or others.

California, which already bars people younger than 21 from buying handguns, will extend that to long guns with a few exceptions for military members and licensed hunters.

Opponents of the legislation argued that people can obtain long guns through illegal channels and that state legislators should focus on making sure criminals and those with mental health issues cannot get guns themselves.

Republican Sen. Jim Nielsen said he thinks ""bills like this miss the target,"" as the Los Angeles Times reported.

GUN-RIGHTS ADVOCATES SUE TO BLOCK NEW WASHINGTON STATE LAW

""What is magic about 21?"" Nielsen asked. ""All of a sudden you are not a danger anymore?

The state's liberal lawmakers cited the February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida — in which a 19-year-old used an AR-15-style gun to kill 17 people — as justification for the legislation.

California also will ban guns for people with certain domestic violence misdemeanors and require eight hours of training and live-fire exercises to carry concealed weapons.

In a widely-cited tweet that he later claimed was in jest, California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell said last month that guns were not an effective deterrent against the government because ""the government has nukes.""

Immigration Policy

A Tennessee law will ban local governments from having ""sanctuary"" policies for people living in the country illegally. It bans local government policies that restrict compliance with federal immigration detainers.

The law also threatens to withhold future state economic development money from those that don't comply.

Colorado, however, will make it easier for immigrants living in the country illegally to renew state driver's licenses. The state has been issuing such licenses since 2014, but they had to be renewed in person every three years at one of just three state offices devoted to that purpose.

On abortion, states continue to move in different directions. A new Washington law will require contraception coverage in health insurance and, if a policy covers maternity care, also will require it to cover abortions.

A Kansas law, facing a court challenge, bans telemedicine abortions, in which patients seeking abortion pills consult with doctors through teleconferencing.

In Tennessee, a new law says if an ultrasound is performed before an abortion, the woman must be given the opportunity to learn the results.

JUDGE STRIKES DOWN MISSISSIPPI'S 15-WEEK ABORTION BAN

Arizona will require increased state reporting about abortions, and providers must ask women if they were coerced into seeking the procedure or if they were victims of sex trafficking or sexual assault.

Meanwhile, Hawaii will become the sixth state, along with Washington D.C., to legalize medically assisted suicide. The law will allow doctors to fulfill requests from terminally ill patients for fatal prescription medication. Two health-care providers must confirm a patient's diagnosis, prognosis and ability to make decisions about the prescription.

Criminal Justice

At the G-7 summit , Canada ’ s metrosexual Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was so upset with President Trump that he held a news conference to bash Trump after the event . During the presser the false eyebrow Trudeau was wearing over his left eye partially fell off .
Stupidity isn ’ t illegal , but it can be evidence of a crime . Mr. Lamar Brown is serving an 18-year sentence for burglary in South Carolina . The state ’ s supreme court upheld his conviction despite his lawyers ’ argument that his cell phone , found abandoned at the crime scene , was searched illegally . The cops had searched the phone after entering 1-2-3-4 as the passcode , which unlocked the phone and enabled the cops to trace the phone to Brown .
Bill Clinton , saddened that the days are gone when a president could get oral sex from an intern in the Oval Office , confessed , “ I think the norms have really changed in terms of , what you can do to somebody against their will , how much you can crowd their space , make them miserable at work . ”
As the month ended , the mischievous geniuses at the Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency — DARPA — announced that they had , just for the hell of it , reinvented the wheel . Instead of the rock , wood , or air-filled rubber circles mankind has used since the days of Fred Flintstone , the new DARPA wheel changes shape at the push of a button . The round wheel becomes a triangle with a rotating tank track that can climb over almost anything . Every enlisted man who has ever had to push a HUMVEE out of the mud rejoiced .
Brigadier General Gholam Reza Jalali , head of Iran ’ s Civil Defense Organization , claimed that Israel was committing “ weather theft ” by manipulating clouds to prevent rain from falling on Iran .

She immediately hit the campaign trail in several states , accompanied by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders . The only thing better than another Hillary presidential bid would be a Sanders-Cortez ticket in 2020 .
The New York Times welcomed Mizz Sarah Jeong to its editorial board and reporting staff . She is apparently qualified for her new job because she has tweeted jewels of editorial wisdom such as , “ Dumb * ss f * * * ing white people marking up the internet with their opinions like dogs pissing on fire hydrants , ” and “ White men are bulls * * * . ” ( There were no asterisks in the original . The asterisks are my totally futile effort to preserve some standards in journalism . )

Why would anyone think that life in Putin ’ s Russia is a dull misery ?
The Noo Yawk Mets appeared on the way to a record-setting season , losing so many games that they didn ’ t seem to qualify for last place in the National League . After they lost a game to the Washington Nationals by the franchise-record margin of 25-4 , a New York-based online mental health marketplace , UMA Health , offered free therapy to distraught Mets fans . It didn ’ t help .

Kaepernick is memorable only for kneeling during the playing of the national anthem in what he said was a protest of police brutality and oppression of black people . His 2016 protests caught on among the spoiled brats who play for the NFL and continued sporadically two years later .
Kaepernick ’ s motto is , “ Believe in something . Even if you have to sacrifice everything. ” What Kaepernick has sacrificed — he ’ s being paid millions of dollars by Nike — is not at all clear . What is clear is the fact that by the end of August one hundred law enforcement officers had died in the line of duty this year . In a Tweet praising Kaepernick , former Iranian prez Mahmoud “ Death to America ” Ahmadinejad said it was unfortunate that Kaepernick wasn ’ t on a team roster this year .

January

On New Year’s Day, California became the ninth state to legalize recreational marijuana. Shortly after that, several cities created affirmative action programs meant to help minority would-be pot sellers into the business. Criminals, who usually can’t get liquor licenses, are favored.

While the East Coast was being battered by a “bomb cyclone,” a winter storm so severe that frozen iguanas were falling from trees in Florida and sharks killed by the cold waters were washing up on New England beaches, Algore told us the ultra-cold weather was caused by “climate change,” the left’s label for what they used to call global warming.

It was so cold that Sen. Elizabeth Warren claimed to be an Eskimo.

Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury described President Trump as an idiot and mentally unstable. Trump answered the book’s criticism by Tweeting that he was a “very stable genius.” That brought to mind an incident from decades ago when the New York Times reported that Rep. Bill Scott of Virginia (later Sen. Scott) was the dumbest member of Congress. Scott then had a press conference to deny he was stupid, thereby proving the Times’s point.

Murphy’s Law was written to describe how governments work. A redundant proof of that fact occurred on January 13 when Hawaiians and visitors woke up to a cellphone alert from the Hawaii Emergency Management agency that a missile was incoming to Hawaii. It said, “THIS IS NO DRILL.” It took forty minutes for the alert to be canceled. Hawaii’s governor reportedly knew the alert was false but couldn’t send out a cancellation of it because he’d forgotten his Twitter password. Apparently not as intelligent as his smartphone, it never occurred to the gov to call any radio or tv stations.

As the month ended, twelve camels were eliminated from a camel beauty contest in Saudi Arabia after their owners were discovered to be using botox on their faces to improve their appearance. No aspect of that occurrence can be explained rationally.

February

Ms. Kim Jong Yo, sister of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Loon, was a big hit at the Olympic games according to the fawning western media. Ms. Kim, chief of her brother’s Propaganda and Agitation directorate, was proclaimed by the media a gold medalist in diplomacy.

Mr. Francisco Valdez, the winner one week of the “Friday Fugitive Bingo” video campaign by the Flagler County, Florida sheriff’s office, was arrested after he taunted the sheriff’s guys on Facebook, making it easy for them to find him. Sheriff Rick Staley said of the taunts, “This, obviously, was not the first bad idea he has had in his life.” The Friday Fugitive Bingo features announced vacancies at the “Green Roof Inn,” the county jail.

When CNN asked a federal court to unseal the records of grand jury proceedings in the Monica Lewinsky case, President Clinton’s criminal defense attorney David Kendall told the court that Bubba wanted to make his position on the matter known to the court before it decided the matter. It has never been clear if Clinton offered to pay the cleaning bill for Monica’s blue dress.

March

The month began on an upbeat note with the announcement that a public survey had found that California was the most unlivable state in the union. One of the principal reasons, the study concluded, is that so many Californians are insufferable. New Jersey finished next to last, which it does in polls on pretty much every subject.

Actress Emma Watson, of Harry Potter fame, sported a tattoo on Oscar night supporting the “Time’s Up” movement that insists on ending casting couch practices in moviedom. Unfortunately, her tattoo read, “Times Up,” the meaning of which is known only to supernatural grammarians.

Selen Atasoy, a research fellow at the Center for Brain and Cognition at the Pompeu Fabra University in Spain, reported that taking LSD can “reorganize your brain in a harmonizing way.” Techies are reportedly taking small doses to prove the point, which explains much about the social media they manage.

Apparently after being dosed by Selen Atasoy, the D.C. government unveiled an 8-foot statue of former mayor Marion Barry. Barry, best remembered for his penchant for snorting cocaine, was characterized by Mayor Muriel Bowser as a personification of the Nation’s Capital.

Chicago police, disparaging the efficiency of the practice, condemned the growing frequency of gun battles erupting at gang member funerals. In Hartford, Connecticut, Mr. Jonathan Rivera drove to court to answer charges of car theft. On leaving the court, he was arrested because he evidently stole the car he drove to the courthouse.

Former porn star Stormy Daniels told 60 Minutes that she spanked Donald Trump with a magazine during their alleged one-night stand. After the broadcast, Bill Clinton reportedly called Trump to ask for her phone number.

Pope Francis declared that there is no hell, which is a relief to a great many of us. On the other hand, opening day of the baseball season happened before the beginning of April. The confluence of these events can be interpreted in several ways.

April

Bereft of statues of Robert E. Lee, Thomas Jefferson, and other such infamous people, the town of Arcata, California, decided to tear down its only statue of a dead white guy, this one being the figure of President William McKinley. The town accused him of “settler colonialism,” as well as killing and raping native Americans. Having apparently flunked high school history Arcata Mayor Sofia Pereira asked, “Is there a difference between honoring McKinley and Robert E. Lee? They both represent historical pain.”

A gay activist lawyer protested global warming by burning himself to death, creating a smoke plume that was visible for miles. On a similar note, Los Angeles announced that it was going to paint all the city’s streets white to prevent black pavement from getting too hot and emitting planet-damaging heat.

Archeologists in Bergen, Norway, found a pair of dice evidently used by ancient Viking gamblers. One die had two “fives,” indicating that either Vikings couldn’t resist cheating or that they weren’t very good at reading numbers through an alcoholic haze after consuming too much mead. Astronomers said there was a cloud of smelly gas around Uranus, the less said about which the better.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo proclaimed that, “I am a woman… seeking to control her health and her choices.” At various times, he also said he was a Muslim and Jewish. He may want to visit the University of Utah, which is creating “crying rooms” for snowflakes who need a good cry.

May

The Army announced that it would grant a soldier a religious exception to its ban on beards because of his “heathen Norse pagan” religion. It is reportedly considering a religious exception for makeup and red noses to those whose religion is the Insane Clown Posse.

A Swedish mother wanted to get a tattoo of her children’s names — Kevin and Nova — on her arm, but the tattoo artist misspelled the boy’s name as “Kelvin.” Thinking that removing the tattoo was too difficult, she had the boy’s name legally changed to “Kelvin.” The lad, who is only five, was not consulted.

Searching desperately for a cure for its sinking ratings and hemorrhaging of viewers, ESPN rehired liberal lunatic Keith Olbermann. In a similar promotional event, the UN Disarmament Conference chose Syria as its new chairman.

June

Dancing at a nightclub in Denver, a young FBI agent did a backflip. In the process, he dropped his off-duty pistol and then fired it accidentally as he picked it up, wounding another club patron. The agent blamed the accident on Russians hacking his holster.

It was revealed that Louis Vuitton, maker of much overpriced luggage and women’s handbags, had hired a shaman to chant about the weather to protect its events from rain. When he was axed from the promotional budget, rain deluged an event in Chantilly, France. The shaman was immediately re-hired.

MIT geniuses decided to take artificial intelligence into the dark side. They intentionally created “Norman,” an AI psychopath named for the proprietor of the Bates Motel in the movie Psycho. It was apparently misnamed. Asked what it wanted most, the computer answered that it wanted to eat the questioner’s liver “…with some fava beans and a nice Chianti.”

The Miss America beauty contest announced that it would no longer have the girls compete based on their appearance. There will be no more bikini parades or “lookism.” Thus was charted a path to yet another comeback for Hillary Clinton and Roseanne Barr.

At the G-7 summit, Canada’s metrosexual Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was so upset with President Trump that he held a news conference to bash Trump after the event. During the presser the false eyebrow Trudeau was wearing over his left eye partially fell off.

The cops had searched the phone after entering 1-2-3-4 as the passcode, which unlocked the phone and enabled the cops to trace the phone to Brown.

Bill Clinton, saddened that the days are gone when a president could get oral sex from an intern in the Oval Office, confessed, “I think the norms have really changed in terms of, what you can do to somebody against their will, how much you can crowd their space, make them miserable at work.”

As the month ended, the mischievous geniuses at the Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency — DARPA — announced that they had, just for the hell of it, reinvented the wheel. Instead of the rock, wood, or air-filled rubber circles mankind has used since the days of Fred Flintstone, the new DARPA wheel changes shape at the push of a button. The round wheel becomes a triangle with a rotating tank track that can climb over almost anything. Every enlisted man who has ever had to push a HUMVEE out of the mud rejoiced.

July

Brigadier General Gholam Reza Jalali, head of Iran’s Civil Defense Organization, claimed that Israel was committing “weather theft” by manipulating clouds to prevent rain from falling on Iran. Before special counsel Robert Mueller could open an investigation into Jalali’s claim, the Israeli Mossad — or at least the brilliant smartasses who run the Mossad’s Twitter page (@MossadIL) — bragged about their ability to steal water from Iranian clouds.

August

The New York Times welcomed Mizz Sarah Jeong to its editorial board and reporting staff.

general_news,CNN (Web News),0,http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/07/us/bill-cosby-quaaludes-sexual-assault-allegations/index.html,Bill Cosby admitted to getting drugs to give to women,2015-07-07,"Holly Yan, Eliott C. Mclaughlin, Dana Ford","The documents , dating back to 2005 , stem from a civil lawsuit filed by Andrea Constand -- one of the dozens of women who have publicly accused the comedian of sexual assault . The records were made public Monday after The Associated Press went to court to compel their release .
CNN has attempted to reach a lawyer and publicist for Cosby to respond to the revelations contained in the documents , without success . His longtime publicist , David Brokaw , said , `` We have no plans to issue a statement . ''
`` When you got the Quaaludes , was it in your mind that you were going to use these Quaaludes for young women that you wanted to have sex with ? '' Troiani asked .
`` Did you ever give any of those young women the Quaaludes without their knowledge ? '' Troiani asked .
Cosby 's attorney objected and told him not to answer the question .
While Cosby admitted that he acquired seven prescriptions of Quaaludes with the intent to give the sedatives to young women he wanted to have sex with , he has not admitted to actually drugging any of his accusers .
He did say he gave drugs to `` other people , '' but when Troiani began to ask Cosby if he gave other people Quaaludes knowing they were illegal , Cosby 's attorney interjected and said that his client acknowledged giving them only to a woman whose name is redacted .
Cosby later testified that he `` misunderstood . Woman , meaning ( the woman whose name is redacted ) , not women '' -- even though Troiani had used neither word in her question .
`` You gave them to other people ? '' Troiani had previously asked , to which the comedian replied , `` Yes . ''
While Cosby 's attorneys cite two women who `` allegedly say that they knowingly took Quaaludes offered to them by Defendant in the late 1970 's '' -- one of them being former model Theresa Serignese , who has shared her accusations publicly -- they do not address the numerous women who say they were given pills for a variety of reasons , including to `` cheer up .

CNN has attempted to reach a lawyer and publicist for Cosby to respond to the revelations contained in the documents, without success. His longtime publicist, David Brokaw, said, ""We have no plans to issue a statement.""

""When you got the Quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going to use these Quaaludes for young women that you wanted to have sex with?"" Troiani asked.

""Yes,"" Cosby replied.

""Did you ever give any of those young women the Quaaludes without their knowledge?"" Troiani asked.

Cosby's attorney objected and told him not to answer the question.

Testy back and forth

While Cosby admitted that he acquired seven prescriptions of Quaaludes with the intent to give the sedatives to young women he wanted to have sex with, he has not admitted to actually drugging any of his accusers.

He did say he gave drugs to ""other people,"" but when Troiani began to ask Cosby if he gave other people Quaaludes knowing they were illegal, Cosby's attorney interjected and said that his client acknowledged giving them only to a woman whose name is redacted.

Cosby later testified that he ""misunderstood. Woman, meaning (the woman whose name is redacted), not women"" -- even though Troiani had used neither word in her question.

""You gave them to other people?"" Troiani had previously asked, to which the comedian replied, ""Yes.""

While Cosby's attorneys cite two women who ""allegedly say that they knowingly took Quaaludes offered to them by Defendant in the late 1970's"" -- one of them being former model Theresa Serignese, who has shared her accusations publicly -- they do not address the numerous women who say they were given pills for a variety of reasons, including to ""cheer up.""

Several women allege Cosby used cappuccino, soft drinks, wine or other beverages as vehicles to drug them, but accusers Constand, Serignese, Janice Dickinson, Tamara Green, Victoria Valentino, Donna Motsinger and a woman identified only as Chelan have alleged Cosby gave them capsules or pills -- sometimes billing them as medication -- before assaulting them.

More than 25 women have publicly accused Cosby of raping or assaulting them over the past 40 years. The comedian has never been criminally charged and has vehemently denied wrongdoing.

Several women who have accused Cosby told CNN they felt vindicated by the newly released information.

""It's huge. I've worked so long and hard to tell my story and screamed my story onto deaf ears,"" said Barbara Bowman, who said Cosby assaulted her numerous times beginning in the late 1980s.

Victoria Valentino, who said she was sexually assaulted by Cosby, said other celebrities can see a warning from the revelation.

""I think the message has to be that fame and wealth and power cannot exempt you from justice,"" she said Tuesday. ""You cannot exempt anyone from the law.""

Cosby support falls

Singer Jill Scott was one of the celebrities who had supported Cosby after the allegations started emerging.

She previously tweeted, ""I'm respecting a man who has done more for the image of Brown people that almost anyone EVER. From Fat Albert to the Huxtables.""

But she changed course after learning about Cosby's deposition.

""About Bill Cosby. Sadly his own testimony offers PROOF of terrible deeds, which is ALL I have ever required to believe the accusations,"" Scott tweeted.

The Temple connection

Constand, whose civil lawsuit spawned the deposition, was a staffer for the women's basketball team at Cosby's alma mater, Temple University, when she visited Cosby's Pennsylvania home in 2004.

According to Constand, Cosby gave her medication that made her dizzy. She said she later woke up to find her bra undone and her clothes in disarray.

Cosby eventually settled the legal suit, which claimed that 13 ""Jane Does"" had similar stories of sexual abuse. The suit was settled under confidential terms.

Years later, after 17 women publicly accused the comedian of sexual misconduct, Cosby resigned from Temple's board of trustees -- a post he held for 32 years.

The Vegas incident

The documents include Cosby's recollection of an incident in Las Vegas in the 1970s.

""She meets me backstage. I give her Quaaludes. We then have sex,"" he said.

While the woman's name was redacted in the deposition transcript, Cosby's lawyers say in a motion filed the following month, ""Defendant testified that he offered Quaaludes to Theresa Serignese, and that she knowingly took them.""

Too late to prosecute

Cosby, 77, had fought the release of the documents, arguing it would violate his and others' privacy and be a source of embarrassment.

One of his accusers, Patti Masten, said many more women have messaged her privately with similar accusations.

""We're up to 48 accusers. There are many who have not come forward,"" she said.

But in most of the cases, the statute of limitations has passed, preventing prosecution.

At least 44 people have died statewide ; many people remain unaccounted for .
In a year of record-breaking fires , Cal Fire Chief Ken Pimlott told NPR 's All Things Considered the Camp fire in the north and Woolsey fire in the south may be `` the most destructive and the deadliest '' on record for the state .
In Northern California , the Camp Fire , which ripped through the town of Paradise , 90 miles north of Sacramento , has killed 42 people , authorities said .
Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea indicated that more human remains from that fire could be found . He said that the county will receive two portable morgue units and cadaver dogs .
He said his department had received more than 1,500 calls from friends and relatives trying to locate people in the area . He said investigators had determined that 231 of those people were safe but since an unknown number of the calls were duplicates , he could n't tell how many people remain unaccounted for .
President Trump tweeted Monday night that he had signed a major disaster declaration for California .
As of Monday evening ET , the Camp fire remained 30 percent contained with 117,000 acres burned ( more than 182 square miles ) .
`` We certainly hope that the fatality count does n't increase but we know there is a strong potential for that '' as authorities continue to sift through ash , rubble and debris in search of missing persons , Pimlott said .
Authorities have yet to account for 228 people reported missing .
Slowing winds in the northern part of the state have given exhausted firefighters a sliver of a reprieve , according to Pimlott , who said the flames are `` moving up onto some more rural areas `` and through `` what used to be Paradise . ''
However , he cautioned , `` We still have very , very dry weather and do n't see that changing at all within the next week. ``
The Camp fire has destroyed more than 7,100 buildings , the vast majority of them residences . About 52,000 people have evacuated the area and 1,385 people are in shelters .
Meanwhile , Southern California winds continue to drive the Woolsey Fire that is slashing a path from Thousand Oaks to the wealthy coastal enclave of Malibu .
`` We 've got 60 to 70 mph off shore Santa Ana winds blowing for the next several days and those are just deadly , '' Pimlott told NPR .
Two people have been reported dead in connection with the fire .
As of Monday evening , the Woolsey Fire in Los Angeles and Ventura counties has burned more than 93,000 acres and is only 30 percent contained . The estimated number of structures destroyed rose up to 370 .
Strained resources were stretched even further Monday morning by another wildfire in the hills north of Los Angeles .
The Peak Fire burned off of the 118 Freeway and into the hills near Simi Valley . The flames temporarily forced the closure of the highway and residents in the Box Canyon and Lake Manor areas were ordered to evacuate .

Wildfires continued to tear through Northern and Southern California on Monday, where firefighters were at the mercy of dry air and whipping winds fanning the deadly blazes. At least 44 people have died statewide; many people remain unaccounted for.

In a year of record-breaking fires, Cal Fire Chief Ken Pimlott told NPR's All Things Considered the Camp fire in the north and Woolsey fire in the south may be ""the most destructive and the deadliest"" on record for the state.

In Northern California, the Camp Fire, which ripped through the town of Paradise, 90 miles north of Sacramento, has killed 42 people, authorities said.

Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea indicated that more human remains from that fire could be found. He said that the county will receive two portable morgue units and cadaver dogs.

He said his department had received more than 1,500 calls from friends and relatives trying to locate people in the area. He said investigators had determined that 231 of those people were safe but since an unknown number of the calls were duplicates, he couldn't tell how many people remain unaccounted for.

President Trump tweeted Monday night that he had signed a major disaster declaration for California.

As of Monday evening ET, the Camp fire remained 30 percent contained with 117,000 acres burned (more than 182 square miles).

""We certainly hope that the fatality count doesn't increase but we know there is a strong potential for that"" as authorities continue to sift through ash, rubble and debris in search of missing persons, Pimlott said.

Authorities have yet to account for 228 people reported missing.

Slowing winds in the northern part of the state have given exhausted firefighters a sliver of a reprieve, according to Pimlott, who said the flames are ""moving up onto some more rural areas "" and through ""what used to be Paradise.""

However, he cautioned, ""We still have very, very dry weather and don't see that changing at all within the next week. ""

The Camp fire has destroyed more than 7,100 buildings, the vast majority of them residences. About 52,000 people have evacuated the area and 1,385 people are in shelters.

Meanwhile, Southern California winds continue to drive the Woolsey Fire that is slashing a path from Thousand Oaks to the wealthy coastal enclave of Malibu.

""We've got 60 to 70 mph off shore Santa Ana winds blowing for the next several days and those are just deadly,"" Pimlott told NPR.

Two people have been reported dead in connection with the fire.

As of Monday evening, the Woolsey Fire in Los Angeles and Ventura counties has burned more than 93,000 acres and is only 30 percent contained. The estimated number of structures destroyed rose up to 370.

About 170,000 people are under mandatory evacuation.

Strained resources were stretched even further Monday morning by another wildfire in the hills north of Los Angeles.

The Peak Fire burned off of the 118 Freeway and into the hills near Simi Valley. The flames temporarily forced the closure of the highway and residents in the Box Canyon and Lake Manor areas were ordered to evacuate.

The ""fast moving brush fire"" was stopped at 105 acres within a couple hours by Ventura and Los Angeles county firefighters.

The National Weather service has extended a ""red flag warning"" through 5 p.m. PT on Wednesday, meaning active critical weather conditions of strong gusty winds and dry conditions will present a challenge to firefighters and containment efforts.

Authorities are anticipating additional spot fires and are primed and ready to combat potential fires in the areas south of North Fork Feather River.

Evacuation orders are in effect for Berry Creek, Rush Creek, Mountain House and Bloomer Hill.

In Southern California, those who fled included the Fortier family.

""All three peaks were on fire, with the wind blowing the flame"" says Johnny Fortier, describing the scene. ""I said an 'Our Father,' tried to bless our homes, and realized it's time to go.""

Some mandatory evacuation orders in the region have lifted, including areas in Thousand Oaks, where authorities anticipate sporadic utility outages.

Thousand Oaks Mayor Andrew Fox says it's likely that some of the town's residents who were affected by last week's shootings also were forced to evacuate — and that memorial services for the victims were delayed because of the fire.

Discussing the afternoon after the shooting, Fox told NPR's David Greene, ""We very quickly pivoted into an evacuation center for fire.""

Fox added, ""The logistics to managing a fire of this magnitude, it's like moving an army, so you have to have places for firefighters to sleep, to eat.""

Paramount Ranch — the backdrop for many films and television shows, including Westworld — has also been destroyed.

As NPR reported Saturday, investigators in Malibu are looking into the deaths of two people after their bodies were found ""severely burned"" inside a vehicle.

`` When you fly to Cairo , you do n't cross the sea , '' she said . `` Then one of the cabin crew told us , 'We are hijacked . We 're being hijacked . ' There was a lot of panic and crying on the plane . They did n't tell us anything more . They did n't say what he wants or where we 're heading , nothing . We were just kidnapped . ''
El Dibany 's flight had been hijacked by a man who officials described as `` unstable '' after he held the passengers and crew hostage with a fake explosive belt , forcing the plane to divert to Cyprus -- apparently over issues involving his ex-wife , a Cypriot . He also has a criminal record ,
`` It was very horrifying to be in this situation , '' El Dibany said .
The incident ended relatively peacefully Tuesday when the plane 's crew and passengers left the aircraft and authorities took the hijacker into custody .
`` The hijacker has just been arrested , '' Cyprus government spokesman Nikos Christodoulides said on Twitter , adding a few minutes later , `` All passengers and crew are safe . ''
Cyprus state television showed video of the hijacker , wearing a white shirt , being led away by a phalanx of police . Presidential spokesman Alaa Yousuf identified the Egyptian man as Seif El Din Mustafa .
An early report that the hijacker was armed with explosives was false , said Alexandros Zinon , permanent secretary for the Cypriot Ministry of Foreign Affairs .

The hijacker was `` unstable , '' Homer Mavrommatis , director of the Cyprus Ministry of Foreign Affairs Crisis Management Center , told CNN . Egyptian authorities negotiated with him , but Mavrommatis said his motivation was not clear .
`` He kept on changing his mind and asking for different things , '' Mavrommatis said .
Zinon also said the hijacker was unstable . One of his demands was that the plane be refueled so that he could travel to Istanbul , which was rejected , Zinon said . Authorities did , however , arrange for him to speak to his ex-wife , Mavrommatis said .
Mustafa is now being questioned by Cypriot authorities , who will levy charges against him , Zinon said . Cyprus has yet to receive an extradition request , he said .
This is not Mustafa 's first brush with the law , Egypt 's Interior Ministry said . The 58-year-old has a criminal record that includes `` forgery , impersonation , burglary and drug dealing , '' the ministry said .
Mostafa was sentenced to one year in prison for forgery , and escaped in 2011 , according to the statement . After additional legal procedures , his sentence for forgery resumed on January 5 , 2014 , and he was released almost exactly one year later .

She applauded how the crew `` very professionally '' handled the harrowing experience .
`` They were keeping everyone calm , '' she said . `` They were n't panicking . They were in control . ''
EgyptAir Flight 181 should have been a short one ; it usually takes less than an hour to fly from Alexandria to the Egyptian capital .
But during the flight , Mustafa falsely claimed that he had an explosive belt , forcing the plane to turn away from its destination and toward Cyprus , pilot Omar El Gamal said , according to the Egyptian Civil Aviation Ministry .
`` Pilots will have a special signal they can use to airport traffic control , '' said Tom Ballentyne , chief correspondent for Oriental Aviation . `` It might be a code word or a signal they can use that will alert air traffic control that there is problem . ''
Officials initially did n't know whether the hijacker really had an explosive belt , but they had no choice but to take the threat seriously , Egyptian Civil Aviation Minister Sherif Fathy Ateyya said .

general_news,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/10/03/ebola-patients-family-quarantined-as-officials-search-for-possible-exposures/?intcmp=latestnews,Ebola patient’s family quarantined as officials search for possible exposures,2014-10-03,,"Federal health officials rushed Friday to assure a frightened public that Ebola does not pose a serious threat in the U.S. , even as the first — and thus far only — diagnosis on American soil exposed potential flaws in border screening , treatment and disposal of contaminated items .
As Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan , who showed symptoms of the often-fatal disease shortly after arriving from Liberia , was in serious condition and being treated in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital , relatives in Dallas resisted a quarantine amid reports that cleanup specialists were balking at disinfecting their home .
Still , Dr. Thomas Frieden , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , insists he 's confident Ebola can be contained in the U.S. , unlike in Africa where it has killed more than 3,300 since the current outbreak began late last year .
“ I have no doubt we will control this case of Ebola so that it does not spread widely , ” Frieden said .
So far , Duncan 's diagnosis is the only verified one in the U.S. A man who was isolated in a Hawaii hospital after showing symptoms consistent with Ebola has been cleared , although on Friday , a spokeswoman for Howard University in Washington said the university 's hospital has admiteed a patient who had been in Nigeria and showed possible symptoms .
Frieden 's assurances came amid calls for better screening of U.S.-bound passengers from Ebola-affected nations and word that Duncan 's initial triage was bungled at the hospital .
At a Dallas apartment where Duncan stayed after arriving Sept. 20 , family members were legally quarantined Thursday after refusing to comply with Dallas health officials requests that they stay home . Doctors are taking the temperatures of four family members in the unit where Duncan was staying twice a day to monitor symptoms as part of the health surveillance efforts being led by CDC officials and local Dallas authorities .
Texas health officials told reporters during a press conference Thursday that the family would be quarantined in their apartment unit for the next 20 days until the potential incubation period for Ebola is over .
On Thursday , a Springfield , Mo. , microbiologist and emergency trauma physician who runs a charity in Guatemala , appeared at Atlanta ’ s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport dressed in protective gear to protest what he called mismanagement of the crisis by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
“ If they ’ re not lying , they are grossly incompetent , ” said Dr. Gil Mobley , who cleared airport security wearing a mask , goggles , gloves , boots and a hooded white jumpsuit emblazoned on the back with the words , “ CDC is lying ! ”
In Duncan 's homeland , authorities vowed to prosecute him for allegedly lying on an airport screening form by answering “ no ” to questions about whether he had “ cared for an Ebola patient or touched the body of someone who had died in an area affected by Ebola . '' In truth , Duncan reportedly had helped carry a 19-year-old pregnant woman to a taxi to go to the hospital just five days before he boarded a U.S.-bound flight . The woman later died .
“ There were no signs of any disease when the gentleman boarded the flight , ” said Dr. Tom Kenyon , director of the CDC ’ s Center for Global Health . “ This was not a failure of the screening process at the airport . ”
But the ease at which Duncan passed the screening , coupled with the fact that Ebola victims may not become symptomatic for weeks after exposure , raised questions about how best to keep the disease off American soil . Jessica Vaughn , a researcher affiliated with the nonprofit Center for Immigration Studies in Washington , said officials have the right to ban anyone from entering the U.S. if they pose a potential threat to public health or safety .
“ Other countries are banning travellers from outbreak countries , and we should , too , ” Vaughn told The Washington Post . “ In the middle of a health crisis , the government should be setting up more robust screening protocols . ”
Meanwhile , health officials in Dallas acknowledged that Duncan ’ s clothing and bedding were still in plastic bags and had not been removed , The Dallas Morning News reports . Officials were seemingly unsure how to delegate the removal of contaminated items from the apartment .
Asked why Duncan 's items and clothing were still at the location , the county 's Health and Human Services director responded that it was n't his agency 's responsibility .
The items will soon be `` appropriately disposed of , '' a county judge said .
Health officials widened their search Thursday to 100 individuals possibly exposed to the disease — tracing contacts of the patient and medical staff who initially treated him . Also on Thursday , officials said three more young children potentially had contact with Duncan , bringing the number of kids being monitored to eight .
“ We ’ re going to break that risk down to high-risk , no-risk and low-risk , and that ’ s going to be the basis of our contact tracing , ” said David Daigle , associate director for communications , public health preparedness and response at the CDC .
Daigle expressed concern about infection control at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital , where Duncan is currently in isolation , and said that a team was dispatched to conduct the same kind of contact tracing officials are doing in the local community .
Zachary Thompson , director of Dallas County Health and Human Services , tried to quell fears in the community of the virus spreading and stressed transparency during the investigation .

As Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, who showed symptoms of the often-fatal disease shortly after arriving from Liberia, was in serious condition and being treated in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, relatives in Dallas resisted a quarantine amid reports that cleanup specialists were balking at disinfecting their home.

Still, Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), insists he's confident Ebola can be contained in the U.S., unlike in Africa where it has killed more than 3,300 since the current outbreak began late last year.

“I have no doubt we will control this case of Ebola so that it does not spread widely,” Frieden said.

So far, Duncan's diagnosis is the only verified one in the U.S. A man who was isolated in a Hawaii hospital after showing symptoms consistent with Ebola has been cleared, although on Friday, a spokeswoman for Howard University in Washington said the university's hospital has admiteed a patient who had been in Nigeria and showed possible symptoms.

Frieden's assurances came amid calls for better screening of U.S.-bound passengers from Ebola-affected nations and word that Duncan's initial triage was bungled at the hospital.

At a Dallas apartment where Duncan stayed after arriving Sept. 20, family members were legally quarantined Thursday after refusing to comply with Dallas health officials requests that they stay home. Doctors are taking the temperatures of four family members in the unit where Duncan was staying twice a day to monitor symptoms as part of the health surveillance efforts being led by CDC officials and local Dallas authorities.

Texas health officials told reporters during a press conference Thursday that the family would be quarantined in their apartment unit for the next 20 days until the potential incubation period for Ebola is over.

On Thursday, a Springfield, Mo., microbiologist and emergency trauma physician who runs a charity in Guatemala, appeared at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport dressed in protective gear to protest what he called mismanagement of the crisis by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“If they’re not lying, they are grossly incompetent,” said Dr. Gil Mobley, who cleared airport security wearing a mask, goggles, gloves, boots and a hooded white jumpsuit emblazoned on the back with the words, “CDC is lying!”

In Duncan's homeland, authorities vowed to prosecute him for allegedly lying on an airport screening form by answering “no” to questions about whether he had “cared for an Ebola patient or touched the body of someone who had died in an area affected by Ebola."" In truth, Duncan reportedly had helped carry a 19-year-old pregnant woman to a taxi to go to the hospital just five days before he boarded a U.S.-bound flight. The woman later died.

“There were no signs of any disease when the gentleman boarded the flight,” said Dr. Tom Kenyon, director of the CDC’s Center for Global Health. “This was not a failure of the screening process at the airport.”

But the ease at which Duncan passed the screening, coupled with the fact that Ebola victims may not become symptomatic for weeks after exposure, raised questions about how best to keep the disease off American soil. Jessica Vaughn, a researcher affiliated with the nonprofit Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, said officials have the right to ban anyone from entering the U.S. if they pose a potential threat to public health or safety.

“Other countries are banning travellers from outbreak countries, and we should, too,” Vaughn told The Washington Post. “In the middle of a health crisis, the government should be setting up more robust screening protocols.”

Meanwhile, health officials in Dallas acknowledged that Duncan’s clothing and bedding were still in plastic bags and had not been removed, The Dallas Morning News reports. Officials were seemingly unsure how to delegate the removal of contaminated items from the apartment.

Asked why Duncan's items and clothing were still at the location, the county's Health and Human Services director responded that it wasn't his agency's responsibility.

The items will soon be ""appropriately disposed of,"" a county judge said.

Health officials widened their search Thursday to 100 individuals possibly exposed to the disease — tracing contacts of the patient and medical staff who initially treated him. Also on Thursday, officials said three more young children potentially had contact with Duncan, bringing the number of kids being monitored to eight.

“We’re going to break that risk down to high-risk, no-risk and low-risk, and that’s going to be the basis of our contact tracing,” said David Daigle, associate director for communications, public health preparedness and response at the CDC.

Daigle expressed concern about infection control at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where Duncan is currently in isolation, and said that a team was dispatched to conduct the same kind of contact tracing officials are doing in the local community.

Zachary Thompson, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, tried to quell fears in the community of the virus spreading and stressed transparency during the investigation.

“A lot of the individuals that we come in contact with will not have any symptoms, they will not have any association other than the fact that someone said they were there, or they might have had contact,” Thompson said. “This is local public health surveillance at its best, in what we do day in and day out.”

Police were stationed at the Ivy Apartment complex where the family lives Thursday to keep the peace and assist residents and health officials in the community during the investigation.

“We want to make sure we create a calm and safe environment for [health officials] to do their work — that’s our primary focus.

Congressional leaders announced that an arrival ceremony will be held for Bush on Monday at 5 p.m . ET . The public will then be invited to pay their respects from 7:30 p.m. until 7:00 a.m. Wednesday . The statement said that the Bush family will provide additional details regarding arrangements beyond the ceremony at the Capitol .
When someone lies in state in the Capitol Rotunda , the casket is placed in the center of the room on the catafalque , the wooden platform used for President Lincoln ’ s funeral in 1865 . The casket is draped with an American flag and an honor guard stands vigil around the clock . The Rotunda is usually permitted to file past the casket after formal and family ceremonies .
The last president to lie in state was President Gerald Ford in late 2006-early 2007 . President Ronald Reagan lay in state in June 2004 . However , the last two people to lie in state were not presidents : Sen. Daniel Inouye , D-Hawaii , in 2012 and Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , this year .
Rev . Billy Graham did not lie in state earlier this year . He lay in honor -- one step down from lying in state -- although the ceremony looks very similar .
President Richard Nixon did not lie in state in 1994 , as his family thought visitors to the Capitol might not be respectful .
The White House said Saturday that President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will attend Bush 's funeral at the National Cathedral in Washington D.C. Trump has also designated December 5 as a National Day of Mourning .
Meanwhile , plans for a state funeral were already underway , according to The Washington Post , with events expected in Texas and Washington. ,
“ We , the men and women of the Department of Defense , are honored and proud to support the Bush family and will do so with the utmost respect , ” Maj. Gen. Michael L. Howard of the Joint Force Headquarters National Capital Region said in a statement .
“ This state funeral is a culmination of years of planning and rehearsal to ensure the support the military renders President Bush is nothing less than a first-class tribute , ” he said .","Former President George H.W. Bush will lie in state in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda next week, congressional leaders announced Saturday -- a move that has become customary to honor the passing of former presidents.

Bush, who spent a lifetime in public service and served as the 41st president between 1989 and 1993, died shortly after 10 p.m. Friday, about eight months after the death of his wife, Barbara Bush.

He is survived by five children, including former President George W. Bush and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. A sixth child died in early childhood. The late former president also is survived by 17 grandchildren.

GEORGE H.W. BUSH, 41ST PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, DEAD AT 94

Congressional leaders announced that an arrival ceremony will be held for Bush on Monday at 5 p.m. ET. The public will then be invited to pay their respects from 7:30 p.m. until 7:00 a.m. Wednesday. The statement said that the Bush family will provide additional details regarding arrangements beyond the ceremony at the Capitol.

When someone lies in state in the Capitol Rotunda, the casket is placed in the center of the room on the catafalque, the wooden platform used for President Lincoln’s funeral in 1865. The casket is draped with an American flag and an honor guard stands vigil around the clock. The Rotunda is usually permitted to file past the casket after formal and family ceremonies.



The last president to lie in state was President Gerald Ford in late 2006-early 2007. President Ronald Reagan lay in state in June 2004. However, the last two people to lie in state were not presidents: Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, in 2012 and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., this year.

Rev. Billy Graham did not lie in state earlier this year. He lay in honor -- one step down from lying in state -- although the ceremony looks very similar.

President Richard Nixon did not lie in state in 1994, as his family thought visitors to the Capitol might not be respectful.

The White House said Saturday that President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will attend Bush's funeral at the National Cathedral in Washington D.C. Trump has also designated December 5 as a National Day of Mourning.

Meanwhile, plans for a state funeral were already underway, according to The Washington Post, with events expected in Texas and Washington.,

You 've probably heard of Mary Mallon , better known as `` Typhoid Mary . '' She was an Irish-born cook who carried the bacteria that causes typhoid fever , a form of salmonella that can cause fever , diarrhea and death . But Mallon herself was immune to the disease . When authorities figured out that her work as a cook had caused the city 's typhoid outbreak , she was sent to North Brother Island for a three-year quarantine . She promised never to cook for others again . But she broke her word . ( She was especially fond of making peach ice cream . ) When apprehended in 1915 , she was sent back to the island for the rest of her life — 23 more years .
With World War I raging , the U.S. military became concerned about the number of young men ineligible for the draft because of sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis and gonorrhea . They also noticed an uptick in `` camp girls , '' prostitutes and other women hanging around U.S. training grounds and military recruitment centers . A federal order allowed for the incarceration of prostitutes and camp girls until they were deemed STD-free via mandatory testing . Harvard University medical historian Allan Brandt estimates at least 30,000 women were picked up in raids . `` There 's no evidence that this impacted the rates of transmission , '' he says . `` But there was this notion that these women constituted a serious threat to our success in the war . '' He notes that while the women were being rounded up and held in prison , often long after they 'd tested negative , the Army was issuing condoms to soldiers shipping off to France .
This global pandemic , which killed an estimated 50 million , prompted quarantine and isolation , as well as school cancellations in Europe and a ban on public gatherings in parts of the U.S . These methods merely held the disease at bay temporarily and were `` hugely socially disruptive , '' according to University of Michigan 's Markel . Influenza is one of the most contagious diseases in the world . A few minutes with a patient who is coughing and sneezing can be enough to transmit the disease . For comparison , Markel says , you 'd need to spend eight hours with a tuberculosis patient to be infected .
There was no AIDS quarantine , but that does n't mean some people did n't want one . In a 1985 Los Angeles Times poll , 51 percent of respondents supported quarantining AIDS patients . `` There is this idea of building a wall against infection , '' says Harvard 's Brandt . `` But we know how AIDS is transmitted , through very specific activities . '' No quarantines went into effect , he says , thanks to a loud opposition movement .
Though the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) pandemic of 2003 led to quarantines in many different countries , Canada 's response was the most disproportionate to the risk . According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health , Canada quarantined almost 100 people for every confirmed SARS case in the country . Though Toronto only had 250 probable cases , about 30,000 people were confined in hospitals and their homes . A comparable number were quarantined in Beijing , which had 2,500 cases .
Andrew Speaker , a lawyer from Atlanta , was suspected of having extensively multidrug-resistant tuberculosis , a dangerous version of the infectious and deadly respiratory disease . While awaiting test results , Speaker flew to Europe for his wedding and honeymoon , hitting Paris , Athens , Mykonos island , Rome and Prague . Then he flew to Montreal and was able to cross the border to the U.S. , where he was put under the first involuntary isolation order since 1963 ( that one occurred when a traveler was incorrectly suspected of having smallpox ) . Speaker apologized to those he 'd flown with but insisted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told him he was safe to travel . ( CDC disagrees . ) Good news : He did n't infect anyone .
China took a page from San Francisco 's turn-of-the-century playbook when it faced a single case of the bubonic plague this summer . A man died of the disease after feeding a dead , plague-infected marmot to his dog in the northwestern city of Yumen . Over 150 people who had contact with the man were placed in quarantine ; several districts of the city were sealed off , isolating thousands . Yanzhong Huang , a fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations , said in an interview with The Guardian , `` SARS taught Chinese leaders ... the wrong lesson — that quarantine was the magic bullet in addressing any major infectious disease outbreak . '' After two days , the quarantine was lifted ; no other cases were reported .
In Liberia , the neighborhood of West Point was cordoned off for 10 days in August after residents raided a center for suspected patients . Patients fled into the densely populated slum , prompting the government 's decision to isolate the neighborhood for 21 days , the incubation period for the disease . Protests ended the quarantine after 10 days . In neighboring Sierra Leone , a three-day quarantine in September asked everyone to stay at home while health workers went door to door , looking for the sick and delivering bars of soap . Doctors Without Borders , the medical organization that 's fighting Ebola , said , `` It has been our experience that lockdowns and quarantines do not help control Ebola , as they end up driving people underground and jeopardizing the trust between people and health providers .

When American nurse Kaci Hickox came home after treating Ebola patients in Liberia, she was quarantined in a tent at Newark Liberty International Airport for three days — even though she showed no signs of illness.

The idea of putting a possibly sick person in quarantine goes back to the ancient texts. The book of Leviticus tells how to quarantine lepers. Hippocrates covered the issue in a three-volume set on epidemics, though he came from a time in ancient Greece when disease was thought to spread from ""miasmas,"" or foul-smelling gas that came out of the ground. With proposed quarantines for Americans exposed to Ebola in the news, we offer a look at quarantine use — and abuse — over the ages.



Bubonic plague in Venice (1370)

The so-called Black Death killed 20 million Europeans in the 14th century. So Venice, a major trade port, grew nervous. If a ship was suspected of harboring plague, it had to wait 40 days before any passengers or goods could come ashore. Venice built a hospital/quarantine center on an island off its coast, where sailors from plague-infested ships were sent either to get better, or, more likely, to die. This 40-day waiting period became known as quarantinario, from the Italian word for 40. As opinions about the disease changed, the isolation period shrank to trentinario — 30 days — but the original name stuck.

Yellow fever in Philadelphia (1793)

Almost 5,000 people died over the course of two years, about a tenth of the city's population. Thousands fled for the countryside, and at the height of the epidemic, when nearly 100 people were dying every day, the city government collapsed. Philadelphia was the capital of the country, but the federal government evacuated rather than face the scourge. The best known cure at the time was to ""bleed"" patients of infected blood and give them wine — and a popular theory on stopping the disease was to quarantine sailors at the Lazaretto, a hospital outside the city. But the disease is spread through mosquitoes, so quarantine was not as effective as the cold snap that eventually killed the infected insects. The Lazaretto, named after Lazarus, the Biblical leper treated and brought back to life by Jesus, remains the oldest surviving quarantine hospital in the United States.

Typhus in New York (1892)

In 1892, a boat carrying many Russian Jewish immigrants arrived at Ellis Island. Passengers in steerage class had developed such bad cases of body lice that the harbor inspector declared he had ""never seen a more bedraggled group,"" according to University of Michigan medical historian Howard Markel. Lice led to typhus, but by the time that disease was discovered, the passengers had spread out to boarding houses and family homes across New York's Lower East Side. At least 70 were rounded up and quarantined in tents on North Brother Island in the East River. An outbreak of cholera followed in New York, from a ship bringing more Russian Jewish immigrants. According to Markel, the front page of The New York Times ran a piece saying, ""We don't need this kind of riff-raff on our shores,"" referring to Russian Jews. It wasn't an op-ed, he notes.

Bubonic plague in San Francisco (1900)

City authorities strung rope and barbed wire around a 12-square-block section of Chinatown (after allowing all Caucasian residents to leave). The cause: fear of bubonic plague, after a Chinese immigrant was found dead in a hotel basement. The quarantine was lifted after a few days, but not before countless Chinese laborers had lost their jobs. This ""bubonic bluff,"" as it became known in the press, prompted ugly discussion — never put into action — about mass deportation of Chinese immigrants.

Typhoid in New York City (1907)

Health A History Of Quarantine, From The Black Death To Typhoid Mary A History Of Quarantine, From The Black Death To Typhoid Mary Listen · 4:08 4:08

You've probably heard of Mary Mallon, better known as ""Typhoid Mary."" She was an Irish-born cook who carried the bacteria that causes typhoid fever, a form of salmonella that can cause fever, diarrhea and death. But Mallon herself was immune to the disease. When authorities figured out that her work as a cook had caused the city's typhoid outbreak, she was sent to North Brother Island for a three-year quarantine. She promised never to cook for others again. But she broke her word. (She was especially fond of making peach ice cream.) When apprehended in 1915, she was sent back to the island for the rest of her life — 23 more years.

Venereal disease in the United States (1917)

With World War I raging, the U.S. military became concerned about the number of young men ineligible for the draft because of sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis and gonorrhea. They also noticed an uptick in ""camp girls,"" prostitutes and other women hanging around U.S. training grounds and military recruitment centers. A federal order allowed for the incarceration of prostitutes and camp girls until they were deemed STD-free via mandatory testing. Harvard University medical historian Allan Brandt estimates at least 30,000 women were picked up in raids. ""There's no evidence that this impacted the rates of transmission,"" he says. ""But there was this notion that these women constituted a serious threat to our success in the war."" He notes that while the women were being rounded up and held in prison, often long after they'd tested negative, the Army was issuing condoms to soldiers shipping off to France.

Flu epidemic in Europe and U.S. (1917-1919)

This global pandemic, which killed an estimated 50 million, prompted quarantine and isolation, as well as school cancellations in Europe and a ban on public gatherings in parts of the U.S. These methods merely held the disease at bay temporarily and were ""hugely socially disruptive,"" according to University of Michigan's Markel. Influenza is one of the most contagious diseases in the world. A few minutes with a patient who is coughing and sneezing can be enough to transmit the disease. For comparison, Markel says, you'd need to spend eight hours with a tuberculosis patient to be infected.

AIDS in the United States (1980s)

There was no AIDS quarantine, but that doesn't mean some people didn't want one. In a 1985 Los Angeles Times poll, 51 percent of respondents supported quarantining AIDS patients. ""There is this idea of building a wall against infection,"" says Harvard's Brandt. ""But we know how AIDS is transmitted, through very specific activities."" No quarantines went into effect, he says, thanks to a loud opposition movement.

SARS in Canada (2003)

Though the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic of 2003 led to quarantines in many different countries, Canada's response was the most disproportionate to the risk. According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Canada quarantined almost 100 people for every confirmed SARS case in the country. Though Toronto only had 250 probable cases, about 30,000 people were confined in hospitals and their homes. A comparable number were quarantined in Beijing, which had 2,500 cases.

Tuberculosis in Atlanta (2007)

Andrew Speaker, a lawyer from Atlanta, was suspected of having extensively multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, a dangerous version of the infectious and deadly respiratory disease. While awaiting test results, Speaker flew to Europe for his wedding and honeymoon, hitting Paris, Athens, Mykonos island, Rome and Prague. Then he flew to Montreal and was able to cross the border to the U.S., where he was put under the first involuntary isolation order since 1963 (that one occurred when a traveler was incorrectly suspected of having smallpox). Speaker apologized to those he'd flown with but insisted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told him he was safe to travel. (CDC disagrees.) Good news: He didn't infect anyone.

Bubonic plague in China (2014)

China took a page from San Francisco's turn-of-the-century playbook when it faced a single case of the bubonic plague this summer. A man died of the disease after feeding a dead, plague-infected marmot to his dog in the northwestern city of Yumen. Over 150 people who had contact with the man were placed in quarantine; several districts of the city were sealed off, isolating thousands. Yanzhong Huang, a fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview with The Guardian, ""SARS taught Chinese leaders ... the wrong lesson — that quarantine was the magic bullet in addressing any major infectious disease outbreak."" After two days, the quarantine was lifted; no other cases were reported.

Ebola in Liberia and Sierra Leone (2014)

In Liberia, the neighborhood of West Point was cordoned off for 10 days in August after residents raided a center for suspected patients. Patients fled into the densely populated slum, prompting the government's decision to isolate the neighborhood for 21 days, the incubation period for the disease. Protests ended the quarantine after 10 days. In neighboring Sierra Leone, a three-day quarantine in September asked everyone to stay at home while health workers went door to door, looking for the sick and delivering bars of soap. Doctors Without Borders, the medical organization that's fighting Ebola, said, ""It has been our experience that lockdowns and quarantines do not help control Ebola, as they end up driving people underground and jeopardizing the trust between people and health providers.""",www.npr.org,center,kppGBbpvqGHByKA2

The number of people missing in northern California's devastating wildfire has leapt to more than 600, and seven more bodies have been found, according to local authorities.

The missing persons' list has doubled since earlier on Thursday.

The Camp Fire, the state's deadliest and most destructive blaze, has killed at least 63 people. Nearly 12,000 buildings have been destroyed.

Three more people have also died in the Woolsey Fire, further south.

President Donald Trump will travel to California on Saturday to survey the damage and meet those affected.

About 9,400 firefighters are currently battling wildfires across the state.

The Camp Fire - which broke out eight days ago - swept through a swathe of the north at high speed, leaving residents little time to escape.

Why such a big jump in the missing?

The official list more than doubled from 300 to 631 on Thursday.

At a news briefing, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said this was because investigators had thoroughly cross-checked their information, including emergency calls made since the Camp Fire started on 8 November.

""I want you to understand that the chaos we were dealing with was extraordinary,"" Mr Honea said.

He stressed that the number of the missing would most likely fluctuate.

""If you look at that list and see your name, or the name of a friend or loved one, please call to let us know,"" Mr Honea appealed to the public.

What's the latest on the firefighting operation?

The California Fire Department says it has now contained about 40% of the Camp Fire blaze.

""We continue to engage in the fire fight. We continue to keep our eye on the ball,"" chief fire department official Ken Pimlott said.

Officials say they do not expect to fully contain the blaze - which has razed 145,000 acres (56,600 ha) - until the end of the month.

They are also battling several other fires. The Woolsey Fire in Ventura County near Los Angeles covers nearly 100,000 acres and is 62% contained.

The smaller Hill Fire, also in Ventura County, covers 4,530 acres and is 99% contained. The Morgan Fire in Contra Costa County, near San Francisco, covers 20 acres and is 60% contained.

The worst-hit area is the town of Paradise, with officials saying it will need a ""total rebuild"" job that will take several years.

Military troops are assisting forensics teams and cadaver dogs as they continue to search for human remains.

Officials have warned the search operation could take weeks.

Why are the fires burning?

Officials have not yet confirmed what started any of the blazes, as investigations are continuing.

Several people have already filed a lawsuit against a local power company, alleging that the Camp Fire started when a high-voltage transmission line failed.

Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn - but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round.

Low humidity, warm winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment.

President Obama announced today the most significant change in U.S. policy toward Cuba in more than 50 years , paving the way for the normalization of relations and the opening of a U.S. Embassy in Havana .
Obama said `` we will end an outdated approach that for decades has failed to advance our interests and instead we will begin to normalize relations between our two countries . ''
He added : `` These 50 years have shown , isolation has not worked . It 's time for a new approach . ''
Obama said as these changes unfold , he will talk to Congress about lifting the embargo on Cuba . The U.S. severed diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1961 , shortly after Fidel Castro and his communist rebels ousted dictator Fulgencio Batista .
In a nationally televised address that coincided with Obama 's remarks , Cuban President Raul Castro called on the United States to `` remove any obstacles that hinder ties between our two countries . ''
`` This decision by President Obama deserves the respect and recognition of our people , '' Castro said . However , he added , this `` does not mean that the most important issue has been resolved . The embargo on our country ... has to end . ''
Despite `` profound differences , '' Castro said , Cuba is willing to talk to the United States about thorny subjects including human rights and democracy .
Today 's developments come hours after news emerged that Alan Gross , the American contractor who spent five years in a Cuban jail , had been freed on humanitarian grounds .
`` It 's good to be home , '' Gross said in Washington , shortly after his return to the U.S .
U.S. officials also said three Cuban spies , part of the so-called Cuban Five spy ring , will be released in exchange for an unnamed U.S. intelligence asset jailed in Cuba for nearly 20 years . That individual , U.S. officials said , identified the Cuban Five , Cuban intelligence agents in the U.S. who were caught in the 1990s . He also identified former Defense Intelligence Agency analyst Ana Belen Montes and former State Department official Kendall Myers and his wife , Gwendolyn , as Cuban agents . Castro , in his news conference , said the man was a Cuban national .
U.S. officials said the two countries will also normalize banking and trade relations . They said the U.S. expects to have differences with Cuba on issues such as democracy and human rights , but the move toward normalization is a `` better way of advancing our interests and our values . ''
Obama , the officials said , approved high-level talks with Cuba over the spring , and meetings were held in Canada . The Vatican also played an important role , the officials said , with Pope Francis appealing for Gross ' release in letters to both leaders .
The officials said the U.S. will also move to remove Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism . Cuba has been on the list since 1982 . Obama has asked Secretary of State John Kerry to give him within six months a review of Cuba 's support for terrorism .
Officials said that , among other steps , the U.S. will ease travel and remittance policies ; expand commercial sales and exports ; and ease imports , including of tobacco products and alcohol . The U.S. will expand Cubans ' access to the Internet and telecommunications .
The U.S. and Cuba will both participate in the Summit of the Americas in Panama next year , but the U.S. said `` Cuban civil society must be allowed to participate . ''
Separately , Cuba also agreed to release 53 detainees whom the U.S. regards as political prisoners .
As we previously reported , Gross , a subcontractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development , had been working on a program to improve Internet access for Jewish Cubans . During several trips to Cuba he had covertly distributed laptops . A Cuban court found him guilty of crimes against the state in 2011 , and sentenced him to 15 years in prison .
In December 2013 , Peter Wallsten of The Washington Post told NPR Gross was being detained in a 10-by-12-foot room with two other prisoners .
This month , Gross ' wife , Judy , said her husband had lost more than 100 pounds during his detention . `` He can barely walk due to chronic pain , and he has lost five teeth and much of the sight in his right eye , '' she said in a statement .
In an interview in June with NPR , Judy Gross said her husband was `` despondent and very hopeless . '' She warned that he had said he would `` take drastic measures if he 's not out very shortly . ''
Gross had staged a nine-day hunger strike earlier this year .
Sen. Marco Rubio , R-Fla. , welcomed Gross ' release , but told Fox News , `` I 'm not in favor of the process by which his release was acquired , because I think it does set a very dangerous precedent . ''
He noted that Obama 's expected announcement will do `` nothing '' to further democracy in Cuba .
`` It 's part of a long record of coddling dictators , and tyrants , that this administration has established , '' he said .
The steps announced today are likely to be closely watched in Miami , which is home to a large Cuban-American community . As NPR 's Eyder Peralta notes : `` The assumption is that Cuban-Americans support punitive policies against Havana , but over the years , polls show that attitude has changed significantly , even among older emigres . ''
Christopher Sabatini , a professor at Columbia University 's School of International and Public Affairs , called the move `` profound . ''
Michael Desch , a professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame , called it a `` long overdue step . ''
`` We have resisted normalizing relations with Cuba to this point largely because of the domestic Cuban-American lobby which has held that normalization would bolster the Castro regime , '' he said . `` That logic is flawed : The more Cubans are exposed to American culture , politics , and our economy , the weaker the hold of the Castroites on power .

U.S. officials also said three Cuban spies, part of the so-called Cuban Five spy ring, will be released in exchange for an unnamed U.S. intelligence asset jailed in Cuba for nearly 20 years. That individual, U.S. officials said, identified the Cuban Five, Cuban intelligence agents in the U.S. who were caught in the 1990s. He also identified former Defense Intelligence Agency analyst Ana Belen Montes and former State Department official Kendall Myers and his wife, Gwendolyn, as Cuban agents. Castro, in his news conference, said the man was a Cuban national.

U.S. officials said the two countries will also normalize banking and trade relations. They said the U.S. expects to have differences with Cuba on issues such as democracy and human rights, but the move toward normalization is a ""better way of advancing our interests and our values.""

Obama, the officials said, approved high-level talks with Cuba over the spring, and meetings were held in Canada. The Vatican also played an important role, the officials said, with Pope Francis appealing for Gross' release in letters to both leaders.

The officials said the U.S. will also move to remove Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. Cuba has been on the list since 1982. Obama has asked Secretary of State John Kerry to give him within six months a review of Cuba's support for terrorism.

Officials said that, among other steps, the U.S. will ease travel and remittance policies; expand commercial sales and exports; and ease imports, including of tobacco products and alcohol. The U.S. will expand Cubans' access to the Internet and telecommunications.

The U.S. and Cuba will both participate in the Summit of the Americas in Panama next year, but the U.S. said ""Cuban civil society must be allowed to participate.""

Separately, Cuba also agreed to release 53 detainees whom the U.S. regards as political prisoners.

As we previously reported, Gross, a subcontractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development, had been working on a program to improve Internet access for Jewish Cubans. During several trips to Cuba he had covertly distributed laptops. A Cuban court found him guilty of crimes against the state in 2011, and sentenced him to 15 years in prison.

In December 2013, Peter Wallsten of The Washington Post told NPR Gross was being detained in a 10-by-12-foot room with two other prisoners.

This month, Gross' wife, Judy, said her husband had lost more than 100 pounds during his detention. ""He can barely walk due to chronic pain, and he has lost five teeth and much of the sight in his right eye,"" she said in a statement.

In an interview in June with NPR, Judy Gross said her husband was ""despondent and very hopeless."" She warned that he had said he would ""take drastic measures if he's not out very shortly.""

Gross had staged a nine-day hunger strike earlier this year.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., welcomed Gross' release, but told Fox News, ""I'm not in favor of the process by which his release was acquired, because I think it does set a very dangerous precedent.""

He noted that Obama's expected announcement will do ""nothing"" to further democracy in Cuba.

""It's part of a long record of coddling dictators, and tyrants, that this administration has established,"" he said.

The steps announced today are likely to be closely watched in Miami, which is home to a large Cuban-American community. As NPR's Eyder Peralta notes: ""The assumption is that Cuban-Americans support punitive policies against Havana, but over the years, polls show that attitude has changed significantly, even among older emigres.""

Most Cuban-Americans oppose the embargo.

Foreign policy experts welcomed the U.S. move.

Christopher Sabatini, a professor at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, called the move ""profound.""

Michael Desch, a professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame, called it a ""long overdue step.""

""We have resisted normalizing relations with Cuba to this point largely because of the domestic Cuban-American lobby which has held that normalization would bolster the Castro regime,"" he said. ""That logic is flawed: The more Cubans are exposed to American culture, politics, and our economy, the weaker the hold of the Castroites on power.""",www.npr.org,center,QtNipjte8A6iyotd

“ The great privilege and honor of my career has been to lead OGE ’ s staff and the community of ethics officials in the federal executive branch , ” Mr. Shaub wrote in a letter to the president that the director posted to his Twitter account . “ They are committed to protecting the principle that public service is a public trust , requiring employees to place loyalty to the Constitution , the laws , and ethical principles above private gain . ”
Mr. Shaub said he would resign on July 19 , six months before his term was set to conclude . He plans to join the Campaign Legal Center as senior director of ethics , according to the group , which advocates for transparency and ethics in government .
In the months since President Donald Trump took office , the GOP president has repeatedly clashed with Mr. Shaub over issues including the steps Mr. Trump took to distance himself from his business empire and his administration ’ s disclosure of ethics waivers for former lobbyists serving in the White House .
Mr. Shaub said in an email to The Wall Street Journal that he hadn ’ t been pushed out by the White House .
He said he was leaving before the end of his term because he felt the Campaign Legal Center would offer him the best platform and he wanted to take the job before it was filled . The new role , he said , will allow greater freedom to push for changes to federal ethics rules .
The White House said Thursday that the president accepted Mr. Shaub ’ s resignation and “ appreciates his service. ” Mr. Trump plans to nominate a successor “ in short order , ” the White House said .
The Office of Government Ethics aims to prevent conflicts of interest for government employees but has limited means to enforce federal ethics rules , aside from publicly raising questions about possible conflicts .
Soon after Mr. Trump ’ s election victory , Mr. Shaub made it clear that he wouldn ’ t hesitate to criticize Mr. Trump over ethics issues . In November , the ethics office sent a series of tweets at Mr. Trump urging him to divest fully from his business interests .
In January , about 10 days before the inauguration , Mr. Shaub denounced as insufficient Mr. Trump ’ s proposal to guard against conflicts of interest , saying it did “ not comport with the tradition of our presidents over the past 40 years . ”
Mr. Trump placed his assets into a trust and turned over management of his business to his adult sons , but retained ownership of the business . He can withdraw funds from the trust if its trustees—his eldest son and a longtime company lawyer—deem it appropriate .
In an interview with CBS News on Thursday , Mr. Shaub again criticized the president for not taking adequate steps to distance himself from his business . Asked whether Mr. Trump and his family were using the presidency to enrich themselves , he said , “ I can ’ t know what their intention is . I know that the effect is that there ’ s an appearance that the businesses are profiting from his occupying the presidency . ”
In March , Mr. Shaub criticized the White House for not taking more aggressive action against senior adviser Kellyanne Conway after she urged viewers in a television interview to “ go buy Ivanka ’ s stuff , ” referring to the brand owned by Mr. Trump ’ s elder daughter . The White House said it had counseled Ms. Conway on the issue and determined she was unlikely to again break the federal law barring government officials from endorsing brands .
In May , Mr. Shaub issued an unusually forceful response to an effort by the White House to block the ethics office ’ s attempt to obtain its ethics waivers , which allow administration officials to work on issues they handled in their previous private-sector jobs . Mr. Shaub declined the request that his office suspend its effort to obtain the waivers and included hundreds of pages of material backing up his right to request them . The White House ultimately provided the waivers to the agency , which publicly disclosed them .
Shortly after Mr. Shaub posted his resignation letter on Twitter , the Office of Government Ethics staff was gathered for an “ all-hands meeting , ” according to an agency official .
The departure of Mr. Shaub , who was appointed by former President Barack Obama , a Democrat , in 2013 , means that Mr. Trump has the power to appoint a successor . A director must be confirmed by the Senate and is appointed to serve a five-year term . Mr. Shaub ’ s term was set to expire in January .
Don Fox , who served as the ethics office ’ s general counsel from 2008 to 2013 and as acting director from 2011 until 2013 , said Mr. Shaub was “ far more outspoken ” than his predecessors about “ what he perceived as the ethical shortcomings of this administration . ”
“ Walt spoke out because he felt he had to , ” said Mr. Fox , adding he couldn ’ t think of another administration “ that was ever this disdainful of government ethics . ”
A White House spokeswoman didn ’ t respond to a request for comment on Mr. Fox ’ s criticism .

The Mid-Atlantic region is notorious for struggling to cope with winter weather, and a light dusting on Wednesday night served as an ominous prelude to the massive blizzard.

Less than an inch of snow was enough to immediately turn roadways treacherous in the District, Maryland and northern Virginia, causing hundreds of accidents and leaving drivers gridlocked for hours. President Obama wasn't spared, as his motorcade slowly weaved and skidded along icy streets to the White House.

The U.S. Capitol Police said sledding on Capitol Hill — which only recently became legal after an act of Congress — would be welcome for the first time in decades, as long as conditions are safe.

Even the start of the snowstorm couldn't keep some tourists from visiting the White House.

On Friday afternoon, several groups and couples were walking in the park in front of the mansion, and the fountain in the home's yard was still spraying water.

Newlyweds Stefan Tomic and Cherokee Tomic, both 22, were visiting from New York and had just arrived in the city Friday by bus. They said they didn't want to change their plans because of the weather and that their first stop was the White House.

""We're just going to have fun,"" Cherokee Tomic said.

As far south as Atlanta, people were urged to go home and stay there to avoid a repeat of the city's ""icepocalypse,"" when a fairly light winter storm in 2014 caused commuter chaos for days.

NWS Director Louis Uccellini warned at a news conference that the snowfall could easily cause more than $1 billion in damage and paralyze the Eastern third of the nation.

""It does have the potential to be an extremely dangerous storm that can affect more than 50 million people,"" Uccellini said at the service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.

''
`` This storm is a monster , '' Gov . Rick Scott said at an evening news conference . `` Matthew is likely to produce devastating impacts along portions of the east coast tonight , '' he added .
As it moved north in the evening , Matthew stayed about 100 miles or more off South Florida , sparing the 4.4 million people in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas from its most punishing effects .
`` We were lucky this time , '' Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said .
By Thursday night , more than 60,000 homes and businesses were without power . Streets in Vero Beach were partially covered with water , and hotel guests in Orlando were told to stay inside , though a few sneaked out to smoke or watch the rain .
The hurricane was instead expected to blow ashore -- or come dangerously close to doing so -- early Friday north of West Palm Beach , which has about 1.1 million people , and then slowly push north for the next 12 hours along the Interstate 95 corridor , through Cape Canaveral and Jacksonville , according to the National Hurricane Center .
Forecasters said it would then probably hug the coast of Georgia and South Carolina over the weekend before veering out to sea -- perhaps even looping back toward Florida in the middle of next week as a tropical storm .
As of 10 p.m. EDT , Matthew was located 65 miles east-southeast of West Palm Beach , moving northwest at about 13 mph .
As evening fell , the winds picked up along Vero Beach , midway between West Palm Beach and Cape Canaveral , stripping away palm fronds , ripping awnings and blowing sand that stung the face . Waves crashed on the beach , and rain came in short bursts . About 30,000 homes and businesses were in the dark .
Officials from Florida to South Carolina urged an estimated 2 million people to evacuate . Scott said so far he has activated 3,500 Florida National Guard members to assist in any rescues and recovery missions after the storm passed .
President Obama declared a state of emergency for Florida and South Carolina on Thursday , clearing the way for federal aid in addition to state and local emergency response teams . The Pentagon reported the governors of Florida , Georgia and South Carolina had mobilized 4,500 National Guardsmen ahead of the hurricane .
Forecasters said Matthew could dump up to 15 inches of rain in some spots and cause a storm surge of 9 feet or more .
They said the major threat to the Southeast would not be the winds -- which newer buildings can withstand -- but the massive surge of seawater that could wash over coastal communities along a 500-mile stretch from South Florida to the Charleston , S.C. , area .
The Fort Lauderdale airport shut down on Thursday morning , and further north the Orlando airport also closed . By early-evening , flight-tracking service FlightAware.com reported that nearly 1,500 flights within the U.S. had been scrapped , with the largest numbers at Fort Lauderdale and Miami . American Airlines , which has a major hub in Miami , was the hardest-hit carrier , followed by Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways .
Amtrak suspended train service between Miami and New York , and cruise lines rerouted ships to avoid the storm , which in some cases will mean more days at sea .
Workers transferred patients from two Florida waterfront hospitals and a nursing home near Daytona Beach to safer locations . Officials at Walt Disney World , Universal Studios and SeaWorld said the parks would shut down Thursday afternoon until the storm passes .
Thousands of people hunkered down in schools converted to shelters , and inland hotels in places such as Charlotte , N.C. , reported brisk business .
At the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral , NASA no longer has to worry about rolling space shuttles back from the launch pad to the hangar because of hurricanes , since the shuttle fleet is now retired . But the spaceflight company SpaceX was concerned about the storm 's effect on its leased seaside pad .
`` When a hurricane is forecast to take a track roughly parallel to a coastline , as Matthew is forecast to do from Florida through South Carolina , it becomes very difficult to specify impacts at any one location , '' National Hurricane Center forecaster Lixion Avila said .
The number of people killed in Haiti rose to at least 283 , local officials told Reuters on Thursday , saying the storm killed at least four people elsewhere in the Caribbean .
Georgia Gov . Nathan Deal ordered an evacuation of the state 's entire coast , covering more than a half-million people . It was the first hurricane evacuation along the Georgia coast since 1999 , when the state narrowly escaped Floyd .
The last Category 3 storm or higher to hit the U.S. was Wilma in October 2005 . It sliced across Florida with 120 mph winds , killing five people and causing an estimated $ 21 billion in damage .
As people hurried to higher ground , authorities in South Carolina said a motorist died on Wednesday after being shot by deputies in a gun battle that erupted when he sped away from a checkpoint along an evacuation route .
South Carolina Gov . Nikki Haley reversed Interstate 26 so that all lanes of traffic were headed west and out of Charleston . It was the first time the lanes had been reversed . Plans to reverse the lanes were put in place after hours-long traffic jams during Hurricane Floyd in 1999 .
Haley said Thursday night she 's `` begging '' people to understand the seriousness of Matthew and evacuate the South Carolina coast .
Haley said so far 280,000 people had evacuated as of 3 p.m. Thursday , but that means hundreds of thousands more need to leave .
The governor told reporters that forecasts are getting worse , but `` we ca n't take you by the hand and bring you to the Upstate . ''
Medical facilities that have had to evacuate their patients include Beaufort Memorial Hospital . Haley said Thursday night that should be an indication of the seriousness .
Authorities said the storm surge in some areas along the southern coast of South Carolina will exceed those when Hurricane Hugo hit the state in 1989 . Haley said to `` imagine floor-to-ceiling '' storm surges , while eastern parts of the state could see 8 to 14 inches of rain .
In Florida , Scott also lifted tolls on major roads . The Florida Turnpike , Alligator Alley and part of the Central Florida Expressway Authority and the Miami-Dade Expressway Authority had toll services suspended , according to Fox 35 Orlando .
In Melbourne Beach , near the Kennedy Space Center , Carlos and April Medina moved their paddle board and kayak inside the garage and took pictures off the walls of their home about 500 feet from the coast . They moved the pool furniture inside , turned off the water , disconnected all electrical appliances and emptied their refrigerator .
They then hopped in a truck filled with legal documents , jewelry and a decorative carved shell that had once belonged to April Medina 's great-grandfather and headed west to Orlando , where they planned to ride out the storm with their daughter 's family .
`` The way we see it , if it maintains its current path , we get tropical storm-strength winds . If it makes a little shift to the left , it could be a Category 2 or 3 and I do n't want to be anywhere near it , '' Carlos Medina said . `` We are just being a little safe , a little bit more cautious . ''
About 20 miles away in the town of Cape Canaveral , John Long said Hurricane Matthew is just hype as his neighbors in his RV park packed up and evacuated inland . Even though his 32-foot RV is just feet from the Banana River and a half mile from the beach , he had no plans to leave .
Long , who owns a bike shop and has lived along the Space Coast for 30 years , said he has a generator and enough food and water for himself and his cats to last a week . `` There 's always tremendous buildup and then it 's no stronger than an afternoon thunderstorm , '' he said . `` I 'm not anticipating that much damage . ''
At Folly Beach , S.C. , southwest of Charleston , Gaby Trompeter loaded her car at her beachfront home preparing to evacuate to Augusta , Georgia .
Trompeter , a 50-year-old goldsmith who designs and makes jewelry , remembers Hurricane Hugo when she stayed in Savannah , Georgia , in 1989 .
A year ago when what has been described as a 1,000-year flood inundated South Carolina there was so much water on the road near her house she could n't get out for three days .
`` If it brings a lot of rain , more than the storm last year , why would I want to stay ? '' she said .
On the Georgia coast , 92-year-old Lou Arcangeli saw two of his adult children come to his home on Tybee Island to help prepare and evacuate if necessary .
`` It 's serious , '' said Arcangeli , who has lived in the Savannah area since 1979 , when Hurricane David became the last hurricane to make landfall on Georgia 's 100-mile coast . `` I 'm going to keep an eye on it and not wait until the last minute . As far as I 'm concerned , what 's going to happen is going to happen . ''
`` We have a house that sits right here on the water and we kind of said goodbye to it thinking that , you know , the house ... might not be here when we get back , '' said Jennifer Banker , a resident of Georgia 's dangerously exposed St. Simons Island . `` You know , we pray a lot and trust God to provide . ''
Some coastal residents in Georgia and beyond decided to take their chances and stay .
Darcy O'Connor , a restaurant owner who lives in a rowhouse in Savannah , Ga. , a historic city of many beautifully maintained homes from the 18th and 19th century , said she and her most of her neighbors were sticking around .
O'Connor noted that her home , built in 1883 , has weathered hurricanes before : `` Half the windows , if you look , still have the original glass . So that tells you something . ''
Farmers in Matthew 's path scrambled to protect their crops . In South Carolina , Jeremy Cannon was harvesting his soybeans a week early after waiting too long before last year 's record rainstorm . He watched his soybeans and cotton crops slowly drown as 20 inches of rain fell , costing him $ 800,000 .
`` I do n't want to lose a single soybean this year if I do n't have to , '' Cannon said . `` The Lord says pray without ceasing . And that 's what I 've been doing — in the fields , near the barn — just praying all the time . I do n't want to find out what I 'll have to do if I get wiped out for another year . ''","Hurricane Matthew closed in on Florida Thursday evening as a powerful Category 4 storm as the governor urged people up and down the state's 580-mile Atlantic coastline to brace for ""devastating impacts.""

Last year’s House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Report described Edward Snowden as a “traitor” who is a “serial exaggerator and fabricator” with a “pattern of intentional lying.” Incoming President Trump on the subject of Snowden said “there is still a thing called execution,” a sentiment echoed Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo, presumptively the next director of the CIA chief.

But groups including the ACLU, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and United Nations Special Rapporteur David Kaye have called for Snowden’s pardon. Obama should do so to send a clear message that the values of truth and integrity are indispensable to protecting the future of this country.

Whistleblowers—employees who discover and disclose evidence of serious misconduct—have been essential to holding government and corporate institutions accountable. Daniel Ellsberg’s disclosures helped end the Vietnam War. Enron whistleblower Sherron Watkins’s fraud disclosures drove sweeping financial reform. And Snowden’s 2013 disclosures about the NSA’s dragnet collection of U.S. citizens’ electronic communications drove legislative reforms and heightened privacy protections for consumers to protect against warrantless surveillance.

The willingness of employees to speak up about illegality and serious threats to public health, safety and the environment has saved lives, changed laws, and averted disasters. Bipartisan passage of numerous federal whistleblower protection laws demonstrates recognition of the powerful enforcement value of employees who witness misconduct firsthand. Those laws have been necessary because, while we know ethical employees are critical to promoting compliance, we also know that whistleblowers, rather than being greeted with gratitude, are instead predictably met with reprisal by those whose wrongdoing they expose.

Whistleblowers suffer attacks on their character, motives and qualifications; demotions, poor performance appraisals and firings; and threats of investigation or prosecution, along with denials of the alleged misconduct. These classic tactics are used to deflect attention from the message to the messenger, and to chill other employees who might be similarly inclined to speak up.

The majority of whistleblowers are culturally vilified rather than valued. All of the synonyms for “whistleblower” in Merriam-Webster are negative—fink, rat, snitch, tattletale. No one aspires to be a whistleblower, and most employees, either out of fear of reprisal or belief that reporting problems will be futile—both legitimate concerns—stay silent.

Something that unifies our country in this divisive time is our collective awareness of corruption at the highest levels of our government and corporate institutions. In the new “post-truth” world, the devaluation of truth, combined with employees’ reluctance to report evidence of wrongdoing, is perilous.

Granting a pardon to Snowden would catalyze the needed paradigm shift that whistleblowers must be valued rather than vilified; that whistleblowers play an essential role in promoting accountability and trust in our institutions; and that truth can, and must, matter in a functional democracy.

To be sure, pardoning Snowden would invite a battery of criticisms, including that it would encourage future disclosures of classified information that would potentially compromise national security interests. But given that there has been no concrete evidence that Snowden’s disclosures threatened such interests, yet ample evidence that his careful, and validated, disclosures to respected journalists resulted in the end of mass warrantless surveillance of Americans, granting a pardon would calibrate Obama’s legacy on whistleblowing.

Obama’s prosecution of Snowden had the effect of eroding trust in government by allowing us to see a largely responsible administration attack those who revealed its flaws.

The importance, and fragility, of truth and truth-tellers has never been starker, nor has the potential cost of silence. Whistleblowers deserve our gratitude and need our support. Pardoning Snowden would be a bulwark against the rapid erosion of the currency of truth in our democracy, and perhaps be the most important legacy Obama could leave us in his final days in office.

Fox News has reached a settlement with former news anchor Gretchen Carlson for a reported $ 20m over claims she was fired from the network after she refused sexual advances from chairman Roger Ailes .
In a statement released on Tuesday , Fox News ’ s parent company expressed “ sincere regret ” over the incident .
“ 21st Century Fox is pleased to announce that it has settled Gretchen Carlson ’ s lawsuit , ” the statement said . “ During her tenure at Fox News , Gretchen exhibited the highest standards of journalism and professionalism . ”
The company apologized to the former Fox & Friends anchor “ for the fact that Gretchen was not treated with the respect and dignity that she and all of our colleagues deserve ” .
Carlson filed a lawsuit against the executive himself on 6 July that accused Ailes of propositioning her for sex and threatening to ruin her career if she refused . Her claims unleashed a wave of accusations from other women who encountered Ailes during his decades-long career in television and Republican politics . In the weeks following her lawsuit , more than 20 women contacted Carlson ’ s attorneys to say they had also been victims . A similar number spoke to investigators hired by 21st Century Fox to look into Carlson ’ s accusations .
Though Carlson sued Ailes personally , Fox News is liable for the settlement of the suit according to a report on the deals in Vanity Fair , which broke the news of the $ 20m payout . It ’ s unclear how much of the money Ailes is personally responsible for .
In response to the suit , Ailes initially maintained that he fired Carlson over poor ratings . He dismissed her and others ’ allegations as categorically false and reportedly called on other Fox News anchors to publicly lend their support . One of the loudest voices in Ailes ’ s defense , Greta Van Susteren , abruptly left the network on Tuesday .
Van Susteren wrote on her Facebook page : “ Fox has not felt like home to me for a few years and I took advantage of the clause in my contract which allows me to leave now. ” According to a report in New York Magazine , the clause stipulated that Van Susteren could leave if Ailes left . “ The clause had a time limitation , meaning I could not wait , ” Van Susteren wrote .
New York reported that Van Susteren was “ troubled ” by the culture exposed by the lawsuit and the investigation by law firm Paul , Weiss .
The internal investigation has apparently concluded without a wider examination of the alleged sexism in the corporate culture at Fox News , according to the Vanity Fair report . Ailes himself has retained Beverly Hills attorney Charles Harder , the lawyer who helped Peter Thiel sue Gawker through proxy Hulk Hogan in a suit that , though the verdict is likely to be overturned on appeal , bankrupted the company and left one of its editors penniless .
According to a report in the Financial Times , Ailes wants Harder to help him pursue legal action against New York Magazine and its reporter Gabriel Sherman , who broke many of the stories around Ailes ’ s decline and fall .
With the accusations mounting – including , reportedly , a claim of sexual harassment by the network ’ s star anchor , Megyn Kelly – Ailes ’ s position had become increasingly tenuous . On 21 July , Ailes was ousted from the rightwing cable giant he helped found nearly two decades ago .
Claims of harassment and intimidation have continued to emerge in the wake of Ailes ’ s departure . In late July , Laurie Dhue , a former on-air host , announced her plans for a tell-all book detailing claims of sexual harassment against Ailes .
On Friday , Sherman reported that a private investigator hired by Fox News had accessed the phone records of a reporter for Media Matters , a watchdog group that monitors conservative media outlets , at the behest of a Fox executive . In the US , obtaining phone records without permission is a crime . The private investigator allegedly accessed the records around the same time another Rupert Murdoch company , News International , was dealing with a mammoth phone-hacking scandal in Britain .
Separately , a longtime aide to Ailes , Laurie Luhn , claimed to Sherman that Ailes had carried on a coercive sexual relationship with her for years . Luhn claimed that Fox News entered a multimillion-dollar settlement with her , and implicated a top Ailes deputy in the alleged effort to silence her , raising the possibility that rumors of Ailes ’ s misconduct were well-known to the upper echelons of Fox News executives .
Two top Ailes lieutenants , Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy , were given promotions after Ailes left and now run the network in his place .
Carlson ’ s is not the only legal action dogging parent company 21st Century Fox . In late August , former Fox News host Andrea Tarantos filed a lawsuit that criticized the network as a “ sex-fueled , Playboy mansion-like cult ” where Ailes , host Bill O ’ Reilly , and other contributors sexually harassed her . A motion that lawyers for Fox News filed last week called Tarantos a “ wannabe ” and an “ opportunist ” .
Ailes left Fox News with a non-compete clause that prevents him from working with a rival cable news network anytime in the near future . A leaked draft of his severance agreement included a $ 40m payout and a two-year consultant relationship with the cable news network he helped build into a ratings behemoth .
Since leaving Fox , Ailes has reportedly begun to advise Donald Trump ’ s presidential campaign . Ailes is reported to be instrumental in Trump ’ s preparation for the upcoming televised debates with Hillary Clinton – a series of major media events for which Ailes is uniquely qualified to ready the first-time candidate .
In the statement 21st Century Fox issued on Tuesday , Carlson thanked other women who came forward with their own harassment complaints .
“ I ’ m ready to move on to the next chapter of my life in which I will redouble my efforts to empower women in the workplace , ” she said . “ I want to thank all the brave women who came forward to tell their own stories and the many people across the country who embraced and supported me in their # StandWithGretchen .

Thirteen more bodies have been recovered in California, bringing the death toll in the US state's deadliest wildfire to 42, officials say.

The remains were found in and around the largely incinerated town of Paradise, in the north of the state.

At least 228 people are missing as the Camp Fire continues to rage. Nearly 7,200 structures have been destroyed, and another 15,500 are at risk.

The fire has now surpassed the 1933 Griffith Park disaster that killed 31.

Speaking at a news conference on Monday evening, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea confirmed the number of dead, and the official number of missing.

Many more people are said to be unaccounted for.

In the south of the state, other wildfires are menacing lives and property. The Woolsey Fire has so far killed two people, damaging beach resorts, including Malibu.

More than 300,000 locals have been forced to flee their homes across California.

President Donald Trump has declared a ""major disaster"" in the state, making federal aid available to affected residents.

How did people die?

Paradise and its surrounding areas bore the brunt of the Camp Fire - the largest blaze - which started in nearby forest on Thursday.

Some bodies were found in gutted cars that were overrun by the fast-moving fire, as residents scrambled to evacuate.

Sorrell Bobrink, a Paradise resident who managed to drive away with her child, told BBC World Service radio she had first been woken up and alerted by a phone call from a friend.

Describing the scene as ""exactly like any apocalyptic movie I have ever seen"", she said she had not known if she was driving towards death or out of harm's way as the sky blackened.

""I had to drive through the fire - it was awful. It was probably the most awful experience I will have in my life,"" she told the Newsday programme.

""It was traumatising, we will be traumatised for a long time. My whole community was traumatised - I can't watch the videos anymore because I actually went through it.""

Many of the victims are believed to be elderly residents or people with mobility issues who would find evacuating more difficult.

Forensic experts are stepping up their search in the ruins of Paradise but officials warn that finding the bodies could take weeks.

Cadaver dogs are being brought in by local police to try and locate the dead, and two mobile army morgues will be used to help identify them.

The fire has burned more than 111,000 acres (45,000 hectares) and is nearly 25% contained, fire officials say.

What about further south?

The separate Woolsey Fire started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles.

It has consumed at least 85,500 acres and destroyed at least 177 buildings, officials say. It is only 10% contained. The smaller Hill Fire, nearby, has scorched 4,530 acres and is 75% contained.

Luxury homes in Malibu and other beach communities are among the properties destroyed.

The nearby city of Calabasas, home to well-known celebrities, remains under a mandatory evacuation order.

Why are the fires so bad?

Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round.

The California Public Utilities Commission is investigating what sparked the latest blazes - amid reports electrical companies may have suffered malfunctions near the sources shortly before the fires began.

Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment.

The state's 40 million-strong population also helps explain the fires' deadliness. That number is almost double what it was in the 1970s, and people are living closer to at-risk forest areas.
