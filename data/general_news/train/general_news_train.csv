A concern over whether Paradise can rebuild

While the Woolsey Fire chased residents from one of the wealthiest ZIP codes of California, near Malibu, the Camp Fire hit a low-income retirement community in Paradise. Some residents now wonder how — or if — it will be rebuilt.



“It had no real economy,” James Hana said of Paradise, where he has lived since 2002. The town was a haven for residents who were elderly or retired, many of them in mobile homes. A quarter of its residents were over 65, according to census data from 2017. Fourteen percent of the population was below the poverty line.

“What are they going to do?” Mr. Hana said. “They’re not going to rebuild.”

As the 2010s draw to a close , here are key ways the country looks different from 10 years ago :
From smartphones to social media , tech use has become the norm . As of 2019 , nine-in-ten U.S. adults say they go online , 81 % say they own a smartphone and 72 % say they use social media . Growth in adoption of some technologies has slowed in recent years , in some instances because there just aren ’ t many non-users left , especially among younger generations . For example , 93 % of Millennials ( ages 23 to 38 in 2019 ) own smartphones , and nearly 100 % say they use the internet .
Social media is now a key pathway to news for Americans . In 2018 , for the first time , social media sites surpassed print newspapers as a news source for Americans . One-in-five adults said they often get news from social media , slightly higher than the share who often did so from print newspapers ( 16 % ) . Among social media sites , Facebook dominates in terms of news consumption : Around half of all U.S. adults ( 52 % ) now say they get news there .
Millennials have surpassed Generation Xers as the largest generation in the U.S. labor force . There were 57 million Millennials ( born 1981 to 1996 ) working or looking for work in 2018 . That was more than the 53 million Gen Xers ( born 1965 to 1980 ) and well ahead of the 38 million Baby Boomers ( born 1946 to 1964 ) .
Following the Great Recession , the U.S. unemployment rate declined from a near record high level ( 9.5 % ) in the second quarter of 2010 to a near-record low ( 3.5 % ) in the second quarter of 2019 ( figures are non-seasonally adjusted ) . Despite the downward trend in unemployment , the recovery in other labor market indicators has been anemic to absent in the post-Great Recession era . For example , the U.S. employment rate in 2019 is several percentage points lower than it was at the start of the Great Recession in 2007 , primarily because of the aging U.S. population .
The 2010s will likely be the first decade in at least 160 years to see an increase in the average number of people living in U.S. households . This is in part because of the rising number of Americans living in multigenerational households . In 2016 , a record 64 million people , or 20 % of the U.S. population , lived with multiple generations under one roof , even with improvements in the U.S. economy since the Great Recession . Another factor behind the increase in household size : More Americans are “ doubled up ” in shared living quarters .
Nonwhites now account for the majority of the nation ’ s newborns , as well as the majority of K-12 students in public schools . More than half of newborn babies in the U.S. are racial or ethnic minorities , a threshold first crossed in 2013 . Nonwhite students also account for the majority of the nation ’ s K-12 public school students . As of fall 2018 , children from racial and ethnic minority groups were projected to make up 52.9 % of public K-12 students .
It ’ s become more common for Americans to attend church a few times a year or less ( 54 % ) than monthly or more ( 45 % ) . This is just one measure by which the religious landscape of the country has changed . Since 2009 , the share of Americans who describe their religious identity as atheist , agnostic or “ nothing in particular ” has grown from 17 % to 26 % , while the share who describe themselves as Christians has declined from 77 % to 65 % .
Americans increasingly support the legalization of marijuana . Two-thirds of U.S. adults now back legalization . A little less than a decade ago , in 2010 , fewer than half ( 41 % ) did so . The change in public sentiment has been accompanied by a changing legal landscape : As of this year , 11 states and the District of Columbia have legalized small amounts of marijuana for adult recreational use , while many others have legalized it for medical use . The drug remains illegal under federal law .
Same-sex marriage has the backing of a majority of U.S. adults . Same-sex marriage is another policy area where support surpassed opposition during the 2010s .

In a statement posted on Apple 's website early Wednesday , CEO Tim Cook said the order by U.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym `` has implications far beyond the legal case at hand . ''
`` We have great respect for the professionals at the FBI , and we believe their intentions are good , '' Cook 's statement read in part . `` Up to this point , we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them . But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have , and something we consider too dangerous to create . They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone . ''
Cook 's statement was published hours after Pym 's first-of-its kind ruling , a significant victory for the Justice Department in a technology policy debate that pits digital privacy against national security interests .
“ Nobody can build a phone that we can not get in under unique circumstances . Why should Apple be allowed to build a phone that does that ? ” a federal agent involved in the San Bernardino terror investigation told Fox News . “ The right should not supersede our ability to keep people safe . It ’ s why we are not finding others , encryption , and , specifically in this case , we can not connect the dots . ”
The agent said the phone ’ s carrier , Verizon , wouldn ’ t be able to provide authorities with the necessary information .
“ The information we need is on that phone and can not be accessed by Verizon , ” the agent said .
FBI Director James Comey told members of Congress last week that encryption is a major problem for law enforcement who `` find a device that ca n't be opened even when a judge says there 's probable cause to open it . ''
The ruling Tuesday tied the problem to the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil since the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon . Syed Farook and his wife , Tashfeen Malik , killed 14 people in a Dec. 2 shooting at a holiday luncheon for Farook 's co-workers . The couple later died in a gun battle with police .
Federal prosecutors told the judge in Tuesday 's court proceeding — which was conducted without Apple being allowed to participate — that investigators ca n't access a work phone used by Farook because they do n't know his passcode and Apple has not cooperated . Under U.S. law , a work phone is generally the property of a person 's employer . The judge told Apple to provide an estimate of its cost to comply with her order , suggesting that the government will be expected to pay for the work .
In his statement , Cook said , `` this moment calls for public discussion , and we want our customers and people around the country to understand what is at stake . ''
Apple has provided default encryption on its iPhones since 2014 , allowing any device 's contents to be accessed only by the user who knows the phone 's passcode . Previously , the company could use an extraction tool that would physically plug into the phone and allow it to respond to search warrant requests from the government .
The ruling by Pym , a former federal prosecutor , requires Apple to supply highly specialized software the FBI can load onto the county-owned work iPhone to bypass a self-destruct feature , which erases the phone 's data after too many unsuccessful attempts to unlock it . The FBI wants to be able to try different combinations in rapid sequence until it finds the right one .
`` The FBI may use different words to describe this tool , but make no mistake , '' Cook wrote . `` Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor . And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case , there is no way to guarantee such control . ''
It was not immediately clear what investigators believe they might find on Farook 's work phone or why the information would not be available from third-party service providers , such as Google or Facebook , though investigators think the device may hold clues about whom the couple communicated with and where they may have traveled .
The couple took pains to physically destroy two personally owned cellphones , crushing them beyond the FBI 's ability to recover information from them . They also removed a hard drive from their computer ; it has not been found despite investigators diving for days for potential electronic evidence in a nearby lake .
Farook was not carrying his work iPhone during the attack . It was discovered after a subsequent search . It was not known whether Farook forgot about the iPhone or did not care whether investigators found it .
The phone was running the newest version of Apple 's iPhone operating system , which requires a passcode and can not be accessed by Apple , unlike earlier operating systems or older phone models . San Bernardino County provided Farook with an iPhone configured to erase data after 10 consecutive unsuccessful unlocking attempts . The FBI said that feature appeared to be active on Farook 's iPhone as of the last time he performed a backup .
The judge did n't spell out her rationale in her three-page order , but the ruling comes amid a similar case in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York .
Investigators are still working to piece together a missing 18 minutes in Farook and Malik 's timeline from Dec. 2 . Investigators have concluded they were at least partly inspired by the Islamic State group ; Malik 's Facebook page included a note pledging allegiance to the group 's leader around the time of the attack .","Apple will fight a federal magistrate's order to help the Obama administration break into an encrypted iPhone belonging to one of the shooters in last December's deadly San Bernardino terror attack.

Shoppers looking for special discounts fill the flagship Macy 's department store in Manhattan on Thanksgiving . The store opened at 6 p.m. Thursday and remained open through the night .
Black Friday sales are expected to come in at around $ 33 billion , according to Customer Growth Partners , a market research and analysis firm , representing a 4.8 % advance over Black Friday last year .
Sales for November and December are expected to climb by about 4 % to some $ 682 billion , which would make 2017 the strongest holiday season since 2014 , according to the National Retail Federation .
Macy ’ s Inc. Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said the retailer had made adjustments based on years past and was well-positioned for the shopping bonanza . “ We don ’ t have the albatross of a lot of extra inventory like we did last year , ” he said .
Macy ’ s is offering fewer promotions , Mr. Gennette said . “ We ’ re in good shape , ” he added , but cautioned , “ we ’ ve still got five weeks ahead of us ” until Christmas .
The average Black Friday advertised discount across 17 categories was 45 % this year compared with 48 % last year , according to price-tracking firm Market Track LLC . Only three of eight major retailers offered deeper discounts than they did a year ago , the firm said .
That isn ’ t to say deals were hard to find . On Friday , shoppers found many of the same promotions that were on offer last year , including 30 % off at Coach and 50 % off at the Gap . Many shoppers snapped up bargains on Thanksgiving Day .
Kevin Krause , 27 , was first in line outside the Kohl ’ s store in Medford , Ore. , on Thanksgiving afternoon . He decided to buy an Xbox One videogame console that was on sale for $ 189 . “ I ’ m just doing that , and then I ’ m out , ” he said .
Black Friday : Then and Now Best Buy at Fair Lakes Shopping Center in Fairfax County , Va .
Analysts have been predicting robust holiday sales amid rising wages , low unemployment and strong consumer confidence . Another bonus , especially in the Northeast , is cooler weather compared with a year ago , when temperatures edged into the 60s .
“ I ’ d be fully expecting people to be thinking about spending more , not be holding back as much as in the past , ” said Andrew Duguay , a senior economist at Prevedere , a predictive analytics company .
Jena Thomas , a university student shopping with her mother at a Target in Chicago , bought two TVs that she couldn ’ t get earlier at Best Buy . She also splurged on a PlayStation 4 console and videogames . “ I caught up with all my Christmas shopping , ” she said .
Traditional stores continue to grapple with a host of problems including sluggish sales as more shopping takes place online . And there is the broad shift in consumer spending away from apparel and accessories and toward dining , travel and entertainment .
But a bright spot has emerged : Stores , having reduced inventories , aren ’ t sitting on piles of excess goods like they were a year ago .
“ Because inventory management was quite good coming out of the third quarter , there ’ s not going to be a need for aggressive promotions in the fourth quarter to clear out unsold goods , ” said Bill Dreher , a retail research analyst with Susquehanna International , a trading firm .
“ Having the right amount of inventory allows you to stick with your promotional plan , ” Kohl ’ s Corp. CEO Kevin Mansell said Friday .
In an interview earlier this week , Neiman Marcus Group CEO Karen Katz attributed a jump in the luxury retailer ’ s gross margin in the latest quarter to stronger full-priced sales . “ We ’ ve gotten our inventory in perfect alignment with our sales , ” she said .
That all could change in the days leading up to Christmas . Shoppers have been trained to wait for deals , a practice made easier by online price comparisons . If they hold off on many purchases , retailers will likely have to slash prices more than planned as the season progresses .
In a Wal-Mart on Long Island Thursday evening , Andre Valadas , a 34-year-old software engineer , said it was hard to snag a discounted Sharp TVs being sold at the store and at a Best Buy across the parking lot . He glanced at his phone often to text with friends looking for a similar deal nearby . “ I hope that if they don ’ t have deals right now they will have them in a few weeks closer to Christmas , ” he said .
Black Friday is expected to be the third-busiest shopping day of the year , behind the Saturday before Christmas and Cyber Monday , according to Customer Growth Partners .
Software company Adobe Systems Inc. said online sales on Thanksgiving increased 18 % to $ 2.87 billion . As of 8 p.m. Friday , shoppers had spent $ 3.54 billion , up 16 % . Adobe expects online sales to increase 14 % to $ 107.4 billion for the November-December period , compared with the previous year .
Amazon said Thanksgiving was one of its biggest mobile shopping days , as orders placed through its app increased more than 50 % over last year . Best selling items included Keurig coffee makers and its Echo speaker devices .
“ If you go back to the creation of Black Friday , it was this amazing opportunity for customers to get great deals , ” Dorion Carroll , vice president of mobile shopping at Amazon , said earlier this week . “ So they would flock to the stores and all of that would be great , until it wasn ’ t . It got too crowded . ”
A few technical problems popped up on Friday . Nike Inc. customers complained about error messages when using the sportswear maker ’ s website , and Macy ’ s said it experienced a “ slowdown ” with its credit-card system . Both retailers said they were working on the issues .
Even so , there are still plenty of shoppers make the post-Thanksgiving pilgrimage to stores .
Delaney Dauchy , a 15-year-old shopping with her mother at a Thousand Oaks , Calif. , mall , said the deals aren ’ t as good this year . She recalled a seven-for- $ 28 deal on underwear at Victoria ’ s Secret last year ; this year , she said it was five-for- $ 28.The Dauchys said they noticed smaller crowds than in past years , noting Black Friday deals have been going on all week . “ I ’ m not sure it seems extra special , ” Anne Dauchy , 48 , said .
Still , in Houston , several dozen people waited in line early Friday morning to start shopping at a Target store when it opened at 6 a.m .
Once inside , Freddy Cespedes , 42 , owner of a small security company , found some of the best advertised stuff had been picked over the night before . “ I was expecting a lot more people , ” he said .

The average Black Friday advertised discount across 17 categories was 45% this year compared with 48% last year, according to price-tracking firm Market Track LLC. Only three of eight major retailers offered deeper discounts than they did a year ago, the firm said.

That isn’t to say deals were hard to find. On Friday, shoppers found many of the same promotions that were on offer last year, including 30% off at Coach and 50% off at the Gap. Many shoppers snapped up bargains on Thanksgiving Day.

Kevin Krause, 27, was first in line outside the Kohl’s store in Medford, Ore., on Thanksgiving afternoon. He decided to buy an Xbox One videogame console that was on sale for $189. “I’m just doing that, and then I’m out,” he said.

Analysts have been predicting robust holiday sales amid rising wages, low unemployment and strong consumer confidence. Another bonus, especially in the Northeast, is cooler weather compared with a year ago, when temperatures edged into the 60s.

“I’d be fully expecting people to be thinking about spending more, not be holding back as much as in the past,” said Andrew Duguay, a senior economist at Prevedere, a predictive analytics company.

Jena Thomas, a university student shopping with her mother at a Target in Chicago, bought two TVs that she couldn’t get earlier at Best Buy. She also splurged on a PlayStation 4 console and videogames. “I caught up with all my Christmas shopping,” she said.

Traditional stores continue to grapple with a host of problems including sluggish sales as more shopping takes place online. And there is the broad shift in consumer spending away from apparel and accessories and toward dining, travel and entertainment.

But a bright spot has emerged: Stores, having reduced inventories, aren’t sitting on piles of excess goods like they were a year ago.

“Because inventory management was quite good coming out of the third quarter, there’s not going to be a need for aggressive promotions in the fourth quarter to clear out unsold goods,” said Bill Dreher, a retail research analyst with Susquehanna International, a trading firm.

“Having the right amount of inventory allows you to stick with your promotional plan,” Kohl’s Corp. CEO Kevin Mansell said Friday.

In an interview earlier this week, Neiman Marcus Group CEO Karen Katz attributed a jump in the luxury retailer’s gross margin in the latest quarter to stronger full-priced sales. “We’ve gotten our inventory in perfect alignment with our sales,” she said.

That all could change in the days leading up to Christmas. Shoppers have been trained to wait for deals, a practice made easier by online price comparisons. If they hold off on many purchases, retailers will likely have to slash prices more than planned as the season progresses.

In a Wal-Mart on Long Island Thursday evening, Andre Valadas, a 34-year-old software engineer, said it was hard to snag a discounted Sharp TVs being sold at the store and at a Best Buy across the parking lot. He glanced at his phone often to text with friends looking for a similar deal nearby. “I hope that if they don’t have deals right now they will have them in a few weeks closer to Christmas,” he said.

Black Friday is expected to be the third-busiest shopping day of the year, behind the Saturday before Christmas and Cyber Monday, according to Customer Growth Partners.

Software company Adobe Systems Inc. said online sales on Thanksgiving increased 18% to $2.87 billion. As of 8 p.m. Friday, shoppers had spent $3.54 billion, up 16%. Adobe expects online sales to increase 14% to $107.4 billion for the November-December period, compared with the previous year.

Amazon said Thanksgiving was one of its biggest mobile shopping days, as orders placed through its app increased more than 50% over last year. Best selling items included Keurig coffee makers and its Echo speaker devices.

“If you go back to the creation of Black Friday, it was this amazing opportunity for customers to get great deals,” Dorion Carroll, vice president of mobile shopping at Amazon, said earlier this week. “So they would flock to the stores and all of that would be great, until it wasn’t. It got too crowded.”

A few technical problems popped up on Friday. Nike Inc. customers complained about error messages when using the sportswear maker’s website, and Macy’s said it experienced a “slowdown” with its credit-card system. Both retailers said they were working on the issues.

Even so, there are still plenty of shoppers make the post-Thanksgiving pilgrimage to stores.

Delaney Dauchy, a 15-year-old shopping with her mother at a Thousand Oaks, Calif., mall, said the deals aren’t as good this year. She recalled a seven-for-$28 deal on underwear at Victoria’s Secret last year; this year, she said it was five-for-$28.The Dauchys said they noticed smaller crowds than in past years, noting Black Friday deals have been going on all week. “I’m not sure it seems extra special,” Anne Dauchy, 48, said.

Still, in Houston, several dozen people waited in line early Friday morning to start shopping at a Target store when it opened at 6 a.m.

Once inside, Freddy Cespedes, 42, owner of a small security company, found some of the best advertised stuff had been picked over the night before. “I was expecting a lot more people,” he said.

A day after police fatally shot Alton Sterling in the parking lot of a convenience store, concentric rings of protesters surrounded the site. In the outermost ring, young men drove cars around the block with speakers blaring: “Fuck the police.”

In the next ring in, the mood was almost celebratory. Neighbours waved signs and told stories about 37-year-old Sterling, and even laughed. They handed out snacks and drinks.

Further in, banks of television cameras ringed local community leaders, who pleaded with the crowds to remain peaceful.

And at the centre, near the door to the Triple S Food Mart, a trio of devastated people stood and stared.



The last person to speak to Sterling was Tawandra Carr, who lives near the store. She had a playful relationship with Sterling, who sold CDs and DVDs on a fold-out table in the parking lot.

At about 12.30am on Tuesday, Carr approached him in the parking lot, and the two pretended to argue before breaking into laughter. Sterling seemed in a good mood, she said – neither knew that an anonymous caller had just told police Sterling had threatened him with a pistol, and officers were on their way.

Sterling had packed up his wares for the night but Carr persuaded him to sell her a bootleg copy of Central Intelligence, a new film starring Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart. He charged her two dollars.

Suddenly – “quicker than you could blink”, Carr said – two police cars arrived from opposite directions and pulled into the parking lot.

Carr said two officers pushed past her, and made straight for Sterling, who seemed baffled. “He just kept saying: ‘What did I do? What did I do?’” she said.

Without answering, she said, the officers – 28-year-old Blane Salamoni and 29-year-old Howie Lake – went for their Tasers and shocked Sterling.

“He didn’t go down,” Carr said. “He was still saying: ‘What did I do?’”

Carr’s account, at that point, starts to coincide with a video made by a bystander. It shows the officers tackle Sterling on to the hood of a car, then to the ground where they pin him. In the midst of overlapping yelling and cursing one of the officers cries out: “He’s got a gun!” and both officers draw weapons.

Bush's death,2018-12-01,Madeline Holcombe,"( CNN ) The 41st President of the United States and patriarch of a political dynasty , George H.W . Bush died on Friday in Houston . He was 94 years old . Friends , world leaders and fellow politicians are now paying tribute to the man remembered as a World War II combat pilot , a Cold War politician , and a compassionate family man .
President Donald J. Trump and first lady Melania Trump : Melania and I join with a grieving Nation to mourn the loss of former President George H.W . Bush , who passed away last night .
Through his essential authenticity , disarming wit , and unwavering commitment to faith , family , and country , President Bush inspired generations of his fellow Americans to public service — to be , in his words , `` a thousand points of light '' illuminating the greatness , hope , and opportunity of America to the world .
President Bush always found a way to set the bar higher . As a young man , he captained the Yale baseball team , and then went on to serve as the youngest aviator in the United States Navy during the Second World War . Later in life , he rose to the pinnacle of American politics as a Congressman from Texas , envoy to China , Director of Central Intelligence , Vice President of eight years to President Ronald Reagan , and finally President of the United States .
With sound judgement ( sic ) , common sense , and unflappable leadership , President Bush guided our Nation , and the world , to a peaceful and victorious conclusion of the Cold War . As President , he set the stage for the decades of prosperity that have followed . And through all that he accomplished , he remained humble , following the quiet call to service that gave him a clear sense of direction .
Along with his full life of service to country , we will remember President Bush for his devotion to family — especially the love of his life , Barbara . His example lives on , and will continue to stir future Americans to pursue a greater cause . Our hearts ache with his loss , and we , with the American people , send our prayers to the entire Bush family , as we honor the life and legacy of 41 .
Former President Barack Obama : America has lost a patriot and humble servant in George Herbert Walker Bush . While our hearts are heavy today , they are also filled with gratitude . Not merely for the years he spent as our forty-first President , but for the more than 70 years he spent in devoted service to the country he loved -- from a decorated Naval aviator who nearly gave his life in World War II , to Commander-in-Chief of our Armed Forces , with plenty of posts along the way . Ambassador to the United Nations . Director of Central Intelligence . U.S . Envoy to China . Vice President of the United States .
George H.W . Bush 's life is a testament to the notion that public service is a noble , joyous calling . And he did tremendous good along the journey . Expanding America 's promise to new immigrants and people with disabilities . Reducing the scourge of nuclear weapons and building a broad international coalition to expel a dictator from Kuwait . And when democratic revolutions bloomed across Eastern Europe , it was his steady , diplomatic hand that made possible an achievement once thought anything but -- ending the Cold War without firing a shot .
It 's a legacy of service that may never be matched , even though he 'd want all of us to try .
After seventy-three years of marriage , George and Barbara Bush are together again now , two points of light that never dimmed , two points of light that ignited countless others with their example -- the example of a man who , even after commanding the world 's mightiest military , once said `` I got more of a kick out of being one of the founders of the YMCA in Midland , Texas back in 1952 than almost anything I 've done . ''
What a testament to the qualities that make this country great . Service to others . Commitment to leaving behind something better . Sacrifice in the name of lifting this country closer to its founding ideals . Our thoughts are with the entire Bush family tonight -- and all who were inspired by George and Barbara 's example .
Former Vice President Al Gore : President George H.W . Bush served our nation with extraordinary integrity and grace . I will remember him for his personal kindness and for his love of this country . He earned bipartisan respect for speaking up and taking action for what he believed was right , even when doing so was unpopular . He inspired countless Americans to volunteer and improve their communities through his point of life Foundation . President Bush leaves behind an American legacy of a lifetime of service that will be revered for generations .
Former President Bill and former first lady Hillary Clinton : Hillary and I mourn the passing of President George H.W . Bush , and give thanks for his great long life of service , love , and friendship . I will be forever grateful for the friendship we formed . From the moment I met him as a young governor invited to his home in Kennebunkport , I was struck by the kindness he showed to Chelsea , by his innate and genuine decency , and by his devotion to Barbara , his children , and their growing brood .
Few Americans have been—or will ever be—able to match President Bush 's record of service to the United States and the joy he took every day from it ; from his military service in World War II , to his work in Congress , the United Nations , China , the Central Intelligence Agency , the Vice Presidency and the Presidency , where he worked to move the post Cold War world toward greater unity , peace , and freedom . He never stopped serving . I saw it up close , working with him on tsunami relief in Asia and here at home after Hurricane Katrina . His remarkable leadership and great heart were always on full display .
I am profoundly grateful for every minute I spent with President Bush and will always hold our friendship as one of my life 's greatest gifts . Our hearts and prayers are with George , Jeb , Neil , Marvin , Doro , their families , and the entire Bush clan .
Hillary Clinton : George H.W . Bush was a beloved father ( and ) grandfather , a war hero , a public servant , ( and ) a class act . In my experiences ( with ) him , I always valued his desire to listen , look at evidence ( and ) ask for ideas , even from people ( with ) different beliefs . My heart goes out to the entire Bush family .

Ex-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev : `` I express my deep condolences to the family of George H.W . Bush and all Americans over of the death of the 41st president of the United States , '' he told the Russian news agency Interfax . Gorbachev and Bush worked closely to help end to the Cold War .
`` I have a lot of memories associated with this person . We had a chance to work together during the years of tremendous changes . It was a dramatic time that demanded great responsibility from everyone . The result was an end to the Cold War and the nuclear arms race , '' Gorbachev added .

Australian Prime Minister John Howard : George Herbert Walker Bush , 41st president of the United States , was in office when arguably the most momentous event in post Second World War affairs occurred - the collapse of the Communist empire of the Soviet Union .
Initially as Vice President to Ronald Reagan , and later as President himself , he played a major role in shaping those historic years .
The late President possessed an endearing sense of humor and always exhibited immense public grace . He was the patriarch of a great American family .
At all times he was a true friend of Australia . He visited our country on a number of occasions . He was the first American president to address a joint sitting of our national parliament .
I extend my deep sympathy to the late President 's family . He exemplified the best of his nation 's values in both war and peace .
Former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger : Today , we 've lost a great hero . George Bush was an inspiration to all Americans and we will miss him dearly . From the day he first put on his US Navy flight suit and took off into the unknown , he always put his country first . He took on many jobs throughout his long career , and all shared one distinct trait : public service . His greatest legacy is that pure American spirit , that commitment to selflessness that drove him until the very end .
He was born in a time that seemed to produce an endless supply of heroes , but make no mistake : George Bush embodied everything that made the Greatest Generation great .
I will always be grateful to him for his friendship , for embracing me and imparting just a fraction of his wisdom during our time together . Some of my fondest memories are of sledding with him at Camp David and inspiring America to join our fitness crusade by hosting the Great American Workout with him on the White House lawn and listening to his speech advice as we flew between campaign rallies . I will never forget the pride I felt the day he appointed me Chairman of the President 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports . I loved to hear him surprise people with his wild side — explaining the pure joy he felt as he flew and jumped out of planes . I also loved to hear him explain his passion for this country — it was a true love that knew no petty boundaries or party lines . He taught me so much , but most of all , he taught me the power of serving a cause greater than yourself . I count myself lucky for many reasons ; but for the opportunity to call George Bush a mentor , I ca n't help but think I 'm the luckiest man in America .
President Bush has left us for one last flight but his destination is n't unknown . He 's flying into the arms of the love of his life , Barbara . This evening , each of us should take a minute to look up and offer him a silent thanks .
Former President Richard Nixon 's daughters Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower : Our father believed in George H.W . Bush . Richard Nixon kicked off George Bush 's campaign for congress in 1966 , encouraged him to run for senate in 1970 , entrusted him as U.N . Ambassador and head of the RNC , and supported him tirelessly when he served as President for four years .
George H.W . Bush lived a life that was purposeful , and extraordinarily rewarding -- -for our nation , and for our world .
While people everywhere salute and thank George H.W . Bush today , we take special solace in knowing that President and Mrs. Bush are together again .
Former Vice President Joe Biden : From the moment he signed up as an 18-year-old Naval aviator a few months after Pearl Harbor and for every step after that in his lengthy career as a diplomat , Congressman , Vice President , and President -- George H.W . Bush chose a path of service .
He was a man who presided over the peaceful end to the Cold War and the reunification of Germany . This was statesmanship and leadership of historic dimensions . So much could have gone wrong but instead went right because of his leadership . This is how history will rightly remember him . Every American — and arguably everybody on Earth — owes him a debt of gratitude for bring such an able steward .
Over the course of the many years we worked with together — and against each other — on the biggest issues of the day , differences of policy were always based on substance . It was never personal . It was never petty . It was always with respect for our institutions and the people they govern .
As we mourn his passing today , we remember a life totally and completely dedicated to the country he loved .

''","(CNN) The 41st President of the United States and patriarch of a political dynasty, George H.W. Bush died on Friday in Houston . He was 94 years old. Friends, world leaders and fellow politicians are now paying tribute to the man remembered as a World War II combat pilot, a Cold War politician, and a compassionate family man.

President Donald J. Trump and first lady Melania Trump: Melania and I join with a grieving Nation to mourn the loss of former President George H.W. Bush, who passed away last night.

Through his essential authenticity, disarming wit, and unwavering commitment to faith, family, and country, President Bush inspired generations of his fellow Americans to public service — to be, in his words, ""a thousand points of light"" illuminating the greatness, hope, and opportunity of America to the world.

President Bush always found a way to set the bar higher. As a young man, he captained the Yale baseball team, and then went on to serve as the youngest aviator in the United States Navy during the Second World War. Later in life, he rose to the pinnacle of American politics as a Congressman from Texas, envoy to China, Director of Central Intelligence, Vice President of eight years to President Ronald Reagan, and finally President of the United States.

With sound judgement (sic), common sense, and unflappable leadership, President Bush guided our Nation, and the world, to a peaceful and victorious conclusion of the Cold War. As President, he set the stage for the decades of prosperity that have followed. And through all that he accomplished, he remained humble, following the quiet call to service that gave him a clear sense of direction.

Along with his full life of service to country, we will remember President Bush for his devotion to family — especially the love of his life, Barbara. His example lives on, and will continue to stir future Americans to pursue a greater cause. Our hearts ache with his loss, and we, with the American people, send our prayers to the entire Bush family, as we honor the life and legacy of 41.

Former President Barack Obama: America has lost a patriot and humble servant in George Herbert Walker Bush. While our hearts are heavy today, they are also filled with gratitude. Not merely for the years he spent as our forty-first President, but for the more than 70 years he spent in devoted service to the country he loved -- from a decorated Naval aviator who nearly gave his life in World War II, to Commander-in-Chief of our Armed Forces, with plenty of posts along the way. Ambassador to the United Nations. Director of Central Intelligence. U.S. Envoy to China. Vice President of the United States.

George H.W. Bush's life is a testament to the notion that public service is a noble, joyous calling. And he did tremendous good along the journey. Expanding America's promise to new immigrants and people with disabilities. Reducing the scourge of nuclear weapons and building a broad international coalition to expel a dictator from Kuwait. And when democratic revolutions bloomed across Eastern Europe, it was his steady, diplomatic hand that made possible an achievement once thought anything but -- ending the Cold War without firing a shot.

It's a legacy of service that may never be matched, even though he'd want all of us to try.

After seventy-three years of marriage, George and Barbara Bush are together again now, two points of light that never dimmed, two points of light that ignited countless others with their example -- the example of a man who, even after commanding the world's mightiest military, once said ""I got more of a kick out of being one of the founders of the YMCA in Midland, Texas back in 1952 than almost anything I've done.""

What a testament to the qualities that make this country great. Service to others. Commitment to leaving behind something better. Sacrifice in the name of lifting this country closer to its founding ideals. Our thoughts are with the entire Bush family tonight -- and all who were inspired by George and Barbara's example.

Former Vice President Al Gore: President George H.W. Bush served our nation with extraordinary integrity and grace. I will remember him for his personal kindness and for his love of this country. He earned bipartisan respect for speaking up and taking action for what he believed was right, even when doing so was unpopular. He inspired countless Americans to volunteer and improve their communities through his point of life Foundation. President Bush leaves behind an American legacy of a lifetime of service that will be revered for generations.

Former President Bill and former first lady Hillary Clinton: Hillary and I mourn the passing of President George H.W. Bush, and give thanks for his great long life of service, love, and friendship. I will be forever grateful for the friendship we formed. From the moment I met him as a young governor invited to his home in Kennebunkport, I was struck by the kindness he showed to Chelsea, by his innate and genuine decency, and by his devotion to Barbara, his children, and their growing brood.

Few Americans have been—or will ever be—able to match President Bush's record of service to the United States and the joy he took every day from it; from his military service in World War II, to his work in Congress, the United Nations, China, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Vice Presidency and the Presidency, where he worked to move the post Cold War world toward greater unity, peace, and freedom. He never stopped serving. I saw it up close, working with him on tsunami relief in Asia and here at home after Hurricane Katrina. His remarkable leadership and great heart were always on full display.

I am profoundly grateful for every minute I spent with President Bush and will always hold our friendship as one of my life's greatest gifts. Our hearts and prayers are with George, Jeb, Neil, Marvin, Doro, their families, and the entire Bush clan.

Hillary Clinton: George H.W. Bush was a beloved father (and) grandfather, a war hero, a public servant, (and) a class act. In my experiences (with) him, I always valued his desire to listen, look at evidence (and) ask for ideas, even from people (with) different beliefs. My heart goes out to the entire Bush family.

general_news,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2017/0109/In-a-divided-America-can-Hollywood-act-as-change-agent,"In a divided America, can Hollywood act as change agent?",2017-01-09,"Jessica Mendoza, Harry Bruinius","There ’ s nothing like a Hollywood thank-you speech to whip pundits , the press , and the president-elect into a Twitter frenzy .
But behind the social media furor sparked by Meryl Streep ’ s speech at the Golden Globes is a bigger question : Can Hollywood – with its current blockbuster , give fans what they want financial model – continue to act as a force for change in today ’ s America ?
Entertainment – music , movies , novels , and TV – has historically played a key part in normalizing new ideas and driving social change . But shifts in technology and culture have put more pressure , especially on the film industry , to come up with products meant to please rather than challenge , media analysts say .
In calling for a more meaningful and empathetic approach to storytelling , the multiple-Oscar-winning Ms. Streep told her colleagues that both film and television need to continue to act as change agents , even in the face of such pressures . And with audiences propelled toward an era of both diversity and division , experts say , the task may be as important as ever .
“ [ Streep ] was making a plea for a vision of Hollywood films as an art form , as a vehicle of understanding and empathy , ” says Aram Sinnreich , professor of communications at American University in Washington , D.C. , and a research fellow at its Center for Media & Social Impact . “ It was a proactive call to arms both for members of the Hollywood establishment , and for their audiences , to preserve what is good about Hollywood in what ’ s sure to be a sustained effort to shut it down . ”
During her speech , Streep called out the president-elect on his treatment of a disabled reporter last year and appealed to her colleagues and the press to stand against such actions .
“ We need the principled press to hold power to account , to call them on the carpet for every outrage , ” she said , asking people to support the Committee to Protect Journalists . “ And we have to remind each other of the privilege and the responsibility of the act of empathy . ”
Her words not only articulated the fears that have bubbled up among racial and religious minorities , women , and LGBT Americans following President-elect Donald Trump ’ s victory in November , media experts say , they also challenged Hollywood and the arts to be part of the movement to resist efforts to silence minorities or curb free expression under the new administration .
“ What she ’ s really doing is summoning the souls of Hollywood and everything Hollywood represents to make sure that it doesn ’ t stand mutely by after Trump takes office … if he really starts implementing all the things he ’ s saying , ” says Paul Levinson , writer , novelist , and professor of communications and media studies at Fordham University in New York .
Some listeners have already responded . The Committee to Protect Journalists reports that hundreds of people made donations to the organization following Streep ’ s speech .
Some commentators – pointing to continued calls for the creation of a Muslim registry and a “ watch list ” of academics a conservative group deemed to be pushing “ left-wing propaganda ” in classrooms – have compared such policies to the repressive McCarthy era of the 1950s .
“ The memory of McCarthyism and the blacklists are fresh in the minds of a lot of creative people , ” says Professor Sinnreich at American University .
“ If I were an artist of conscience in Hollywood right now … I would be doing everything I could to organize , to drive audience sympathy for the important role of the arts as a medium of dissent and as a platform for the celebration of difference , ” he says .
To be sure , casting departments have made an effort to place more brown and black characters in shows and movies , says Darnell Hunt , a professor of sociology and the Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies at the University of California Los Angeles .
In contrast to the # OscarsSoWhite controversy of the past two years , the Globes awarded Best Drama to “ Moonlight ” and best supporting actress to Viola Davis for “ Fences. ” Tracee Ross Ellis won best actress in a comedy for the ABC ’ s “ black-ish , ” and FX ’ s “ Atlanta , ” created by and starring Donald Glover , won best comedy .
More stories , especially in television , are being told that reflect the diversity of audiences , he says . Women and actors of color are more visible in big-budget blockbusters than perhaps they have ever been . The casts of the last two films in the “ Star Wars ” franchise are a prime example .
Those efforts matter , Professor Hunt notes , because “ to the degree that diversity is absent , it ’ s hard to have empathy for one another . ”
He adds , “ To the degree that Hollywood is not diverse , that it makes the same old types of movies and TV shows from a white male point of view , then it ’ s failing in that mission … [ to ] give other people access to experiences and points of view that they might not have otherwise . ”
From that perspective , there ’ s plenty to work on , he says . The most recent Hollywood Diversity Report , which the Bunche Center releases every February , found that despite making up 40 percent of the US population in 2014 , racial minorities held 12.9 percent of lead roles in the 164 films made that year .
To change that , “ Hollywood has to deal with diversity from ground up : what type of stories are we telling , who can tell them , who are we casting in them , ” he says . Hunt holds up as an example “ Moonlight , ” whose protagonist is a gay black man struggling with identity . The story draws from the life of director Barry Jenkins , who also wrote the screenplay .
“ That ’ s when you get the breakthrough in terms of inclusivity and resonating with where America is , ” Hunt says .
“ Rarely do we see poor families who can ’ t afford anything on TV , ” Hunt says . A few programs try to delve into the anxieties of working-class folks trying to make ends meet – like ABC ’ s “ The Middle , ” which follows the Heck family as they struggle to get by in small-town Indiana .
The problem , analysts say , is that reminding audiences of money troubles isn ’ t conventionally regarded as good marketing – notwithstanding the success of “ All in the Family ” in the 1970s , “ Roseanne ” in the 1990s , and the success of current animated sitcoms “ The Simpsons ” and “ Bob ’ s Burgers . ”

“ Any honest appraisal of Hollywood has to say that in many ways it represents the whole continuum of human nature … in terms of making money , ” says Levinson at Fordham . “ All that counts is [ the ] box office . ”

“ Those political tensions and aspirations have always existed in Hollywood , but their role in shaping content is always mediated through the marketplace , ” Sinnreich says .
“ So ultimately if we , the viewing public , are interested in seeing Hollywood fulfill Meryl Streep ’ s hope of a more empathetic , more inclusive medium , people need to vote with their wallets . ”","There’s nothing like a Hollywood thank-you speech to whip pundits, the press, and the president-elect into a Twitter frenzy.

But behind the social media furor sparked by Meryl Streep’s speech at the Golden Globes is a bigger question: Can Hollywood – with its current blockbuster, give fans what they want financial model – continue to act as a force for change in today’s America?

Entertainment – music, movies, novels, and TV – has historically played a key part in normalizing new ideas and driving social change. But shifts in technology and culture have put more pressure, especially on the film industry, to come up with products meant to please rather than challenge, media analysts say.

In calling for a more meaningful and empathetic approach to storytelling, the multiple-Oscar-winning Ms. Streep told her colleagues that both film and television need to continue to act as change agents, even in the face of such pressures. And with audiences propelled toward an era of both diversity and division, experts say, the task may be as important as ever.

“[Streep] was making a plea for a vision of Hollywood films as an art form, as a vehicle of understanding and empathy,” says Aram Sinnreich, professor of communications at American University in Washington, D.C., and a research fellow at its Center for Media & Social Impact. “It was a proactive call to arms both for members of the Hollywood establishment, and for their audiences, to preserve what is good about Hollywood in what’s sure to be a sustained effort to shut it down.”

Will show business take a stand?

During her speech, Streep called out the president-elect on his treatment of a disabled reporter last year and appealed to her colleagues and the press to stand against such actions.

“We need the principled press to hold power to account, to call them on the carpet for every outrage,” she said, asking people to support the Committee to Protect Journalists. “And we have to remind each other of the privilege and the responsibility of the act of empathy.”

Her words not only articulated the fears that have bubbled up among racial and religious minorities, women, and LGBT Americans following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in November, media experts say, they also challenged Hollywood and the arts to be part of the movement to resist efforts to silence minorities or curb free expression under the new administration.

“What she’s really doing is summoning the souls of Hollywood and everything Hollywood represents to make sure that it doesn’t stand mutely by after Trump takes office … if he really starts implementing all the things he’s saying,” says Paul Levinson, writer, novelist, and professor of communications and media studies at Fordham University in New York.

Some listeners have already responded. The Committee to Protect Journalists reports that hundreds of people made donations to the organization following Streep’s speech.

Some commentators – pointing to continued calls for the creation of a Muslim registry and a “watch list” of academics a conservative group deemed to be pushing “left-wing propaganda” in classrooms – have compared such policies to the repressive McCarthy era of the 1950s.

“The memory of McCarthyism and the blacklists are fresh in the minds of a lot of creative people,” says Professor Sinnreich at American University.

“If I were an artist of conscience in Hollywood right now … I would be doing everything I could to organize, to drive audience sympathy for the important role of the arts as a medium of dissent and as a platform for the celebration of difference,” he says.

More women, minorities on screen

To be sure, casting departments have made an effort to place more brown and black characters in shows and movies, says Darnell Hunt, a professor of sociology and the Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies at the University of California Los Angeles.

In contrast to the #OscarsSoWhite controversy of the past two years, the Globes awarded Best Drama to “Moonlight” and best supporting actress to Viola Davis for “Fences.” Tracee Ross Ellis won best actress in a comedy for the ABC’s “black-ish,” and FX’s “Atlanta,” created by and starring Donald Glover, won best comedy.

More stories, especially in television, are being told that reflect the diversity of audiences, he says. Women and actors of color are more visible in big-budget blockbusters than perhaps they have ever been. The casts of the last two films in the “Star Wars” franchise are a prime example.

Those efforts matter, Professor Hunt notes, because “to the degree that diversity is absent, it’s hard to have empathy for one another.”

He adds, “To the degree that Hollywood is not diverse, that it makes the same old types of movies and TV shows from a white male point of view, then it’s failing in that mission … [to] give other people access to experiences and points of view that they might not have otherwise.”

To change that, “Hollywood has to deal with diversity from ground up: what type of stories are we telling, who can tell them, who are we casting in them,” he says. Hunt holds up as an example “Moonlight,” whose protagonist is a gay black man struggling with identity. The story draws from the life of director Barry Jenkins, who also wrote the screenplay.

“That’s when you get the breakthrough in terms of inclusivity and resonating with where America is,” Hunt says.

Needed: more blue-collar stories

Also lacking in representation: the working class.

“Rarely do we see poor families who can’t afford anything on TV,” Hunt says. A few programs try to delve into the anxieties of working-class folks trying to make ends meet – like ABC’s “The Middle,” which follows the Heck family as they struggle to get by in small-town Indiana.

The problem, analysts say, is that reminding audiences of money troubles isn’t conventionally regarded as good marketing – notwithstanding the success of “All in the Family” in the 1970s, “Roseanne” in the 1990s, and the success of current animated sitcoms “The Simpsons” and “Bob’s Burgers.”

“[E]ntertainment has always been a class issue because it always costs money, the kind known as 'discretionary.' ” writes Mary McNamara for the Los Angeles Times.

Mcclennen,"Much has been made recently about the inaccurate representation of Chris Kyle in “ American Sniper. ” We ’ ve learned that , despite the fact that the film depicts Kyle as a hero and a martyr , the real American sniper was heartless and cruel . Rather than struggle with moral dilemmas as we see in the film , the actual man had no such hesitation and no such conscience .
But to focus on “ American Sniper ’ s ” depiction of Kyle is to miss the larger problems of the film . In addition to sugarcoating Kyle , the film suffers from major myopia -- from a complete inability to see the larger picture . And that is why criticism of the film has to look at its director , Clint Eastwood , and the troubling ways he represents a dark , disturbing feature of the GOP mind-set .
In order to have the bigger picture we need to remember two key moments in recent Eastwood public appearances . The first took place in 2005 when Eastwood confronted filmmaker Michael Moore at the National Board of Review dinner , where both men were being honored . Moore was there for his documentary on the Iraq War , `` Fahrenheit 911. ” Eastwood had “ Million Dollar Baby. ” After Eastwood accepted his award , he directed comments at Moore . “ Michael Moore and I actually have a lot in common – we both appreciate living in a country where there ’ s free expression. ” Eastwood then added : “ But , Michael , if you ever show up at my front door with a camera – I ’ ll kill you . I mean it. ” The tone was I ’ m sort of joking , but maybe not really joking , provoking nervous laughter from both the audience and Moore himself .
Eastwood said he would kill Moore if he showed up at his door . This was his response to a film that raised much-needed conversation about U.S. gun culture . Eastwood ’ s reaction tells us a lot about the way that some members of the GOP treat those with whom they disagree . If you don ’ t agree with me on guns , I ’ ll just kill you .
The second event took place at the Republican National Convention in 2012 when Eastwood delivered a monologue to an empty chair , which supposedly had an invisible Barack Obama sitting in it . It was , without question , the weirdest moment of the RNC , and that ’ s taking into account Paul Ryan ’ s lying and Romney ’ s poor performance . While more than 30 million Americans watched , Eastwood delivered an improvised , rambling monologue that suggested that Obama was swearing at him and cursing at Romney . It left most of us watching completely bewildered .
Thankfully , though , Jon Stewart stepped in to make sense of it . On “ The Daily Show , ” Stewart explained that Eastwood 's performance could be understood as a metaphor for the existence of a president that only exists in the minds of the GOP .
“ This president has issues , and there are very legitimate debates to be had about his policy and actions and successes and/or failures -– I mean , tune in next week –- but I could never wrap my head as to why the world and the president that Republicans describe bears so little resemblance to the world and experience that I experience . And now I know why . There is a President Obama that only Republicans can see . ”
These two events taken together help explain what ’ s wrong with “ American Sniper. ” They illustrate the combination of delusion and aggressive violence that governs too much of GOP politics .
Let ’ s start with the delusion . The film draws a direct link between the events of 9/11 and the war in Iraq , forgetting completely that the war in Iraq had nothing whatsoever to do with 9/11 . Not one of the attackers that day was in any way connected to Iraq . Thus to connect 9/11 to Iraq is delusional . Not even the Bush administration made that overt a link—at the time they claimed they went to Iraq to keep the Iraqis from using weapons of mass destruction that were never found .
But that ’ s not the perceptions of many who watch Fox News . As the Program on International Policy Attitudes ( PIPA ) at the University of Maryland reported back in 2003 : “ Those who receive most of their news from Fox News are more likely than average to have misperceptions. ” In their poll they found that 80 percent of Fox viewers held at least one of three Iraq-related misperceptions , more than any other news consumers , especially those that consume NPR and PBS .
The point is that the 9/11-Iraq link is delusional , but it is also a common link in public perceptions of those on the right who watch Fox News and clearly it is one that makes sense to Eastwood and those that think like him .
The second problem is the culture of violence . While the film tries to show Kyle wrestling at some level with some of his kills , he still very clearly divides the world into categories . As his father puts it in the film , there are wolves ( those that want to kill you ) , sheep and sheep dogs ( who have to protect the sheep from the wolves ) . Not only are there just three categories of life , but these categories are also defined solely by a logic of violence and aggression . In the film , Iraqis are almost all depicted as wolves , even women and children . Kyle ’ s first two kills are a young boy and his mother . But they posed a threat and thus needed to be killed . As Kyle later explains , he has no remorse over any of his kills , just over the lives he wished he could have protected .
At no point does the film consider the fact that the war was based on false justifications . At no point does it imagine that those in Iraq might have seen the U.S. soldiers as invaders in their homeland . At no point does it imagine that the violence suffered by our own soldiers could have been avoided if we simply hadn ’ t started the war to begin with . The logic of war is completely unquestioned , making this the most simplistic war film we have seen nominated for an Oscar in decades .
But the fact that the film has no nuance , no context and no subtlety should not surprise us . If anything it is a terrifying glimpse into a GOP mind-set that couples delusion with violence . We watch Kyle zero in on a pinpointed target and we are reminded of the ways that such a narrow , aggressive vision is itself a metaphor for GOP beliefs . This is a movie that ’ s not just about a sniper , but also about an attitude that threatens to destroy any chance in our nation for political compromise and productive debate .

He dialed her cell . And she answered . But , officials say , she did n't tell him that she was on her way to Syria to join ISIS .
She was just late for class , that 's all , Ibrahim 's daughter told him on Friday , according to the Arapahoe County Sheriff 's Office , which filed a runaway report
The American girl of Sudanese descent also kept quiet about her two girlfriends , Americans of Somali descent , who were flying with her to Turkey by way of Germany .
Those two had told their father , Ali Farah , that they were going to the library .
But when Farah got home from work , a visitor came calling , according to the documents . Apparently , it was Ibrahim .
Farah should check to see if his daughters ' passports were missing , the visitor told him -- just like his daughter 's passport was .

Sure enough , they were gone , along with $ 2,000 in cash .
The two families called the FBI . They said they thought the girls were on their way to Turkey .
German authorities intercepted the trio , ages 15 , 16 and 17 , at Frankfurt airport and put them on a plane back to the United States , where they were greeted by FBI agents .
The three girls were questioned and released . Two U.S. officials say they had planned to join militants with ISIS , the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria .
The girls ' parents say they had no idea their children planned to travel . None of them had ever run away before .
Their disappearance hit them out of the blue , the way other ISIS related incidents are popping up in the Western world . Two more turned up in tandem with the girls ' runaway attempt .
On Monday , a radical convert to Islam in Canada ran down two soldiers in his car , killing one of them . Martin Rouleau Couture , 25 , then led police on a chase before his car rolled into a ditch in the town of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu , southeast of Montreal .
Back in July , Couture , too , had tried to join foreign jihad , and Canadian police arrested him on his way to Turkey . But they could not charge him and had to let him go .
And this week , a video turned up of a 17-year-old Australian boy standing with ISIS fighters and threatening to behead Western leaders , including President Obama , then fly the ISIS flag over the White House .
ISIS has , for an anti-Western organization , been surprisingly attractive to young recruits from the West , as well as to some young women .
More than 100 of the foreign fighters have come from the United States , according to intelligence estimates ; hundreds more from Europe , which is geographically closer to the fight .
Every week , five more people from the UK alone join ISIS , a British police commissioner said Tuesday . And that 's a conservative estimate .
`` We know that over 500 British nationals traveled to join the conflict , '' said Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe from the Metropolitan Police .
`` Five a week does n't sound much , but when you realize there are 50 weeks in a year , 250 more would be 50 % more than we think have gone already , '' he said .
To put things into perspective , though , thousands more come from the Middle East and Africa . More than 3,000 have joined from Tunisia .
It 's more than just a radical interpretation of Islam that is drawing teens to the extremely bloodthirsty militant group , a former CIA officer says .
`` They 're often times searching for an identity , because what the jihadis are actually pushing is a specific narrative , which is : Your people ( Muslims ) are being oppressed in this place called Syria ; your government is doing nothing ; we 're the only ones who are actually going to help you out , '' said Aki Peritz . `` Why do n't you join the fight ? ''
Richard Barrett of The Soufan Group says many of the teens lack a sense of belonging where they live , and they believe ISIS can give it to them .
`` The general picture provided by foreign fighters of their lives in Syria suggests camaraderie , good morale and purposeful activity , all mixed in with a sense of understated heroism , designed to attract their friends as well as to boost their own self-esteem , '' he says .

He dialed her cell. And she answered. But, officials say, she didn't tell him that she was on her way to Syria to join ISIS.

She was just late for class, that's all, Ibrahim's daughter told him on Friday, according to the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office, which filed a runaway report

The American girl of Sudanese descent also kept quiet about her two girlfriends, Americans of Somali descent, who were flying with her to Turkey by way of Germany.

Two more girls, sisters

Those two had told their father, Ali Farah, that they were going to the library.

But when Farah got home from work, a visitor came calling, according to the documents. Apparently, it was Ibrahim.

Farah should check to see if his daughters' passports were missing, the visitor told him -- just like his daughter's passport was.

Sure enough, they were gone, along with $2,000 in cash.

The two families called the FBI. They said they thought the girls were on their way to Turkey.

The agency put out a notice on their passports.

German authorities intercepted the trio, ages 15, 16 and 17, at Frankfurt airport and put them on a plane back to the United States, where they were greeted by FBI agents.

The three girls were questioned and released. Two U.S. officials say they had planned to join militants with ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

Out of the blue

The girls' parents say they had no idea their children planned to travel. None of them had ever run away before.

Their disappearance hit them out of the blue, the way other ISIS related incidents are popping up in the Western world. Two more turned up in tandem with the girls' runaway attempt.

On Monday, a radical convert to Islam in Canada ran down two soldiers in his car, killing one of them. Martin Rouleau Couture, 25, then led police on a chase before his car rolled into a ditch in the town of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, southeast of Montreal.

He exited the car, and police shot him dead.

Back in July, Couture, too, had tried to join foreign jihad , and Canadian police arrested him on his way to Turkey. But they could not charge him and had to let him go.

And this week, a video turned up of a 17-year-old Australian boy standing with ISIS fighters and threatening to behead Western leaders, including President Obama, then fly the ISIS flag over the White House.

ISIS' draw

ISIS has, for an anti-Western organization, been surprisingly attractive to young recruits from the West , as well as to some young women.

More than 100 of the foreign fighters have come from the United States, according to intelligence estimates; hundreds more from Europe, which is geographically closer to the fight.

Every week, five more people from the UK alone join ISIS, a British police commissioner said Tuesday. And that's a conservative estimate.

""We know that over 500 British nationals traveled to join the conflict,"" said Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe from the Metropolitan Police.

""Five a week doesn't sound much, but when you realize there are 50 weeks in a year, 250 more would be 50% more than we think have gone already,"" he said.

To put things into perspective, though, thousands more come from the Middle East and Africa. More than 3,000 have joined from Tunisia.

Sense of belonging

It's more than just a radical interpretation of Islam that is drawing teens to the extremely bloodthirsty militant group, a former CIA officer says.

""They're often times searching for an identity, because what the jihadis are actually pushing is a specific narrative, which is: Your people (Muslims) are being oppressed in this place called Syria; your government is doing nothing; we're the only ones who are actually going to help you out,"" said Aki Peritz. ""Why don't you join the fight?""

Richard Barrett of The Soufan Group says many of the teens lack a sense of belonging where they live, and they believe ISIS can give it to them.

""The general picture provided by foreign fighters of their lives in Syria suggests camaraderie, good morale and purposeful activity, all mixed in with a sense of understated heroism, designed to attract their friends as well as to boost their own self-esteem,"" he says.

And ISIS constantly cranks the PR machine, making expert use of slick videos and social media.

Echoing back West

ISIS' global digital reach has terror experts in the United States worried about security at home as well.

There are terrorist groups in Yemen and in Syria with stated ambitions of striking on American soil, but another threat is more probable, says counterterrorism expert Matt Olsen.

""I would say the most likely types of attack is one of these homegrown violent extremists or lone offenders in the United States, and (with) the rise of ISIS and the number of people going to Syria...the likelihood does go up.""

Self-styled attackers like the Boston Marathon bombers could be the result.

The use of the Internet makes terrorists more vulnerable to tracking, but that has become more difficult since Edward Snowden revealed secret U.S. surveillance programs.

Girls' online activities

In Denver, the 17-year-old girl was apparently the instigator of the trip, having planned it for months, two U.S. officials said.

But all three researched the plan online, visiting websites where extremists discuss how to get to Syria. The online activity didn't set off any tripwires the FBI typically uses to flag possible jihadist sympathizers, the officials said.

The FBI is combing all of their communications to see if anyone was helping them. Their parents think ISIS was behind the trip.

Investigators are also not sure the girls had even worked out the final goal for their travel.

As was the case with the Canadian, Couture, the investigation into the travel will probably not lead to charges, especially because the girls are minors, the two U.S. officials said.

On Monday, Sheriff's Deputy Evan Driscoll visited the two girls of Somali descent in their home and had a conversation with them.

""The girls explained that they stole the $2,000 and their passports from their mother,"" he wrote in the runaway report.

They wouldn't tell Driscoll why they flew to Germany.

Officials in 10 states are reporting cases of respiratory illness, some severe enough to send children to hospitals.

In Kansas City, Mo., more than 300 cases of respiratory illnesses were reported last month, according to the state Department of Health and Senior Services. About 15% of the illnesses resulted in children being placed in an intensive care unit, according to a health alert issued Aug. 29.

Ten states have contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for help in investigating enterovirus — Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and Kentucky, according to WXIA-TV.

Enteroviruses, with symptoms similar to an intense cold, hits its peak in September, according to medical officials.

But it is unusual that there have been so many hospitalizations, CNN reports.

The number of hospitalizations reported could be ""just the tip of the iceberg in terms of severe cases,"" Mark Pallansch, director of the CDC's Division of Viral Diseases, told CNN.

Pallansch said the division is looking into the situation.

Cincinnati medical officials admitted a record number of children to a local hospital over the weekend. Although there's been no confirmed cases of the enterovirus at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, officials admitted 540 patients Friday, said Dr. Derek Wheeler, associate chief of staff at the hospital.

The previous record was around 515, Wheeler said.

""We're just seeing the (increased) volumes, we haven't seen (patients) sicker than usual yet,"" he said.

While hospitals from other states have placed restrictions on visitations, Wheeler said there are no plans to do that in Cincinnati.

The virus is similar to what doctors treat during cold and flu season. That means nothing really changes if a child comes down with the rare virus, he said.

A vaccine for EV-D68 isn't available.

""Many infections will be mild and self-limited, requiring only symptomatic treatment,"" the analysis said. ""Some people with several respiratory illness caused by EV-D68 may need to be hospitalized and receive intensive supportive therapy.""

""The virus just runs its course. The illness goes away by itself,"" Reddy said. ""But for kids who may have asthma or may have bad allergies, or have some other underlying medical problem, they're the ones that, potentially, could get more sick.""

She said kids with uncontrolled asthma are at greatest risk for serious illness. Those with no history of breathing problems will recover quickly, Nyquist said.

""Most of the children really do just fine,"" she said. ""That's the scary part — the unpredictability of it.""

Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children in Denver had five children in intensive care and 20 more in the pediatric unit, KUSA-TV reported last week.

""This is the worst I've seen in my time here at Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children,"" Raju Meyeppan told the station. ""We're going to have a pretty busy winter at this institution and throughout the hospitals of Denver.""

Will Cornejo, 13, was among the children in intensive care at Rocky Mountain after he came down with a cold and then woke up Tuesday night with an asthma attack that couldn't be controlled with his medicine albuterol. His mother, Jennifer, called 911 when her son's breathing became shallow, and her son was airlifted to the Denver hospital, she told KUSA.

In Cincinnati, Wheeler said parents can prevent their children from getting the virus by making them wash their hands frequently and drink plenty of fluids.

If they do suspect their child contracted the virus, he suggested parents call their pediatrician first because urgent care facilities will be busy.

Doctors recommend disinfecting school supplies, pens, pencils — even a child's cellphone.

Rescues and narrow escapes

Rainfall totals for the storm will be similar to those in hurricanes Dennis and Floyd in 1999, the National Weather Service's Chris Wamsley said

""The only difference is, back then it was within 14 days,"" he said. With Florence, ""we're looking at the same amount of rainfall in three days.""

One of the rescuers in New Bern was Jason Weinmann, a retired Marine who has a military troop transport vehicle he bought at a government auction.

He picked up 10 people on one run and took them to a shelter. Jennifer Morales, 20, said there was 3 feet of water in her home.

""It was pretty bad. We didn't know where to go,"" she said.

Another woman who was rescued by another group in New Bern told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360˚"" that she and her family thought they would be safe in their brick home and heard the storm had been downgraded from a Category 4.

""About 11:30, 12 (midnight), the water came into the house. It came in slowly but then it just steady, just kept rising,"" Annazette Riley-Cromartie said.

She, her husband and three children went up into the attic for a while, but the winds howled and the family descended to an upper floor bedroom.

As they waited for emergency workers, they heard neighbors calling for help.

Her husband went to see if he could assist them but the water was chest high, she said.

""It's the worst feeling in the world to hear people yelling for help and you can't do anything,"" she said.

Eventually a citizen rescue crew came with a boat.

An area in downtown Wilmington, North Carolina, usually meant for street parking and relaxing on park benches is inundated by water from the swollen Cape Fear River.

Swift-water rescue teams from out of state helped local rescuers evacuate people whenever conditions allowed. One team from Maryland helped with about 40 rescues in New Bern starting Thursday, member Mitchell Rusland said.

In Belhaven, the Pungo River roared into town, crashing up against homes at a waist-high level and higher late Thursday and early Friday, video from Amy Johnson showed.

A terrifying night

In Morehead City, Brooke Kittrell rode out the storm Thursday and Friday with her boyfriend aboard their docked boat, hoping it didn't break loose and slam something.

She succeeded -- staying awake all night, retying broken dock lines in howling winds. But there were times she thought they wouldn't survive, she told CNN.

A boat is wedged in trees Friday in Oriental, North Carolina, in a photo from Angie Propst.

""I honestly cried,"" Kittrell said. ""I was born and raised here and been through every storm the last 30 years, but this one seems to be doing more damage than we expected.""

By Friday morning, the shore was flooded, and buildings were damaged, in video she put up on Facebook.

In Jacksonville, North Carolina, city officials posted photos of toppled gas pumps and a downed trees early Friday , warning residents to take shelter and avoid roadways.

Officials in several states have declared states of emergency, including in the Carolinas, Georgia, Virginia and Maryland, where coastal areas are still recovering from summer storms.

High winds and a storm surge from then-Hurricane Florence hit Swansboro, North Carolina, on Friday.

Florence is one of four named storms in the Atlantic. According to the National Hurricane Center, the storm will travel through upstate South Carolina, be downgraded to a tropical depression, then turn north toward the Ohio Valley.

As it moves near Ohio and West Virginia, it will become a remnant low. Then it will swing to the northeast in the middle of next week on a path to the Atlantic Ocean near Nova Scotia, where it will be an extratropical low with gale-force winds.",www.cnn.com,left,7u7escE0fszhnH1C

Stormy Daniels

Attacks on Maxine Waters and Omarosa Manigault Newman

Mika Brzezinski

Trump made insulting comments about MSNBC personalities Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough on Twitter in June 2017, calling Brzezinski ""crazy"" and claiming she was ""bleeding badly from a face-lift"" a few months ago.

That slam was not his first attack on Brzezinski.

Attacking other women

There are a host of other times Trump publicly criticized women's appearance, both before and during his presidential campaign.

Before he entered politics, he rated women's appearance on Howard Stern's radio show from 1997 to 2008.

During the campaign, he appeared to insult then-competitor Carly Fiorina, saying in an interview with Rolling Stone, ""Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!""

Trump later claimed he was talking about her persona and not her appearance, but Fiorina made it clear at the next debate that she wasn't buying it, saying flatly, ""Women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.""

Also during the presidential campaign, Trump retweeted a post that had side by side a photo of his wife, Melania Trump, and an unflattering photo of Heidi Cruz, the wife of his then-competitor Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. The photo was captioned, ""The images are worth a thousand words.""

Asked about the retweet by CNN's Anderson Cooper during a town hall event in Wisconsin, Trump responded, ""I thought it was a nice picture of Heidi. I thought it was fine.""

For weeks , I have been calling upon the administration to take a robust , proactive approach to prevent Ebola from becoming a public health crisis here in the United States . These steps include appointing a single , accountable official to coordinate with the many agencies tasked with containing the Ebola epidemic , and moving from passive to active screening at U.S. ports of entry for all passengers traveling from countries with known outbreaks of Ebola .

(CNN) -- With the news that a Liberian citizen has been diagnosed with Ebola on U.S. soil, the Obama administration must finally act to ensure that the disease does not spread further.

For weeks, I have been calling upon the administration to take a robust, proactive approach to prevent Ebola from becoming a public health crisis here in the United States. These steps include appointing a single, accountable official to coordinate with the many agencies tasked with containing the Ebola epidemic, and moving from passive to active screening at U.S. ports of entry for all passengers traveling from countries with known outbreaks of Ebola.

Ebola prompts talk of enhanced screening

These common sense steps, while not foolproof, would go far in preventing an outbreak of Ebola and assuring the American people that their leaders are not taking the threat of this disease for granted.

The recent case of Ebola in Dallas is instructive. Currently, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), under the direction of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), engages in ""passive"" screening for Ebola. This means that CBP only stops travelers who are showing symptoms of Ebola. Carriers of Ebola who are not yet showing symptoms could enter the country without so much as a question about their potential contact with the disease.

Instead, we rely on government officials from West Africa to ask those kinds of questions at the point of departure. If they fail to do so or if the person lies on their exit form, there is nothing to stop infected individuals from traveling to the United States.

Can you catch Ebola on a plane?

This must change. Moving from passive to active screening would give the CBP the power to more thoroughly review international passengers before they are allowed into the United States.

Just as travelers are now asked where they have been, whether they are bringing in fruits or vegetables or have been in contact with livestock, travelers from West Africa would be asked if they were in contact with someone with Ebola, someone displaying symptoms of Ebola, or if they have any symptoms of Ebola. If the answer is yes or suspicions are raised, the passenger would be referred to CDC officials for additional questioning, medical screening and quarantine, if necessary.

CDC chief: U.S. can stop Ebola in its tracks

This particular patient in Dallas apparently did have contact with someone with Ebola and might well have been identified by active screening. This case proves that in today's global society, great distance will not prevent a disease like Ebola from spreading from Africa to the United States. It is only a few hours and a plane flight away. Now we need to think about the next case, not the last one, and what we can do to ensure that no more Americans are exposed unwittingly to this disease.

There's no reason to panic, but there's no reason to be complacent, either. President Obama told the American people that it was ""unlikely"" Ebola would reach our shores. We are now told that it is unlikely that Ebola will spread. But our government should not play the odds or rely on luck when it comes to the health and welfare of the American people.

This administration has a history of allowing manageable situations to spiral out of control before taking action. We can't be reactive when it comes to this disease. The administration must lead, and it must take proactive steps to ensure that the initial case of Ebola in the United States remains an isolated incident.

Should we be concerned?

The paramedics who took the patient to the hospital have been isolated, the chief of staff for Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings told CNN. They have not shown symptoms of the disease so far.

The ambulance that carried the patient -- ambulance No. 37 -- was in use for two days after the transport but was properly decontaminated, said Dallas city spokeswoman Sana Syed.

Frieden said the patient himself had a handful of contacts with people after he fell ill and before he was isolated -- a period of about four days.

A CDC team arrived in Texas to investigate the people who came in contact with the man. Those people will be monitored for 21 days to see if they develop symptoms. If they do, they'll be isolated.

""It is certainly possible that someone who had contact with this individual could develop Ebola in the coming weeks,"" Frieden said. ""But there is no doubt in my mind that we will stop it here.""

How is this not concerning?

Although there's no vaccine and no cure, the one real advantage we have with Ebola is that doctors know how to control it.

Ebola isn't ""some mystical pathogen (with) some bizarre mode of transmission,"" said Bruce Ribner , director of Emory University Hospital's Infectious Disease Unit.

And we have the resources to contain it.

How are we so confident?

For starters, the United States has the luxury of better health care compared to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

The U.S. has facilities that can ""do the kind of isolation that apparently is very difficult to do within the health care infrastructure in the African countries that we are talking about,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health.

Secondly, remember Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol? The doctor and the American missionary were infected in Liberia, brought to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, placed in isolation units, treated and discharged.

They were the first humans with Ebola to ever arrive in the United States. And they are now fine.",www.cnn.com,left,RC6eWmATp3uStf71

Nikki Haley poked at President Donald Trump, Kanye West and attorney general Jeff Sessions Thursday night, and, as an Indian-American woman, sympathized with Elizabeth Warren's recent DNA test.

The outgoing U.S.ambassador to the United Nations unleashed her barbs at the annual white-tie Al Smith dinner in New York City, where speakers are expected to zing political figures — including themselves.

The 46-year-old former governor of South Carolina said the Catholic charity invited her because they wanted ""to spice things up"" at this year's dinner, after a ""choir boy"" appearance last year by House Speaker Paul Ryan.

""I get it. You wanted an Indian woman, but Elizabeth Warren failed her DNA test,"" Haley joked.

""Actually, when the President found out that I was Indian-American, he asked if I was from the same tribe as Elizabeth Warren,"" she added.

Warren, who has been pummeled by Trump for years as ""Pocahontas"" over her claims of Native American heritage, this week released the findings of a DNA test backing up her claims, but opening herself up to jokes.

Haley, a Republican star with possible presidential ambitions, said Trump, who spoke at the dinner two years ago, called to offer her some advice for her remarks.

“Just brag about my accomplishments,” she said he recommended. “It really killed at the U.N., I’ve got to tell you.”

While Haley did not offer any new insights into her unexpected decision to step down as U.N. ambassador, she did complain about fake news over the move, including one that said rapper Kanye West had been sworn in as her replacement. “Oh wait,"" she quipped, ""that could really happen.”

Returning to her ethnic roots, Haley said people often wonder if she felt different or isolated as an Indian-American growing up in rural South Carolina. ""Actually,"" she said, ""there was a benefit. It totally prepared me for being a Republican in New York.""

Jabs aside, Haley also took advantage of the high-profile moment to offer her own assessment of the state of U.S. politics, noting that the ""toxic political environment"" has prompted politicians in both parties to ""describe their opponents as enemies or evil.""

""In America, our political opponents are not evil,"" Haley said.

Among her barbs:

♦ ""People ask me all the time what they should call me — governor, ambassador, Nikki. You can call me anything, just don't call me anonymous.""

♦ ""I saw Jeff Sessions earlier today — not in New York. I saw him on LinkedIn looking for a job. Actually, we both were.""

♦ ""I saw when recently (President Barack Obama) said that we're not supposed to use the FBI or the Justice Department to punish political enemies. Comey, McCabe and Strzok said, now you tell us! Turns out what President Obama meant to say — 'That's what we use the IRS for.'""

♦ ""The President got really mad about Woodward's book, really mad. The book compared him to a fifth grader. A lot of Democrats seized on that, until they realized, they got beat by a fifth grader.""

Haley spoke to a high-powered crowd of some 700 people that included Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, CBS anchor Jeff Glor and Wall Street financier Stephen Schwarzman. It was hosted by Cardinal Timothy Dolan.

The dinner, now in its seventh-decade, raised almost $4 million for the Catholic children's charities this year.

Bush became president after serving two terms as vice-president to Ronald Reagan, but he suffered the ignominy of becoming a single-term president - defeated by Bill Clinton in the 1992 election amid a weakening economy.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that ""in navigating a peaceful end to the Cold War he made the world a safer place for generations to come""

Former UK PM John Major said he was ""privileged to have worked"" with George HW Bush

Queen Elizabeth said he was ""a great friend and ally"" of the United Kingdom

Bill Clinton said he and Hillary gave ""thanks for his great long life of service, love and friendship"", adding: ""I am grateful for every minute I spent with him and will always hold our friendship as one of my life's greatest gifts""

Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev hailed Bush's contribution to ending the Cold War and reducing nuclear weapons. Both men signed the first Start treaty in 1991, which led to big cuts in long-range nuclear weapons. ""He was a genuine partner,"" Mr Gorbachev said.

When will the funeral take place?

While the White House said Wednesday would be a day of mourning, its statement did not make clear whether the funeral was to be held on the same day.

Announcing Mr Trump's attendance, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckerbee Sanders released a statement saying: ""A state funeral is being arranged with all of the accompanying support and honours.""

It will take place at the National Cathedral in Washington.

A lying in state in Washington is thought likely, followed by burial at the presidential library in Texas alongside Barbara Bush.

The last state funeral for a former president was that of Gerald Ford, which began on 30 December 2006 with a lying in state and service at the US Capitol.

Further services were held at the Washington National Cathedral on 2 January 2007 and the following day in Grand Rapids, Michigan, his boyhood home.

Aftershocks were expected to continue for several weeks , though State Geologist John Parrish told the Associated Press that they would decrease in magnitude and it was unlikely that there would be a large follow-up earthquake . Still , he warned people to be careful because buildings that were damaged by the quake were now more susceptible to collapse from aftershocks .
The U.S. Geological Survey says the tremor struck just before 3:30 a.m. Sunday local time about 10 miles northwest of American Canyon , which is about 6 miles southwest of Napa .
Of the 172 patients admitted to Queen of the Valley Medical Center in Napa , 13 were admitted to the hospital with broken bones and respiratory or cardiac conditions , while the rest were treated and released for less severe injuries , hospital president Walt Mickens said at a news conference Sunday evening .
Only one patient remains in the hospital in critical condition while another , a 13-year-old boy , was airlifted to another trauma center in critical condition after pieces of the fireplace at his home collapsed onto him , Mickens said . The boy is now listed in serious condition .
The most common injuries were from household items falling off of walls or shelves onto people or from those who stepped on debris in their homes , he said .
Mickens announced earlier Sunday that 120 people had been treated at the hospital , but that number rose as dozens of people got injured while cleaning up after the quake , he said .
Napa City Manager Mike Parness said the city declared a local emergency at 8:59 a.m. California time , which is the first step in getting more help from the state .
Pacific Gas & Electric said that 2,200 customers were without power as of late Sunday evening and said the utility hoped to have power restored to all customers by Monday morning . A spokesman said that approximately 70,000 customers in Sonoma and Napa counties lost power during the earthquake .
Mark Ghilarducci , director of the California Governor 's Office of Emergency Services , said about 90 to 100 homes were deemed not habitable . He said the next step was to continue damage assessments and get a cost estimate for potential federal assistance .
Officials said they were still assessing buildings in the area .
A Red Cross evacuation center was set up at a high school , and crews were assessing damage to homes and roadways .
Authorities said Sunday evening that all bridges responded well to the earthquake .
John Callahan of the Napa City Fire Department said at one point Sunday there were a half-dozen multiple structure fires . One was at a mobile home park where four mobile homes have been destroyed by fire , and two others suffered major damage .
Public Works Director Jack LaRochelle assured residents the water has not been contaminated .
“ The water is safe to drink , ” he said . LaRochelle said that more than 60 water mains have been damaged ; 20 have been turned off . He said none of the larger transmission lines had been damaged .
Napa Fire Chief Mike Randolph said firefighters were continuing to assess the damage to buildings in the downtown area , and the department was busy answering more than 100 calls reporting the smell of natural gas . That 's `` our primary attention right now , '' he said .
A number of buildings are damaged during the quake , but no number on how many was reported .
The city ’ s 911 emergency call system was maxed out , according to Napa Police Department operations captain Steve Potter , but he said there have been no reports of major disturbances . “ We have relative calm for this magnitude of an earthquake , ” he said .
Jennifer Jones Lee , who lives in the earthquake area , told Fox News the tremor “ felt like someone just picked up the house , shook it for a while , then dropped it . It was incredibly violent . ”
Arik Housley , who owns two grocery stores in the area , said he was awakened at about 3:30 a.m. by the shaking . “ It was very jolting and probably went for 20 seconds . . . it was shaking pretty good , ” said Housley , whose brother is Fox News senior correspondent Adam Housley .
Arik Housley said he passed a mobile home park where multiple fires could be seen as he drove to one of his stores to assess the damage . Housley said the shelving in his store had moved 2 feet to 3 feet from the wall , and much of his inventory had fallen to the floor , including $ 200 bottles of wine . Many merchants in the area forgo earthquake insurance because it ’ s too expensive , he said . A quake about 14 years ago resulted in about $ 30,000 in damage , he told Fox News , and speculated the current damage would be in excess of $ 100,000 .
`` There 's collapses , fires , '' said Napa Fire Capt . Doug Bridewell , standing in front of large pieces of masonry that broke loose from a turn-of-the-century office building where a fire had just been extinguished . `` That 's the worst shaking I 've ever been in . ''
Bridewell said he had to climb over fallen furniture in his own home to check on his family before reporting to duty .
The tremor set off car alarms and had residents of neighboring Sonoma County running out of their houses in the middle of night .
The USGS says the depth of the earthquake was just less than 7 miles , and numerous small aftershocks have occurred in the Napa wine country .
Aftershocks were expected to continue for several weeks , though State Geologist John Parrish said they would decrease in magnitude and it was unlikely that there would be a large follow-up earthquake . Still , he warned people to be careful because buildings that were damaged by the quake were now more susceptible to collapse from aftershocks .
“ There ’ s fires , debris all over the streets , everywhere , ” Napa resident Karen Hunt earlier told “ Fox & Friends . ”
Hunt said her husband , who is an engineer , shut off the gas line to their home to guard against explosions , then went to neighbors ’ homes to do the same .
“ Right now we ’ re just waiting for the aftershocks , ” she said . She said she had not felt any , but reportedly there have been two , one at magnitude 2.5 .
Hunt has said she has felt other earthquakes , but “ this is way on top of anything I ’ ve ever felt . ”
Hunt , who has lived in Napa since 1996 , owns a winery . She said she heard from her partner that her 2011 and 2012 vintages had been destroyed .
Sunday 's quake was felt widely throughout the region . People reported feeling it more than 200 miles south of Napa and as far east as the Nevada border . Amtrak suspended its train service through the Bay Area so tracks could be inspected .
California Highway Patrol Officer Kevin Bartlett said cracks and damage to pavement closed the westbound Interstate 80 connector to westbound State Route 37 in Vallejo and westbound State Route 37 at the Sonoma off ramp . He said there had n't been reports of injuries or people stranded in their cars , but there were numerous cases of flat tires from motorists driving over damaged roads .
Thousands of small earthquakes occur in California each year , providing scientists with clear indications of places where faults cut the Earth 's crust .

“ If they ’ d instituted the travel ban when Alan Grayson , of all people , demanded it , [ Duncan ] wouldn ’ t be here , ” said Mark Krikorian , executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies , who said a ban could have prevented the scrambling health officials are now doing to try to track Mr. Duncan ’ s movements and see whom he might have infected .

Mr. Krikorian said the decision to restrict travel should come from President Obama himself , but said top U.S. officials appear reluctant to use the country ’ s borders as a security mechanism to keep potential bad actors out .
Mr. Krikorian raised the notion of “ Ebola tourism , ” in which someone who fears he or she has come into contact with an infected person quickly schedules a trip to the U.S. , where top-notch care is available .

Screening out health risks was long a part of the U.S. immigration system , dating back to the Immigration Act of 1891 , which excluded “ persons suffering from a loathsome or a dangerous contagious disease . ”
Today , the law gives the administration the power to refuse entry to foreigners with a “ communicable disease of public health significance. ” A decade-old executive order specifically lists Ebola as one of those diseases with the potential to cause a pandemic .
But experts question whether it ’ s possible , or even appropriate , to try to screen out infected persons at the border .
Relying on screening at airports is difficult , said Laurie Garrett , senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations , who said during the previous SARS and swine flu outbreaks that uninfected travelers were quarantined while infected travelers got through .
“ I think the idea that you can stop a virus at the airport or before it gets on an airplane is as much an antique as the notion that Ellis Island will screen out all disease among the immigrants , ” she told reporters .

Homeland Security officials said they have well-tested procedures that have shown “ positive results ” in the past in minimizing risks to public health .
U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its personnel are trained to observe and question passengers , looking for “ general overt signs of illnesses. ” The agency has also posted signs at airport inspection areas and has been distributing a fact sheet to travelers entering the U.S. from affected countries , telling them the signs to watch for if they become sick .
International SOS , a travel security firm , lists more than a dozen countries that have imposed some sort of ban , ranging from closure of land borders to outright prohibitions on entry for anyone that has visited an infected country in the previous weeks .
In the U.S. , the team responding to Mr. Duncan ’ s case in Dallas has faced questions over its handling — including having released the patient after a first visit .
Now officials have ordered the woman Mr. Duncan was staying with , her child and two of her nephews to remain quarantined at home . And officials finally sent a contractor to collect and dispose of the sheets soaked with Mr. Duncan ’ s sweat , which the woman complained had been left at the house for days .
Five school-age children are being monitored at home because they interacted with Mr. Duncan prior to his hospitalization on Sunday . The revelation spooked parents of fellow schoolchildren , some of whom kept their own children home .
Mike Miles , superintendent of the Dallas Independent School District , said the children will be hooked into a program that lets them continue their education at home .
While Mr. Duncan is one of just a handful of Ebola patients in the U.S. — the others were diagnosed overseas and brought back here on a special plane — the danger of an outbreak has raised all manner of public health questions .
One analysis from 2013 , published by the Global Policy Journal , even raised the question of whether al Qaeda-inspired terrorists in West Africa could harness the Ebola virus as a weapon .
“ The increase in natural outbreaks in the region , coupled with a possibility of a terrorist group recruiting experts to acquire the virus and to prepare it to use as a bioweapon , should lead policymakers to consider the risk of a deliberate outbreak , ” Amanda M. Teckman , an administrative assistant at Seton Hall University , who earned her master ’ s degree from the university ’ s school of diplomacy and international relations , said in the analysis .
“ This prospect is worthy of consideration , particularly in East Africa due to the history of terrorist attacks by different groups in the area ; the potential for these groups to obtain Ebola in the field ; the lack of political capacity in the region and global will to develop a vaccine ; and the pathogen ’ s natural occurrence in the region , ” Ms. Teckman wrote .","The first case of Ebola diagnosed within the U.S. is prompting calls for heavy travel restrictions between the U.S. and those West African countries hardest hit by the outbreak — and one advocate is even warning against the possibility of “Ebola tourism” by patients seeking better care here.

International SOS, a travel security firm, lists more than a dozen countries that have imposed some sort of ban, ranging from closure of land borders to outright prohibitions on entry for anyone that has visited an infected country in the previous weeks.

In the U.S., the team responding to Mr. Duncan’s case in Dallas has faced questions over its handling — including having released the patient after a first visit.

Now officials have ordered the woman Mr. Duncan was staying with, her child and two of her nephews to remain quarantined at home. And officials finally sent a contractor to collect and dispose of the sheets soaked with Mr. Duncan’s sweat, which the woman complained had been left at the house for days.

Five school-age children are being monitored at home because they interacted with Mr. Duncan prior to his hospitalization on Sunday. The revelation spooked parents of fellow schoolchildren, some of whom kept their own children home.

Mike Miles, superintendent of the Dallas Independent School District, said the children will be hooked into a program that lets them continue their education at home.

While Mr. Duncan is one of just a handful of Ebola patients in the U.S. — the others were diagnosed overseas and brought back here on a special plane — the danger of an outbreak has raised all manner of public health questions.

One analysis from 2013, published by the Global Policy Journal, even raised the question of whether al Qaeda-inspired terrorists in West Africa could harness the Ebola virus as a weapon.

“The increase in natural outbreaks in the region, coupled with a possibility of a terrorist group recruiting experts to acquire the virus and to prepare it to use as a bioweapon, should lead policymakers to consider the risk of a deliberate outbreak,” Amanda M. Teckman, an administrative assistant at Seton Hall University, who earned her master’s degree from the university’s school of diplomacy and international relations, said in the analysis.

“This prospect is worthy of consideration, particularly in East Africa due to the history of terrorist attacks by different groups in the area; the potential for these groups to obtain Ebola in the field; the lack of political capacity in the region and global will to develop a vaccine; and the pathogen’s natural occurrence in the region,” Ms. Teckman wrote.

In delivering the opinion of the court , Judge Ann Claire Williams said the school district failed to provide any evidence of how the preliminary injunction would harm the school or any of its students or parents .
“ The harms identified by the School District are all speculative and based upon conjecture , whereas the harms to Ash are well‐documented and supported by the record , ” she said .
In the 35-page opinion , Williams said a policy that requires an individual to use a bathroom that does not conform with his or her gender identity punishes that individual for his or her gender non‐conformance , which in turn violates Title IX anti-discrimination laws .
“ The School District ’ s policy also subjects Ash , as a transgender student , to different rules , sanctions , and treatment than non‐transgender students , in violation of Title IX , ” she said .
Though the school created a separate bathroom for only Whitaker to use , Williams said that only “ exacerbated the harm . ”
“ This action further stigmatized Ash , indicating that he was ‘ different ’ because he was a transgender boy , ” she wrote .

The Transgender Law Center said this is the first federal appeals court to find conclusively that a transgender student has the right to be treated in accordance with the student ’ s gender identity at school under both Title IX and the Constitution .
The group claims it is also the first decision to reach that conclusion without reliance on the Obama administration ’ s guidance on schools ’ Title IX obligations to transgender students , which the Trump administration rescinded in February .
The Supreme Court in March tossed out a ruling that allowed Gavin Grimm , a transgender boy in Virginia , to use the bathroom he chooses and ordered a lower court to reconsider the case in light of that new guidance .

The Supreme Court in March tossed out a ruling that allowed Gavin Grimm, a transgender boy in Virginia, to use the bathroom he chooses and ordered a lower court to reconsider the case in light of that new guidance.

The justices had planned to hear arguments in the case before Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsMedill dean 'deeply troubled by the vicious bullying and badgering' of student journalists Trump has considered firing official who reported whistleblower complaint to Congress: report Northwestern student paper apologizes for coverage of 'traumatic' Jeff Sessions event MORE and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos rescinded the Obama-era guidance that said schools should allow transgender students to use the bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity, claiming those rights were covered federal anti-discrimination laws addressing “sex.”

In withdrawing that guidance, the Trump administration said the Obama administration failed to ""explain how the position is consistent with the express language of Title IX"" but didn't make their own case for whether Title IX applies.",www.thehill.com,center,dI3M0tfKq9nU22tv

( ███ ) - Search teams have recovered remains of 42 people killed by a fierce wildfire that largely incinerated the town of Paradise in northern California , marking the greatest loss of life from a wild land blaze in state history , authorities said on Monday .
The latest death toll , up from 29 tallied over the weekend , was announced by Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea at an evening news conference in the nearby city of Chico after authorities found the bodies of 13 more victims of the devastating blaze dubbed the Camp Fire .
The fire already ranked as the most destructive on record in California in terms of property losses , having consumed more than 7,100 homes and other structures since igniting on Thursday in Butte County ’ s Sierra foothills , about 175 miles ( 280 km ) north of San Francisco .
Honea said 228 people were officially listed as missing in the disaster , but added that his office had received requests to check on the wellbeing of more than 1,500 people who had not been heard from by loved ones . Of those cases , 231 individuals had turned up safe , he said .

The bulk of the destruction and loss of life occurred in and around the town of Paradise , where flames reduced most of the buildings to ash and rubble on Thursday night , just hours after the blaze erupted . Some 52,000 people remained under evacuation orders , the sheriff said .
The 42 confirmed fatalities marked the highest death toll in history from a single California wildfire , Honea said , far surpassing the previous record of 29 lives lost in 1933 from the Griffith Park blaze in Los Angeles .
Authorities reported two more people perished over the weekend in a separate blaze , dubbed the Woolsey Fire , that has destroyed 435 structures and displaced some 200,000 people in the mountains and foothills near Southern California ’ s Malibu coast , west of Los Angeles .

The presidential election was clearly a dominant topic of interest , but stories on culture , climate change , and how to be a family in a divisive and sometimes dangerous time in the world also drew avid readership .
Here 's a selection of some of the most popular opinion pieces of 2016 . The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors .
`` There were nods to Michael Jackson , to Black Greek step shows , to Malcolm X and a salute to the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Black Panthers . For a minute , watching Beyonce and those strong black women sporting black berets and big afros march out onto the field , I forgot I was watching a Super Bowl performance . For the first time I felt like I was n't just a spectator of the game but that the game had become a part of my black experience in America . With just a few lyrics , Beyonce connected with black women everywhere . Her performance became personal . ''
Roxanne Jones , a founding editor of ESPN Magazine and former vice president at ESPN , has worked as a producer and as a reporter at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer .
`` Justice David Souter , Scalia 's longtime colleague on the court , had just announced his retirement , creating a vacancy for President Obama to fill . Scalia figured that as senior adviser to the new president , I might have some influence on the decision -- or at least enough to pass along a message .
' I have no illusions that your man will nominate someone who shares my orientation , ' said Scalia , then in his 23rd year as the court 's leading and most provocative conservative voice . 'But I hope he sends us someone smart . '
A little taken aback that he was engaging me on the subject , I searched for the right answer , and lamely offered one that signaled my slight discomfort with the topic . ' I 'm sure he will , Justice Scalia . '
He was n't done . Leaning forward , as if to share a confidential thought , he tried again .
'Let me put a finer point on it , ' the justice said , in a lower , purposeful tone of voice , his eyes fixed on mine . ' I hope he sends us Elena Kagan . ' ''
David Axelrod is CNN 's senior political commentator and host of the podcast `` The Axe Files. `` He was senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chief strategist for the 2008 and 2012 Obama campaigns .
`` Her achievements in Congress and at the State Department ca n't be denied , though many will try . Do n't forget her courageous China speech on the rights of women , her aggressive work on climate change and her skill as a senator in guiding the Children 's Health Insurance Program through Congress . She helped to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas during a tense moment in Israel . I think of her successes in forging alliances in South America , Africa and Asia , and her part in establishing tough sanctions against Iran . That 's only the beginning .
And yet people hate her . Her negative ratings , in fact , have been shockingly high for someone this close to the nomination of her party . Indeed , one of the most frequently posed questions to the candidate herself is some version of 'Why do n't they like you ? '
Of course , Republicans have known for a long time that Hillary Clinton is an unusually strong candidate , and this terrifies them . So they have seized on talking points like Benghazi ( for which she bears little or no responsibility ) and her email scandal . On the latter , even columnist Ruth Marcus -- certainly no fan of Clinton 's -- recently wrote in The Washington Post that 'there is no clear evidence that Clinton knew ( or even should have known ) that the material in her emails was classified . ' As we 've seen , neither Benghazi nor the email trouble are likely to put off Democratic voters , who regard them as Republican talking points . ''
Danny Cevallos : Abby Wambach 's arrest for a crime that makes no sense
`` Why ? Why do people who otherwise would never commit a crime somehow get arrested for drunken driving ? Sure , it 's a question of personal responsibility , but why is it so much easier for upstanding citizens to refrain from all other crimes , except DUI ?
It 's the mixed signals . Most other criminal activity unambiguously violates our social norms . There 's no 'gray area ' when it comes to smoking meth at a cocktail party , for example . Most crimes are also social faux pas , such that you would neither engage in , nor tolerate the behavior from a peer .
With DUIs , however , there are mixed messages . Most people are surprised to learn that it 's not actually illegal to drink and drive . Technically , it 's only illegal to drive while 'impaired ' by alcohol . What does 'impaired ' mean ? ''
`` Fat is a floating signifier . It can attach to anyone at any moment . Ask Amy .
But why do we care what anyone weighs ? Well , the stakes are high when being thin or fat determines whether you 'll be loved , respected , hired , promoted , dated , married , able to travel , buy clothes , see people who look like you in mainstream media , get unbiased medical care , and count as a person -- or not .

The presidential election was clearly a dominant topic of interest, but stories on culture, climate change, and how to be a family in a divisive and sometimes dangerous time in the world also drew avid readership.

Here's a selection of some of the most popular opinion pieces of 2016. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors.

Roxanne Jones: Beyonce gets Super Bowl show right

February 9

""There were nods to Michael Jackson, to Black Greek step shows, to Malcolm X and a salute to the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Black Panthers. For a minute, watching Beyonce and those strong black women sporting black berets and big afros march out onto the field, I forgot I was watching a Super Bowl performance. For the first time I felt like I wasn't just a spectator of the game but that the game had become a part of my black experience in America. With just a few lyrics, Beyonce connected with black women everywhere. Her performance became personal.""

David Axelrod: A surprising request from Justice Scalia

February 14

""Justice David Souter, Scalia's longtime colleague on the court, had just announced his retirement, creating a vacancy for President Obama to fill. Scalia figured that as senior adviser to the new president, I might have some influence on the decision -- or at least enough to pass along a message.

'I have no illusions that your man will nominate someone who shares my orientation,' said Scalia, then in his 23rd year as the court's leading and most provocative conservative voice. 'But I hope he sends us someone smart.'

A little taken aback that he was engaging me on the subject, I searched for the right answer, and lamely offered one that signaled my slight discomfort with the topic. 'I'm sure he will, Justice Scalia.'

He wasn't done. Leaning forward, as if to share a confidential thought, he tried again.

'Let me put a finer point on it,' the justice said, in a lower, purposeful tone of voice, his eyes fixed on mine. 'I hope he sends us Elena Kagan.'""

Jay Parini: Why the hate for Hillary Clinton?

Jay Parini

March 20

""Her achievements in Congress and at the State Department can't be denied, though many will try. Don't forget her courageous China speech on the rights of women, her aggressive work on climate change and her skill as a senator in guiding the Children's Health Insurance Program through Congress. She helped to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas during a tense moment in Israel. I think of her successes in forging alliances in South America, Africa and Asia, and her part in establishing tough sanctions against Iran. That's only the beginning.

And yet people hate her. Her negative ratings, in fact, have been shockingly high for someone this close to the nomination of her party. Indeed, one of the most frequently posed questions to the candidate herself is some version of 'Why don't they like you?'

Of course, Republicans have known for a long time that Hillary Clinton is an unusually strong candidate, and this terrifies them. So they have seized on talking points like Benghazi (for which she bears little or no responsibility) and her email scandal. On the latter, even columnist Ruth Marcus -- certainly no fan of Clinton's -- recently wrote in The Washington Post that 'there is no clear evidence that Clinton knew (or even should have known) that the material in her emails was classified.' As we've seen, neither Benghazi nor the email trouble are likely to put off Democratic voters, who regard them as Republican talking points.""

Danny Cevallos: Abby Wambach's arrest for a crime that makes no sense

Danny Cevallos

April 4

""Why? Why do people who otherwise would never commit a crime somehow get arrested for drunken driving? Sure, it's a question of personal responsibility, but why is it so much easier for upstanding citizens to refrain from all other crimes, except DUI?

It's the mixed signals. Most other criminal activity unambiguously violates our social norms. There's no 'gray area' when it comes to smoking meth at a cocktail party, for example. Most crimes are also social faux pas, such that you would neither engage in, nor tolerate the behavior from a peer.

With DUIs, however, there are mixed messages. Most people are surprised to learn that it's not actually illegal to drink and drive. Technically, it's only illegal to drive while 'impaired' by alcohol. What does 'impaired' mean?""

On Tuesday , the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Kenosha Unified School District in Wisconsin violated the rights of a trans student , Ash Whitaker , when it refused to let him use the boys ’ bathroom .
According to the court , Whitaker is likely to win upon a full review of the case ( instead of the current review of a lower court ’ s preliminary injunction ) on his claim that the school ’ s actions violated Title IX , a federal law that prohibits discrimination in schools based on sex , and the Equal Protections Clause of the 14th Amendment . So it upheld a lower court ’ s injunction forcing the school to let Whitaker use the bathroom that aligns with his gender identity .
In the decision , a three-judge panel from the Seventh Circuit Court concluded that the school district “ has failed to provide any evidence of how the preliminary injunction will harm it , or any of its students or parents ” — a rebuke of the prevalent myth that letting trans people use the bathroom for their gender identity will hurt others .
The ruling has big implications : If existing federal law and the 14th Amendment shield trans people from discrimination , then it ’ s not just Whitaker ’ s rights that are protected here , but all trans students ’ . And if bans against sex discrimination in particular apply to trans people , then it ’ s not just students ’ rights that are protected , but all trans people who face discrimination in other settings where sex discrimination is banned — so not just schools , but the workplace and housing as well .
“ This powerful decision — another in a growing list of rulings affirming the constitutional rights of transgender people — helps Ash and tens of thousands of students like him get the same opportunity to learn as any other student , ” National Center for Transgender Equality executive director Mara Keisling said in a statement . “ It recognizes that fully respecting and including transgender students like Ash Whitaker is legally and morally the right thing to do , and that discrimination against these young people because of who they are is cruel , wrong and illegal . ”
The ruling comes on the heels of similar court battles , particularly that of Gavin Grimm in Virginia . That case briefly rose to the US Supreme Court , which LGBTQ advocates hoped would decide the legal issue — of whether Title IX really applies to trans people . But since the Trump administration rescinded a legal guidance protecting trans people that was attached to Grimm ’ s situation , the court punted on the case , sending it back down to the lower courts .
The Seventh Circuit Court ’ s case does not have the limitation of being attached to the guidance or any other regulation that the Trump administration could rescind . Instead , it poses the straight question : Are trans people protected under federal law ? If other courts agree with the Seventh Circuit Court , that could reshape the face of civil rights laws in America — and help fill a void that ’ s left trans people legally unprotected from discrimination across most of the US .
Under most states ’ laws and federal law , trans people aren ’ t explicitly protected from discrimination in the workplace , housing , public accommodations , and schools . This means that a person can be fired from a job , evicted from a home , kicked out of a business , or denied the correct bathroom facility just because an employer , landlord , business owner , or school principal doesn ’ t approve of the person ’ s gender identity .
LGBTQ advocates argue , however , that federal civil rights law should already shield trans people from discrimination .
The argument : Discrimination against someone based on their gender identity is fundamentally rooted in sex-based expectations . For example , if someone discriminates against a trans woman , that ’ s largely based on the expectation that a person designated male at birth should identify as a man — a belief built on an idea of what a person of a certain sex assigned at birth should be like . So since federal civil rights laws , such as Title IX , ban sex discrimination in the workplace , housing , and schools , they should ban discrimination against trans people in these settings as well .
This isn ’ t just a wild interpretation by LGBTQ advocates ; there ’ s legal precedent for it . Joshua Block , an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who worked on Grimm ’ s case , cited a 1998 Supreme Court case , Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services Inc. , in which the Court unanimously agreed that bans on sex discrimination prohibit same-sex sexual harassment . Same-sex sexual harassment was not something the authors of federal civil rights laws considered , but it ’ s something , the Supreme Court said , that a plain reading of the law protects .
“ Oncale says that ’ s irrelevant whether [ Congress ] contemplated it , ” Block previously told me . “ That ’ s not how laws work . This is literal sex discrimination . Whether or not that ’ s what Congress was focused on doesn ’ t make it any less a type of discrimination covered by the statute . ”
Seventh Circuit Judge Ann Claire Williams embraced this view in her ruling on Tuesday : “ A policy that requires an individual to use a bathroom that does not conform with his or her gender identity punishes that individual for his or her gender non‐conformance , which in turn violates Title IX . ”
But the court went even further — arguing that the Kenosha Unified School District ’ s actions violated the 14th Amendment . The school district claimed that it treats all boys and girls equally — meaning it forces them all to use certain bathrooms based on the sex they were assigned at birth instead of their gender identity . But Williams ruled that this is “ untrue , ” adding , “ Rather , the School District treats transgender students like Ash , who fail to conform to the sex‐based stereotypes associated with their assigned sex at birth , differently . ”
Anti-trans bathroom policies harm trans people — and are based on a myth
Anti-trans policies like the Kenosha Unified School District ’ s do real harm to trans students . Forcing trans people to use the bathroom that doesn ’ t align with their gender identity acts as a reminder that as far as society has come on some LGBTQ issues , it ’ s still not completely willing to accept trans people and their identities — even if trans people pose no danger to anyone else .
Indeed , this is exactly the argument that the Seventh Circuit Court seemingly sided with . The court ’ s ruling stated :
[ Whitaker ] asserted that the denial of access to the boys ’ bathroom was causing him harm , as his attempts to avoid using the bathroom exacerbated his vasovagal syncope , a condition that renders Ash susceptible to fainting and/or seizures if dehydrated . He also contended that the denial caused him educational and emotional harm , including suicidal ideations .
Under anti-trans measures , trans people have to constantly fear using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity . As Lily Carollo wrote for ███ , “ From now until the law is repealed or settled in court , or until my birth certificate is amended , I will keep breaking the law . I ’ m not the only one . I will be an anxious mess every time I use the bathroom , but I don ’ t see any option . It ’ s all I can do , really . I am a woman . ”
Grimm , a teenage trans activist who sued his school for bathroom access , framed it another way . “ This wasn ’ t just about bathrooms . It was about the right to exist in public spaces for trans people , ” Grimm previously told me , quoting trans actress Laverne Cox . “ Without the access to appropriate bathrooms , there ’ s so much that you ’ re limited in doing . If you try to imagine what your day would be like if you had absolutely no restrooms to use other than the home , it would take planning . You would probably find yourself avoiding liquids , probably avoiding eating , maybe going out in public for too long at a time . ”
At the same time , a major argument used to impose anti-trans policies is based on a total myth : that letting trans people use the bathroom or locker room for their gender identity will allow men to disguise themselves as trans women to go into women ’ s bathrooms or locker rooms and sexually assault and harass women .
But even if trans people are allowed to use the bathroom or locker room that aligns with their gender identity , sexual assault remains illegal .
There ’ s also no evidence that nondiscrimination laws — and other policies that let trans people use the bathroom for their gender identity — lead to sexual assault in bathrooms and locker rooms . In two investigations , the left-leaning media watchdog organization Media Matters confirmed with experts and officials in 12 states and 17 school districts with protections for trans people that they had no increases in sex crimes after they enacted their policies .
Conservatives who favor these policies usually counter that there are examples of men sneaking into women ’ s bathrooms to attack women . But as PolitiFact reported , none of the examples cited in the US happened after a city or state passed a nondiscrimination law or otherwise let trans people use the bathroom or locker room for their gender identity . Instead , these seem to be examples of men doing awful things regardless of the law — which has , unfortunately , happened since the beginning of civilization .
One example is a case in Toronto , Canada , which now has a nondiscrimination law , in which a man disguised himself as a woman and attacked women in shelters . But the attacks happened months before Ontario ( Toronto ’ s province ) protected trans people in a nondiscrimination law . So the law couldn ’ t have been the cause .
While the issue is now being used primarily against trans people , historically bathroom fears have been regularly deployed against civil rights causes . They were used against black people to justify segregation — by invoking fears that black men would attack white women in bathrooms . And they were used to stop the Equal Rights Amendment , which tried to establish legal equality between men and women , because opponents claimed it would lead to the abolition of bathrooms for different genders , potentially putting women in danger .
Some people are also , frankly , just bothered by the idea that someone in the same bathroom or locker room won ’ t share the same genitalia as them .
This gets to the heart of the issue : Bathrooms are places where really private things happen , and that makes people feel vulnerable in all sorts of ways . “ People are afraid because they ’ re exposed , ” Kathryn Anthony , author of Designing for Diversity : Gender , Race and Ethnicity in the Architectural Profession , told the Guardian . “ There ’ s a vulnerability we feel in public restrooms we don ’ t feel in other places . ”
But a lot of things happen in public bathrooms that people aren ’ t comfortable with — and people have managed to deal with it to accommodate others ’ rights and needs .
So if it ’ s not harming anyone , perhaps it ’ s best , LGBTQ advocates argue , to let trans people use the facility for their gender identity without making them feel ostracized and discriminated against . ( Discrimination is a huge contributor to gender dysphoria , a medical condition some trans people experience that can cause depression , anxiety , and even suicidal ideation . )
On Tuesday , the Seventh Circuit Court sided with this view . It agreed that there is no evidence that letting Whitaker use the bathroom for his gender identity will cause any harm to anyone else , while acknowledging the clear harms the school ’ s policy had done to him .","A single student’s case has turned into a massive legal decision for all transgender Americans.

On Tuesday, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Kenosha Unified School District in Wisconsin violated the rights of a trans student, Ash Whitaker, when it refused to let him use the boys’ bathroom.

According to the court, Whitaker is likely to win upon a full review of the case (instead of the current review of a lower court’s preliminary injunction) on his claim that the school’s actions violated Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination in schools based on sex, and the Equal Protections Clause of the 14th Amendment.

Most states don't explicitly ban anti-LGBTQ discrimination

Under most states’ laws and federal law, trans people aren’t explicitly protected from discrimination in the workplace, housing, public accommodations, and schools. This means that a person can be fired from a job, evicted from a home, kicked out of a business, or denied the correct bathroom facility just because an employer, landlord, business owner, or school principal doesn’t approve of the person’s gender identity.

LGBTQ advocates argue, however, that federal civil rights law should already shield trans people from discrimination.

AMY GOODMAN : The Trump administration has rescinded key protections for transgender students in public schools . The move reverses President Obama ’ s landmark decision last May to order public schools to let transgender students use the bathrooms matching their chosen gender identity . The Obama administration had threatened to withhold funding for schools that did not comply .
According to press accounts , there was a split in the Trump administration over the issue between Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos . The New York Times reports DeVos initially resisted signing off and told Trump she was uncomfortable because of the potential harm that rescinding the protections could cause transgender students . At a meeting on Tuesday in the Oval Office , the president sided with Sessions and pushed DeVos to drop her opposition , which she did . DeVos later issued a statement saying , in part , quote , “ This is an issue best solved at the state and local level . ”
On Wednesday , hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House to call on Trump to protect transgender speakers . Participants included Gavin Grimm , a 17-year-old transgender student in Virginia whose lawsuit against the Gloucester County School Board has gone to the Supreme Court .
GAVIN GRIMM : It ’ s frustrating that that was even proposed , but this isn ’ t going to stop us in our tracks . We ’ re going to fight as hard as we always have . And that doesn ’ t—we ’ ll not slow down at any point and for any reason .
AMY GOODMAN : Mara Keisling of the National Center for Transgender Equality also spoke outside the White House .
MARA KEISLING : The worst-case scenario is what is already happening . Children all over the country are scared by this man . They are really worried that they ’ re going to go to school tomorrow , they ’ re going to be bullied . These are kids who have to go to school all the time worried about being bullied by other kids , being bullied sometimes even by educators . And now they have to worry about the attorney general of the United States and the president of the United States bullying them ? It ’ s just not OK .
AMY GOODMAN : To talk more about President Trump ’ s decision to roll back protections for transgender students , we ’ re joined by Chase Strangio , staff attorney with the ACLU ’ s LGBT & AIDS Project . The ACLU is representing Gavin Grimm in his Supreme Court case .
Welcome , Chase . Talk about the significance of what ’ s just taken place .
CHASE STRANGIO : You know , thanks for having me . And yesterday ’ s action by the Trump administration was really just another example of mean-spirited targeting of vulnerable individuals—this time , transgender young people . The protections that the Obama administration clarified in the guidance last year were incredibly important for this community that is so vulnerable to violence and bullying in schools . What ’ s important , though , is that as much as the Trump administration may want to change federal law , it ’ s still in the province of Congress and the courts . And so , yesterday ’ s actions , while sending a terrible message to the young people who are going to school in this country , young people who face incredibly high rates of suicide and harassment , it does not change the law . And that ’ s important , because the protections themselves come from Title IX , they come from the Constitution , and the president himself and his executive agencies can not change that .
AMY GOODMAN : So this Supreme Court case that has been brought by Gavin Grimm , this Supreme Court case will determine what happens ?
CHASE STRANGIO : Absolutely . Yesterday ’ s actions just highlight just how important this case is . This case before the Supreme Court involving Gavin Grimm , the 17-year-old boy from Virginia who ’ s being barred from the common spaces at his school just because he is transgender , his case is before the—
AMY GOODMAN : No , what do you mean ? Explain just—he ’ s being barred from the common spaces .
CHASE STRANGIO : His school has passed a policy , solely because his principal and his guidance counselor and the people closest to him at the school said , “ We understand that you ’ re a boy , and you will be allowed to use the boys ’ restrooms and other facilities , just like other boys. ” And his school board decided that that was unacceptable , and passed a policy targeting him , explaining that he , and he alone , is not able to use the shared restrooms and has to be banished to a separate , isolating , faraway and stigmatizing restroom .
And he filed a lawsuit . The case is before the Supreme Court . The case is not mooted by yesterday ’ s actions , because the question before the court is : Well , what does Title IX mean when it comes to transgender students ? And courts , for many , many years , have made clear that prohibitions on sex discrimination include prohibitions on discrimination against people who are transgender because they are transgender .
AMY GOODMAN : Let ’ s go to the White House press briefing yesterday with Press Secretary Sean Spicer talking about the Supreme Court decision .
PRESS SECRETARY SEAN SPICER : There is a case pending in the Supreme Court in which we have to decide whether or not to continue to issue guidance to the court . We—it ’ s not—it ’ s dictated by that . The Obama administration had issued joint guidance from the Department of Education and the Department of Justice . We now have to decide whether or not this administration wants to continue that track that they were on . It ’ s plain and simple , if we don ’ t . But there are problems both in the legal and process way in which that guidance was issued . And so it ’ s incumbent upon us to actually follow the law .
AMY GOODMAN : So that ’ s Press Secretary Sean Spicer talking about the Supreme Court case .
CHASE STRANGIO : Yeah , and Press Secretary Spicer does seem a little bit confused about the case , because the United States is not a party to the case . The United States has no role . There ’ s no deadline impending for them . And the parties to the case—Gavin Grimm and the Gloucester County School Board—have agreed before the court that the court should resolve the substantive question about Title IX . So , there was no deadline with respect to that case . That case moves forward . And it is , in fact , the answer to the question of how we respond to this cruel action by the Trump administration that we saw yesterday .
AMY GOODMAN : So , can you explain what these reports are in The New York Times and other places of the DeVos-Sessions battle in the Oval Office on Tuesday ? That ’ s Education Secretary DeVos , well known for years for her anti-gay stance , and Attorney General Jeff Sessions .
CHASE STRANGIO : Well , I wasn ’ t there . It ’ s hard to know exactly what ’ s going on . I have to admit I ’ m a little bit surprised to hear it . I would have thought perhaps both DeVos and Sessions would have been very much in support of rescinding this guidance . Certainly , it is not a surprise from Sessions , who we are hearing is absolutely determined to roll back not only the guidance , but the substantive protections for trans individuals .
When it comes to DeVos , what I can say is , I am imagining that she was presented with the very clear evidence that transgender students face high rates of bullying and harassment and suicide , and that the thing that helps protect trans students is respecting who they are and treating them like their other—like their peers . And so , she must have thought , as she should , that perhaps it was a terrible idea to take away clarity about the protections for this population , when we know that with support and protections , trans students have comparable mental health outcomes to non-trans students , and , without them , they face rates of suicide attempts nine times their peers . So , the reality is that , you know , maybe she took a pause to think perhaps this was going to be a horrible idea . But , unfortunately , she caved .
And the reality is that kids will be harmed by this . And , you know , I can ’ t say it more strongly , but the blood is on the hands of these lawmakers , who are making it a priority to make vulnerable kids feel less safe .
AMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to Donald Trump himself . President Donald Trump was asked about transgender rights when he was running for president and appeared at a town hall event on NBC ’ s Today show . This was last April .
WILLIE GEIST : [ reading ] “ Mr . Trump , please be specific . Tell us your views on LGBT , how you plan to be inclusive as president . Speak about North Carolina bathroom law , in particular . ”
DONALD TRUMP : Oh , I had a feeling that question was going to come up , I will tell you . Well , look , North Carolina did something , was very strong , and they ’ re paying a big price . And there ’ s a lot of problems . And I heard—one of the best answers I heard was from a commentator yesterday saying , “ Leave it the way it is right now . There have been very few problems . Leave it the way it is. ” North Carolina , what they ’ re going through with all of the business that ’ s leaving and all of the strife and—and that ’ s on both sides . You leave it the way it is . There have been very few complaints the way it is . People go , they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate . There has been so little trouble . And the problem with what happened in North Carolina is the strife and the economic—I mean , the economic punishment that they ’ re taking . So , I would say that ’ s probably the best plan .
WILLIE GEIST : Do you have any transgender people working in your organization ?
DONALD TRUMP : I really don ’ t know . I probably do . I really don ’ t know .
WILLIE GEIST : So , if Caitlyn Jenner were to walk into Trump Tower and want to use the bathroom , you would be fine with her using any bathroom she chooses ?
AMY GOODMAN : So , Caitlyn Jenner could use any bathroom she chooses in Trump Tower , candidate Donald Trump said . But President Donald Trump has gone with a very different approach .
CHASE STRANGIO : You know , that was a surprising amount of clarity from then-candidate Trump on the issue . And I think what it reflects is that when people first think about this , it makes perfect sense to not worry about where people go to the bathroom , because actually we ’ ve all been using the bathroom , trans people and non-trans people alike , for a very long time with no problems . And the emphasis on trying to expel trans people from the bathrooms we ’ ve been using for decades is , in fact , creating the problems . I think what we ’ ve seen now in his shift of position is , you know , he ’ s being caught up in the rhetoric that is really about demonizing trans individuals and making it seem not palatable to share public space with us . But that ’ s just simply not a tenable position .
And when it comes to the idea of states ’ rights , federal civil laws—federal civil rights laws are , by definition , designed to create federal standards when it comes to civil rights . So there ’ s no way that he can , you know , relegate this to the states , when we ’ re talking about the United States Constitution and federal civil rights laws , which , by their definition , are designed to ensure that people ’ s rights can ’ t be rolled back at the state level .
AMY GOODMAN : So , just two days before President Obama left office , he spoke about the change over the last decade around LGBTQ rights .
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : I ’ m proud that in certain places we maybe provided a good block downfield to help the movement advance . I don ’ t think it is something that will be reversible , because American society has changed , the attitudes of young people , in particular , have changed . That doesn ’ t mean there aren ’ t going to be some fights that are important—legal issues , issues surrounding transgender persons . There are still going to be some battles that need to take place .
AMY GOODMAN : That was President Obama right before he left office , Chase .
CHASE STRANGIO : You know , he ’ s right . You know , one of the key things he said is that we are not going to roll back the progress . And that ’ s absolutely right . Not only does this action by the Trump administration not change the substantive legal protections , but the reality is that there ’ s a movement of people supporting the trans community , trans people are out there speaking for themselves , and that to the extent people ’ s answer to the question of what to do about trans people existing in the world is to tell us not to exist at all , that is just simply not tenable , and people will not stand for that . And I know that we will continue to march forward , and we will continue to stand beside the young people , particularly , who are taking on so much .
AMY GOODMAN : You know , on June 12th , it was Omar Mateen , a 29-year-old security guard , who opened fire in the Pulse nightclub in Orlando and killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in a clear terrorist attack . After the Orlando shooting , Michigan lawmaker Jeremy Moss tweeted , “ I literally never want to hear again that LGBT people in the bathroom are a threat to public safety. ” So what happens next , Chase ?
CHASE STRANGIO : You know , what happens next is we tell the young people and their families that we will not stop fighting for them , and we tell everyone in this country to mobilize around the Supreme Court case that ’ s happening , with arguments on March 28th , because that is where we will continue to make our case for the protections that transgender individuals need , and we will stand in solidarity with all of the communities being targeted by this administration .
AMY GOODMAN : And if a child or anyone is harassed in school , wherever , what can they do ?
CHASE STRANGIO : If a child is harassed , if they ’ re denied access to the restroom , they can contact their local ACLU office . They can contact any organization that works with the LGBT community in their state . They can find me on Twitter . They can search for other people who are out there . We will not be silent , and we will not let people be isolated and targeted , no matter how much targeting happens from the federal government and down into the states .
AMY GOODMAN : Chase Strangio , thank you very much for joining us . Chase Strangio is staff attorney at the ACLU .
When we come back , we go to North Dakota to the standoff at Standing Rock . Stay with us .","This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: The Trump administration has rescinded key protections for transgender students in public schools.

According to press accounts, there was a split in the Trump administration over the issue between Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. The New York Times reports DeVos initially resisted signing off and told Trump she was uncomfortable because of the potential harm that rescinding the protections could cause transgender students. At a meeting on Tuesday in the Oval Office, the president sided with Sessions and pushed DeVos to drop her opposition, which she did. DeVos later issued a statement saying, in part, quote, “This is an issue best solved at the state and local level.”

On Wednesday, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House to call on Trump to protect transgender speakers. Participants included Gavin Grimm, a 17-year-old transgender student in Virginia whose lawsuit against the Gloucester County School Board has gone to the Supreme Court.

GAVIN GRIMM: It’s frustrating that that was even proposed, but this isn’t going to stop us in our tracks. We’re going to fight as hard as we always have. And that doesn’t—we’ll not slow down at any point and for any reason.

AMY GOODMAN: Mara Keisling of the National Center for Transgender Equality also spoke outside the White House.

MARA KEISLING: The worst-case scenario is what is already happening. Children all over the country are scared by this man. They are really worried that they’re going to go to school tomorrow, they’re going to be bullied. These are kids who have to go to school all the time worried about being bullied by other kids, being bullied sometimes even by educators. And now they have to worry about the attorney general of the United States and the president of the United States bullying them? It’s just not OK.

AMY GOODMAN: To talk more about President Trump’s decision to roll back protections for transgender students, we’re joined by Chase Strangio, staff attorney with the ACLU’s LGBT & AIDS Project. The ACLU is representing Gavin Grimm in his Supreme Court case.

Welcome, Chase. Talk about the significance of what’s just taken place.

CHASE STRANGIO: You know, thanks for having me. And yesterday’s action by the Trump administration was really just another example of mean-spirited targeting of vulnerable individuals—this time, transgender young people. The protections that the Obama administration clarified in the guidance last year were incredibly important for this community that is so vulnerable to violence and bullying in schools. What’s important, though, is that as much as the Trump administration may want to change federal law, it’s still in the province of Congress and the courts. And so, yesterday’s actions, while sending a terrible message to the young people who are going to school in this country, young people who face incredibly high rates of suicide and harassment, it does not change the law. And that’s important, because the protections themselves come from Title IX, they come from the Constitution, and the president himself and his executive agencies cannot change that.

AMY GOODMAN: So this Supreme Court case that has been brought by Gavin Grimm, this Supreme Court case will determine what happens?

CHASE STRANGIO: Absolutely. Yesterday’s actions just highlight just how important this case is. This case before the Supreme Court involving Gavin Grimm, the 17-year-old boy from Virginia who’s being barred from the common spaces at his school just because he is transgender, his case is before the—

AMY GOODMAN: No, what do you mean? Explain just—he’s being barred from the common spaces.

CHASE STRANGIO: His school has passed a policy, solely because his principal and his guidance counselor and the people closest to him at the school said, “We understand that you’re a boy, and you will be allowed to use the boys’ restrooms and other facilities, just like other boys.” And his school board decided that that was unacceptable, and passed a policy targeting him, explaining that he, and he alone, is not able to use the shared restrooms and has to be banished to a separate, isolating, faraway and stigmatizing restroom.

And he filed a lawsuit. The case is before the Supreme Court. The case is not mooted by yesterday’s actions, because the question before the court is: Well, what does Title IX mean when it comes to transgender students? And courts, for many, many years, have made clear that prohibitions on sex discrimination include prohibitions on discrimination against people who are transgender because they are transgender.

AMY GOODMAN: Let’s go to the White House press briefing yesterday with Press Secretary Sean Spicer talking about the Supreme Court decision.

PRESS SECRETARY SEAN SPICER: There is a case pending in the Supreme Court in which we have to decide whether or not to continue to issue guidance to the court. We—it’s not—it’s dictated by that. The Obama administration had issued joint guidance from the Department of Education and the Department of Justice. We now have to decide whether or not this administration wants to continue that track that they were on. It’s plain and simple, if we don’t. But there are problems both in the legal and process way in which that guidance was issued. And so it’s incumbent upon us to actually follow the law.

AMY GOODMAN: So that’s Press Secretary Sean Spicer talking about the Supreme Court case.

CHASE STRANGIO: Yeah, and Press Secretary Spicer does seem a little bit confused about the case, because the United States is not a party to the case. The United States has no role. There’s no deadline impending for them. And the parties to the case—Gavin Grimm and the Gloucester County School Board—have agreed before the court that the court should resolve the substantive question about Title IX. So, there was no deadline with respect to that case. That case moves forward. And it is, in fact, the answer to the question of how we respond to this cruel action by the Trump administration that we saw yesterday.

AMY GOODMAN: So, can you explain what these reports are in The New York Times and other places of the DeVos-Sessions battle in the Oval Office on Tuesday? That’s Education Secretary DeVos, well known for years for her anti-gay stance, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

CHASE STRANGIO: Well, I wasn’t there. It’s hard to know exactly what’s going on. I have to admit I’m a little bit surprised to hear it. I would have thought perhaps both DeVos and Sessions would have been very much in support of rescinding this guidance. Certainly, it is not a surprise from Sessions, who we are hearing is absolutely determined to roll back not only the guidance, but the substantive protections for trans individuals.

When it comes to DeVos, what I can say is, I am imagining that she was presented with the very clear evidence that transgender students face high rates of bullying and harassment and suicide, and that the thing that helps protect trans students is respecting who they are and treating them like their other—like their peers. And so, she must have thought, as she should, that perhaps it was a terrible idea to take away clarity about the protections for this population, when we know that with support and protections, trans students have comparable mental health outcomes to non-trans students, and, without them, they face rates of suicide attempts nine times their peers. So, the reality is that, you know, maybe she took a pause to think perhaps this was going to be a horrible idea. But, unfortunately, she caved.

And the reality is that kids will be harmed by this. And, you know, I can’t say it more strongly, but the blood is on the hands of these lawmakers, who are making it a priority to make vulnerable kids feel less safe.

AMY GOODMAN: I want to turn to Donald Trump himself. President Donald Trump was asked about transgender rights when he was running for president and appeared at a town hall event on NBC’s Today show. This was last April.

WILLIE GEIST: [reading] “Mr. Trump, please be specific. Tell us your views on LGBT, how you plan to be inclusive as president. Speak about North Carolina bathroom law, in particular.”

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, I had a feeling that question was going to come up, I will tell you. Well, look, North Carolina did something, was very strong, and they’re paying a big price. And there’s a lot of problems. And I heard—one of the best answers I heard was from a commentator yesterday saying, “Leave it the way it is right now. There have been very few problems. Leave it the way it is.” North Carolina, what they’re going through with all of the business that’s leaving and all of the strife and—and that’s on both sides. You leave it the way it is. There have been very few complaints the way it is. People go, they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate. There has been so little trouble. And the problem with what happened in North Carolina is the strife and the economic—I mean, the economic punishment that they’re taking. So, I would say that’s probably the best plan.

WILLIE GEIST: Do you have any transgender people working in your organization?

DONALD TRUMP: I don’t know.

WILLIE GEIST: No?

DONALD TRUMP: I really don’t know. I probably do. I really don’t know.

WILLIE GEIST: So, if Caitlyn Jenner were to walk into Trump Tower and want to use the bathroom, you would be fine with her using any bathroom she chooses?

DONALD TRUMP: That is correct.

AMY GOODMAN: So, Caitlyn Jenner could use any bathroom she chooses in Trump Tower, candidate Donald Trump said. But President Donald Trump has gone with a very different approach.

CHASE STRANGIO: You know, that was a surprising amount of clarity from then-candidate Trump on the issue. And I think what it reflects is that when people first think about this, it makes perfect sense to not worry about where people go to the bathroom, because actually we’ve all been using the bathroom, trans people and non-trans people alike, for a very long time with no problems. And the emphasis on trying to expel trans people from the bathrooms we’ve been using for decades is, in fact, creating the problems. I think what we’ve seen now in his shift of position is, you know, he’s being caught up in the rhetoric that is really about demonizing trans individuals and making it seem not palatable to share public space with us. But that’s just simply not a tenable position.

And when it comes to the idea of states’ rights, federal civil laws—federal civil rights laws are, by definition, designed to create federal standards when it comes to civil rights. So there’s no way that he can, you know, relegate this to the states, when we’re talking about the United States Constitution and federal civil rights laws, which, by their definition, are designed to ensure that people’s rights can’t be rolled back at the state level.

AMY GOODMAN: So, just two days before President Obama left office, he spoke about the change over the last decade around LGBTQ rights.

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I’m proud that in certain places we maybe provided a good block downfield to help the movement advance. I don’t think it is something that will be reversible, because American society has changed, the attitudes of young people, in particular, have changed. That doesn’t mean there aren’t going to be some fights that are important—legal issues, issues surrounding transgender persons. There are still going to be some battles that need to take place.

AMY GOODMAN: That was President Obama right before he left office, Chase.

CHASE STRANGIO: You know, he’s right. You know, one of the key things he said is that we are not going to roll back the progress. And that’s absolutely right. Not only does this action by the Trump administration not change the substantive legal protections, but the reality is that there’s a movement of people supporting the trans community, trans people are out there speaking for themselves, and that to the extent people’s answer to the question of what to do about trans people existing in the world is to tell us not to exist at all, that is just simply not tenable, and people will not stand for that. And I know that we will continue to march forward, and we will continue to stand beside the young people, particularly, who are taking on so much.

AMY GOODMAN: You know, on June 12th, it was Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old security guard, who opened fire in the Pulse nightclub in Orlando and killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in a clear terrorist attack. After the Orlando shooting, Michigan lawmaker Jeremy Moss tweeted, “I literally never want to hear again that LGBT people in the bathroom are a threat to public safety.” So what happens next, Chase?

CHASE STRANGIO: You know, what happens next is we tell the young people and their families that we will not stop fighting for them, and we tell everyone in this country to mobilize around the Supreme Court case that’s happening, with arguments on March 28th, because that is where we will continue to make our case for the protections that transgender individuals need, and we will stand in solidarity with all of the communities being targeted by this administration.

AMY GOODMAN: And if a child or anyone is harassed in school, wherever, what can they do?

CHASE STRANGIO: If a child is harassed, if they’re denied access to the restroom, they can contact their local ACLU office. They can contact any organization that works with the LGBT community in their state. They can find me on Twitter. They can search for other people who are out there. We will not be silent, and we will not let people be isolated and targeted, no matter how much targeting happens from the federal government and down into the states.

AMY GOODMAN: Chase Strangio, thank you very much for joining us. Chase Strangio is staff attorney at the ACLU.

What makes Florence so dangerous?

Forecasters say the storm poses such a threat because it is expected to slow down and hover for nearly two days over the Carolina coast, before dipping south towards Georgia.

It is forecast to bring 20-40in (50-100cm) of rain and life-threatening storm surges of up to 13ft. As of Wednesday evening, officials say these surges are now ""highly likely"" as Florence churns closer.

National Hurricane Center Director Ken Graham warned that waterways up to 40 miles inland may flood.

Is global warming to blame?

The relationship between climate change and hurricanes is a complex one.

Warmer seas power hurricanes. So as the temperature of ocean water goes up, we might expect the intensity of hurricanes to increase in future.

A hotter atmosphere can also hold more water, so this should allow hurricanes to dump more water on affected areas.

But there are so many factors that contribute to these rare events, it has been difficult to tease out clear trends from the data.

United Continental Holdings Inc. also added service to the area to help passengers evacuate, said chief executive Oscar Munoz.

American Airlines Group Inc. canceled some 705 flights in the region scheduled between Wednesday and Sunday. Southwest Airlines has canceled 264 flights through Saturday morning.

Some airlines waived change fees and allowed passengers to fly out of the storm’s path with extra luggage and pets on board for free.

“We’re doing everything we can to help them,” American Airlines Group CEO Doug Parker said Wednesday at a conference in Washington, D.C.

Duke Energy Corp. said the hurricane could knock out electricity for more than 1 million of its 4 million customers in the Carolinas.

“People could be without power for a very long time. Not days, but weeks,” David Fountain, the North Carolina president of Duke Energy, said Wednesday.

The company has been assembling 20,000 utility workers from as far away as Texas so crews can begin restoring power in the region as soon as it is safe. Mr. Fountain said the company is “primed and ready.”

A Boeing spokesman said some 787s were flown from its plant in North Charleston, S.C., to the plane maker’s facilities in Everett, Wash. “We...will continue 787 production there until it is safe for our employees to return back to work in South Carolina,” the spokesman said.

BMW AG also has a plant in the state, and railcars transporting vehicles to the port of Charleston for export have been diverted to holding areas, said a BMW spokesman.

With more than 400 automotive suppliers located in South Carolina, a supply-chain disruption could be far reaching, according to automotive forecasting firm LMC Automotive.

The firm said while plants in South Carolina are at the greatest risk for an extended production loss, automotive plants in Georgia, Kentucky and Tennessee could be impacted by flooding.

State and local authorities in the Carolinas and Virginia had ordered at least 1.5 million people to evacuate the coasts, while urging many more to leave. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster lifted some orders for the southernmost parts of the state, but on Wednesday urged people in flood-prone areas to get to higher ground.

With Florence’s predicted path shifting south, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency Wednesday for his entire state. Virginia, the Carolinas and the District of Columbia had already declared states of emergency. President Trump has issued federal emergency declarations for Virginia and the Carolinas so far. The president spoke with Mr. Deal on Wednesday and let him know the federal government was ready to help with anything the state needed, according to White House.

In inland North Carolina, the U.S. Army’s Fort Bragg—the nation’s largest military installation—said only “mission and emergency essential personnel” should report on Thursday and Friday. The base told service members to contact their commanders for guidance.

Across the region, many people boarded up homes and businesses and left to areas farther inland or out of the storm’s predicted path. Others gathered supplies and prepared to ride it out in their homes.

In Elizabeth City, N.C., employees at a Lowe’s helped customer after customer load 50-pound bags of sand into their cars and trucks. Karol Smith came looking to pick up 300 pounds of sand for her house. “This is my first big storm here,” she said, as she and her daughter loaded their vehicle. “We have been all over the place trying to find stuff.”

In Goldsboro, N.C., Jacob Whitfield said he planned to close his jiu jitsu school Wednesday night, then will head west with his family to stay with his mom outside of Greensboro. Fresh in his mind was another powerful storm, Hurricane Matthew in 2016.

“We’re right on the edge of where it’s going to be really bad,” he said. “When Hurricane Matthew came through the flooding was biblical. I’m hoping that doesn’t happen again.”

PENSACOLA , Fla. ( AP ) — An aviation student from Saudi Arabia opened fire in a classroom at the Naval Air Station Pensacola on Friday morning , killing three people in an attack the Saudi government quickly condemned and that U.S. officials were investigating for possible links to terrorism .
The assault , which ended when a sheriff ’ s deputy killed the attacker , was the second fatal shooting at a U.S. Navy base this week and prompted a massive law enforcement response and base lockdown .
Twelve people were hurt in the attack , including the two sheriff ’ s deputies who were the first to respond , Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan said . One of the deputies was shot in the arm and the other in the knee , and both were expected to recover , he said .
The shooter was a member of the Saudi military who was in aviation training at the base , Florida Gov . Ron DeSantis said at a news conference . DeSantis spokesman Helen Ferre later said the governor learned about the shooter ’ s identity from briefings with FBI and military officials .
A U.S. official who spoke to The ███ on condition of anonymity identified the shooter as Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani . The official wasn ’ t authorized to discuss the matter publicly . The official also said the FBI is examining social media posts and investigating whether he acted alone or was connected to any broader group .
During a news conference Friday night , the FBI declined to release the shooter ’ s identity and wouldn ’ t comment on his possible motivations .
“ There are many reports circulating , but the FBI deals only in facts , ” said Rachel L. Rojas , the FBI ’ s special agent in charge of the Jacksonville Field Office . “ This is still very much an active and ongoing investigation . ”
Earlier Friday , two U.S. officials identified the student as a second lieutenant in the Saudi Air Force , and said authorities were investigating whether the attack was terrorism-related . They spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose information that had not yet been made public .
President Donald Trump declined to say whether the shooting was terrorism-related . Trump tweeted his condolences to the families of the victims and noted that he had received a phone call from Saudi King Salman .
He said the king told him that “ the Saudi people are greatly angered by the barbaric actions of the shooter , and that this person in no way shape or form represents the feelings of the Saudi people who love the American people . ”
The Saudi government offered condolences to the victims and their families and said it would provide “ full support ” to U.S. authorities investigating the shooting .
“ The Ministry of Foreign Affairs affirms that the perpetrator of this horrific attack does not represent the Saudi people whatsoever , ” the government said in a statement . “ The American people are held in the highest regard by the Saudi people . ”
Vice Minister of Defense Khalid bin Salman noted on Twitter that he and many Saudi military personnel have trained on U.S. military bases and gone on to fight ‘ ’ against terrorism and other threats ’ ’ alongside American forces . “ Today ’ s tragic event is strongly condemned by everyone in Saudi Arabia , ’ ’ he said .

Florida U.S. Sen. Rick Scott issued a scathing statement calling the shooting an act of terrorism “ whether this individual was motivated by radical Islam or was simply mentally unstable . ”
Scott added that it was “ clear that we need to take steps to ensure that any and all foreign nationals are scrutinized and vetted extensively before being embedded with our American men and women in uniform . ”
U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in a statement Friday that he was “ considering several steps to ensure the security of our military installations and the safety of our service members and their families. ” He did not elaborate .
The U.S. has long had a robust training program for Saudis , providing assistance in the U.S. and in the kingdom . The shooting , however , shined a spotlight on the two countries ’ sometimes rocky relationship .
The kingdom is still trying to recover from the killing last year of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul .

Alone among industrialized nations in not offering paid leave for new parents to care for a child , or paid sick days , the U.S. has a two-tiered system , where well-paid women get paid time off from their employers , and working class women don ’ t . Only 10 percent of women in the bottom quartile of earners have paid family leave , compared with 71 percent in the top quartile . The numbers are similar when it comes to paid sick leave : 43 million American have none at all , and that includes 86 percent of bottom-quartile workers .
That means a lot of women in influential business and policy positions don ’ t recognize the need for government action on those fronts . When I asked former Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke , a businesswoman , if she favored paid family leave last October , she told me she ’ d have to research the need for it . “ If it ’ s an issue that really needs attention , and people aren ’ t being covered through plans by their employers , then I think that ’ s something to be looked at . But it ’ s not going to be a priority now. ” While I appreciated her candor , I was surprised a Democrat didn ’ t know it was “ an issue that really needs attention . ”
The president ’ s initiative would provide $ 2.2 billion to reimburse states that develop paid family and medical leave programs , plus $ 35 million for those that are exploring such a move . The Department of Labor will put $ 1 million in already allocated funds to keep helping states and cities do feasibility studies on the issue .
The president is also directing federal agencies to allow workers to use up to six weeks in advanced sick leave as paid family leave , though they will have to pay it back .
When it comes to paid sick leave , Obama is endorsing Rep. Rosa DeLauro ’ s Healthy Families Act ( co-sponsored by Sen. Patty Murray , since Tom Harkin retired ) , which requires employers to provide at least seven days of paid sick leave . But so far he ’ s not supporting the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act DeLauro is co-sponsoring with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand . When we spoke a few months ago , de Lauro told me talks with the administration were continuing and she was “ optimistic. ” On a conference call Wednesday night , Jarrett did not rule out backing federal legislation eventually , but said “ we ’ re not going to just wait for Congress . ”
“ I applaud President Obama ’ s announcement and appreciate his endorsement of the Healthy Families Act , which I first introduced in 2005 with Senator Kennedy , ” DeLauro said Thursday in a statement . “ The fact that the United States is one of just a handful of countries that does not require paid family or sick leave is nothing short of shameful . I will be reintroducing both the Healthy Families Act with Senator Murray and FAMILY Act with Senator Gillibrand to change that reality for American families very soon . ”
For now , Obama ’ s focus is pragmatic , since paid family leave legislation is unlikely to go anywhere in an increasingly conservative Congress . States and cities , particularly those led by Democrats , are where the action is , and the administration ’ s moves reflect that opportunity . California , New Jersey and Rhode Island all have paid family leave ; Massachusetts just voted for paid sick days , even as it elected Republican Gov . Charlie Baker .
De Lauro and Gillibrand ’ s bill is important , however , because it creates a funding mechanism for paid family leave , similar to disability insurance . Employers and employees would contribute two-tenths of one percent of salary – an average of $ 2 a week for most workers – that would fund leaves up to 12 weeks when an employee has a child or needs to care for a sick family member .
The funding mechanism means employers aren ’ t paying a full salary at a time when they ’ re losing a worker for up to three months , which could make it easier to get temporary help . Just as important , family leave becomes an earned benefit , not a top employee perk , not a welfare program , and not a benefit to be cut back in tough economic times .
“ This is not a partisan issue ; this is a family issue , and it ’ s an economic issue , ” Jarrett said in Wednesday night 's conference call .
It shouldn ’ t be a partisan issue , but increasingly , it is . President George H.W . Bush vetoed the first Family and Medical Leave Act . Future House Speaker John Boehner promised the legislation would `` be the demise of some [ businesses ] '' and that `` the light of freedom will grow dimmer . '' It was n't , and it did n't .
Still , the bill signed by President Clinton in 1993 had the backing of 19 Senate Republicans and 40 in the House . There would be no such bipartisan support for a paid leave bill today .
The good news is that many companies are recognizing the benefits of paid family leave on their own . When Google increased paid maternity leave to 18 weeks in 2007 , the rate at which new mothers left the firm dropped by 50 % . In California , 91 percent of employers now say the law either has no effect or positive effects , though most opposed it when it was passed .
Obama ’ s moves are another sign that activism is moving to the state and local level in an era of federal gridlock . But taken together with his community college initiative , and House Democrats ’ progressive tax plans , the plan is another sign that Democrats are finally crafting social policy for the 21st century , leaving Republicans to continue to try to repeal the 20th .","President Obama continues his recent crusade to bring American social policy into the 21st century Thursday with new initiatives to expand the number of Americans who have paid family leave and paid sick leave.

The numbers are similar when it comes to paid sick leave: 43 million American have none at all, and that includes 86 percent of bottom-quartile workers.

That means a lot of women in influential business and policy positions don’t recognize the need for government action on those fronts. When I asked former Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke, a businesswoman, if she favored paid family leave last October, she told me she’d have to research the need for it. “If it’s an issue that really needs attention, and people aren’t being covered through plans by their employers, then I think that’s something to be looked at. But it’s not going to be a priority now.” While I appreciated her candor, I was surprised a Democrat didn’t know it was “an issue that really needs attention.”

The president’s initiative would provide $2.2 billion to reimburse states that develop paid family and medical leave programs, plus $35 million for those that are exploring such a move. The Department of Labor will put $1 million in already allocated funds to keep helping states and cities do feasibility studies on the issue.

The president is also directing federal agencies to allow workers to use up to six weeks in advanced sick leave as paid family leave, though they will have to pay it back.

When it comes to paid sick leave, Obama is endorsing Rep. Rosa DeLauro’s Healthy Families Act (co-sponsored by Sen. Patty Murray, since Tom Harkin retired), which requires employers to provide at least seven days of paid sick leave. But so far he’s not supporting the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act DeLauro is co-sponsoring with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. When we spoke a few months ago, de Lauro told me talks with the administration were continuing and she was “optimistic.” On a conference call Wednesday night, Jarrett did not rule out backing federal legislation eventually, but said “we’re not going to just wait for Congress.”

“I applaud President Obama’s announcement and appreciate his endorsement of the Healthy Families Act, which I first introduced in 2005 with Senator Kennedy,” DeLauro said Thursday in a statement. “The fact that the United States is one of just a handful of countries that does not require paid family or sick leave is nothing short of shameful. I will be reintroducing both the Healthy Families Act with Senator Murray and FAMILY Act with Senator Gillibrand to change that reality for American families very soon.”

For now, Obama’s focus is pragmatic, since paid family leave legislation is unlikely to go anywhere in an increasingly conservative Congress. States and cities, particularly those led by Democrats, are where the action is, and the administration’s moves reflect that opportunity. California, New Jersey and Rhode Island all have paid family leave; Massachusetts just voted for paid sick days, even as it elected Republican Gov. Charlie Baker.

De Lauro and Gillibrand’s bill is important, however, because it creates a funding mechanism for paid family leave, similar to disability insurance. Employers and employees would contribute two-tenths of one percent of salary – an average of $2 a week for most workers – that would fund leaves up to 12 weeks when an employee has a child or needs to care for a sick family member.

The funding mechanism means employers aren’t paying a full salary at a time when they’re losing a worker for up to three months, which could make it easier to get temporary help. Just as important, family leave becomes an earned benefit, not a top employee perk, not a welfare program, and not a benefit to be cut back in tough economic times.

“This is not a partisan issue; this is a family issue, and it’s an economic issue,” Jarrett said in Wednesday night's conference call.

It shouldn’t be a partisan issue, but increasingly, it is. President George H.W. Bush vetoed the first Family and Medical Leave Act. Future House Speaker John Boehner promised the legislation would ""be the demise of some [businesses]"" and that ""the light of freedom will grow dimmer."" It wasn't, and it didn't.

Still, the bill signed by President Clinton in 1993 had the backing of 19 Senate Republicans and 40 in the House. There would be no such bipartisan support for a paid leave bill today.

The good news is that many companies are recognizing the benefits of paid family leave on their own. When Google increased paid maternity leave to 18 weeks in 2007, the rate at which new mothers left the firm dropped by 50%. In California, 91 percent of employers now say the law either has no effect or positive effects, though most opposed it when it was passed.

Obama’s moves are another sign that activism is moving to the state and local level in an era of federal gridlock. But taken together with his community college initiative, and House Democrats’ progressive tax plans, the plan is another sign that Democrats are finally crafting social policy for the 21st century, leaving Republicans to continue to try to repeal the 20th.",www.salon.com,left,7WCHHUd4Wl5avjW5

US President Barack Obama has commuted Chelsea Manning's sentence for leaking documents to Wikileaks in 2010.

The 29-year-old transgender US Army private, born Bradley Manning, will be freed on 17 May instead of her scheduled 2045 release.

She was sentenced to 35 years in 2013 for her role in leaking diplomatic cables to the anti-secrecy group.

The leak was one of the largest breaches of classified material in US history.

The commutation reduces Manning's sentence but is not a pardon, which some campaigners had called for.

Manning also passed on sensitive messages between US diplomats, intelligence assessments of Guantanamo detainees being held without trial and military records from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The disclosures were considered an embarrassment to the US, prompting the Obama administration to crack down on government leaks.

At a sentencing hearing, Manning apologised for ""hurting the US"" and said she had thought she could ""change the world for the better"".

What next for Julian Assange?

Wikileaks, which published the diplomatic cables, previously said its founder Julian Assange would agree to be extradited to the US if Mr Obama granted clemency to Manning.

The White House said Manning's commutation had not been influenced in any way by Mr Assange's offer, and the US justice department has not indicted Mr Assange nor publicly sought his extradition.

But he did tweet: ""Thank you to everyone who campaigned for Chelsea Manning's clemency. Your courage and determination made the impossible possible.""

Why no pardon for Edward Snowden?

More than a million supporters of Mr Snowden have petitioned Mr Obama to pardon Mr Snowden, who also leaked classified US documents.

But according to the White House, the National Security Agency (NSA) leaker has not himself submitted the necessary documents.

How do pardons and commutations work?

Mr Obama has commuted 1,385 sentences and issued 212 pardons, more than the total granted by the past 12 presidents combined.

In America, a pardon not only lifts the sentence but removes other penalties such as the bar on convicted felons sitting on federal juries, and state-level prohibitions on such things as voting or possession of firearms.

A commutation means the sentence is lifted but the civil handicaps outlined above remain.

USA TODAY

The 41st president of the United States, George Herbert Walker Bush, died on Friday, Nov. 30 at his Houston home. He was 94-years-old.

As news of the World War II veteran's death spread across the globe, family members, politicians and pop culture celebrities expressed gratitude and paid tribute online to the life and legacy of the late president.

Family Members

In a statement on Twitter, his grandson George P. Bush said that H.W.'s most enduring legacy wouldn't be his public life, but the example he set for his family.

""He was more than a great man; he was a good man. His courage was matched by his compassion; and his dedication to country was equaled only by his devotion to his family,"" George P. Bush said. ""Gampy, we love you and we will miss you. But we will never forget you.""

The elder Bush was the son of a senator, Prescott Bush of Connecticut, and the father of Jeb Bush, the two-term governor of Florida, and George W. Bush, the two-term governor of Texas who went on to win two terms as president. Bush, who was 94, died just months after his wife Barbara.

Early Saturday Jeb Bush tweeted, ""I already miss the greatest human being that I will ever know. Love you Dad!""

The 43rd president of the U.S., George W. Bush, released a statement on behalf of himself and his siblings: ""Jeb, Neil, Marvin, Doro and I are saddened to announce that after 94 remarkable years, our dear Dad has died. The entire Bush family is deeply grateful for 41's life and love, for the compassion of those who have cared and prayed for Dad.""

Political Figures

Former President Barack Obama said America had lost a ""patriot and humble servant in George Herbert Walker Bush"" in a statement released after the news broke. ""While our hearts are heavy today, they are also filled with gratitude. Our thoughts are with the entire Bush family tonight – and all who were inspired by George and Barbara’s example.""

Despite a contentious public relationship, President Donald Trump also mourned the loss, saying in a White House statement that ""through his essential authenticity, disarming wit, and unwavering commitment to faith, family, and country, President Bush inspired generations of his fellow Americans to public service—to be, in his words, 'a thousand points of light' illuminating the greatness, hope, and opportunity of America to the world.""

Speaker of the House Paul Ryan issued a statement saying that the elder Bush made the ""world safer and freer,"" calling the former president a war hero.

""Like so many Americans, I admired President Bush not only for how he served but for how he lived,"" Ryan said.

Former President Jimmy Carter said that Bush's administration was ""marked by grace, civility, and social conscience.""

Former Vice President Dan Quayle shared a story about the impact Bush had on his family while the two served in the White House: ""I have often told my children 'If you want a role model in your life — look to President George Herbert Walker Bush. The world mourns the loss of a great American. But, it also celebrates a life well lived.' ""

""What a life... full of love of family... strong faith... nothing’s more important. God bless the Bush family at this sad time,"" former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said.

While they were foes on the campaign trail in the 1990 election, former President Bill Clinton worked with Bush once they were both out of office on different humanitarian efforts. ""He never stopped serving,"" Clinton said in a joint statement with his wife, Hillary. ""I saw it up close, working with him on tsunami relief in Asia and here at home after Hurricane Katrina. His remarkable leadership and great heart were always on full display.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, reflected on a time when Bush offered comfort to their family during a difficult time. ""When we went to Houston in 2015 to honor the doctors that cared for our deceased son Beau, President Bush insisted on coming out to see us."" They called the elder Bush ""decent, kind, and welcoming,"" in a statement.""

Condoleezza Rice, who served as secretary of state under Bush Junior, called the senior president, ""the epitome of a public servant,"" in a statement on Facebook.

Celebrities and World Leaders

From CEOs of major corporations and British royalty to pop culture figures who disagreed with Bush's politics, high profile world icons paid tribute to the former Republican president whose public life spanned longer than 50 years.

""We lost a great American,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said on Twitter.

Queen Elizabeth II reflected on her time with the man she referred to as a ""great friend and ally of the United Kingdom."" In a statement Saturday, the queen referenced the late president's military service during World War II. ""It was with sadness that I learned of the death of President George H W Bush last night. Prince Philip and I remember our days in Texas in 1991 with great fondness. My thoughts and prayers are with President Bush's family and the American people.

Arnold Schwarzenegger took to Twitter to offer condolences, reminding people to ""look up and offer him a silent thanks.""

Chaz Bono, an actor and son of singer and actress Cher, said in a Tweet that although he didn't agree with most of Bush's policies, he appreciates and respects his dedication as president.

Other vocal liberal celebrities, including Ellen DeGeneres and Andy Cohen, took to social media to pay their respects.

""I will never forget George H.W. Bush and President Clinton meeting me in my old hometown of New Orleans to show support and raise money after Hurricane Katrina,"" Ellen tweeted.

Cohen posted a photo on Instagram of the former President and his wife Barbara with the caption #RIP.

Long before he was president, service was in his blood. Bush joined the Navy on his 18th birthday, months after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. After serving in World War II, he went to Yale and then moved his young family to Texas. There, he found his fortune in both the oil industry and politics.

After serving as the chairman of the Harris County Republican Party in Houston, he lost his first U.S. Senate bid. He was then elected to the House of Representatives in 1966, where he served for four years before losing another campaign for the Senate.

That loss seemed to serve him fine, though. President Richard Nixon appointed Bush as the United Nations ambassador and then brought him on to lead the Republican National Committee during Watergate.

Following Nixon's resignation, Bush then named the chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in China by President Gerald Ford. He then went on to become director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

Bush became Ronald Reagan's running mate in 1980, serving as vice president for the next eight years. When he won the presidency in 1988, he was ecstatic.

''We can now speak the most majestic words a democracy has to offer: 'The people have spoken,'"" he said after his victory.

ROME — A powerful earthquake toppled homes, churches and shops in a wide swath of medieval towns in central Italy Wednesday, killing at least 247 people and injuring hundreds of others, according to Italy's civil protection agency.

Dozens more were missing or feared dead from the magnitude-6.2 earthquake and a series of aftershocks that jolted Umbria, Lazio and Le Marche, three regions 80 to 100 miles northeast of Rome.

Rescue teams using bulldozers, and aided by townspeople with their bare hands, were still poring through the piles of rock, metal and wood late Wednesday looking for possible survivors.

Houston hammed by rain

More than 11 inches of rain fell in some spots of Houston overnight into Tuesday -- inundating byways and highways, slowing first responders, knocking out power and generally bringing the southeast Texas metropolis to a standstill.

According to the authorities in Houston, five people died and at least two more are missing.

The nightmare in Houston echoes that in other communities in Texas, Oklahoma and northern Mexico in recent days -- all from the same deadly, powerful, persistent storm system. And it's not over.

Storm, search continues

The storm moved eastward, bringing rain and more danger to Louisiana and Mississippi. So that meant slightly less rain as the day wore on in Texas, though this reprieve should be short-lived; 2 to 3 more inches of rain could fall as the week wears on.

The problem with this system isn't just the heavy rain -- this is, after all, late May along the Gulf Coast -- but that it's lingered and that it's after weeks of regular, intense precipitation.

I could hardly recognize this once-captivating city of breathtaking views , delectable food and cool jazz . Today it ’ s occupied by an army of homeless men and women who have turned Baghdad-by-the-bay into Bombay-by-the-bay with some of the dirtiest slums in America .
I first visited San Francisco in 1964 as a member of Barry Goldwater ’ s political team that wrapped up the Republican presidential nomination for the candidate who offered a conservative choice , not a liberal echo .
Then , we freely roamed the streets and hills of the city . Today , you watch your step lest you slip on human feces . Then , Goldwater Girls in their white cowboy hats and boots welcomed delegates and guests at the Cow Palace . Today , homeless men openly urinate in Union Square .
Then , we shared copies of “ The Conscience of a Conservative. ” Now , the homeless share their needles . Then , we opposed the legalization of marijuana . Now , Californians seem to grow more weed than oranges .
What has happened ? Why is America slouching like some rough beast — not toward Bethlehem , but Gomorrah ? Beyond dispute , things feel as if they are failing apart , and the common rules of a civil society no longer seem to apply .
Then , most Americans agreed that the family is the basic bloc of society . Now , according to the rising generation , the nuclear family is disappearing , gay rights take precedence over every other kind of right , Washington is accepted as primarily responsible for our welfare , and socialism is the tidal wave of the future .
What has happened ? A major reason is the influence , in and out of the academy , of political philosophers such as John Rawls , who argues that everything is relative and there is no absolute right or wrong . Rawls is the liberals ’ favorite philosopher because he believes , as politics professor Jerome Foss puts it , that “ the purpose of government is to rectify every injustice. ” Not so the Founders , who instituted a system of checks and balances to limit the role of government .
The government that Rawls envisions , says Mr. Foss , “ is empowered to enforce a theory without any institutional restraints. ” So much for the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and their reliance on certain “ self-evident ” truths , accumulated through 2,500 years of Western civilization from Jerusalem to Athens to Rome to London to Philadelphia .
I was a stranger in a strange land in San Francisco as I watched the people tread the sidewalks carefully on the way to work and shrug in embarrassment about the feces and the needles and the homeless tents that sprout like weeds . I reflected on what the plain-speaking Barry Goldwater might say about the tragic decline of this once magical city , and I believe it would be something like : “ Let ’ s cut out the crap and clean it up ! ” And then he would quote Milton Friedman on the importance of freedom — and , equally , the importance of what you do with that freedom .

It’s one thing to read about the decline of San Francisco. It’s another to see it for yourself.

I could hardly recognize this once-captivating city of breathtaking views, delectable food and cool jazz. Today it’s occupied by an army of homeless men and women who have turned Baghdad-by-the-bay into Bombay-by-the-bay with some of the dirtiest slums in America.

I first visited San Francisco in 1964 as a member of Barry Goldwater’s political team that wrapped up the Republican presidential nomination for the candidate who offered a conservative choice, not a liberal echo.

Then, we freely roamed the streets and hills of the city. Today, you watch your step lest you slip on human feces. Then, Goldwater Girls in their white cowboy hats and boots welcomed delegates and guests at the Cow Palace. Today, homeless men openly urinate in Union Square.

Then, we shared copies of “The Conscience of a Conservative.” Now, the homeless share their needles. Then, we opposed the legalization of marijuana. Now, Californians seem to grow more weed than oranges.

What has happened? Why is America slouching like some rough beast — not toward Bethlehem, but Gomorrah? Beyond dispute, things feel as if they are failing apart, and the common rules of a civil society no longer seem to apply.

Then, most Americans agreed that the family is the basic bloc of society. Now, according to the rising generation, the nuclear family is disappearing, gay rights take precedence over every other kind of right, Washington is accepted as primarily responsible for our welfare, and socialism is the tidal wave of the future.

What has happened? A major reason is the influence, in and out of the academy, of political philosophers such as John Rawls, who argues that everything is relative and there is no absolute right or wrong. Rawls is the liberals’ favorite philosopher because he believes, as politics professor Jerome Foss puts it, that “the purpose of government is to rectify every injustice.” Not so the Founders, who instituted a system of checks and balances to limit the role of government.

The government that Rawls envisions, says Mr. Foss, “is empowered to enforce a theory without any institutional restraints.” So much for the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and their reliance on certain “self-evident” truths, accumulated through 2,500 years of Western civilization from Jerusalem to Athens to Rome to London to Philadelphia.

I was a stranger in a strange land in San Francisco as I watched the people tread the sidewalks carefully on the way to work and shrug in embarrassment about the feces and the needles and the homeless tents that sprout like weeds. I reflected on what the plain-speaking Barry Goldwater might say about the tragic decline of this once magical city, and I believe it would be something like: “Let’s cut out the crap and clean it up!” And then he would quote Milton Friedman on the importance of freedom — and, equally, the importance of what you do with that freedom.

I might have gone home depressed and saddened by what I had seen, but my next stop was Dallas. After a day among its shining skyscrapers, clean streets and parks, and optimistic can-do residents, my spirits soared. All was not lost.

The young professionals whom I met were excited about what tomorrow might bring. Dallas, not San Francisco, is the future, unless the citizens of Baghdad-by-the-bay resolve to take back their city.
