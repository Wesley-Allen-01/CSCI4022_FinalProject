The 41-page opinion by U.S. District Court Judge Arenda L. Wright Allen ruled that the constitutional amendment and “ any other Virginia law that bars same-sex marriage or prohibits Virginia ’ s recognition of lawful same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions unconstitutional . ”
The ban will remain in effect while appeals are heard .
Attorney General Mark R. Herring , who announced the opinion Thursday night via Twitter , applauded the ruling but said he expected a prompt appeal would be filed to the U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit .
“ The decision is a victory for the Constitution and for treating everyone equally under the law , ” Mr . Herring said . “ It is the latest step in a journey towards equality for all Virginians , no matter who they are or whom they love . ”
The opinion comes after the attorney general said last month he would not defend the state ’ s voter-approved constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage and that he would actively work to overturn the law .
Judge Allen , who was appointed by President Obama in 2011 , said the ban denies the plaintiffs in the case due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution .
“ Our nation ’ s uneven but dogged journey toward truer and more meaningful freedoms for our citizens has brought us continually to a deeper understanding of the first three words in our Constitution : we the people , ” Judge Allen wrote . ” ‘ We the People ’ have become a broader , more diverse family than once imagined . ”
She drew parallels in her opinion between this case and the historic Loving v. Virginia Supreme Court case in which the justices struck down state laws prohibiting interracial marriage .
Judge Allen led the opinion with a passage from remarks made in 2007 by Mildred Loving , the black woman who served as plaintiff in the 1967 case .
“ In order to grow our economy and attract the best businesses , entrepreneurs , and families to Virginia , we must be open and welcoming to all who call our Commonwealth home , ” Mr. McAuliffe said in a statement . “ As this case continues through the judicial process , I will enforce the laws currently on the books , but this decision is a significant step forward in achieving greater equality for all of our citizens . ”
Others , however , were not as pleased . The Virginia Catholic Conference released a statement from Bishops Francis X. DiLorenzo and Paul S. Loverde saying the decision “ strikes a severe blow to the citizens of our Commonwealth . ”
“ In striking down Virginia ’ s Constitutional Amendment affirming the institution of marriage as a union between a man and a woman , Judge Wright Allen has not only totally ignored our state ’ s rights under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , she has also redefined marriage to the peril and detriment of our society , ” they said .
Virginia ’ s constitutional amendment banning gay marriage passed a public vote in 2006 , 57 percent to 43 percent . But amid a growing number of states legalizing the unions , a poll conducted in October by Christopher Newport University ’ s Judy Ford Wason Center for Public Policy showed 56 percent of likely voters opposed the ban on same-sex marriage , while 36 percent support it and 7 percent had no opinion .
Gay marriage advocates were hopeful after a Democratic sweep of the state ’ s top three offices in November , led by Mr. McAuliffe . But Republican control of the House of Delegates made any legislative change to Virginia ’ s constitutional amendment unlikely .
Virginia now joins Utah and Oklahoma in having voter-approved prohibitions on same-sex marriage lifted when federal courts intervened . It ’ s the first state in the former Confederacy in which gay marriage would be legalized .

White House press secretary Jay Carney said Friday that while he wouldn ’ t speak about cases the U.S. Supreme Court may or may not take up in the future , “ the president supports , as he ’ s made clear , making available to LGBT Americans the rights that we all should enjoy . ”

Moments after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on a pair of same-sex marriage cases , the handful of Democrats considering running for president in 2016 stumbled over themselves in a rush of celebratory reaction , blasting out a salvo of congratulatory press releases and tweets .
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , whose husband signed DOMA into law in 1996 , applauded the decision .

Maryland Gov . Martin O'Malley called the rulings `` a powerful step forward . '' New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo said the opinions were `` groundbreaking . ''
Public opinion on same-sex marriage has shifted dramatically from the time President Clinton signed the bill into law almost 17 years ago , after the legislation was approved by overwhelming majorities in both the Republican-controlled House and Senate .
In 1996 , just 27 % of Americans said gay and lesbian marriages should be recognized by law , according to CNN polling . By 2007 , the number had jumped to 40 % .
Today , a majority of Americans -- 55 % -- say that marriages between gays and lesbians should be recognized as valid , with 44 % opposed . More than two-thirds of young people support same-sex marriage , a recent Pew survey found .
Democrats who support same-sex marriage are now playing on increasingly friendly political turf , a circumstance that prompted a raft of Democratic senators to reverse their positions on the issue earlier this year in quick succession .
`` The battle lines are now clearly drawn for future elections , '' said Lis Smith , a Democratic consultant who advises O'Malley . `` Democrats , like the majority of Americans , support freedom and equality . Republicans embrace the stale and exclusionary policies of the past . Like immigration and women 's health in 2012 , this is an issue that will haunt the Republican Party for years to come . ''
Meanwhile , the court 's rulings Wednesday were met with something less than unbridled enthusiasm by the GOP political class .
`` My interest in weighing in on this topic approaches zero , '' said one veteran Republican working on a 2014 Senate race when asked to opine on the cases .
The reason is clear enough : Republican tacticians understand that winning modern races often means surviving the obstacle course of a conservative-dominated primary before having to appeal to general election voters who , nationally , view same-sex marriage as a non-issue .
Republican leaders in Washington expressed dismay at the ruling , but seemed eager to wash their hands of a polarizing national issue that , thanks to the court 's opinion on Proposition 8 , will now be considered in state capitals instead of the corridors of Capitol Hill .
`` A robust national debate over marriage will continue in the public square , and it is my hope that states will define marriage as the union between one man and one woman , '' said House Speaker John Boehner in a prepared statement .
The political fight over marriage is felt most acutely , perhaps , in Iowa , where three state Supreme Court judges were removed from the bench in 2010 in a recall election after they ruled in favor of same-sex marriage in the state .
Defending traditional marriage -- between one man and one woman -- has become an animating issue for Iowa 's vibrant social conservative community since that initial ruling in 2009 , and a litmus test for Republican candidates seeking their approval , either in contested primaries or in the state 's presidential caucuses .

At the beginning of last year 's GOP presidential primary fight , Rick Santorum narrowly won the Iowa caucuses with the backing of a dedicated network of pastors and home-school families who rallied to his side because of his furious opposition to abortion rights and same-sex marriage .
But other Republicans in Iowa say the party is consigning itself to minority status by failing to embrace the shifting opinions about marriage that Wednesday 's court ruling seemed to ratify .
`` We ca n't afford to create a litmus test for the party , '' said David Kochel , who steered Mitt Romney 's presidential campaign in Iowa and said he was pleased with the ruling . `` There are too many young people , and too many people who frankly care far more about other issues , and people in the liberty movement who simply have no problem with same sex-marriage . We have to maintain a kind of open-armed stance on this . ''
But Iowa Republicans seeking their party 's Senate nomination in 2014 are n't quite jumping on Kochel 's bandwagon . None of them cheered Wednesday 's decisions . The one Senate candidate who did celebrate was Bruce Braley -- the likely Democratic nominee .
Sam Clovis , a suspender-wearing college professor and former talk radio host running for the Iowa seat , blasted the DOMA ruling and said it opens the door to `` polyamorous '' marriages between more than two people .
While Clovis acknowledged that being a modern-day opponent of same-sex marriage presents a political challenge for himself and other Republicans , he said conservatives are fed up with being attacked by the left for simply stating their principles on the matter .
`` Every time you advance the notion that you are a conservative and that you believe in traditional marriage , you get hammered , '' Clovis said . `` People who have strong beliefs have been silenced . You ca n't talk about it except among your own friends . ''
For Republicans , the same-sex marriage rulings were something of a Rorshach test , exposing the almost timeless fault line between the party 's pragmatists and its ideologues .
For figures in the party 's establishment like Kochel , the rulings were met with a sinking feeling that same-sex marriage is increasingly a settled matter for voters and a potent wedge issue that Democrats can exploit for political gain in battleground states and in national elections .
Statements from the establishment wing of the party Wednesday were either risk-averse or nonexistent .
Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Preibus issued no comment on the ruling . Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell dodged a question about it . Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan said he opposes same-sex marriage but called for `` respect , '' `` civility '' and `` understanding '' as people work through their `` honest disagreements . ''

But for outspoken conservatives who tend to get rewarded in Republican primaries , the opinions were greeted with fury -- general election consequences be damned .
Santorum , who is expected to make another play for the White House in 2016 , attacked the `` activist judges '' on the court . Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , a freshman senator who harbors obvious national ambitions , called the rulings `` a regrettable overreach against the will of the people . ''
These harsh denouncements had the added benefit of stoking outrage among family values conservatives around the country who contribute financially to their causes .
The mood was similar among Republican candidates further down the ballot , who are running in gerrymandered House districts where winning a GOP primary is the only victory that matters -- providing little political incentive to side with gays and lesbians .

Bradley Byrne , a front-runner for the seat , wasted little time in hammering the court . `` I am disappointed in today 's decision , but know that Alabamians stand strong in supporting our states ' right to define marriage without intrusion from the federal government , '' Byrne said .

Rion Tucker is covering a lot of ground in his home state of Maine these days . The 20-year-old is a canvasser for Equality Maine , and he 's been knocking on lots of doors in an effort to make sure that voters in his state pass a ballot initiative in November legalizing same-sex marriage .
It 's a tough sell to many in the small town of Dexter , Maine , where some 69 percent of voters in this town voted against same-sex marriage in 2009 , part of a statewide majority who overturned a law allowing gays to marry . Dexter 's population tends to be older , whiter and poorer than the rest of the country . Tucker canvassed here a couple of months ago and got a lot of doors slammed in his face . But he 's back .
For the past two years , gay-marriage supporters have traversed this mostly rural state , knocking on around 300,000 doors , aiming to persuade voters one by one . Now they 're in the final stretch , revisiting supporters they 've identified , like Patricia Smith .
`` I just support anyone that wants to get married and live together as a couple , '' Smith tells Tucker when he knocks on her door .
Tucker asks supporters to keep in mind actual couples who would be able to marry . He encourages them to put bumper stickers on their cars and vote early . Tucker 's been canvassing for five months and believes that this kind of personal campaign can work anywhere .
`` I know a lot of us want to go to the next place where it will be voted on , and the next place , and just keep doing it , '' Tucker says .
Tucker is a transgender man . He grew up nearby as a closeted lesbian and joined the Marines , until coming out as transgender about a year ago . Now he spends hours every day debating with Mainers whose concept of gender is considerably more traditional , like Dexter resident Douglas Brackett .
`` What is it to be a woman , and what is it to be a man ... These days it 's sometimes kinda hard to tell , '' Brackett tells Tucker .
Brackett says he will probably be voting no on same-sex marriage in November .
Most of the addresses in this neighborhood are not on Tucker 's list , so he often walks for blocks to the next supporter 's home — and even they can be skittish .
At one home that doubles as a gunsmith shop , a young man says he 'll vote for the bill , but he keeps his voice low . He lives with his father who is vehemently opposed . Tucker offers him a bumper sticker . The man laughs and says , `` That would be a great way to get my car set on fire . ''
The Rev . Seamus Griesbach , a priest at the St. John the Apostle Parish in Bangor , the biggest city in the county , says no one wants to talk about gay marriage . About a third of Mainers are Catholic . The last time the issue came to a vote , the Catholic Church in Maine raised money for TV ads and dedicated days to preaching on the issue from the pulpit . But Griesbach felt emotionally bruised by the political campaign .
`` We have both perspectives in the church , and they 're very inclined to really get pretty nasty , '' says Griesbach . `` So I think the church said , wait a minute , we can not allow the Gospel to be limited to some kind of slogan . ''
This time , the Catholic Church 's strategy mirrors the other side 's . Griesbach is focusing on one-on-one conversations . He says the most difficult encounters are with those who have a gay family member .
`` I , first of all , say I 'm sorry you are going through this . I know how brutal it is , '' Griesbach says . `` The second piece is to try to help them understand how they can love their family member while at the same time not necessarily espousing all the lifestyle choices that their child or son or daughter or brother or sister is making . ''
Back in Dexter , night has fallen , but Tucker is still out talking to folks . Winding his way back to his car , ready to call it a night , Tucker knocks on a door not on his list of supporters . Giovanni Sarino answers the door . He 's got a bushy gray beard and wears a Vietnam veterans sweatshirt . He says he 's definitely opposed to same-sex marriage .
Sarino says he believes marriage is between a man and a woman . Tucker asks Sarino to tell him more about it .

Rion Tucker is covering a lot of ground in his home state of Maine these days. The 20-year-old is a canvasser for Equality Maine, and he's been knocking on lots of doors in an effort to make sure that voters in his state pass a ballot initiative in November legalizing same-sex marriage.

It's a tough sell to many in the small town of Dexter, Maine, where some 69 percent of voters in this town voted against same-sex marriage in 2009, part of a statewide majority who overturned a law allowing gays to marry. Dexter's population tends to be older, whiter and poorer than the rest of the country. Tucker canvassed here a couple of months ago and got a lot of doors slammed in his face. But he's back.

For the past two years, gay-marriage supporters have traversed this mostly rural state, knocking on around 300,000 doors, aiming to persuade voters one by one. Now they're in the final stretch, revisiting supporters they've identified, like Patricia Smith.

""I just support anyone that wants to get married and live together as a couple,"" Smith tells Tucker when he knocks on her door.

Tucker asks supporters to keep in mind actual couples who would be able to marry. He encourages them to put bumper stickers on their cars and vote early. Tucker's been canvassing for five months and believes that this kind of personal campaign can work anywhere.

""I know a lot of us want to go to the next place where it will be voted on, and the next place, and just keep doing it,"" Tucker says.

Tucker is a transgender man. He grew up nearby as a closeted lesbian and joined the Marines, until coming out as transgender about a year ago. Now he spends hours every day debating with Mainers whose concept of gender is considerably more traditional, like Dexter resident Douglas Brackett.

""What is it to be a woman, and what is it to be a man ... These days it's sometimes kinda hard to tell,"" Brackett tells Tucker.

Brackett says he will probably be voting no on same-sex marriage in November.

No One Wants To Talk About It

Most of the addresses in this neighborhood are not on Tucker's list, so he often walks for blocks to the next supporter's home — and even they can be skittish.

At one home that doubles as a gunsmith shop, a young man says he'll vote for the bill, but he keeps his voice low. He lives with his father who is vehemently opposed. Tucker offers him a bumper sticker. The man laughs and says, ""That would be a great way to get my car set on fire.""

The Rev. Seamus Griesbach, a priest at the St. John the Apostle Parish in Bangor, the biggest city in the county, says no one wants to talk about gay marriage. About a third of Mainers are Catholic. The last time the issue came to a vote, the Catholic Church in Maine raised money for TV ads and dedicated days to preaching on the issue from the pulpit. But Griesbach felt emotionally bruised by the political campaign.

""We have both perspectives in the church, and they're very inclined to really get pretty nasty,"" says Griesbach. ""So I think the church said, wait a minute, we cannot allow the Gospel to be limited to some kind of slogan.""

This time, the Catholic Church's strategy mirrors the other side's. Griesbach is focusing on one-on-one conversations. He says the most difficult encounters are with those who have a gay family member.

""I, first of all, say I'm sorry you are going through this. I know how brutal it is,"" Griesbach says. ""The second piece is to try to help them understand how they can love their family member while at the same time not necessarily espousing all the lifestyle choices that their child or son or daughter or brother or sister is making.""

One Voter At A Time

Back in Dexter, night has fallen, but Tucker is still out talking to folks. Winding his way back to his car, ready to call it a night, Tucker knocks on a door not on his list of supporters. Giovanni Sarino answers the door. He's got a bushy gray beard and wears a Vietnam veterans sweatshirt. He says he's definitely opposed to same-sex marriage.

Sarino says he believes marriage is between a man and a woman. Tucker asks Sarino to tell him more about it.

""That's tradition, since beginning of time. And the worst part is, I got nothing against people,"" Sarino says. ""But the part about adoptions; kids being brought up in same-sex marriage really offends me in a great way.""

But like so many people here, Sarino is willing to debate the issue with the stranger at the door. Tucker turns the conversation personal: He asks Sarino if he's ever been in love. Of course, Sarino says.

""It was beautiful, except [it was] a tragedy,"" Sarino tells Tucker. ""My fiancee died, and I never wanted to get married again, and I've been by myself for a long time.""

Tucker tells him that gay couples just want to commit to the ones they're with. Sarino says they are forcing the issue — that it's a private thing.

""I agree,"" Tucker tells him. ""Well, if you weren't able to get married, if the state of Maine said you couldn't get married because of whatever the issue, maybe because you have dark hair, would you push the issue to be with someone you love?""

Pretty soon the two are chatting like old friends who disagree on an issue. Tucker prods Sarino into grappling with his own upbringing, his faith and what it means to be tolerant of others. Sarino recalls that he did know a lesbian couple raising kids.

""I hadn't heard a lot of negative things about them raising family,"" Sarino says, ""which makes me think, let 'em have kids.""

Tucker anticipates Sarino's last concern. He's Catholic and under the wrong impression that the measure would force churches to marry gay couples.

""Well they won't be in the state of Maine,"" Tucker assures Sarino. ""This is a people's referendum, and we have it on our terms.""

""All right,"" Sarino says. ""I'm all for people having the right to love and care for the people that they're with.""

""That's wonderful,"" Tucker tells him.

The gay-marriage campaign doesn't need to change the mind of everyone like Giovanni Sarino, but it will need to do better with rural voters then it did in 2009.

All the candidates support LGBTQ rights , Biden warned , so there wouldn ’ t be much space between their positions .

To prove the depth of his own emotional concern for queer people , Biden decided to act like one . He flirted with multiple men , joked that he was about to come out as gay , and at one point , clasped Anderson Cooper on the shoulder and mimed giving him a kiss .
If you weren ’ t watching the town hall , you probably think I ’ m joking right now . I assure you , I am not .

I didn ’ t expect Biden to sidle up to Cooper—the gay CNN anchor moderating Biden ’ s portion of the town hall—and reenact the moment when , according to Biden , President Barack Obama gave him a kiss after he expressed his support for gay marriage in 2012 .

It was all hilariously off-tone , uncomfortable , and strained—the purest essence of the Biden candidacy . He didn ’ t provide the only brutal cringes of the night—when Kamala Harris said her pronouns are she , her , and hers , CNN ’ s Chris Cuomo replied , “ Mine , too ” —but Biden ’ s were the most persistent and bizarre . I wish I could be incensed that Biden made a gay joke out of what could have been , and otherwise was , an improbably fruitful evening of discussion about the future of LGBTQ lives in America . But honestly , it was a lot of fun watching him try to prove that he was so not grossed out by the idea of two men kissing that he was almost down to do it himself . It looked like a straight guy had found himself at a great gay bar and thought he ’ d plant himself in the middle of the dance floor for a second , just to show he was OK with all that gay stuff going on around him .
To that end , Biden ended his time with Cooper on a passionate note of acceptance . “ It ’ s normal , ” he said of being queer in 2019 . “ It ’ s normalized . It ’ s not anything strange . It ’ s not strange. ” I ’ m sure all the LGBTQ people in the audience appreciated the affirmation . Biden also noted how far the public discourse around LGBTQ issues has come in recent decades : “ Remember , Anderson ? Back 15 , 20 years ago when we talked about this in San Francisco , it was all about , well , gay bath houses . It was all about round-the-clock sex . Come on , man . Gay couples are more likely to stay together longer than heterosexual couples . ”
“ We ’ re going to leave it there , ” Cooper replied , ending Biden ’ s segment on his weird tangent about how straight people think gay people have tons of sex—a fitting last note for a truly presidential candidate .","Joe Biden touches Anderson Cooper at the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and CNN presidential town hall on LGBTQ issues.

I didn’t expect Biden to sidle up to Cooper—the gay CNN anchor moderating Biden’s portion of the town hall—and reenact the moment when, according to Biden, President Barack Obama gave him a kiss after he expressed his support for gay marriage in 2012.

I didn’t expect Biden to joke he “came out” when he said he supported gay marriage in 2012. And, when the audience laughed, I still didn’t expect Biden to put his arm around Cooper a second time and say with a smile, “I’ve got something to tell you.”

It was all hilariously off-tone, uncomfortable, and strained—the purest essence of the Biden candidacy. He didn’t provide the only brutal cringes of the night—when Kamala Harris said her pronouns are she, her, and hers, CNN’s Chris Cuomo replied, “Mine, too”—but Biden’s were the most persistent and bizarre. I wish I could be incensed that Biden made a gay joke out of what could have been, and otherwise was, an improbably fruitful evening of discussion about the future of LGBTQ lives in America. But honestly, it was a lot of fun watching him try to prove that he was so not grossed out by the idea of two men kissing that he was almost down to do it himself. It looked like a straight guy had found himself at a great gay bar and thought he’d plant himself in the middle of the dance floor for a second, just to show he was OK with all that gay stuff going on around him.

To that end, Biden ended his time with Cooper on a passionate note of acceptance. “It’s normal,” he said of being queer in 2019. “It’s normalized. It’s not anything strange. It’s not strange.” I’m sure all the LGBTQ people in the audience appreciated the affirmation. Biden also noted how far the public discourse around LGBTQ issues has come in recent decades: “Remember, Anderson? Back 15, 20 years ago when we talked about this in San Francisco, it was all about, well, gay bath houses. It was all about round-the-clock sex. Come on, man. Gay couples are more likely to stay together longer than heterosexual couples.”

“We’re going to leave it there,” Cooper replied, ending Biden’s segment on his weird tangent about how straight people think gay people have tons of sex—a fitting last note for a truly presidential candidate.",www.slate.com,left,7ZRamxDHGx6VvclR

Justice Samuel Alito : `` Traditional marriage has been around for thousands of years . Same-sex marriage is very new . I think it was first adopted in the Netherlands in 2000 . So there is n't a lot of data about its effect . And it may turn out to be a — a good thing ; it may turn out not to be a good thing , as the supporters of Proposition 8 apparently believe .

Justice Anthony Kennedy : `` On the other hand , there is an immediate legal injury or legal — what could be a legal injury , and that 's the voice of these children . There are some 40,000 children in California , according to [ a legal brief ] that live with same-sex parents , and they want their parents to have full recognition and full status .

The U.S. Supreme Court heard lively arguments Tuesday in a challenge to California's Proposition 8 ban on same-sex marriages.

And, as many learned painfully after last year's court decision to uphold Obamacare, it is risky business to predict how justices will rule later based on questions raised in arguments.

So we won't.

Instead, here are five areas of discussion we found interesting, even if they may not prove predictive of the outcome.

Most involve Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is, once again, considered the swing vote of a court otherwise divided evenly between liberal and conservative justices. The quotes below were taken from various parts of the arguments.

On Monday , Republican Gov . Brad Little approved two bills that had been met with widespread opposition . House Bill 500 bans transgender girls from playing on school sports teams in alignment with their gender identity , while House Bill 509 blocks trans people from correcting their birth certificates to match the person they know themselves to be . Forty local and national businesses , including Hewlett-Packard and Verizon , signed onto an open letter opposing the legislation , while Idaho ’ s own attorney general warned their passage could open up the state to costly litigation .
That is precisely what Idaho can now expect , according to Lambda Legal . Peter Renn , an attorney with the legal advocacy group , said that HB 509 is in direct violation of a 2018 court order which said the state can not “ automatically and categorically ” prevent trans people from updating their birth documents .
“ We absolutely intend to defend the victory that we obtained for transgender people in court , ” Renn told ███ . “ HB 509 has , in essence , already been adjudicated as unconstitutional by a court . You do n't have to guess about whether or not this law is unconstitutional . You already have a ruling from a federal judge saying that it is , and to nevertheless go forward shows a lot of contempt for the rule of law . ”
Kathy Griesmyer , the American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho ’ s policy director , said her organization is also preparing a legal challenge to HB 500 , saying it was “ no secret ” that the organization “ would be willing to sue if it came to that. ” In fact , Griesmyer said the ACLU warned Little ’ s office that a legal battle could cost the state “ millions ” at a time when states across the country are struggling to effectively allocate resources to fight off the spread of COVID-19 , also known as the novel coronavirus .
“ We ’ re in the midst of a health crisis , ” Griesmyer told ███ , noting that Little ordered a 1 percent budget cut for all state government agencies . “ But he ’ s willing to risk taxpayer dollars from people who might be losing their jobs , who are stuck at home battling a really severe crisis , to use it to defend blatantly unconstitutional legislation . It just does n't make sense . ”
While these battles are fought in the courts , advocates are concerned that the passage of these laws could be extremely harmful for trans people in Idaho at a time when people are fighting for their daily survival . As the number of deaths from COVID-19 approaches 3,000 in the United States as of Tuesday afternoon , Little issued a statewide lockdown last Wednesday . This decision followed weeks of inaction on the part of government leaders .
Megan Carter , ███ chair of the local LGBTQ group Add the Words , said the passage of these bills is especially dangerous because trans people already don ’ t have statewide protections in areas like health care or any other form of public accommodation .
“ For instance , if a trans person were to get sick with COVID-19 and go to a health care provider , they could be turned away and denied service , ” Carter told ███ . “ There is a lot of fear already in our community and then you add this extra layer of this pandemic .
It really just shows trans folks in Idaho that we 're not welcome here . We are not seen as human . ”
Little has not released a public statement regarding his reasoning for signing HB 500 and HB 509 into law , but advocates worried their enactment could be a green light for other states looking for an excuse to discriminate against trans people . Of the estimated 60 anti-trans bills under consideration by state legislatures in 2020 , 12 are still active . That includes an Alabama bill that would prevent transgender minors from receiving medication or surgery intended to help their bodies align with their gender identity .
Sam Brinton , head of advocacy and government affairs for The Trevor Project , said the Idaho laws could open a “ Pandora ’ s box , ” whether it ’ s signing bills like Alabama ’ s into law or other anti-trans proposals that could be tabled in subsequent years .
“ This could be just the impetus that these other states needed to say , ‘ Well , if they can do it in Idaho , we can do it here , ’ ” Brinton told ███ , noting that Idaho ’ s bills were the first anti-trans bills to be signed into law in 2020 . “ We are lucky that these were the first and we will continue to fight the rest , but everything bad can come out . Our hope now can only be to keep as much in as possible . ”
Others weren ’ t convinced that additional states would feel the ripple effect of Idaho ’ s laws , especially given the myriad legal issues they pose . In his analysis of HB 500 , Idaho Assistant Chief Deputy Attorney General Brian Kane warned that the law would likely violate the Equal Protection Clause under the 14th Amendment , which forbids the government from singling out particular groups for undue scrutiny , as well as Title IX laws that ban discrimination on the basis of sex .
Kate Oakley , state legislative director and senior counsel at the Human Rights Campaign , added that HB 500 could also be used to target any female student who wishes to play sports in K-12 schools or at the college level . Because the law is extremely vague about the process by which athletes , parents , and coaches can bring forward complaints , she said it could be used to discriminate against any player accused of being “ too good ” to be a “ real ” girl . Theat student would then be subject to invasive physical exams and DNA testing to prove their “ biological sex . ”
Oakley said these kinds of regulations are “ outrageous ” and “ discriminatory ” but also predicted they would prove an “ outlier . ”
“ It is despicable that the governor signed these laws , but I suspect that other state legislatures are not going to be that heartened by this choice , ” she told ███ . “ In the greater context of everything that 's going on , the silliness of these and the hurt that they impose without any conceivable benefit , I think that is going to become apparent . ”
It remains to be seen—for now—whether other states will follow in the footsteps of Idaho and pass laws limiting the ability of trans people to play school sports , have identity documents that match their gender identity , or participate fully in public life . A 2015 survey from the National Center for Trans Equality found that a third of individuals who presented a birth certificate or ID that didn ’ t conform to their physical presentation had faced harassment or even violence .
For transgender Idahoans who fear the passage of these laws could lead to greater discrimination in their daily lives , there is a small silver lining . According to Lambda Legal , HB 509 is currently unenforceable because of the aforementioned 2018 federal court ruling . In order to stop trans people from correcting their birth documents , which they have now been able to do for two years , the state of Idaho must petition the court to reverse the existing injunction . The government will have until July 1 to do so , which is when the new law is scheduled to take effect .
Renn said he did not believe the courts would accommodate that request . “ If the government wants to enforce this law , they need to get that injunction lifted , and I do n't think they will be successful in doing so , ” he said . “ It is incredibly disappointing that during this time of a global pandemic , Idaho has chosen to take up this fight . ”","Idaho is facing a pair of lawsuits after its governor signed two of the nation’s harshest anti-transgender bills into law.

Renn said he did not believe the courts would accommodate that request. “If the government wants to enforce this law, they need to get that injunction lifted, and I don't think they will be successful in doing so,” he said. “It is incredibly disappointing that during this time of a global pandemic, Idaho has chosen to take up this fight.”

Story Continued Below

Look at what’s happened in four states dominated by the GOP in the past year.

Weeks before the Super Bowl kickoff in 2014, the Arizona Legislature passed a bill allowing businesses to refuse service to gay customers. This “religious freedom” measure made it OK for business owners to kick customers out of their establishments if they opposed homosexuality on religious grounds. Scores of corporate titans in the travel and tourism industry, together with the NFL, opposed the bill. Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed it.

In Indiana this March, lawmakers tried to pass similar legislation, followed by a hell-hath-no-fury response led by Eli Lilly, Salesforce and Angie’s List, which canceled a $40 million project planned for Indianapolis. Marriott’s CEO said the legislation was “pure idiocy from a business perspective.” Gov. Mike Pence modified the bill, but the damage was done. (The state has since hired a global PR firm to resuscitate its image following the brouhaha.)

In Arkansas, same story. Seeing the firestorm that occurred in Indiana, Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson didn’t sign the original bill that hit his desk after calls for him to veto it came from his own son, and from Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, which said the bill ran counter to the company’s values. In the end, the governor signed a less toxic, less controversial bill.

And this week, Texas became the latest to join the fray.

The Lone Star State just wrapped its legislative session, which included two “religious freedom” constitutional amendments. Learning from what happened in the above states, industry groups and major businesses went out pre-emptively — let me say that again: pre-emptively — before such bills made it too far in the Legislature. The conservative state chamber of commerce, the Texas Association of Business, took the lead.

The amendments “would devastate economic development, tourism and the convention business,” said Bill Hammond, TAB’s CEO. “One has to look no further than Indiana to realize what a detriment this would be, and how hard it would be to sell Texas to the rest of the country. The Super Bowl [in Houston in 2017], the Final Four, all those things would be at risk in Texas if this were to become part of our Constitution.”

More than 250 Texas companies — American Airlines, Dell, Texas Instruments, Dow Chemical, the Dallas Mavericks — went on record with a general pledge in support of treating gay and transgender Texans fairly and equally under the law — and that welcoming and inclusive communities are essential to their bottom line.

Both amendments in the Texas Legislature died a quick death.

So: four states, same story and same result. If the “religious freedom” strategy can’t work in Texas — the bastion of conservatism and beacon for business — where can it work?

It’s not news this country has come a long way on LGBT rights. An evolution, a massive one, has taken place. Culturally, we’ve gone from taboo to tolerance, and in some cities, total embrace. Elections are always about the future, never about the past. And so my advice to GOP candidates is to recognize that since our society has largely moved on, and business has moved on, so should the party of Abraham Lincoln, who fought a civil war over civil rights.

Discrimination is now simply bad for the bottom line and bad for any brand, whether a company’s or a state’s. When it comes to recruitment and retention, the millennial generation, which will be 75 percent of the workforce by 2030, doesn’t have much tolerance for anti-gay anything. In fact, it’s become somewhat of a litmus test. 73 percent of millennials support LGBT nondiscrimination, according to Public Religion Research Institute. Surely, they use it as one criterion when deciding where to work.

Most businesses now have their own internal nondiscrimination policies for LGBT employees, but they want to see their larger communities in which they operate adopt similar welcoming and inclusive policies. Top talent is looking for both a great job and a great quality of life. To most folks, I would venture, that does not mean a city or state that looks the other way when discrimination happens.

It’s clear from the reaction of many of America’s leading corporations, that Big Business wants to do the right thing for and by employees — all of them. And most CEOs of the Fortune 500 are Republicans. So, they are paving the way for more in our party to jump on board with gay rights. If it’s good for business, it’s generally good for the Republican Party.

Negative national headlines on religious freedom continue to fuel a negative image of the entire party. Both in my private conversations with and in public (and private) polling, conservatives are moving ever closer to supporting full equity for LGBT Americans. Gallup’s Values and Beliefs poll released last month showed a more than 20 percentage-point increase since 2001 in Americans (63 percent) who believe “gay and lesbian relations” are “morally acceptable”.

The tiny dynamo asking the U.S. Supreme Court to turn the world upside down looks nothing like a fearless pioneer . At age 83 , Edith Windsor dresses in classic , tailored clothes , usually with a long string of pearls , and she sports a well-coiffed , shoulder-length flip . She looks , for all the world , like a proper New York City lady .
Proper she may be , and a lady , but Windsor , who likes to be called Edie , is making history , challenging the federal Defense of Marriage Act , known as DOMA . The law bans federal recognition and benefits for legally married same-sex couples .
The crux of her lawsuit is that after living with Thea Spyer for more than four decades , and having a marriage recognized as legal in the state of New York , Windsor had to pay $ 363,000 in estate taxes when Spyer died because the federal government did not recognize their marriage as valid .
`` If Thea was Theo , '' she says , `` I would not have had to pay '' those taxes . `` It 's heartbreaking , '' she adds . `` It 's just a terrible injustice , and I do n't expect that from my country . I think it 's a mistake that has to get corrected . ''
Windsor was born in 1929 , shortly before her parents lost their home and business in the Depression . As a teenager she was , by her own account , very popular with boys , and after graduating from Temple University , Windsor got married .
But as she puts it , when she went to the movies , she secretly identified with movie star Dick Powell , not with his co-star Ruby Keeler . After less than a year , she asked her husband for a divorce .
`` I told him the truth , '' she recalls . `` I said , 'Honey , you deserve a lot more . You deserve somebody who thinks you 're the best because you are . And I need something else . ' ``
After moving to New York City , Windsor worked as a secretary , got a master 's in mathematics from New York University , and soon was on her way to a career as a top programmer at IBM .
In those days , it was `` impossible '' to be openly gay , she says . `` I really was a middle-class girl ... and of course you did n't want to be queer . ''
Finally , though , she asked an old friend for help : `` If you know where the lesbians are , please take me . '' Her friend took her to a Greenwich Village restaurant called Portofino , where Windsor met Thea Spyer , a prominent psychologist , who would be the love of Windsor 's life and , eventually , her wife .
In 1967 , on a drive to the countryside , Thea asked Edie what she would do if she got an engagement ring . After all , if co-workers saw it , they would want to meet `` the guy . ''
When they got to the house they were renting for the weekend , Thea got out of the car and got down on her knees and said , `` Edie Windsor , will you marry me ? '' Instead of a ring , she presented Edie with a circle pin adorned with diamonds .
At the time , of course , there was no place the two could actually marry . But they led good lives together , even after Thea was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis . The disease at first progressed slowly .
Thea 's first symptom was not being able to complete her golf swing . `` It was very gradual , '' Edie says , but eventually `` it turned into a fairly vicious , progressive MS. '' Edie never thought of Thea as being `` sick , '' but her partner was becoming increasingly crippled .

Edie eventually took early retirement to help care for Thea , and they waited and hoped for the day New York would legalize same-sex marriage . They thought of going to Canada , where same-sex marriage was legal and recognized by the state of New York , but Edie says that with all the lifts and gear that Thea needed to travel , `` my feeling was I do n't have to drag her though that .

Then suddenly , it was clear that the end was near .
`` She got a lousy prognosis , which said within a year , and she got up the next morning and she said , 'Do you still want to get married ? ' ``

'I Need Something Else'

Windsor was born in 1929, shortly before her parents lost their home and business in the Depression. As a teenager she was, by her own account, very popular with boys, and after graduating from Temple University, Windsor got married.

But as she puts it, when she went to the movies, she secretly identified with movie star Dick Powell, not with his co-star Ruby Keeler. After less than a year, she asked her husband for a divorce.

""I told him the truth,"" she recalls. ""I said, 'Honey, you deserve a lot more. You deserve somebody who thinks you're the best because you are. And I need something else.' ""

After moving to New York City, Windsor worked as a secretary, got a master's in mathematics from New York University, and soon was on her way to a career as a top programmer at IBM.

All the while, she hid her homosexuality.

In those days, it was ""impossible"" to be openly gay, she says. ""I really was a middle-class girl ... and of course you didn't want to be queer.""

Finally, though, she asked an old friend for help: ""If you know where the lesbians are, please take me."" Her friend took her to a Greenwich Village restaurant called Portofino, where Windsor met Thea Spyer, a prominent psychologist, who would be the love of Windsor's life and, eventually, her wife.

'Will You Marry Me?'

In 1967, on a drive to the countryside, Thea asked Edie what she would do if she got an engagement ring. After all, if co-workers saw it, they would want to meet ""the guy.""

When they got to the house they were renting for the weekend, Thea got out of the car and got down on her knees and said, ""Edie Windsor, will you marry me?"" Instead of a ring, she presented Edie with a circle pin adorned with diamonds.

Edie said yes. Thea said, ""Me too."" And they did, flying off to Toronto with ""two best men and four best women.""

The photos show nothing but joy.

'This Magic Thing'

""The fact is, marriage is this magic thing,"" Edie says. ""I mean forget all the financial stuff — marriage ... symbolizes commitment and love like nothing else in the world. And it's known all over the world. I mean, wherever you go, if you're married, that means something to people, and it meant a difference in feeling the next day.""

The Minneapolis-based retailer is taking heat in its home state , where voters will decide this November whether to put a gay marriage ban into the state constitution . One organizer of gay marriage opponents warned that their displeasure could spread to 32 other states where voters have banned gay marriage .
`` Target is attacking traditional marriage , which is an incredibly misguided thing for them to have done , '' said Chuck Darrell , spokesman for Minnesota for Marriage , a group campaigning to pass the constitutional marriage amendment . `` It 's an insult to the overwhelming majority of their customers . ''
Target 's move comes two years after it endured a backlash from gay rights supporters for giving $ 150,000 to a campaign group backing the conservative Republican candidate for Minnesota governor , Tom Emmer , who narrowly lost to Democrat Mark Dayton in a race that went to an automatic recount . The donation set off protests and calls for a boycott from a constituency that had seen Target as an ally .
Supporters of gay marriage see Minnesota as having the potential to halt their long losing streak in statewide votes .

Darrell also urged Target to get out of the marriage issue -- and stay out .
`` Just get out of this debate and do what they 're good at , '' Darrell said . `` Get out of the business of trying to redefine marriage . ''","Two years after Target Corp. angered gay marriage supporters with a political donation that benefited a gay-marriage opponent seeking the governor's office, the retailer is now upsetting same-sex marriage opponents by selling T-shirts to raise money for a group working to defeat a gay marriage ban in Minnesota.

The Minneapolis-based retailer is taking heat in its home state, where voters will decide this November whether to put a gay marriage ban into the state constitution. One organizer of gay marriage opponents warned that their displeasure could spread to 32 other states where voters have banned gay marriage.

""Target is attacking traditional marriage, which is an incredibly misguided thing for them to have done,"" said Chuck Darrell, spokesman for Minnesota for Marriage, a group campaigning to pass the constitutional marriage amendment. ""It's an insult to the overwhelming majority of their customers.""

Target's move comes two years after it endured a backlash from gay rights supporters for giving $150,000 to a campaign group backing the conservative Republican candidate for Minnesota governor, Tom Emmer, who narrowly lost to Democrat Mark Dayton in a race that went to an automatic recount. The donation set off protests and calls for a boycott from a constituency that had seen Target as an ally.

Supporters of gay marriage see Minnesota as having the potential to halt their long losing streak in statewide votes.

Sometimes it seems as if they are in a contest to see who can be the most stalwart defender of “ traditional marriage ” – who can most effectively stoke the unfounded fears of the far right .
When talking about same sex marriage , these candidates regularly throw around phrases like religious freedom and religious liberty , warn that marriage equality will lead to the criminalization of Christianity or the downfall of the American family , and fret that our nation ’ s very future is at risk .
Let ’ s be clear . The fight over marriage equality isn ’ t about religious freedom or the criminalization of Christianity . States have regularly taken action to enact civil marriage with clear exemptions and protections for churches , synagogues and other religious entities . No matter what happens with same-sex marriage , that will not change .
It is also no longer a fight about our country ’ s future because that fight is already over . According to a recent CNN/ORC survey , the highest percentage of Americans ever , 63 % , support the freedom to marry as a constitutional right for gay couples . This is an increase of 14 % since 2010 and shows significant gains across all party lines . Regardless of what the U.S. Supreme Court decides this term , the American Public is already on the side of marriage equality . Should the Court oppose the expansion of the freedom to marry to all fifty states , millions of Americans will be disappointed , but progress will continue to be made . It will just take a bit longer .
The next time a Republican presidential candidate wants to talk about the need for our society to support and protect families and children , I hope he or she will include all families and all children in that protection .
What is up for discussion and debate however , is where the Republican Party goes from here .
Along with the general public , support for the freedom to marry has increasingly gained acceptance among senior Republicans on Capitol Hill . Senators Rob Portman of Ohio and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska announced their support of marriage equality in recent years . And just this spring , twenty-three current and former members of Congress , including Senators Mark Kirk ( Ill. ) and Susan Collins ( Maine ) and Representatives Curbelo ( Fla. ) , Dold ( Ill. ) , Hanna ( N.Y. ) , Gibson ( N.Y. ) , and Ros-Lehtinen ( Fla. ) added their names to a Republican amicus brief arguing in support of marriage equality cases presently before the U.S. Supreme Court .
The Republican Party has always claimed to be in favor of certain key principles including , support for individual liberty , personal responsibility and the belief that strong families are the corner stone of our society . This is exactly why more leaders of the party should embrace the idea of marriage equality .
Legalizing civil marriage for same-sex couples does not threaten heterosexual marriage ; nor does it violate the First Amendment by forcing churches to perform ceremonies that violate their fundamental beliefs . It will not lead to the arrest of ministers or priests who refuse to perform same sex marriage ceremonies .
It will , however , increase relationship stability , strengthen families and provide legal protections for children growing up in same-sex families – all of which are goals in keeping with the principles of the Republican Party .
For years I have listened while Republican candidates talked about the importance of family and the need for our country to support strong families . I whole-heartedly agree . We do need to support families , but that means supporting all families – regardless of which state they live in , how they look or how they are made .

At that hour , perhaps the nation ’ s most contentious political issue will get its day in court , as the Supreme Court prepares to hear oral arguments in four cases that gay marriage advocates say will go down in history as landmarks of anti-discrimination law .
Competing rallies have been planned outside the high court Tuesday morning . More than a dozen people had already started camping out on the sidewalk near the court by Saturday morning in hopes of getting one of the coveted public seats for the 2-hour hearing .
At issue in the cases are whether the U.S. Constitution ’ s 14th Amendment requires states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and whether states are required to recognize marriages conducted by other jurisdictions .
Dozens of gay couples from Michigan , Tennessee , Ohio and Kentucky are urging the court to agree that they have a fundamental right to marriage — and many attorneys and gay rights advocates believe they have the upper hand in the contest .
“ If you read what the Supreme Court said ” in a 2013 gay marriage case , Windsor v. United States , “ there ’ s really no other way for the Supreme Court to come out in the case that ’ s up for argument on Tuesday , ” lawyer Ted Olson said on NBC ’ s “ Meet the Press . ”
Mr. Olson and David Boies argued successfully against California ’ s Proposition 8 , the 2008 gay marriage ban .
They said they believe at least five of the nine justices are in favor of sanctioning same-sex marriage .
However , Arkansas Gov . Asa Hutchinson , a Republican , called the court ’ s thinking on the issue “ a little bit unpredictable . ”
“ I think they could continue to give some deference to the states , but I do think we ’ ll probably have to clearly recognize what happens in another state , ” Mr. Hutchinson said on “ Meet the Press . ”
The Supreme Court has affirmed that states have the constitutional right to create marriage policies — which is why it struck down the federal government ’ s Defense of Marriage Act in the 2013 Windsor case , Gene Schaerr , former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and Chief Justice Warren E. Burger , told a recent briefing at the Family Research Council .
The Defense of Marriage Act was overturned precisely because it overrode states ’ rights in domestic policies , he explained . It would be “ a monumental act of judicial hypocrisy ” for the high court to “ turn Windsor around ” and force states to adopt same-sex marriage .
The high court needs to “ stick with ” the logic of Judge Jeffrey S. Sutton ’ s majority opinion for the 6th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals , Caleb Dalton , litigation counsel of Alliance Defending Freedom , said at a briefing at ADF offices Friday .
Moreover , if the high court agrees that the cases deserve only rational-basis review , states can show they have multiple , legitimate reasons to keep marriage laws as the union of one man and one woman , Mr. Dalton said .

“ If the question is ‘ who decides who you marry , the government or the individual , ’ under our case law , under our system of equality and liberty , it ’ s the individual and not the government , ” said Ms. Bonauto , who won the first state gay marriage victory in Massachusetts in 2003 .
Mr. Hallward-Driemeier , a partner in Ropes & Gray law firm , will argue that states must recognize one another ’ s legal marriages .
“ Separate but equal , ” anti-miscegenation laws , and rules that men , but not women , have legal domestic rights have all been overturned and discarded by courts , he said .
“ What ’ s at stake on our question is the ability for marriage to fulfill its purpose , which is to provide stability and security for the couple and their children , ” Mr. Hallward-Driemeier said . There are “ huge implications ” for a couple who is legally married , but then moves to another state where their union is not recognized , he added .
The attorneys said they welcomed the additional arguments from U.S . Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. , in favor of gay marriage .
Referring to private talks with colleagues , Mr. Hallward-Driemeier said it is wonderful that the day has finally come “ when the United States ’ legal representative is standing beside gay and lesbian couples to argue that they can not be denied the right to marry . That is something to celebrate , and we absolutely do . ”

He recently told The Detroit News that when he enters the high court Tuesday , he will again do something he has done before for luck — “ reach out and touch the foot ” of the 132-year-old statue of former Chief Justice John Marshall .
Having argued before the court eight times should also be a strength , Mr. Bursch told The Detroit News . “ I know the justices very well and they know me . I think that ’ s helpful if you ’ re walking into the court , ” he told The News .
Mr. Bursch will have 45 minutes to explain why states , such as Michigan and Kentucky , have the right to decide a core domestic policy like marriage .
“ It has to be decided at the ballot box , and not through the courts , ” he told The News .
Joseph F. Whalen , associate solicitor general for Tennessee , will represent states , such as Ohio , Kentucky and Tennessee , in arguing that they have the right to decide which legal unions they will recognize .
Mr. Whalen has not given press interviews , but in his brief to the Supreme Court , he argued that there is no fundamental right to same-sex marriage , and some states can not impose their policy choices on other states .
Some 147 friend-of-the-court briefs were filed in the cases , which is known by its lead case James Obergefell v. Richard Hodges , director of the Ohio Department of Health .
Tony Perkins , president of the Family Research Council , said Sunday that if anything , a court ruling in favor of recognizing same-sex marriage in all 50 states will inflame the debate .
“ The courts are not going to settle this issue .

Of 104 immigrants who told an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer that they were afraid of being put in detention because of their sexual orientation or gender identity between October 2013 and October 2014 , 81 were placed in detention anyway , according to records obtained from ICE via a Freedom of Information Act request .
These detentions appear to violate ICE 's policies for how unauthorized immigrants living in the US are treated after they 're apprehended by immigration agents .
The government does n't have to detain every immigrant who 's apprehended , even if it 's seeking to deport him or her . Instead , it can release an immigrant under virtual supervision ( like an ankle bracelet ) or simply under the supervision of a lawyer , and tell him or her to show up in court for a deportation hearing . ( Because many LGBTQ immigrants might qualify for asylum in the US , since they 'd be persecuted due to sexual orientation in their home countries , it 's particularly likely that they 'd show up to court to make their asylum case . )
According to ICE , immigrants who 'd be vulnerable in detention because of their sexual orientation or gender identity are recommended for release unless the law requires it — and officers are n't supposed to overrule that recommendation unless they have a very good reason .
`` I feel very confident that when someone is processed , when we have the information about their vulnerabilities and we can put that into the system , we 're making good decisions , '' one ICE official who spoke on condition of anonymity told ███ .
ICE claims it 's done a lot to improve the treatment of LGBTQ immigrants since President Obama took office in 2009 . But given the risk of sexual abuse in detention , advocates are saying , it makes no sense for ICE to be putting LGBTQ immigrants in detention at all except in extreme cases .
The fight over LGBTQ detention is just another round in a battle between the Obama administration and immigration activists that stretches back to 2009 . Advocates complain the administration is n't doing enough to protect unauthorized immigrants , especially vulnerable immigrants like children , families , and LGBTQ individuals . The administration keeps putting out policies telling ICE agents to use their judgment and protect vulnerable immigrants , but advocates say that agents do n't follow through .
But there 's also a difference of principle between the administration and advocates . For the administration , the goal is making detention safer for LGBTQ immigrants . Advocates are asking : why are they being detained at all ?
Prison rape is a tremendous problem , and it 's an especially tremendous problem for LGBTQ inmates . The most recent Bureau of Justice Statistics survey of sexual assault in prisons and jails in the US found that 11.9 percent of LGBTQ men and 9.4 percent of LGBTQ women had been sexually abused by another inmate , and 6 percent of LGBTQ men and 3 percent of LGBTQ women had been assaulted by a guard . ( For comparison , only 1 percent of straight men and 3.6 percent of straight women said they 'd been sexually victimized by another inmate ; only 2 percent of straight men and 1.4 percent of straight women were abused by a guard . )
It 's harder to get data on sexual assault in immigration detention , but indications are that it 's no less of a problem there . A Fusion analysis of a 2013 government report about sexual abuse in immigration detention found that even though transgender immigrants made up only one of every 500 detainees , they accounted for one of every five cases of sexual assault the Government Accountability Office was able to confirm . ( In a majority of cases , the government was n't able to determine whether an assault had happened . )
Journalists and advocates have repeatedly uncovered stories of LGBTQ immigrants who suffered repeated abuse in detention — particularly transgender women , who are placed in detention with men . In January , advocates started a campaign to demand the release of Nicoll Hernandez-Polanco , a Guatemalan transgender woman who was put into detention after she came to the US to seek asylum . Hernandez-Polanco reported that she 'd been routinely groped by guards and referred to as `` it , '' and that she was put in solitary confinement for `` insolence '' when she tried to stand up for herself . ( She was released from detention in early May . )
The Obama administration has put effort into developing new policies to improve detention conditions , and they put special emphasis on their efforts to improve treatment of LGBTQ immigrants . They emphasize that they have a `` zero tolerance '' policy for sexual abuse in detention facilities , and that an immigrant should not be put in solitary confinement just because of gender identity or sexual orientation . And they take great pains to point to a detention center in California that has a special unit for gay , bisexual , and transgender inmates .
Immigrants might be afraid to out themselves after being apprehended
To decide whether to detain an individual immigrant , ICE goes through an evaluation called the Risk Classification Assessment ( RCA ) . The evaluation collects a lot of details about the immigrant 's case , weighs them according to a computer formula , and then generates an automated recommendation about what ICE should do with her .
The automated recommendation is n't binding — ICE officials can decide to override it . But the agency stresses that it 's a useful tool to help individual officers adhere to the department 's priorities and properly implement prosecutorial discretion . ( In some cases , federal law requires that an immigrant be detained — in those cases , ICE still runs the risk evaluation but uses it to figure out how the immigrant should be detained . )
One of the instructions to ICE officers administering the evaluation : `` Ask the individual if he/she fears any harm in detention based on his/her sexual orientation or gender identity . ''
Both ICE and advocates stress that a lot of LGBTQ immigrants probably do n't want to out themselves after they 've been taken into custody . The evaluation `` is only as good as the data we get , '' one ICE official who spoke on condition of anonymity told ███ . So it 's almost certain that far more than 104 LGBTQ immigrants came into ICE custody between October 2013 and October 2014 . But only 104 were willing to acknowledge it or understood the question being asked .
Here 's what happens when an immigrant acknowledges that he or she is afraid of detention because of gender identity or sexual orientation , according to the ICE official : if US law does n't require them to be detained , `` the RCA will recommend that the officer process them for release . '' That release could come with conditions , or could involve other monitoring like an ankle bracelet — but it 's definitely not a recommendation for detention . If federal law does require that an LGBTQ immigrant get placed in detention , ICE says , it will use the evaluation to make sure she 's put in a facility that will protect her from sexual abuse .
ICE agents often choose to detain an LGBTQ immigrant when the evaluation does n't recommend it
The problem is that is n't what the data shows at all . According to the records obtained by the Center for American Progress , in 81 of the 104 cases where an immigrant said he or she feared being put in detention because of sexual orientation or gender identity , ICE detained him or her anyway .
In almost two-thirds ( 64 percent ) of the 104 cases , it appears the automated assessment did n't even make a recommendation . The records obtained by CAP show the result of the assessment as `` Officer to Determine '' — which , according to a DHS Inspector General report about detention , means it 's entirely left up to ICE officials to decide .
ICE maintains that its evaluation always produces a recommendation , and it 's just a question of whether the officer follows the recommendation or not . When I asked the ICE official about cases in which the risk evaluation makes no recommendation , the official replied , `` The RCA always produces a result . It always produces one , either to detain or not to detain . ''
But the data shows ICE officials had a lot more leeway to make decisions than that . And most of the time , they did n't use that discretion on behalf of the immigrant . In two-thirds of the cases where the automated evaluation made no recommendation — in circumstances where , again , ICE says it should automatically recommend release — agents chose to put the immigrant in detention . ( That 's about the same rate as the general immigrant population , according to the Inspector General . )
Despite what the ICE official told ███ , in only six of the 104 cases did the risk evaluation recommend that an LGBTQ immigrant get released . But in four of those cases , according to the FOIA data , ICE overruled that recommendation and detained the immigrant anyway .
The administration says it 's improving . But how can anyone tell ?
ICE maintains that the way it treats immigrants with `` special vulnerabilities , '' such as LGBTQ immigrants , has n't changed since it put the automated evaluation in place in 2012 . It does n't appear to have been following those policies from October 2013 to October 2014 . But that does n't necessarily mean the agency is n't started following them now .
ICE says the formula it uses to make an automatic recommendation is an `` evolving tool . '' What officers are supposed to do has n't changed ; instead , they 've changed the automated system so that it 's more in line with the instructions that ICE agents have .
In particular , ICE says , it made some big changes to the risk evaluation at the beginning of 2014 , so that ICE stopped focusing so much on detaining people who might run away and focused more on detaining people who were dangers to public safety . As a result , when it comes to all detainees — not just LGBTQ immigrants — ICE officials went from overruling the evaluation 's recommendations about 20 percent of the time in 2013 to less than 8 percent of the time in 2014 .
There 's no way of knowing how many of the 104 LGBTQ immigrants came in in the last few months of 2013 , before the evaluation was changed . And there 's no way of knowing whether immigrants who are taken into ICE custody now are getting released more often . But ICE wo n't say that the older data is unrepresentative , and is n't releasing new data to show there 's been a change .
And it maintains that the basic way the evaluation works — always recommending that someone get detained or released , and recommending that LGBTQ immigrants get released whenever the law allows it — has n't changed since the system was put in place .
So in order to trust that ICE is getting it right now , advocates would have to assume the agency knows it was screwing up before and just wo n't admit it .","American immigration officials frequently choose to detain LGBTQ immigrants — even when their own evaluation system recommends release, putting them at significant risk for sexual abuse, new documents provided by the Center for American Progress show.

It has to do with another revelation, one deeply personal. His 21-year-old son, Will, is gay.

""He wanted to tell us that there's something about him that we didn't know,"" Portman said, reflecting on the day two years ago his son Will first told his parents he was gay.

Portman quickly added that it ""of course hasn't changed our view of him at all.""",www.cnn.com,left,Ah3mphkv5MxGWQ3i

But Kennedy’s concerns sounded different from the liberals. Rather than a fairness question for gays, his questions focussed on the traditional right of states to define marriage.

That difference could result in a decision that wipes DOMA from the books and provides federal benefits to same-sex married couples, but stops short of declaring that all government distinctions based on sexual orientation be subject to “heightened scrutiny” by the courts — a landmark decision gay rights advocates hoped for.

“You are at real risk of running in conflict with what has always been thought to be the essence of the state police power, which is to regulate marriage, divorce, custody,” Kennedy said. He suggested the law was “not consistent with the historic commitment of marriage and of questions of the rights of children to the state.”

The U.S. Court of Appeals covering much of the Midwest has become the third federal appeals court to strike down gay-marriage bans — this time in Wisconsin and Indiana.

Writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, Judge Richard Posner, a Reagan appointee, said that Wisconsin and Indiana had given the court ""no reasonable basis"" for forbidding same-sex marriage. Indeed, he said, ""The only rationale that the states put forward with any conviction is ... so full of holes that it cannot be taken seriously.""

Two other federal appeals courts have reached similar conclusions: the 10th Circuit, which struck down gay-marriage bans in Utah and Oklahoma, and the 4th Circuit, which struck down Virginia's ban on same-sex marriage. All three cases are being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is widely expected to take on the issue before the end of its current term in June.

As to the Indiana and Wisconsin cases decided on Thursday, Judge Posner wrote that at their ""deepest level"" they are about ""the welfare of American children."" The argument that the states ""press hardest,"" he noted, is that they ""seek to encourage marriage"" between a man and a woman as a way of protecting children who can be the product of accidental pregnancies. And, he said, states argue if the biological parents aren't married, the children are often abandoned to a single parent or foster care. ""Overlooked by this argument,"" said Posner, is that many of those children are adopted by homosexual couples, and ""would be better off both emotionally and economically if their adoptive parents were married.""

The tone of Posner's opinion was almost as scathing as his questions were just 10 days ago when the two cases were argued.

What’s happening

The Supreme Court on Monday issued a landmark ruling for LGBTQ rights.

By a 6-3 vote, the court ruled that the 1964 Civil Rights Act — which bans workplace discrimination based on sex, race and religion — also applies to sexual orientation. Prior to the decision, it was legal in a majority of states for employees to be fired for being gay, bisexual or transgender.

Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch broke with their conservative colleagues to join the four liberal justices in the court ruling. In the majority opinion, Gorsuch wrote that it’s impossible to fire someone for being gay or transgender without discriminating against them based on sex.

In a dissenting opinion, Justice Samuel Alito called the decision a “brazen abuse of our authority” and accused the majority of imposing modern sensibilities on a law that was never intended to consider LGBTQ rights.

Why there’s debate

The decision has been celebrated as a major victory for LGBTQ Americans, on par with the Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage in 2015. At its most basic level, the ruling provides them with legal protections from discrimination in the workplace. But some legal experts say it may lead to broader changes. The reasoning within the majority opinion could provide precedent for a future expansion of LGBTQ rights in education, housing, government services and other areas, they argue.

Some activists have cautioned against overreacting to the ruling, which they see as a positive step in an ongoing effort that still has a long way to go. This is especially true for transgender people, who just last week had antidiscrimination protections in health care rolled back by the Trump administration.

Beyond the legal implications, the case could also have a significant political impact. For many social conservatives, Trump’s appointments of Supreme Court justices like Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh have been a way to rationalize supporting a president whose behavior in other areas would normally turn them away — to the point where “But, Gorsuch” has become a popular meme in right-wing internet circles. Gorsuch’s move in favor of expanding LGBTQ rights throws a wrench into that calculus. Some influential religious conservative groups could decide to pull back support for Trump in his reelection bid if they don’t feel they’re getting their side of the bargain fulfilled, political analysts say.

What’s next

It may be several years before the true implications of Monday’s ruling are clear. The court is likely to hear more cases about LGBTQ rights in the near future. Each case will provide an opportunity to expand upon or contradict the precedent set this week.

There is also an ongoing push in the legislative branch to widen LGBTQ rights. Democrats in the House passed a bill that would expand antidiscrimination laws to the whole country, but the bill has stalled in the Republican-led Senate.

Perspectives

The decision is a huge win for LGBTQ rights, regardless of what happens next

“For LGBTQ Americans, this is a watershed moment — one that’s decades overdue, and one that rivals the legalization of same-sex marriage in terms of what it means for our lives.” — John D. Sutter, CNN

The ruling could lead to a major expansion of antidiscrimination rules

“Experts say the ruling could have ramifications beyond employment — with this new Supreme Court precedent, it will be difficult to justify federal, state, and local nondiscrimination policies that include sex but exclude gender identity and sexual orientation.” — Laura Thompson, Mother Jones

The ruling could hurt Trump’s support among religious conservatives

“Legal conservatives have long justified their support for Trump by citing his success at placing like-minded jurists on the federal bench, with Gorsuch as the foremost example of their victory. Monday’s ruling suggests that the reliably conservative Supreme Court majority sought for so long by right-wing legal activists may not be quite as reliable as it seems — and that their moral and ethical sacrifices to pursue it may have been in vain.” — Matt Ford, New Republic

The Republican Party has been doing some soul-searching in the wake of the November election , where voters elected President Obama to a second term and Democrats picked up seats in the House and the Senate - overcoming the Republican attempts to blame Obama for the sluggish economy and high unemployment .
The Republican National Committee released a post-election report last month that said the GOP could broaden its appeal to young voters by making sure they “ do not see the Party as totally intolerant of alternative points of view . ”
“ Already , there is a generational difference within the conservative movement about issues involving the treatment and rights of gays — and for many younger voters , these issues are a gateway into whether the party is a place where they want to be , ” the report said . “ If our party is not welcoming and inclusive , young people and increasingly other voters with continue to tune us out . ”
“ We need to campaign among Hispanic , black , Asian , and gay Americans and demonstrate that we care about them , ” the report said .

But as several justices noted in forceful dissents , the war between religious and LGBT rights is far from over .
In a landmark opinion , a divided Supreme Court ruled that states can not ban same-sex marriage , establishing a new civil right and handing gay and lesbian advocates a long-sought victory .
President Barack Obama , speaking after the highly anticipated ruling , urged those celebrating to keep in mind that many Americans oppose same-sex marriage `` based on sincere and deeply held beliefs . '' Those beliefs , he suggested , should remain a protected part of the country 's `` deep commitment to religious freedom . ''
Still , fierce battles over religious and LGBT rights , like the one fought this spring in Indiana , seem likely to intensify across the country after Obergefell v. Hodges .
While polls show that a majority of religious Americans now support same-sex marriage , many prominent groups -- such as the Catholic Church , the Southern Baptist Convention and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints -- do not . Leaders from those groups pledged on Friday to seek legal means to shield their beliefs from state interference .
In his sweeping decision , Justice Anthony Kennedy , who wrote for the majority , briefly mentioned faith groups ' right to object to same-sex marriage .
`` The First Amendment ensures that religions , those who adhere to religious doctrines and others have protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths , '' Kennedy said .
`` It must be emphasized that religions , and those who adhere to religious doctrines , may continue to advocate with utmost , sincere conviction that , by divine precepts , same-sex marriage should not be condoned . ''
But more conservative justices and a number of religious groups chided Kennedy for failing to mention the First Amendment 's `` free exercise '' clause .
Religious rights ( and rites ) are n't limited to preaching and teaching , they argued . They also entail individuals ' and organizations ' `` free exercise '' of faith , a wide swath of activities that run from sacred ceremonies to performing charitable works and running businesses according to religious principles .
`` Religious liberty is about freedom of action in matters of religion generally , '' Justice Clarence Thomas said in his dissent , `` and the scope of that liberty is directly correlated to the civil restraints placed upon religious practice . ''
He dismissed the majority 's nod toward religious liberty as a `` weak gesture , '' arguing that the ruling could have `` ruinous consequences . ''
`` In our society , marriage is not simply a governmental institution ; it is a religious institution as well , '' Thomas said . `` Today 's decision might change the former , but it can not change the latter . ''
Friday 's decision makes it `` all but inevitable , '' the conservative justice said , that competing definitions of marriage will come into conflict . Thomas suggested that pastors and churches will be confronted with demands to participate in and endorse same-sex marriages .
There is historical precedent for such demands , Thomas said , citing Virginia laws that once imposed criminal penalties on pastors who presided over mixed-race marriages .
Chief Justice John Roberts said `` hard questions '' will arise when people of faith exercise their religious liberty in ways that conflict with the new right to same-sex marriage .
What happens , the chief justice asked , when a religious college provides student housing only to heterosexual couples ? Or a faith-based adoption agency refuses to place children with same-sex spouses ? Would both lose their tax exemptions ?
`` There is little doubt that these and similar questions will soon be before this Court , '' Roberts continued . `` Unfortunately , people of faith can take no comfort in the treatment they receive from the majority today . ''
Justice Antonin Scalia , in his signature scathing style , took the argument even further , accusing his colleagues of playing God .
The conservative justice said that Friday 's ruling on same-sex marriage `` is not of special importance to me . ''
`` It is of overwhelming importance , however , who it is that rules me , '' Scalia said . `` Today 's decree says that my Ruler , and the Ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast , is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court . ''
Archbishop William Lori of Baltimore , the U.S. Catholic bishops ' point-man on religious rights , said Friday 's ruling will affect `` thousands '' of state and local statutes across the country . The archbishop said he could foresee `` a lot of legal controversies in terms of the way we organize and run our ministries . ''
Most troubling for the Catholic Church , Lori said in a conference call with the media , is that while ruling recognizes religious groups ' right to free speech , it does n't acknowledge `` the right to follow our teachings when we are intersecting with the broader society . ''
Evangelicals , too , who make up about 25 % of the country 's population , pledged to fight the legal implications of Friday 's ruling .
`` In the coming years , evangelical institutions could be pressed to sacrifice their sacred beliefs about marriage and sexuality in order to accommodate whatever demands the culture and law require , '' dozens of prominent evangelicals said in a joint statement .
`` We will not allow the government to coerce or infringe upon the rights of institutions to live by the sacred belief that only men and women can enter into marriage . ''
One of the statement 's signees , Russell Moore , president of the Southern Baptist Convention 's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission , called `` religious liberty '' the `` next front in the skirmish in American life . ''
The skirmish will likely endure for years , Moore said at a press conference on Friday , with casualties on both sides .
`` One of the most tragic results we could possibly see is an unrelenting cultural war from progressives toward those who dissent because of deeply held religious convictions .

A party broke out on the steps of the Supreme Court when its ruling affirming the right of same-sex couples to marry was announced . For the record , the case was called Obergefell v. Hodges .
And in the middle of the noise and jubilation , Jim Obergefell got a phone call from President Obama :
`` Your leadership on this has changed the country , '' Mr. Obama said .
`` I really appreciate that , Mr. President , '' Obergefell said . `` It 's really been an honor for me to be involved in this fight , and to have been able to fight for my marriage and live up to my commitments to my husband . ''
Jim Obergefell and John Arthur had been together more than 20 years when they were married in July of 2013 .

All Obergefell wanted was to be listed as `` husband '' on Arthur 's Ohio death certificate .
As he told ███ correspondent Jan Crawford , `` I promised John . It was one more promise I made to him that I would fight for him . I would fight for our marriage wherever that led . ''

Headlines in recent days tell the story : “ Support for gay marriage is soaring ” ( Washington Post ) “ Why Republicans Are Saying ‘ I Do ’ to Gay Marriage ” ( Time ) “ The Normalization of Gay Marriage ” ( The Atlantic ) “ Millennial Support For Gay Marriage Hits All-Time High ” ( Huffington Post )
The stories and the shift in public opinion they reflect are most challenging to Republicans .
When Sen . Rob Portman of Ohio came out for same-sex marriage recently ( because his son is gay ) , fellow Republicans professed their personal support for him while gently disagreeing with his newly-declared stance .
New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie – who faces re-election this year and is considered to be a strong possible candidate for president in 2016 – wrestled rhetorically over whether he would sign a proposed law outlawing so-called “ conversion therapy , ” the controversial practice which seeks to make those who see themselves as homosexual “ convert ” to heterosexuals .
“ I ’ m of two minds just on this stuff in general . No . 1 , I think there should be lots of deference given to parents on raising their children , ” Gov . Christie said at a news conference last week . “ I don ’ t – this is a general philosophy , not to his bill – generally , philosophically , on bills that restrict parents ’ ability to make decisions on how to care for their children , I ’ m generally a skeptic of those bills . Now there can always be exceptions to those rules , and this bill may be one of them . ”
Ohio Gov . John Kasich said he was for civil unions , but ( through a spokesman ) quickly retracted that .
Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia tried to deflect the issue with a quip that drew snickers : “ I 'm not gay , so I 'm not going to marry one . ''
Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky – a hot prospect for the 2016 presidential race – fell back on his libertarian/states right leanings . “ I don ’ t want the government promoting something I don ’ t believe in , but I also don ’ t mind if the government tries to be neutral on the issue , ” he told Fox News Sunday – which would mean that the Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA ( one of the Supreme Court cases ) would no longer apply .
Ken Mehlman , a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and head of the 2004 Bush re-election campaign who came out of the closet in 2010 , gathered signatures from 131 prominent Republicans to file a friend-of-the-court brief in the other case before the Supreme Court – a challenge to California ’ s Proposition 8 , the 2008 ballot measure which defines marriage in the state constitution as a legal union of one man and one woman .
Asked on Fox News Sunday if he could imagine the next Republican nominee for the White House supporting gay marriage , Karl Rove said he can .
Margaret Hoover , a former George W. Bush White House aide and a leading Republican Party operative , agrees .
“ At the rate this issue is changing within the party , I think it ’ s not out of the question , ” she told Time .
According to the polls the issue is changing more rapidly with the public than it is with the GOP .
Some 58 percent of Americans now say gay and lesbian couples should be allowed to get married , according to the latest Washington Post/ABC poll . Nine years ago , support for gay marriage was just 32 percent , and just three years ago it was less than half at 47 percent .
Meanwhile , the Pew Research Center finds that among “ millenials ” ( those born after 1980 ) , support has soared to 70 percent from 51 percent when President Obama took office in 2009 . The Post/ABC poll finds that 81 percent of adults under 30 support same-sex marriage . As Pew points out , millenials as a portion of the adult population have grown from 9 percent to 27 percent over the past decade .

Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus took the same tack in comments to reporters this past week .
“ I think Senator Portman made some pretty big inroads last week , ” Mr. Priebus said . “ I think it ’ s about being decent . I think it ’ s about dignity and respect , that nobody deserves to have their dignity diminished , or people don ’ t deserve to be disrespected . I think that there isn ’ t anyone in this room – Republican , Democrat , in the middle – that doesn ’ t think that Rob Portman , for example , is a good , conservative Republican . He is . And we know that . ”","As elected officials and pundits wait to hear US Supreme Court arguments in two gay marriage cases this week, they find the political ground on this hottest of social issues rapidly shifting beneath them.

Headlines in recent days tell the story: “Support for gay marriage is soaring” (Washington Post) “Why Republicans Are Saying ‘I Do’ to Gay Marriage” (Time) “The Normalization of Gay Marriage” (The Atlantic) “Millennial Support For Gay Marriage Hits All-Time High” (Huffington Post)

The stories and the shift in public opinion they reflect are most challenging to Republicans.

When Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio came out for same-sex marriage recently (because his son is gay), fellow Republicans professed their personal support for him while gently disagreeing with his newly-declared stance.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie – who faces re-election this year and is considered to be a strong possible candidate for president in 2016 – wrestled rhetorically over whether he would sign a proposed law outlawing so-called “conversion therapy,” the controversial practice which seeks to make those who see themselves as homosexual “convert” to heterosexuals.

“I’m of two minds just on this stuff in general. No. 1, I think there should be lots of deference given to parents on raising their children,” Gov. Christie said at a news conference last week. “I don’t – this is a general philosophy, not to his bill – generally, philosophically, on bills that restrict parents’ ability to make decisions on how to care for their children, I’m generally a skeptic of those bills. Now there can always be exceptions to those rules, and this bill may be one of them.”

Ohio Gov. John Kasich said he was for civil unions, but (through a spokesman) quickly retracted that.

Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia tried to deflect the issue with a quip that drew snickers: “I'm not gay, so I'm not going to marry one.""

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky – a hot prospect for the 2016 presidential race – fell back on his libertarian/states right leanings. “I don’t want the government promoting something I don’t believe in, but I also don’t mind if the government tries to be neutral on the issue,” he told Fox News Sunday – which would mean that the Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA (one of the Supreme Court cases) would no longer apply.

Ken Mehlman, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and head of the 2004 Bush re-election campaign who came out of the closet in 2010, gathered signatures from 131 prominent Republicans to file a friend-of-the-court brief in the other case before the Supreme Court – a challenge to California’s Proposition 8, the 2008 ballot measure which defines marriage in the state constitution as a legal union of one man and one woman.

Asked on Fox News Sunday if he could imagine the next Republican nominee for the White House supporting gay marriage, Karl Rove said he can.

Margaret Hoover, a former George W. Bush White House aide and a leading Republican Party operative, agrees.

“At the rate this issue is changing within the party, I think it’s not out of the question,” she told Time.

According to the polls the issue is changing more rapidly with the public than it is with the GOP.

Some 58 percent of Americans now say gay and lesbian couples should be allowed to get married, according to the latest Washington Post/ABC poll. Nine years ago, support for gay marriage was just 32 percent, and just three years ago it was less than half at 47 percent.

Meanwhile, the Pew Research Center finds that among “millenials” (those born after 1980), support has soared to 70 percent from 51 percent when President Obama took office in 2009. The Post/ABC poll finds that 81 percent of adults under 30 support same-sex marriage. As Pew points out, millenials as a portion of the adult population have grown from 9 percent to 27 percent over the past decade.

None of this is news to the GOP, which clearly lost this portion of the electorate in last year’s presidential election, when the party platform advocated a marriage amendment to the Constitution and defended the Boy Scouts of America’s ban on gay scouts and troop leaders.

Today, the party’s effort to rebrand itself assumes a softer tone regarding gay rights as part of an overall effort to appear (if not become) more inclusive.

Tuesday ’ s case could settle the standoff in California over gay marriage , and the second case , to be argued Wednesday , challenges a federal law that only recognizes marriages of one man and one woman , preventing gay couples from accessing the benefits afforded straight couples .
Taken together , the two cases could permit the nation ’ s highest court to answer important questions about the legality of gay marriage and how sexual orientation should be treated when equal rights are an issue .
Thousands of protesters for and against gay marriage gathered at the Capitol and Supreme Court to make their voices heard .
On Tuesday , in a packed courtroom , the high court heard oral arguments in Hollingsworth v. Perry , a case involving the constitutionality of Proposition 8 , a voter-passed California initiative that defines marriage as only the unions of one man and one woman .
A key area of inquiry was what would happen if the court struck down Proposition 8 .
SEE ALSO : Both sides optimistic , uncertain as gay marriage arguments end
Would the ruling be limited to legalizing gay marriage in California ? justices asked . Or would it also force a few other states that have domestic partnerships or civil unions to convert them to marriage ? Or would it become a national ruling , forcing all states to strike down their man-woman marriage laws ?
“ The problem with the case is that you ’ re really asking , particularly because of the sociological evidence you cite , for us to go into uncharted waters , ” observed Associate Justice Anthony M. Kennedy .
Former Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson , representing two same-sex couples who want to overturn Proposition 8 , responded that the high court had ventured into the unknown in 1967 when it struck down laws banning interracial marriage .
Mr. Olson ’ s answer wasn ’ t completely satisfying for Justice Kennedy , but he and the other justices moved on , posing a wide range of questions to Mr. Olson ; Charles J. Cooper , who represented Dennis Hollingsworth and other supporters of Proposition 8 ; and Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. , who came as a friend of the court in support of Mr. Olson ’ s side .
Mr. Cooper was asked about the legal injuries to some 37,000 children being raised by gay couples who can not marry . “ The voice of those children is important in this case , don ’ t you think ? ” asked Justice Kennedy .
Mr. Cooper ’ s answer was that there wasn ’ t any data on such a subject .
Associate Justice Stephen G. Breyer also wanted to know why marriage — as a procreative institution — is not good for gay couples but OK for opposite-sex couples who can ’ t have children . “ Couples that aren ’ t gay but can ’ t have children get married all the time , ” Justice Breyer said to Mr. Cooper .
“ The concern is that redefining marriage as a genderless institution will sever its abiding connection to its historic traditional , procreative purposes , ” Mr. Cooper replied . It ’ s also a concern , he added , to have the age-old institution of marriage refocused “ away from the raising of children ” to something that meets the “ emotional needs and desires of adults . ”
Proposition 8 , Mr. Olson said , “ walls off ” marriage from gay and lesbian couples , “ labeling their most cherished relationships as second-rate , different , unequal and not OK . ”
But then he was asked pointedly if California gay couples — who already have all the rights and responsibilities in marriage in domestic partnerships — are just after the “ label ” of marriage .
Since they have every other right , “ all you ’ re interested in is the label and you insist on changing the definition of the label . It ’ s just about the label , ” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said .
Mr. Olson countered by saying that “ there are certain labels in this country that are very , very critical , ” and marriage has “ a status . ”
Chief Justice Roberts agreed , but added that “ maybe it is the procreative aspect that makes it a fundamental right . ”
Even the brief history of gay marriage was delved into , with Associate Justice Samuel Anthony Alito Jr. noting that such nuptials are “ newer than cellphones or the Internet , ” while Associate Justice Antonin Scalia repeatedly asked Mr. Olson about exactly “ when ” it become unconstitutional to prohibit gays from marriage .
“ We don ’ t prescribe law for the future . We decide what the law is , ” said Justice Scalia . “ I ’ m curious — when did it become unconstitutional to exclude homosexual couples from marriage ? 1791 ? 1868 , when the 14th Amendment was adopted ? ”
Mr. Olson tried to answer rhetorically , saying the same could be asked of school segregation and interracial-marriage bans . “ Don ’ t give me a question to my question , ” Justice Scalia replied , but even as the audience laughed , the justice pressed again on , asking again , “ when ” did the Constitution change on marriage ?
“ There ’ s no specific date in time , ” Mr. Olson finally responded . “ This is an evolutionary cycle . ”
“ Well , how am I supposed to know how to decide a case … if you can ’ t give me a date when the Constitution changes ? ” Justice Scalia said .
After the court session ended , many media pundits concluded that Proposition 8 has no chance of being upheld , and the only questions are how the court would strike it down .
If the court dismisses the case with no ruling at all , it is widely believed that an outcome would almost certainly allow gay marriages to resume in California .
The session , which ran about 80 minutes long , riveted the 400 people in the courtroom , which included actor-director Rob Reiner , who opposes Proposition 8 ; and leading gay-rights lawyers including Mary L. Bonauto of the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders , and Evan Wolfson , leader of Freedom to Marry .
Andrew Pugno , general counsel of ProtectMarriage.com , which petitioned the court with Dennis Hollingsworth and others , to hear its case to uphold Proposition 8 , said he thought the hearing went “ very well ” and that Mr. Cooper spoke clearly on their behalf .
“ We have every confidence that the nine justices will resist the political pressure to prematurely end the national debate about the definition of marriage , ” he said , adding that gay marriage is “ a social experiment that needs no special protection by or recognition from the U.S. Supreme Court . ”
President Obama , who personally supports same-sex marriage , received updates at the White House on Tuesday about the oral arguments , and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler were among the White House officials who attended the oral arguments .
White House press secretary Jay Carney said public officials who are expressing support for same-sex marriage , and polls reflecting more public support for it , are a “ welcome phenomenon . ”
“ The president has noted … the transformation that ’ s been taking place in American society on these issues , ” Mr. Carney said . “ It is a recognition by an increasing number of Americans that gay and lesbian Americans ought not to be discriminated against . And it reflects his core beliefs on these issues . ”
Mr. Verrilli , representing the Justice Department , also took part in Tuesday ’ s oral arguments , saying in part that states with same-sex “ civil unions ” also should be required to accept full recognition of gay marriage as well .

lgbt_rights,Reason,2,http://reason.com/blog/2017/04/17/now-that-gorsuch-is-seated-will-supreme,"Now That Gorsuch Is Seated, Will Supreme Court Take Up Gay Wedding Cake Case?",2017-04-17,"Scott Shackford, C.J. Ciaramella, Ira Stoll, David Post, Jacob Sullum, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Eric Boehm, Ilya Somin, Mike Riggs","Today is newly seated Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch 's first day at the office hearing cases . He is apparently not going to be a quiet , Clarence Thomas-style justice and asked several questions during the first case before the court .
Before this morning 's case—which is a procedurally-oriented matter about the processes required appeal federal work discrimination complaints—the Supreme Court released its list of orders from last week 's conference and decided not to take any new cases as yet . Gorsuch did not participate in this last conference but will for the next one .
This matters because the Supreme Court has repeatedly declined to make a decision whether to take a high-profile case about businesses declining to serve gay weddings and has been bumping it to future conferences since last December . It rescheduled the case yet again this morning .
That case is Masterpiece Cakeshop Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission . This is a case about wedding cakes , gay marriage , and whether businesses can decline to provide their goods and services on the basis of religious beliefs . Jack Phillips , owners of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood , Colorado , declined ( all the way back in 2013 ) to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple 's wedding . This decision ran him afoul of Colorado 's public accommodation laws , which forbid discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation .
Phillips ' response , as we have seen in many of these cases , is that he 's not refusing to serve gay people , but he has religious objections to gay marriage and sees being obligated to make a wedding cake as being compelled to put his stamp of approval on it . Courts across the country have disagreed with Phillips and other businesses that serve weddings , like florists and photographers . Courts have thus far declined to accept the argument that refusing to serve gay weddings is somehow different from refusing to serve gay people . Furthermore courts have declined to accept the claim that floral arrangements or wedding cakes are a form of protected expression and that compliance with law compels speech or forces people to compromise their religious beliefs .
That the Supreme Court kept pushing back a decision on whether to take this case until now is significant because they 've already previously rejected to hear a similar fight . A photographer in New Mexico tried to get the court in 2014 to hear their case where the state told them they could n't refuse to provide their services for a gay couple 's wedding . The photography company , like Masterpiece Cakeshop , lost their challenge to the law , and the Supreme Court declined to hear the case .
Now , three years later , the court appears to be delaying a decision at least until Gorsuch has been seated . There have n't been any cases where higher courts have accepted the arguments of the religious shop owners , so there 's no `` split '' that requires the Supreme Court to resolve . Most recently , a florist in Washington State lost her challenge just like the bakery and photographer had before her . It 's possibly significant that the Supreme Court did n't again simply refuse to certify a case that 's very similar to one they 've rejected before .
Damon Root has carefully analyzed what Gorsuch is likely to be bringing to the court here . On Wednesday , the Supreme Court will be hearing a case connected to the boundaries of separation between church and state . The question at hand is whether it 's constitutional for Missouri to withhold grants from a state program funding playground equipment from religious schools . Missouri 's state constitution forbids it ; the religious schools say this counts as religiously motivated discrimination .
The only real fundamental overlap here with the bakery case is the invocation of religious freedom , so be wary of reading too much into any questions Gorsuch might ask in that case . Nevertheless , it 's worthy of noting that the court held on to the bakery case long enough for a ninth justice to be seated before deciding whether to take it . We may find out next Monday .","Today is newly seated Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch's first day at the office hearing cases. He is apparently not going to be a quiet, Clarence Thomas-style justice and asked several questions during the first case before the court.

Before this morning's case—which is a procedurally-oriented matter about the processes required appeal federal work discrimination complaints—the Supreme Court released its list of orders from last week's conference and decided not to take any new cases as yet. Gorsuch did not participate in this last conference but will for the next one.

This matters because the Supreme Court has repeatedly declined to make a decision whether to take a high-profile case about businesses declining to serve gay weddings and has been bumping it to future conferences since last December. It rescheduled the case yet again this morning.

That case is Masterpiece Cakeshop Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. This is a case about wedding cakes, gay marriage, and whether businesses can decline to provide their goods and services on the basis of religious beliefs. Jack Phillips, owners of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colorado, declined (all the way back in 2013) to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple's wedding. This decision ran him afoul of Colorado's public accommodation laws, which forbid discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

Phillips' response, as we have seen in many of these cases, is that he's not refusing to serve gay people, but he has religious objections to gay marriage and sees being obligated to make a wedding cake as being compelled to put his stamp of approval on it. Courts across the country have disagreed with Phillips and other businesses that serve weddings, like florists and photographers. Courts have thus far declined to accept the argument that refusing to serve gay weddings is somehow different from refusing to serve gay people. Furthermore courts have declined to accept the claim that floral arrangements or wedding cakes are a form of protected expression and that compliance with law compels speech or forces people to compromise their religious beliefs.

That the Supreme Court kept pushing back a decision on whether to take this case until now is significant because they've already previously rejected to hear a similar fight. A photographer in New Mexico tried to get the court in 2014 to hear their case where the state told them they couldn't refuse to provide their services for a gay couple's wedding. The photography company, like Masterpiece Cakeshop, lost their challenge to the law, and the Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

Now, three years later, the court appears to be delaying a decision at least until Gorsuch has been seated. There haven't been any cases where higher courts have accepted the arguments of the religious shop owners, so there's no ""split"" that requires the Supreme Court to resolve. Most recently, a florist in Washington State lost her challenge just like the bakery and photographer had before her. It's possibly significant that the Supreme Court didn't again simply refuse to certify a case that's very similar to one they've rejected before.

Damon Root has carefully analyzed what Gorsuch is likely to be bringing to the court here. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will be hearing a case connected to the boundaries of separation between church and state. The question at hand is whether it's constitutional for Missouri to withhold grants from a state program funding playground equipment from religious schools. Missouri's state constitution forbids it; the religious schools say this counts as religiously motivated discrimination.

The only real fundamental overlap here with the bakery case is the invocation of religious freedom, so be wary of reading too much into any questions Gorsuch might ask in that case. Nevertheless, it's worthy of noting that the court held on to the bakery case long enough for a ninth justice to be seated before deciding whether to take it.

The West Village has historically been known as a safe haven for LGBTQ people . People travel from various parts of New York and New Jersey to be in the neighborhood , walk around without feeling judged or to worry that their sexual orientation or gender identity will lead to an attack . But , eight years ago , seven young women learned that safety , even in a haven like the West Village , is never guaranteed .
On August 18 , 2006 , Renata Hill , Terrain Dandridge and five of their friends decided to go to the Village . All were young , black and lesbian . Outside the Independent Film Center ( IFC ) , a small theater showing independent films , they were harassed by a man named Duane Buckle . When they told him they were gay , he threatened them with rape and physically attacked them . He threw his lit cigarette at them , ripped the hair from one woman 's head and choked another woman .
The seven women defended themselves and , at some point during the four-minute fight , were assisted by two unknown men . As Buckle attempted to choke Renata , her friend Patreese Johnson stabbed him with a pen knife . By the time the police arrived , the men who had jumped to the women 's defense had left the scene . Buckle was taken to the hospital , where he stated that men had attacked him , and released a few days later .

Facing the possibility of twenty-five year sentences , three women accepted plea bargains and served six months . The remaining four -- Venice Brown , Terrain Dandridge , Renata Hill and Patreese Johnson -- pled not guilty and became known as the New Jersey Four . They were convicted and received sentences ranging from three-and-a-half to eleven years in prison .
None had ever been involved in a gang , yet they charged with and convicted of gang assault . Their claims of self-defense were ignored .
Out in the Night , a film by blair dorosh-walther released by the Fire This Time The Film LLC , examines how race , sexual orientation and gender violence affect ideas about safety and self-defense , and how each shaped the fates of the New Jersey Four . What happens when women refuse to accept street harassment or homophobic violence ? What happens when these women happen to be black women ?
The documentary places the case of the New Jersey Four in a larger pattern of violence against black people and the legal system 's treatment of their claims to self-defense . It draws parallels between the case of the New Jersey Four with more recent cases involving attacks on black people , such as Trayvon Martin , CeCe McDonald and Marissa Alexander . All three were attacked , all three fought back , and all three were treated as if they were the aggressors by the police and court systems . Although Trayvon Martin was the person killed , the media and legal system treated him as if he 'd been the assailant , subjecting his body to drug testing and speculating about his recent school suspension and cellphone photos as if these justified his killing . McDonald and Alexander 's claims of self-defense were likewise rejected by the courts , and they were both demonized in the media .
Similarly , when the seven women were initially arrested in 2006 , news headlines labeled them a `` lesbian wolf pack '' and `` killer lesbians . '' Meanwhile , The New York Times stated that `` Man is Stabbed in Attack After Admiring a Stranger . '' Evening news segments added more fuel with reports of lesbian gangs ( alternately labeled Gays Taking Over and Dykes Taking Over ) raping young girls .
Attorneys of the New Jersey Four note that the fear-mongering around the case had even reached the courtroom . `` The district attorney made certain decisions , like the charges and holding them without bail , '' noted Susan Tipograph , one of the two trial attorneys for Hill . Those charges influence perceptions even before evidence can be presented , agreed Lori Cohen , Tipograph 's co-counsel . `` There are some charges that , when you hear them , it 's really hard to get below them to what actually happened . '' The charges scared at least one juror who , Tipograph remembered , sent his wife out of town during the course of the trial .
`` Out in the Night '' also challenges viewers to think about the constant threats ( and realities of ) harassment and violence against LGBTQ people , particularly LGBTQ people of color . The film recounts the 2003 murder of Sakia Gunn , a fifteen-year-old high school student and black lesbian . Gunn and her friends had been returning from New York City 's West Village . As they waited for the bus in downtown Newark , they were propositioned by two black men . When the women told them that they were lesbians , the men attacked . One of the men stabbed Gunn in the chest . Her friends flagged down a taxi and took her to the hospital , where she died . The night they were attacked three years later , Patreese recalled , she remembered Gunn and wondered if the same thing would happen to her .
Gunn 's death is neither an anomaly nor is it a relic of the ( not-too-distant ) past . In 2011 , CeCe McDonald , a twenty-three-year-old black woman , faced the same scenario . Walking down a Minneapolis street with her friends , McDonald was first verbally harassed and then physically attacked by people standing outside a bar . One woman smashed glass into McDonald 's face , slicing into her cheek . The man who had instigated the harassment was stabbed during the attack . He was taken to the hospital , where he later died . McDonald was arrested and charged with second-degree murder . The woman who smashed glass into her face was neither arrested nor charged .
During pre-trial motions , the judge ruled against McDonald 's ability to introduce evidence showing that the attack against her was motivated by her race and gender identity : Both Schmitz 's swastika and his three previous convictions for violent assault were ruled inadmissible . The judge also refused to allow an expert witness to testify about the pervasive and systemic violence faced by trans people on a daily basis . Facing the possibility of twenty to forty years in prison and a hostile court , McDonald pled guilty to second-degree manslaughter due to negligence and was sentenced to forty-one months in prison . She was released this past January .
In August 2013 twenty-one-year-old Islan Nettles died after being attacked on a New York City street . While accounts vary as to whether she was flirting with or had been catcalled by 20-year-old Paris Wilson , all agree that , after realizing that she was trans , Wilson beat her unconscious . She died four days later at the hospital . Wilson was originally charged with three counts of misdemeanor assault and released on $ 2000 bail . A few months later , when another man claimed that he had attacked Nettles but was too drunk to remember what had happened , the district attorney dropped the charge altogether , declining to prosecute either .
Why did the legal system treat the death of a young trans woman less seriously than a non-fatal stabbing with a pen knife ? What does this say about the value placed on the lives of black people , particularly LGBTQ black people ? The attacks on Gunn , McDonald , Nettles and the New Jersey Four are only a few examples of the systemic violence faced by LGBTQ people , particularly LGBTQ people of color .

Defending Pence

Most of the 2016 GOP presidential contenders have rushed to defend the embattled Mr. Pence, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who said Thursday that Christians shouldn’t have to chose between their faith and operating their businesses.

lgbt_rights,Fox News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/06/26/conservative-case-for-gay-marriage.html,OPINION: The conservative case for gay marriage,2015-06-26,Richard Grenell,"Led by conservative Justice and Reagan appointee , Anthony Kennedy , the Supreme Court ruled Friday , in a 5-4 decision , in favor of same-sex marriage . Despite the often binary depiction in the media , this decision is in fact a landmark victory for conservative principles . In fact , Friday ’ s decision is a momentous win for the founding principle of the Republican Party : individual liberty .
Consistent conservatives should frame their views in accordance with the fundamental belief that individuals , not governments , have the right to determine the course of their own lives .
Fellow conservatives , particularly within the Republican Party , typically do a good job arguing against totalitarian , one-size-fits-all approaches to policy . What works for a family in New York City , might not work in Jenison , Michigan , or Tulsa , Oklahoma .
It is for this reason that Republicans and conservatives have embraced issues such as school choice , which gives parents the right to choose the method of schooling that best fits their child ’ s needs . Parents , not governments , should decide what is best for their family .
Friday ’ s Supreme Court decision is a momentous win for the founding principle of the Republican Party : individual liberty .
Republicans and American conservatives have also been remarkably consistent on taxation .

The only true conservative position , the individual right of marriage for all , has been affirmed by the Supreme Court . It ’ s time for consistent conservatives to come out in favor of the Court 's ruling .","Led by conservative Justice and Reagan appointee, Anthony Kennedy, the Supreme Court ruled Friday, in a 5-4 decision, in favor of same-sex marriage. Despite the often binary depiction in the media, this decision is in fact a landmark victory for conservative principles. In fact, Friday’s decision is a momentous win for the founding principle of the Republican Party: individual liberty.

Consistent conservatives should frame their views in accordance with the fundamental belief that individuals, not governments, have the right to determine the course of their own lives.

Fellow conservatives, particularly within the Republican Party, typically do a good job arguing against totalitarian, one-size-fits-all approaches to policy. What works for a family in New York City, might not work in Jenison, Michigan, or Tulsa, Oklahoma.

It is for this reason that Republicans and conservatives have embraced issues such as school choice, which gives parents the right to choose the method of schooling that best fits their child’s needs. Parents, not governments, should decide what is best for their family.

Friday’s Supreme Court decision is a momentous win for the founding principle of the Republican Party: individual liberty.

Republicans and American conservatives have also been remarkably consistent on taxation. Consistent conservatives believe people should keep more of the money they work so hard to earn—not because the vulnerable don’t deserve assistance, but because individuals can and will make better, and more effective financial and charitable choices with their money than government bureaucrats.

The list of important conservative positions, all relating back to the fundamental principle of individual choice, goes on and on: property rights; freedom of association; and freedom of speech, etc.

The Defense of Marriage Act denies benefits to same-sex couples
A majority of justices raised questions in oral arguments Wednesday about the federal Defense of Marriage Act , indicating the Supreme Court may strike down a key part of the law that denies legally married same-sex couples the same benefits provided to heterosexual spouses .
A ruling is expected within three months on the constitutionality of the 1996 law that defines marriage for federal purposes as only between one man and one woman .
Wednesday 's arguments concluded two days of presentations before the high court on one of the most prevalent social issues of this era -- the right of gay and lesbian couples to wed and receive the full benefits of law provided to heterosexual couples .
Afterward , Edith `` Edie '' Windsor , 83 , stood on the steps of the courthouse -- near the `` Equal Justice Under Law '' slogan engraved above -- and proclaimed something she hid for decades before her challenge against the act known as DOMA .
`` I am today an out lesbian , OK , who just sued the United States of America , which is kind of overwhelming for me , '' she said . She had just watched almost two hours of oral arguments before the nation 's highest court on how she had to pay higher estate taxes than someone in a heterosexual marriage .
Windsor tried to explain to reporters why she and her late spouse , Thea Spyer , married in New York when the law allowed it after decades together .
Marriage , she said , is `` a magic word , for anyone who does n't understand why we want it and why we need it . ''
`` We did win in the lower court , '' Windsor added , then later predicted : `` I think it 's gon na be good . ''
Under DOMA , Social Security , pension and bankruptcy benefits , along with family medical leave protections and other federal provisions , do not apply to gay and lesbian couples legally married in states that recognize such unions .
Windsor was forced to assume an estate tax bill much larger than heterosexual married couples would have to pay . Because her decades-long partner was a woman , the federal government did not recognize their same-sex marriage in legal terms , even though their home state of New York did .

JUST WATCHED The fight over same-sex marriage Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The fight over same-sex marriage 04:51
The court appeared divided along ideological lines during the arguments about whether DOMA is discriminatory and steps on state marriage laws for gays and lesbians .
If legally married homosexuals were being denied more than 1,100 federal benefits , `` what kind of marriage is that ? '' asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , who said the discriminatory effect is `` pervasive . ''
`` What gives the federal government the right to define marriage ? '' asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor .
The potential swing vote , Justice Anthony Kennedy , also questioned the reach of DOMA , saying it presents a `` real risk of running into traditional state police power to regulate marriage . ''
Kennedy 's point caused court observers to speculate he would join the four normally liberal-leaning justices to create a majority against the act .
On the other side , Chief Justice John Roberts repeatedly asked whether it would step on state power to do the opposite of DOMA -- pass a law providing full federal benefits to any legally married same-sex couple .
When Windsor 's lawyer argued in court there was a `` sea change '' afoot today in support of same-sex marriage that leaves DOMA outdated , Roberts said that is because of `` the political effectiveness of those on your side '' swaying public opinion .
Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia also suggested DOMA could still remain in place as a valid extension of congressional authority , as 41 states do not allow same-sex marriage .
Paul Clement , the high-profile lawyer hired by House Speaker John Boehner and fellow Republican legislators to defend DOMA , suggested the act was passed as a `` cautious approach '' in response to initial efforts in some states to change state marriage laws to include homosexuals .
`` In 1996 something was happening '' in the country , Clement said , adding that Congress wanted to created uniformity in the federal sphere and not sow confusion in states that did not want same-sex marriage .
However , Justice Elena Kagan drew an audible gasp from the packed courtroom by quoting from the official House reports of 17 years ago , when legislators stated one reason to pass DOMA was to `` express moral disapproval '' over gays and lesbians being allowed to wed .
It was not until 2004 that Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage .
No consensus was reached from the bench on the gateway or jurisdictional questions -- whether House Republicans were on solid legal footing when they stepped in and defended the law after President Barack Obama and his Justice Department reversed their position by concluding DOMA was unconstitutional .
The administration changed its mind after initially defending the law before a federal judge hearing the Windsor lawsuit .
Roberts tweaked Obama for not having `` the courage of conviction '' to continue enforcing the law even if he thought it was discriminatory .
At a news conference later Wednesday , House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California called congressional Republicans irresponsible for funding the defense of what she called a discriminatory law at a cost she put at $ 3 million .
`` On the basis of what I heard , the questions of the justices , the response of the participants , I 'm very optimistic that DOMA will be struck down , '' Pelosi said .
To Windsor , Wednesday 's arguments represented another step in the evolving history of gay rights in America .
For years , she said , she wore a circle of diamonds as a pin instead of a traditional diamond ring to hide her lesbian relationship from co-workers .
`` We all lived , really , behind masks and in closets , indeed , '' Windsor explained . `` So what happened is there was , as we increasingly came out , people saw that we did n't have horns . People learned that , okay , we were their kids and their cousins and their friends , all of whom were coming out for the first time . And I think it just , it just grew to where we were human beings like everybody else . And I really think that 's what made the change . ''
Laughing , she told reporters : `` I 'm talking to you freely . I 'd have been hiding in a closet 10 years ago . ''

Public interest remained high outside the court in advance of Wednesday 's session , but not at the same level as Tuesday 's arguments in another case involving California 's voter-approved ban of same-sex marriage .
A smaller crowd gathered than the day before , with most of them opponents of DOMA .
`` I 'm here today because I 'm a social worker and I 've seen a lot of people suffer over the years , '' Mary Ann Piet told CNN . `` And I 'm concerned about not getting people their human rights , their dignity as people . ''
Conservative supporters of the law contend it codifies a fundamental cornerstone of society , and changing the definition of marriage would have widespread negative impacts .
During Tuesday 's arguments , the justices seemed to lack consensus on both jurisdictional and constitutional questions relating to the voter-approved California law , known as Proposition 8 , which bans same-sex marriage .
The overriding legal question in the California case is whether the Constitution 's guarantee of equal protection under the law prevents states from refusing marriage to a defined class of people .
When it rules , the court could strike down laws across the country banning same-sex marriage , or it could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place , choosing to let state legislatures and state courts sort it all out .
`` This was a deeply divided Supreme Court , and a court that seemed almost to be groping for an answer here , '' CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin said after the arguments .
Four of the more liberal justices seemed at least open to the idea that same-sex marriage should be allowed in California . Three of the more conservative justices seemed aligned with the view that marriage should only be for a man and a woman , and it 's likely they 'd be joined by Justice Clarence Thomas , who does n't speak at arguments .
That could leave Kennedy as the swing vote , as has often been the case .
While admitting the law 's defenders are `` not just any citizens , '' Kennedy raised concerns about whether just the possibility of same-sex marriage was enough to establish they had suffered harm -- a key jurisdictional hurdle allowing them to appeal in the first place .
Among the 41 states that now forbid same-sex marriage , nine of them allow civil partnerships . Nine other states allow same-sex marriage , and about 120,000 same-sex couples have gotten married , according to estimates .
Prohibitions seem to run counter to polls that show rising support overall for same-sex marriage .
A CNN/ORC International poll released on Monday found 53 % of Americans now support same-sex marriage , up from 40 % in 2007 . As to how the federal government should handle the issue , another CNN/ORC International poll out Tuesday found 56 % of the public feels the federal government should also legally recognize same-sex marriages .","Story highlights ""I think it's gonna be good,"" says Edith Windsor, the focus of the DOMA challenge

Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia also suggested DOMA could still remain in place as a valid extension of congressional authority, as 41 states do not allow same-sex marriage.

Paul Clement, the high-profile lawyer hired by House Speaker John Boehner and fellow Republican legislators to defend DOMA, suggested the act was passed as a ""cautious approach"" in response to initial efforts in some states to change state marriage laws to include homosexuals.

""In 1996 something was happening"" in the country, Clement said, adding that Congress wanted to created uniformity in the federal sphere and not sow confusion in states that did not want same-sex marriage.

However, Justice Elena Kagan drew an audible gasp from the packed courtroom by quoting from the official House reports of 17 years ago, when legislators stated one reason to pass DOMA was to ""express moral disapproval"" over gays and lesbians being allowed to wed.

It was not until 2004 that Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage.

No consensus was reached from the bench on the gateway or jurisdictional questions -- whether House Republicans were on solid legal footing when they stepped in and defended the law after President Barack Obama and his Justice Department reversed their position by concluding DOMA was unconstitutional.

The administration changed its mind after initially defending the law before a federal judge hearing the Windsor lawsuit.

Roberts tweaked Obama for not having ""the courage of conviction"" to continue enforcing the law even if he thought it was discriminatory.

At a news conference later Wednesday, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California called congressional Republicans irresponsible for funding the defense of what she called a discriminatory law at a cost she put at $3 million.

""On the basis of what I heard, the questions of the justices, the response of the participants, I'm very optimistic that DOMA will be struck down,"" Pelosi said.

""We didn't have horns""

To Windsor, Wednesday's arguments represented another step in the evolving history of gay rights in America.

For years, she said, she wore a circle of diamonds as a pin instead of a traditional diamond ring to hide her lesbian relationship from co-workers.

Public interest remained high outside the court in advance of Wednesday's session, but not at the same level as Tuesday's arguments in another case involving California's voter-approved ban of same-sex marriage.

A smaller crowd gathered than the day before, with most of them opponents of DOMA.

""I'm here today because I'm a social worker and I've seen a lot of people suffer over the years,"" Mary Ann Piet told CNN. ""And I'm concerned about not getting people their human rights, their dignity as people.""

Conservative supporters of the law contend it codifies a fundamental cornerstone of society, and changing the definition of marriage would have widespread negative impacts.

The California case

During Tuesday's arguments, the justices seemed to lack consensus on both jurisdictional and constitutional questions relating to the voter-approved California law, known as Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage.

The overriding legal question in the California case is whether the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law prevents states from refusing marriage to a defined class of people.

When it rules, the court could strike down laws across the country banning same-sex marriage, or it could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place, choosing to let state legislatures and state courts sort it all out.

""This was a deeply divided Supreme Court, and a court that seemed almost to be groping for an answer here,"" CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin said after the arguments.

Four of the more liberal justices seemed at least open to the idea that same-sex marriage should be allowed in California. Three of the more conservative justices seemed aligned with the view that marriage should only be for a man and a woman, and it's likely they'd be joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, who doesn't speak at arguments.

That could leave Kennedy as the swing vote, as has often been the case.

While admitting the law's defenders are ""not just any citizens,"" Kennedy raised concerns about whether just the possibility of same-sex marriage was enough to establish they had suffered harm -- a key jurisdictional hurdle allowing them to appeal in the first place.

Nine states permit same-sex marriage

Among the 41 states that now forbid same-sex marriage, nine of them allow civil partnerships. Nine other states allow same-sex marriage, and about 120,000 same-sex couples have gotten married, according to estimates.

Prohibitions seem to run counter to polls that show rising support overall for same-sex marriage.

A CNN/ORC International poll released on Monday found 53% of Americans now support same-sex marriage, up from 40% in 2007. As to how the federal government should handle the issue, another CNN/ORC International poll out Tuesday found 56% of the public feels the federal government should also legally recognize same-sex marriages.",www.cnn.com,left,KPErv9w0eGae7hYQ

Those benefits include joint tax returns and estate tax exclusions, Social Security and veterans benefits, civil service and military pensions.

A Supreme Court ruling declaring DOMA unconstitutional would make married same-sex couples eligible for all those benefits, leading to the presumption that they would gain and the federal Treasury would lose. But just the opposite is true.

WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced Tuesday that gay and lesbian troops for the first time will be protected from discrimination by the same equal opportunity policy that protects other servicemembers.

Carter announced the change at the Pentagon's Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Pride event.

The change ensures that gay and lesbian troops' complaints about discrimination based on sexual orientation will be investigated by the Military Equal Opportunity program, the same office that handles complaints based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin.

""Discrimination of any kind has no place in America's armed forces,"" Carter said. The military needs ""to be a meritocracy.""

The Pentagon rescinded its ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy in 2011. Under it, gay and lesbian troops could be kicked out of service if their sexual orientation became known.

""With this policy revision, we are now ensuring that servicemembers are afforded protection against discrimination in the department's military equal opportunity program, provided to all military members,"" said Lt. Cmdr. Nathan Christensen, a Pentagon spokesman.

Previously, gay and lesbian troops were required to register discrimination complaints with inspector general offices.

Carter called diversity critical to developing the troops the Pentagon will need for future battles. Excluding qualified troops, he said, is ""bad defense policy.""

Carter spoke before a standing-room-only crowd of troops from each service, from enlisted personnel to general officers and top civilian officials.

Amanda Simpson, the highest-ranking transgender official at the Pentagon, told the audience she has her Army post not because of her gender but ""because I happen to be the best person to do the job.""

The military still can kick out transgender troops for what it terms health reasons. However, the Army and the Air Force have made that process more difficult by requiring senior civilian officials to approve the discharges. The Williams Institute, a think-tank at the UCLA Law School that concentrates on issues regarding sexual orientation, estimates there are 15,000 transgender troops serving in the military.

A review of military health policies, including the transgender ban, is underway, Christensen said.

""The current periodic review is expected to take between 12-18 months; it is not a specific review of the department's transgender policy,"" Christensen said.

Before dumping the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly, the Pentagon conducted a nine-month study on the effect of rescinding it. That effort, led by Army Gen. Carter Ham in 2010, determined that the risks of repeal were low and manageable.

Justices to meet to consider appeals from gays , lesbians in five states
Same-sex marriage laws are decided by states , resulting in legal patchwork across U.S .
The one-sentence order from the U.S. Supreme Court was brief but emphatic . The year was 1972 and the justices were asked to decide something extraordinary in that era : whether an openly gay couple from Minnesota had a `` fundamental right '' under the Constitution to legally wed .
In just 13 words , the court under Chief Justice Warren Burger dismissed the Baker v. Nelson petition , `` for want of a substantial federal question . ''

If one or more of those petitions are accepted now for review , oral arguments would likely be held early next year , with a monumental opinion expected by late June 2015 .
`` The question of whether same-sex marriage bans are constitutional is a historic issue , under the Constitution and for the Roberts Court , '' said Thomas Goldstein , publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a respected Washington attorney . `` It 's hard to imagine a situation where judges are going to have more power to define the social and family relationships of the country .

Same-sex marriage is legal in 19 U.S states plus the District of Columbia : California , Connecticut , Delaware , Hawaii , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Hampshire , New Jersey , New Mexico , New York , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington state .

Some conservative activists say this bench should slow down , and ultimately stay out .
`` When the court on such an issue -- where there are very strong opinions on both sides , and a huge issue of social change in our country -- steps in and makes it into a constitutional issue , it makes the justices look significantly more political in the eyes of the American people , '' said Carrie Severino , chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network . `` It would cast doubt on the legitimacy of the court ... by imposing one type of solution for the entire nation , instead of leaving it in the hands of the states to decide how they want to address this issue . ''
Many supporters of `` traditional '' marriage privately say preserving an inflexible one-man/one-woman definition of wedlock nationwide would not be realistic moving forward , and that a divided bloc of states upholding the status quo may be the best possible scenario . But all that hinges on what the Supreme Court does and does not do .
A federal appeals court in August took just nine days after intensive oral arguments to issue its sweeping conclusion that voter-approved same-sex marriage bans in Indiana and Wisconsin were unacceptably discriminatory . And state leaders then took just five days to formally ask the Supreme Court to intervene .
Even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently hinted a `` why wait '' attitude may predominate .
`` I think the court will not do what they did in the old days when they continually ducked the issue of miscegenation , '' she told the Associated Press in July , referring to state bans on interracial marriage , which was not struck down by the high court until 1967 . `` If a case is properly before the court , they will take it . ''
In their private conference on Monday -- just the nine justices , no one else attends -- the court will discuss among itself whether to grant a `` petition for a writ of certiorari , '' essentially if any of the marriage cases deserve full scrutiny . It takes just four justices to put such petitions on the docket , but five to ultimately prevail on the merits .
`` The stakes are incredibly high for Americans and for the legacy of the Roberts court , '' said Elizabeth Wydra , chief counsel of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center . Moderate-conservative `` Justice Anthony Kennedy , who has been a crucial vote on the question gay rights [ in the past ] , is again expected be a crucial vote in this case . ''

Justices to meet to consider appeals from gays, lesbians in five states

Same-sex marriage laws are decided by states, resulting in legal patchwork across U.S.

The one-sentence order from the U.S. Supreme Court was brief but emphatic. The year was 1972 and the justices were asked to decide something extraordinary in that era: whether an openly gay couple from Minnesota had a ""fundamental right"" under the Constitution to legally wed.

In just 13 words, the court under Chief Justice Warren Burger dismissed the Baker v. Nelson petition, ""for want of a substantial federal question.""

For about four decades that was the final word on the issue, at least legally. Now a generational shift in public acceptance has given same-sex marriage a powerful new voice. Judges around the country -- in state and federal courts -- have spoken with a near unanimity over the past year that millions of gays and lesbians have been denied an equal protection right to tie the knot, or to have their legal unions recognized by their home states.

The public debate is back at the nation's highest court, with the justices being asked to offer a fresh, definitive, and binding ruling.

New Jersey ’ s largest LGBTQ organization has found itself at the center of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States . After New York , New Jersey has the second-most coronavirus cases of any U.S. state , with more than 75,000 cases ; the majority of reported infections are concentrated in the northern half of New Jersey . Garden State Equality is located in the coastal town of Asbury Park , just over an hour ’ s drive outside New York City , the global epicenter of the crisis .
Christian Fuscarino , executive director of the organization , said the onslaught of COVID-19 has only increased the demand for resources from the LGBTQ community . He said community members have reached out for everything from protective gear and health care needs to financial aid . While Fuscarino noted that New Jersey Gov . Phil Murphy indefinitely freezed evictions and foreclosures for those who are out of work or have been furloughed , many of its clients “ live month to month , ” and the governor ’ s order “ still does n't put food on the table . ”
“ For an organization that is essentially the only statewide LGBTQ organization , we 're here for the community to be a voice and to advocate for our people on a normal day , ” Fuscarino told ███ . “ When the lives of our community are turned upside down , we need to be there for them even more . ”
But continuing to meet that overwhelming need will be a challenge for Garden State Equality as donations have dwindled over the past few weeks . Fuscarino said donors who typically give generously to the organization “ have a lot more going on in their lives right now. ” After Murphy issued a stay-at-home order on March 24 , the org was forced to cancel two of its largest events of the year . One of those was a gala for its corporate partners ; the fundraiser typically brings in 30 percent of the group ’ s operating budget for the year .
Without those donations , Fuscarino estimated that 80 percent of all Garden State Equality ’ s expenses in the last 30 days were paid out of its “ reserve funding , ” which is set aside in case of extreme emergencies . It ’ s unclear how long that can continue , especially if the COVID-19 crisis lasts into the summer .
“ Imagine standing under a spigot with a bucket that says ‘ monthly fundraising , ’ ” he said , “ and then someone came and turned that spigot off and it stopped immediately . ”
LGBTQ groups across the country say they are being forced to do more with less to offer support to a community that advocacy organizations have claimed is uniquely vulnerable to COVID-19 . As ███ previously reported , Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David noted in a March memo that LGBTQ people are less likely to have access to paid leave or health coverage and disproportionately work in industries that have been shut down by coronavirus , which both puts “ them in greater economic jeopardy ” and increases “ their exposure to the virus . ”
But providing the assistance the community needs is a struggle when many groups are just trying to keep the lights on . LGBTQ groups across the country said COVID-19 has severely hampered their ability to bring in funding and revenue , and many have been forced to cancel events and fundraisers in the wake of the crisis .
Just weeks into the COVID-19 pandemic , LGBTQ organizations said they are already feeling the strain . Human Rights Campaign cancelled three fundraisers in Los Angeles , Nashville , and Houston , and a representative told ███ the L.A. event alone could result in a loss of “ possibly up to $ 1 million. ” GLAAD was forced to cancel its annual media awards , which Chief Communications Officer Rich Ferraro estimated would be a “ $ 2 million implication to [ its ] bottom line. ” Family Equality was forced to pull the plug on a May fundraiser that typically brings in about $ 1 million every year and may have to pause another event in the Fall .
███ reached out to nearly 20 LGBTQ groups for this story , and almost all reported that they ’ d had to shutter or postpone upcoming events because of the pandemic , costing them critical fundraising opportunities . These included from Lambda Literary , which holds a yearly awards ceremony recognizing excellence in LGBTQ literature ; Equality Texas , which rescheduled four events each bringing in as much as $ 25,000 ; and the Transgender Equality Network in Fayetteville , Ark. , which couldn ’ t hold its annual Trans Day of Visibility gathering due to social distancing concerns .
Vee Lamneck , executive director of Equality Virginia , told ███ that the impact of losing out on these events is “ probably incalculable. ” Although some of the individuals who had purchased tickets to its annual Commonwealth Dinner in March allowed the organization to keep their donations , Equality Virginia holds a popular silent auction and raffle ticket fundraiser at the gala .
“ It brings in a quarter of our operating expenses , ” Lamneck said of the event , estimating that the group would take “ at least ” a $ 50,000 hit . “ It ’ s not a small portion by any means . ”
While some organizations may be able to withstand those temporary downturns , others are being forced to tighten their belts . Black and Pink , a prison justice organization based in Omaha , Neb. , had to delay the launch of a youth space for formerly incarcerated LGBTQ people and individuals living HIV . Adrian Shanker , executive director of the Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center in Allentown , Pa. , said two staff members had been furloughed . This means the already small organization has only 11 employees left , even as their offices are flooded with requests for help with unemployment and LGBTQ-specific information related to COVID-19 .
“ We were understaffed to begin with and now we ’ re even more understaffed , ” Shanker told ███ . “ We ’ re not the kind of organization that can just turn to a rainy day fund and get through this unscathed . ”
Relief organizations like Indiana Youth Group in Indianapolis and New Alternatives to Homeless LGBT Youth in New York City haven ’ t made any cuts to staff , but they worried that a prolonged recovery period could have severe long-term impacts on the programs they offer . Although Indiana Youth Group CEO Chris Paulsen estimated that COVID-19 could result in as much as $ 300,000 in lost grants and funding , she said the organization has continued to provide food , clothing , showers , and laundry facilities to clients . However , Paulsen said the group could only “ ride out 60 days ” of fundraising doldrums before it would “ be looking at cutting services . ”
New Alternatives for Homeless LGBT Youth Executive Director Kate Barnart noted that five fundraisers for the organization have already been cancelled or postponed , and four others could follow suit . The organization has continued to meet the needs of marginally housed young people by offering daily hot meals in addition to its weekly Sunday night dinners and switching all its meals to carry-out orders , but those additional services have actually increased its operating costs .
“ We get no government funding at all , ” Barnart told ███ . “ We ’ re a very grassroots organization , and we ’ ve always relied on community-based fundraisers . We already run on a shoestring , so it ’ s really hard for us to cut much . ”
Organizations across the country said they are scrambling to figure out how to make up for lost funding , and a few have had some success in doing so . When Victory Fund was forced to postpone a pair of campaign brunches that would have brought together thousands of potential donors , it put together a conversation on Facebook Live between its president and CEO , Annise Parker , and two LGBTQ lawmakers endorsed by the political advocacy group : Pennsylvania state Rep. Brian Sims and U.S . Senator Tammy Baldwin . According to Parker , Victory Fund “ raised maybe $ 5,000 ” in donations after 6,000 viewers tuned in .
Although OutFront Minnesota has had to pull its weekly drag brunches , which bring in $ 100,000 annually for the organization , Development Director Michelle Hesterberg said the organization moved its annual Youth Summit to a virtual event , which included online workshops and hangouts for LGBTQ youth . Because the vast majority of its partners did not cancel their sponsorship , Hesterberg added that the event “ did not lose any revenue ” and “ raised more than $ 50,000 ” for the organization .
Chris Hartman , executive director of Fairness Kentucky , told ███ that his organization had also been fortunate . When the statewide LGBTQ group had to shutter its annual fundraiser , he said 90 percent of its donors “ allowed their contributions and sponsorships to stand , ” and some even bought additional tickets .
But even as LGBTQ groups are facing challenges during an unprecedented time , they remain undeterred . The Bayard Rustin Center for Social Justice has been hosting daily livestreams with notable figures like Gavin Grimm to give its members a space for community while many are stuck at home . Imani Rupert-Gordon , executive director of National Center for Lesbian Rights , said her organization plans to continue to hold a “ reimagined ” version of its annual gala to make sure that its supporters have somewhere where they “ can feel safe and be themselves ” and retain a “ sense of normalcy ” during uncertain times .
“ When things are closed and we ’ re feeling lost and not every place is answering , it ’ s really important for the places that can answer to answer , ” Rupert-Gordon told ███ . “ We know that ’ s something we provide for folks . ”
These groups said , however , that they have no choice but to continue the fight for LGBTQ equality because their opponents aren ’ t stopping . Even as COVID-19 has shut down most of the country , Idaho Gov . Brad Little enacted two first-of-their-kind laws targeting members of the trans community . One blocks transgender people from correcting the gender marker on their birth certificates , while the other prevents transgender girls from playing on school sports teams in alignment with their gender identity at both the K-12 and collegiate level .
Although many state legislatures have disbanded during the COVID-19 outbreak to keep lawmakers from contracting the virus , LGBTQ advocates know more proposals like them are headed down the pipeline when the crisis is over . More than 200 anti-LGBTQ bills were considered by state legislatures this year , and not all have been killed .
“ Discrimination isn ’ t stopping , ” Matthew Ramsey , chief development officer for Family Equality , told ███ . “ Our work is necessary , and it can ’ t go away . We need to find a way to do it . ”","Garden State Equality had its lowest month of fundraising in four years, and it couldn’t have come at a worse time.



New Jersey’s largest LGBTQ organization has found itself at the center of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. After New York, New Jersey has the second-most coronavirus cases of any U.S. state, with more than 75,000 cases; the majority of reported infections are concentrated in the northern half of New Jersey. Garden State Equality is located in the coastal town of Asbury Park, just over an hour’s drive outside New York City, the global epicenter of the crisis.

Christian Fuscarino, executive director of the organization, said the onslaught of COVID-19 has only increased the demand for resources from the LGBTQ community. He said community members have reached out for everything from protective gear and health care needs to financial aid. While Fuscarino noted that New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy indefinitely freezed evictions and foreclosures for those who are out of work or have been furloughed, many of its clients “live month to month,” and the governor’s order “still doesn't put food on the table.”

“For an organization that is essentially the only statewide LGBTQ organization, we're here for the community to be a voice and to advocate for our people on a normal day,” Fuscarino told VICE. “When the lives of our community are turned upside down, we need to be there for them even more.”

But continuing to meet that overwhelming need will be a challenge for Garden State Equality as donations have dwindled over the past few weeks. Fuscarino said donors who typically give generously to the organization “have a lot more going on in their lives right now.” After Murphy issued a stay-at-home order on March 24, the org was forced to cancel two of its largest events of the year. One of those was a gala for its corporate partners; the fundraiser typically brings in 30 percent of the group’s operating budget for the year.

Without those donations, Fuscarino estimated that 80 percent of all Garden State Equality’s expenses in the last 30 days were paid out of its “reserve funding,” which is set aside in case of extreme emergencies. It’s unclear how long that can continue, especially if the COVID-19 crisis lasts into the summer.

“Imagine standing under a spigot with a bucket that says ‘monthly fundraising,’” he said, “and then someone came and turned that spigot off and it stopped immediately.”

LGBTQ groups across the country say they are being forced to do more with less to offer support to a community that advocacy organizations have claimed is uniquely vulnerable to COVID-19. As VICE previously reported, Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David noted in a March memo that LGBTQ people are less likely to have access to paid leave or health coverage and disproportionately work in industries that have been shut down by coronavirus, which both puts “them in greater economic jeopardy” and increases “their exposure to the virus.”

But providing the assistance the community needs is a struggle when many groups are just trying to keep the lights on. LGBTQ groups across the country said COVID-19 has severely hampered their ability to bring in funding and revenue, and many have been forced to cancel events and fundraisers in the wake of the crisis.

Just weeks into the COVID-19 pandemic, LGBTQ organizations said they are already feeling the strain. Human Rights Campaign cancelled three fundraisers in Los Angeles, Nashville, and Houston, and a representative told VICE the L.A. event alone could result in a loss of “possibly up to $1 million.” GLAAD was forced to cancel its annual media awards, which Chief Communications Officer Rich Ferraro estimated would be a “$2 million implication to [its] bottom line.” Family Equality was forced to pull the plug on a May fundraiser that typically brings in about $1 million every year and may have to pause another event in the Fall.

Twitter has exploded in outrage because J. K.

But force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real ? # IStandWithMaya # ThisIsNotADrill — J.K. Rowling ( @ jk_rowling ) December 19 , 2019
As for what she is referring to , it is merely the latest in the transgender war on employment rights .
In October , I wrote about a doctor who was sacked for his disbelief in transgenderism . David Mackereth M.D . had worked for nearly 30 years for the British National Health Service without attracting a single complaint . But when he signaled at a training session , after being confronted with a hypothetical scenario , that he felt unable to disregard his belief in the immutability of sex , he was dismissed .
Later , a British employment judge ruled that his employer ’ s decision was fair because Mackereth ’ s belief that a person can not become the opposite sex was “ incompatible with human dignity. ” This week , another employment judge made an almost identical ruling in relation to Maya Forstater , a tax expert who lost her job for expressing this same belief in various tweets .
As with Mackereth , Forstater was hoping to defend her right to express her beliefs by using the U.K. ’ s anti-discrimination law , the Equality Act of 2010 . This law was intended to prevent discrimination on the basis of a range of characteristics including “ belief. ” As I explained at the time :
The legal precedent for a case like this , as referred to throughout the judgment , comes from Grainger v. Nicholson , argued in 2010 . In Grainger , Nicholson ’ s lawyers successfully argued that his belief in climate change was a philosophical position worthy of protection under the “ religion or belief ” clause of the Equality Act . Nicholson ’ s environmentalism was then used to establish the following criteria for the category of “ belief ” : That it be “ genuinely held . ”
That it be a belief and not an opinion or viewpoint ( e.g. , this or that political affiliation or preference ) .
That it be concerning “ a weighty and substantial aspect of human life and behavior . ”
That it have “ a certain level of cogency , seriousness , cohesion and importance . ”
That it be “ worthy of respect in a democratic society [ and ] be not incompatible with human dignity and not conflict with the fundamental rights of others ” ( emphasis added ) .
Forstater ’ s belief , on trial , was simply that “ ‘ sex ’ is a material reality which should not be conflated with ‘ gender ’ or ‘ gender identity. ’ ” Further , that “ being female is an immutable biological fact , not a feeling or an identity . Moreover , sex matters . It is important to be able to talk about and take action against the discrimination , violence and oppression that still affect women and girls because they were born female . ”
The legal question is whether this belief — or her lack of belief in transgenderism : “ that everyone has an inner ‘ gender ’ which may be the same as or different to their sex at birth , and that gender effectively trumps sex , so that ‘ trans men are men ’ and ‘ trans women are women ’ ” — amounts to a philosophical belief as defined and protected by the Equality Act of 2010 .
Forstater explains that the reason for her involvement in the gender debate was that “ she first became concerned about proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act 2004 in 2017 because of proposals for a move to permitting people to self-identify their gender. ” After a year of researching and formulating her view , she began tweeting about it in August 2018 . Some of those tweets included :
“ UK gov consultation on reforming the GenderRecognitionAct – proposes to dramatically change scope of the law ; from requiring medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria for change of sex on birth certificate , to using the basis of ‘ self identification ’ … ”
“ I share the concerns of @ fairplaywomen that radically expanding the legal definition of ‘ women ’ so that it can include both males and females makes it a meaningless concept , and will undermine women ’ s rights & protections for vulnerable women & girls . … ”
“ Some transgender people have cosmetic surgery . But most retain their birth genitals . Everyone ’ s equality and safety should be protected , but women and girls lose out on privacy , safety and fairness if males are allowed into changing rooms , dormitories , prisons , sports teams . ”
The judge also notes that Forstater had shown support for “ campaigns where the definition ‘ woman , wʊmən , noun , adult human female ’ is put on billboards , projected onto buildings and printed on T shirts. ” Just imagine !
The judge highlighted that Forstater had explained to her employers in October 2018 :
I have been told that it is offensive to say “ transwomen are men ” or that women means “ adult human female ” . However since these statement are true I will continue to say them . Yes the definition of females excludes males ( but includes women who do not conform with gendered norms ) . Policy debates where facts are viewed as offensive are dangerous . I would of course respect anyone ’ s self-definition of their gender identity in any social and professional context ; I have no desire or intention to be rude to people .
The judge characterized Forstater ’ s comments as proving that “ she considers there are two sexes , male and female , there is no spectrum in sex and there are no circumstances whatsoever in which a person can change from one sex to another , or to being of neither sex. ” Is this not a reasonable belief ? One that ’ s commonly held and worthy of protection ? The judge also noted that “ she would generally seek to be polite to trans persons and would usually seek to respect their choice of pronoun but would not feel bound to. ” Again , is this not a reasonable position ?
The judge himself notes that Forstater ’ s approach “ is largely that currently adopted by the law , which still treats sex as binary as defined on a birth certificate. ” And yet he decides that the answer to whether one should be protected from being fired , simply for politely expressing a belief in biological sex , is no . This is judicial activism , and deeply unfair . J. K. Rowling is exactly right . For all our sakes , it must be overturned .

“I share the concerns of @fairplaywomen that radically expanding the legal definition of ‘women’ so that it can include both males and females makes it a meaningless concept, and will undermine women’s rights & protections for vulnerable women & girls. …”

“Some transgender people have cosmetic surgery. But most retain their birth genitals. Everyone’s equality and safety should be protected, but women and girls lose out on privacy, safety and fairness if males are allowed into changing rooms, dormitories, prisons, sports teams.”

The judge also notes that Forstater had shown support for “campaigns where the definition ‘woman, wʊmən, noun, adult human female’ is put on billboards, projected onto buildings and printed on T shirts.” Just imagine!

The judge highlighted that Forstater had explained to her employers in October 2018:

I have been told that it is offensive to say “transwomen are men” or that women means “adult human female”. However since these statement are true I will continue to say them. Yes the definition of females excludes males (but includes women who do not conform with gendered norms). Policy debates where facts are viewed as offensive are dangerous. I would of course respect anyone’s self-definition of their gender identity in any social and professional context; I have no desire or intention to be rude to people.

The judge characterized Forstater’s comments as proving that “she considers there are two sexes, male and female, there is no spectrum in sex and there are no circumstances whatsoever in which a person can change from one sex to another, or to being of neither sex.” Is this not a reasonable belief? One that’s commonly held and worthy of protection? The judge also noted that “she would generally seek to be polite to trans persons and would usually seek to respect their choice of pronoun but would not feel bound to.” Again, is this not a reasonable position?

The judge himself notes that Forstater’s approach “is largely that currently adopted by the law, which still treats sex as binary as defined on a birth certificate.” And yet he decides that the answer to whether one should be protected from being fired, simply for politely expressing a belief in biological sex, is no. This is judicial activism, and deeply unfair. J. K. Rowling is exactly right. For all our sakes, it must be overturned.

I’ll never forget what it felt like to sit inside the U.S. Supreme Court more than four years ago, anxiously awaiting a ruling in the case that ultimately brought same-sex couples the freedom to marry nationwide.

I was the named plaintiff in the case, and I felt a tremendous burden leave my shoulders as the world learned that justice had prevailed for same-sex couples and for the supermajority of Americans who supported the freedom to marry.

Now I’m feeling a similar sense of anxiety awaiting a different ruling from the Supreme Court. Just over a month ago, the justices heard arguments in three cases brought by LGBTQ+ people who were fired from their jobs because of who they are or whom they love.

Discrimination is still a threat

Over the years, I have heard from many same-sex couples who have been able to marry — or whose marriages are now recognized — because of the marriage equality victory. But in many of those conversations, I’ve also heard fears about the lack of explicit nondiscrimination protections in their home states. I’ve heard from gay people whose job offers were rescinded after they mentioned their spouse in negotiations, transgender people fired after their gender transition and bisexual people who endured colleagues’ anti-LGBTQ harassment with no intervention from their employer.

Religious liberty can't be ignored:Kentucky photographer: I shouldn't be forced to work same-sex weddings

A win in the employment discrimination cases at the Supreme Court would assuage many of those fears, protect people from harm and put the nation’s highest court on the right side of history by upholding a view that nearly 70% of Americans hold: LGBTQ+ people should be legally protected from discrimination.

But even with a landmark victory in these employment cases, our work won’t be over. Regardless of the outcome of these cases, we’ll need to pass clear and comprehensive protections for LGBTQ+ people in every area of life, including housing, health facilities and public spaces.

The truth is that everyone should be treated with dignity and respect regardless of who they are — and that means ensuring no one faces unfair treatment because of their LGBTQ+ identity.

Lawmakers have another chance

I recently moved back to my home state of Ohio after spending a few years in Washington, D.C. Ohio is where I was raised, where I fell in love and where I lost my beloved husband John — the loss that propelled me to activism and advocacy in the first place.

Ohio is one of a majority of states where LGBTQ+ people lack vital comprehensive nondiscrimination protections. It pains me year after year to see our state Legislature fail to pass legislation prohibiting anti-LGBTQ discrimination. But this year, lawmakers have another chance: In September, a nondiscrimination bill was proposed with bipartisan support.

The fight for equal rights goes on:My mom's victory against sex discrimination expanded Title VII protections to LGBTQ people

There are many opportunities to give LGBTQ+ people full dignity and equality — and it’s up to all of us to push forward every day. That means encouraging the Supreme Court to do the right thing, but it also means organizing in our communities, educating our lawmakers about our lives and our experiences and sharing our stories until all of us are able to thrive.

Momentum is building, and together we can ensure that everyone is protected from discrimination, no matter where they live. We look forward to a future where we are all truly part of ""We the people.""

These parents can ’ t even agree if their child is a boy or a girl , ” said Logan Odeneal , the lawyer for Jeff Younger , in his concluding remarks to the jury in a drawn-out custody battle .
For the past week , jurors have been sitting through a family court trial between Younger and Anne Georgulas , who argued over whether their seven-year-old son , James , has gender dysphoria , and if so , whether they should show their parental love to him by taking an approach of “ affirmation ” or one of “ watchful waiting . ”
Today , the jury decided to give sole managing conservatorship of the parents ’ two twin sons to Georgulas , a pediatrician , who contended that James is transgender and should be affirmed by allowing him to wear dresses and taking him to school as a girl named “ Luna . ”
Younger had contended that James is not transgender and is happy being a boy , and that a “ social transition ” or subsequent “ medical transition ” would not be in his best interest .
The mother filed a request with the court to modify their joint managing conservatorship by requiring Jeff to follow the recommendations of the therapists to “ affirm ” James by calling him by the name “ Luna . ”

The father responded to the request with his own : to become the sole managing conservator over James and his twin brother Jude .
Gerogulas ’ s witnesses in the trial were mostly therapists or counselors who said that James told them that he was a girl and wanted to be called “ Luna . ”
Younger ’ s witnesses in the trial , while not having met James , were medical professionals who pointed out the dangers of a “ social transition ” and the “ medical transition ” it usually leads to .
The latter transition includes puberty suppression , administration of cross-sex hormones , and ultimately surgical removal of reproductive organs .
At the end of the hearing , the jury was given the charge to answer one or two questions on the basis of what is in the best interest of the children in the case — James and Jude .
First , did they think that the current joint managing conservatorship should change to a sole managing conservatorship ?
Second — if they said “ yes ” to the first question — did they think Younger should be the sole managing conservator ?

Contending that both parents loved James , as acknowledged by everyone who interviewed both Younger and Georgulas , he asked the jury to choose for the parents to remain joint managing conservators , and leave the rights and duties of that custody agreement for the judge to rule on in a way that would address the concerns of the father .
Ultimately , the jury of Texans decided to say “ yes ” to the first question and “ no ” to the second — effectively making Georgulas the sole managing conservator .
The judge is expected to make a final verdict on the details of the new arrangement of the conservatorship on Wednesday .
Benjamin Albritton , who compiled a report for the court on the case , had advocated for the “ affirmation ” approach , but recommended the court to prohibit Georgulas from initiating a medical transition without approval from Younger .

Which brings us to Kansas.

In anticipation of a federal court ruling that would end its gay marriage ban, the Kansas state legislature is advancing a 21st century Jim Crow law for anti-gay religious residents. They may not be able to prevent gay marriages for long, but nobody in Kansas will be vulnerable to civil or criminal penalties for discriminating against gay people with respect to their marriages or other partnerships, if said discrimination is an artifact of religious belief.

Although one commenter seemed less than satisfied: ""Yup. I'm so glad to be represented by background characters that they can just erase if China so much as raises an eyebrow.""

They believe public servants like celebrity clerk Kim Davis owe their highest allegiance to the Bible , which means they shouldn ’ t be forced to give out unbiblical marriage licenses—like to gay couples . The issue is contested by a host of liberals , secularists , Satanists and moderate Christians . But assuming that Bible believers and religious freedom advocates carry the day , public servants will need to know their Good Book . The following 15-item quiz can be used to screen applicants for county clerk positions or as a guide for those already on the job .
If Kentucky issues only biblical marriage licenses , to which of the following couples should a county clerk grant a license ?
1 . A man with a consenting woman , but without her father ’ s permission . No . Numbers 30:1-16 teaches that a single woman ’ s father has final authority over legal contracts she may enter .
2 . A man , a nonconsenting woman , and her father . Yes . According to the Law of Moses a female is male property , as are slaves , livestock and children . ( See Exodus 20:17 , Exodus 21:7 . ) Her father can give her in marriage or sell her to a slave master . Female consent in the Bible is not a prerequisite for marriage or sex .
3 . A married man and three other women . Yes . The Old Testament endorses polygamy , and the New Testament does not reverse this—except for church elders ( 1 Timothy 3:2 ) . ( See Biblicalpolygamy.com )
4 . A childless widow and her husband ’ s reluctant brother . Yes . Genesis 38:8-10 makes it clear that a man has a responsibility to seed children for his deceased brother . In the Gospel of Matthew , Jesus doesn ’ t alter the tradition but does say it will no longer apply in heaven . ( Matthew 22:24-28 )
5 . Two men . No . Leviticus is clear . Two men having sex is an abomination , just like eating shellfish , getting tattoos , shaving your beard , or wearing blend fabrics . ( Leviticus 18:22 , 20:13 , 11:9-12 , 19:28 , 19:27 )
6 . Two women . No , not even with their fathers ’ permission . Paul ’ s epistle to the Romans ( 1:26 ) makes it clear that this is degrading and unnatural .
7 . A Christian and a Hindu . No . The Apostle Paul calls this being unequally yoked ( 2 Corinthians 6:14 ) . If the applicants balk at your refusal , you might respond gently with Paul ’ s own words : “ What fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness ? And what communion has light with darkness ? ”
8 . A soldier and a virgin prisoner of war . Yes , but you should provide written instructions on the purification ritual required before bedding her . The soldier must shave her head and trim her nails and give her a month to mourn her parents before the first sex act . Also , remind him that if she fails to `` delight , '' he must set her free rather than selling her . ( Deuteronomy 21:10-14 )
9 . A rapist and his victim . Yes , with qualifiers . The woman ’ s consent is not an issue , but her father should be present as he is owed 50 shekels ( approximately $ 580 ) for the damage to his daughter . Also , the contract should have an addendum stating clearly that no divorce will be allowed . The rapist must keep her for life since , obviously , no one else will want the damaged goods . ( Deuteronomy 22:28-29 )
10 . A man and his wife ’ s indentured/undocumented servant . Yes , although you might remind the man that in this case a marriage license is not a prerequisite for sex , since community property laws apply . However , should God bless this union with babies , any offspring will belong to the man and his wife , not the indentured woman . ( Genesis 30:1-22 )
11 . A man and his mother , sister , half-sister , mother-in-law , grandchild , or uncle ’ s wife . Probably not . Although God ’ s law is timeless and unchanging , He does seem to shift on this one . In the book of Genesis , God rewards marriages between siblings—for example , the patriarch Abraham and his half-sister Sarah . But later texts specifically prohibit a variety of incestuous relationships ( e.g . Lev . 18:7-8 ; Lev . 18:10 ; Lev . 20:11 ; Deut . 22:30 ; Deut . 27:20 ; Deut . 27:23 ) .
12 . A black woman and a white man , or vice versa . Absolutely not . Scripture is full of verses prohibiting interracial marriage ( Gen. 28:6 ; Exod . 34:15-16 ; Num . 25:6-11 ; Deut . 7:1-3 ; Josh . 23:12-13 ; Judges 3:5-8 ; 1 Kings 11:1-2 ; Ezra 9:1-2 , 12 ; Ezra 10:2-3 , 10-11 ; Neh . 10:30 ; Neh . 13:25-27 ) .
13 . A gentile and a Jew . No . If the Jew should appeal to the Anti-Defamation League , remind them of how dangerous such a union could be : “ Thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son , nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son . For they will turn away thy son from following me , that they may serve other gods : so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you , and destroy thee suddenly. ” ( Deuteronomy 7:3-4 )
14 . A man and a pregnant woman who claims to be a virgin.Yes . You may feel personal misgivings about a marriage that is based in deception from the get-go , but judge not that ye be not judged . One in 200 American women who give birth say they have never had sex . Rather than plaguing this young couple with your corrosive doubt , you can encourage them with the biblical virgin birth story , while taking care to avoid any sex-negative implications that might harm their marriage .
15 . A man and a goat . Don ’ t be ridiculous . Can a goat sign a marriage license ?
16 . A man and a sex-trafficked teen he bought from a gangster . Yes , but not until Kentucky legalizes sex trafficking . Sexual slavery is quite common in the Bible , well regulated ( Exodus 28:8 ) , and frequently sanctioned or blessed by God . However , the New Testament teaches that we should pay our taxes and be law-abiding , even under a secular/pagan government . ( Titus 3:1 ; 1 Peter 2:13-17 )
17 . Two zombies . Only if they are not Christians . Jesus states clearly that there will be no marriage for Christians in the afterlife ( Matthew 22:24-28 ) . Otherwise , marriage between the undead is not addressed in the Bible , and you should default to whatever the Supreme Court may have ruled on this matter .
Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets ; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill . For truly I say to you , until heaven and earth pass away , not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished . Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments , and teaches others to do the same , shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven ; but whoever keeps and teaches them , he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven ( Matthew 5 : 17-19 ) .
Stand firm . If the Bible is the perfect Word of the living God , your detractors are up against the Almighty himself .

Note: Some liberal Christian license seekers may complain to you or your supervisor that these guidelines come mostly from the Old Testament, which has been replaced by a New Covenant under Jesus. Ask them if the Old Testament is still part of their Bible. Remind them that the Ten Commandments are in the Old Testament—all three versions. Lastly, quote the words of Jesus:

Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill. For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished.

The landmark , 5-4 decision split the court along the usual ideological lines , with Republican appointee Justice Anthony Kennedy joining the court ’ s liberal wing to back same-sex marriage rights and the court ’ s remaining GOP appointees dissenting .
The majority opinion , authored by Kennedy , was framed as a legal interpretation of the constitutional rights of gays and lesbians . However , the decision appeared to reflect and ratify one of the most dramatic and rapid shifts in public opinion on a high-profile social issue in American history .
Kennedy bluntly rejected arguments from same-sex marriage opponents that allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry would undermine and disrespect the marriages of heterosexual couples .
“ In forming a marital union , two people be­come something greater than once they were , “ Kennedy wrote . “ As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate , marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death . It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage . Their plea is that they do respect it , respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves . ”
In a rare occurrence , all four justices who disagreed with the majority authored dissents .
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the court ’ s ruling unwisely short-circuited the democratic process .
“ Understand well what this dissent is about : It is not about whether , in my judgment , the institution of mar­riage should be changed to include same-sex couples , ” the chief justice said . “ It is instead about whether , in our democratic republic , that decision should rest with the people acting through representatives , or with five lawyers who happen to hold commissions authorizing them to resolve legal disputes according to law . The Constitution leaves no doubt about the answer . ”
Roberts also advanced an anti-same-sex marriage argument many gay rights advocates find offensive : that approving the practice could lead court rulings forcing official recognition of polygamy .
“ From the standpoint of history and tradi­tion , a leap from opposite-sex marriage to same-sex mar­riage is much greater than one from a two-person union to plural unions , which have deep roots in some cultures around the world , ” the chief justice wrote . “ If the majority is willing to take the big leap , it is hard to see how it can say no to the shorter one . ”
Justice Antonin Scalia went even further than Roberts in denouncing the justices in the majority , accusing them of what amounts to a coup .
“ What really astounds is the hubris reflected in today ’ s judicial Putsch , ” Scalia wrote in his dissent . “ These Justices know that limiting marriage to one man and one woman is contrary to reason ; they know that an institution as old as government itself , and accepted by every nation in history until 15 years ago , can not possibly be supported by anything other than ignorance or bigotry . And they are willing to say that any citizen who does not agree with that , who adheres to what was , until 15 years ago , the unanimous judgment of all generations and all societies , stands against the Constitution . ”
Scalia also mocked Kennedy ’ s writing , calling it “ pretentious , ” “ often profoundly incoherent , ” and reminiscent of the sayings in a “ fortune cookie . ”
“ If , even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote , I ever joined an opin­ion for the Court that began : ‘ The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach , a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons , within a lawful realm , to define and express their identity , ’ I would hide my head in a bag , ” Scalia quipped in a footnote .
While Scalia joined Roberts ’ dissenting opinion , Roberts did not join Scalia ’ s , suggesting perhaps that the chief was unwilling to embrace some of Scalia ’ s most heated rhetoric .
“ This morning the Supreme Court recognized that the Constitution guarantees marriage equality , ” Obama said in his second Rose Garden statement in as many days praising the Court ’ s decision . “ In doing so , they ’ ve reaffirmed that all Americans are entitled to the equal protection of the law , that all people should be treated equally regardless of who they are or who they love . ”
Earlier in the day after the decision was announced , he tweeted : “ Today is a big step in our march toward equality . Gay and lesbian couples now have the right to marry , just like anyone else . # LoveWins . ”
Prior to the ruling , 37 states issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples . However , that list could have shrunk dramatically if the Supreme Court had reached the opposite result , since most of the wave of new states allowing gay marriage did so as a result of lower court rulings the justices could have reversed .
In legal terms , the majority opinion was a sweeping victory for gay rights advocates . The court held both that marriage is a fundamental constitutional right and that denying it to same-sex couples violates the Constitution ’ s guarantee of “ equal protection of the laws. ” The latter holding is likely to make it even harder for governments to discriminate against gays and lesbians in any context , not just marriage .
Invoking the high court ’ s 1967 ruling against bans on interracial marriage , Kennedy rejected the notion that gay and lesbian couples should have to wait for legislatures and voters to repeal same-sex marriage bans in place before Friday ’ s decision
“ The dynamic of out constitutional system is that individuals need not await legislative action before asserting a fundamental right , ” Kennedy wrote . “ It is of no moment whether advocates of same-sex marriage now enjoy or lack momentum in the democratic process….The petitioners stories makes clear the urgency of the issue they present to the Court . ”
The lead-up to the ruling generated less suspense than other major Supreme Court cases , in part because advocates on both sides were convinced that Kennedy would join the court ’ s four Democratic-appointed justices in concluding that the Constitution does not allow states to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples .
With the new ruling , Kennedy — an appointee of President Ronald Reagan — extended his streak penning each of the court ’ s major decisions in favor of gay rights in the past two decades .
In 1996 , Kennedy wrote the court ’ s 6-3 decision striking down a Colorado ballot measure that banned legal protections for gays and lesbians . In 2003 , he authored another 6-3 opinion in which the court struck down on privacy grounds a Texas law prohibiting gays from engaging in sodomy . And in 2013 , Kennedy wrote the court ’ s 5-4 ruling striking down the portion of the Defense of Marriage Act that banned the federal government from providing benefits to same-sex married couples .
At the same time the court ruled in the DOMA case two years ago , the court turned down on technical grounds a California case about same-sex marriage rights .
When the court was presented last summer with cases involving rulings in favor of same-sex marriage in five states , it turned the cases down . Many observers on both sides of the issue asserted that the action telegraphed an eventual win for same-sex marriage rights nationally because the court ’ s refusal to step into those cases allowed thousands of same-sex marriages to go forward — a kind of on-the-ground victory for gay rights forces that might be unpalatable for the justices to reverse .
In January of this year , the court finally announced it would take up the gay marriage issue again , ruling on cases from Kentucky , Michigan , Ohio and Tennessee after the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals split with other federal appeals courts by holding that the Constitution does not require states to allow marriage of same-sex couples .
The set of four cases were argued before the justices in April . The litigants were also asked to address the question of whether if no right to same-sex marriage is found in the Constitution , states should still be obliged to recognize same-sex marriages other states choose to authorize .
The new decision explicitly overruled a 1972 ruling in which the Supreme Court — without recorded dissent — summarily dismissed a Minnesota gay couple ’ s claims that denying them a marriage license violated their rights under the U.S. Constitution . As a technical matter , the case — Baker v. Nelson — served as a binding precedent on lower courts but it was never fully briefed or argued .
The Baker case ’ s ongoing impact was the matter of some dispute due to a variety of developments in legal doctrine in the past four decades and the lack of an opinion in the case to demonstrate what arguments the justices considered . However , the ruling figured prominently in the recent 6th Circuit opinion that brought the justices the cases they decided .
Recent surveys have showed a clear majority of Americans favoring same-sex marriage rights and reflect a clear demographic trend , with younger voters overwhelmingly in support of the concept and older ones more likely to oppose it .
The sharp shift in favor of gay marriage took place in the past five years or so , following a series of major political victories for anti-same-sex-marriage forces in the immediately preceding years .
In 2004 , voters in 11 states across the country approved bans on same-sex marriage , often doing so by a 2-to-1 margin . The drive was fueled largely by fears that a state court ruling clearing the way for same-sex marriage in Massachusetts might lead to similar decisions in other states .
As recently as 2008 , the broad and solid political consensus against granting marriage rights to same-sex couples seemed to remain in place . In that year ’ s presidential election , all major Republican and Democratic presidential candidates opposed the practice . That same year , California voters — known for their liberalism on social issues — backed a ban on same-sex marriage , 52 % to 48 % .
However , many gay rights advocates predicted that because of changing attitudes on the question within the Democratic Party President Barack Obama would have to reverse his previous opposition to same-sex marriage prior to his 2012 re-election bid .
In 2010 , Obama said his views on the issue were “ constantly evolving. ” In May 2012 , Obama publicly swung behind same-sex marriage rights — spurred to announce his decision earlier than planned because Vice President Joe Biden revealed his support for the concept .
In the case just decided by the high court , the Obama Administration urged the justices to rule in favor of a Constitutional right to same sex marriage . During the marriage litigation two years ago , the administration took a more nuanced position that stopped short of making that argument .
In the years to come , the Supreme Court ’ s new gay-marriage decision could prove to be a boon for the Republican Party because it could quiet public debate on an issue where many members of the party ’ s socially conservative base are at odds with the overall trend towards support for same-sex marriage rights .
However , in the near term , the issue could remain tricky for the GOP . With the 2016 presidential race underway and debates set to begin in August , Republican candidates could face pressure to denounce the Supreme Court ruling or to endorse a constitutional amendment to overturn it . Such a stance could prove popular in GOP primaries and caucuses , but be a drag on the Republican nominee in the general election .
Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-Texas ) is already backing such an amendment , which had the support of President George W. Bush in 2004 and during his second term .
While many Republican political operatives have been itching for the Supreme Court to issue a clear pronouncement in favor of same-sex marriage , conservative legal scholars who insist they don ’ t oppose same-sex marriage have expressed discomfort with having the courts — rather than voters — lead the policy shift .
In recent months , social conservatives strongly opposed to same-sex marriage began to treat as a foregone conclusion Supreme Court decision in favor of the practice . For many activists , the focus has already shifted to a new round of legal battles over the rights of small business owners to discriminate against gay and lesbian couples .
Last year , the justices turned aside an early case in which a photographer from New Mexico refused to photograph a gay wedding and was punished under a state anti-discrimination law . Similar disputes are brewing in other states .
Religious conservatives are also up in arms over efforts to ban what they contend are forms of “ conversion therapy ” or “ reparative therapy ” aimed at getting gays and lesbians to become heterosexual .
Three states and Washington , D.C. have already banned such practices , which have been rejected by many professional groups , including the American Psychological Association . In April , the White House issued a statement that appeared supportive of efforts to implement a national ban on so-called conversion therapy , particularly when aimed at children .
However , some social conservatives insist the practices are religious in nature and that efforts to ban them violate the Constitution by intruding on religious freedom .","The Supreme Court has legalized gay marriage nationwide by ruling that the U.S. Constitution bars states from denying marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

The majority opinion, authored by Kennedy, was framed as a legal interpretation of the constitutional rights of gays and lesbians. However, the decision appeared to reflect and ratify one of the most dramatic and rapid shifts in public opinion on a high-profile social issue in American history.

Kennedy bluntly rejected arguments from same-sex marriage opponents that allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry would undermine and disrespect the marriages of heterosexual couples.

“In forming a marital union, two people be­come something greater than once they were,“ Kennedy wrote. “As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death.

With the new ruling, Kennedy — an appointee of President Ronald Reagan — extended his streak penning each of the court’s major decisions in favor of gay rights in the past two decades.

In 1996, Kennedy wrote the court’s 6-3 decision striking down a Colorado ballot measure that banned legal protections for gays and lesbians. In 2003, he authored another 6-3 opinion in which the court struck down on privacy grounds a Texas law prohibiting gays from engaging in sodomy. And in 2013, Kennedy wrote the court’s 5-4 ruling striking down the portion of the Defense of Marriage Act that banned the federal government from providing benefits to same-sex married couples.

At the same time the court ruled in the DOMA case two years ago, the court turned down on technical grounds a California case about same-sex marriage rights.

When the court was presented last summer with cases involving rulings in favor of same-sex marriage in five states, it turned the cases down. Many observers on both sides of the issue asserted that the action telegraphed an eventual win for same-sex marriage rights nationally because the court’s refusal to step into those cases allowed thousands of same-sex marriages to go forward — a kind of on-the-ground victory for gay rights forces that might be unpalatable for the justices to reverse.

In January of this year, the court finally announced it would take up the gay marriage issue again, ruling on cases from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee after the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals split with other federal appeals courts by holding that the Constitution does not require states to allow marriage of same-sex couples.

The set of four cases were argued before the justices in April. The litigants were also asked to address the question of whether if no right to same-sex marriage is found in the Constitution, states should still be obliged to recognize same-sex marriages other states choose to authorize.

The new decision explicitly overruled a 1972 ruling in which the Supreme Court — without recorded dissent — summarily dismissed a Minnesota gay couple’s claims that denying them a marriage license violated their rights under the U.S. Constitution. As a technical matter, the case — Baker v. Nelson — served as a binding precedent on lower courts but it was never fully briefed or argued.

The Baker case’s ongoing impact was the matter of some dispute due to a variety of developments in legal doctrine in the past four decades and the lack of an opinion in the case to demonstrate what arguments the justices considered. However, the ruling figured prominently in the recent 6th Circuit opinion that brought the justices the cases they decided .

Recent surveys have showed a clear majority of Americans favoring same-sex marriage rights and reflect a clear demographic trend, with younger voters overwhelmingly in support of the concept and older ones more likely to oppose it.

The sharp shift in favor of gay marriage took place in the past five years or so, following a series of major political victories for anti-same-sex-marriage forces in the immediately preceding years.

In 2004, voters in 11 states across the country approved bans on same-sex marriage, often doing so by a 2-to-1 margin. The drive was fueled largely by fears that a state court ruling clearing the way for same-sex marriage in Massachusetts might lead to similar decisions in other states.

As recently as 2008, the broad and solid political consensus against granting marriage rights to same-sex couples seemed to remain in place. In that year’s presidential election, all major Republican and Democratic presidential candidates opposed the practice. That same year, California voters — known for their liberalism on social issues — backed a ban on same-sex marriage, 52% to 48%.

However, many gay rights advocates predicted that because of changing attitudes on the question within the Democratic Party President Barack Obama would have to reverse his previous opposition to same-sex marriage prior to his 2012 re-election bid.

In 2010, Obama said his views on the issue were “constantly evolving.” In May 2012, Obama publicly swung behind same-sex marriage rights — spurred to announce his decision earlier than planned because Vice President Joe Biden revealed his support for the concept.

In the case just decided by the high court, the Obama Administration urged the justices to rule in favor of a Constitutional right to same sex marriage. During the marriage litigation two years ago, the administration took a more nuanced position that stopped short of making that argument.

In the years to come, the Supreme Court’s new gay-marriage decision could prove to be a boon for the Republican Party because it could quiet public debate on an issue where many members of the party’s socially conservative base are at odds with the overall trend towards support for same-sex marriage rights.

However, in the near term, the issue could remain tricky for the GOP. With the 2016 presidential race underway and debates set to begin in August, Republican candidates could face pressure to denounce the Supreme Court ruling or to endorse a constitutional amendment to overturn it. Such a stance could prove popular in GOP primaries and caucuses, but be a drag on the Republican nominee in the general election.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is already backing such an amendment, which had the support of President George W. Bush in 2004 and during his second term.

While many Republican political operatives have been itching for the Supreme Court to issue a clear pronouncement in favor of same-sex marriage, conservative legal scholars who insist they don’t oppose same-sex marriage have expressed discomfort with having the courts — rather than voters — lead the policy shift.

In recent months, social conservatives strongly opposed to same-sex marriage began to treat as a foregone conclusion Supreme Court decision in favor of the practice. For many activists, the focus has already shifted to a new round of legal battles over the rights of small business owners to discriminate against gay and lesbian couples.

Last year, the justices turned aside an early case in which a photographer from New Mexico refused to photograph a gay wedding and was punished under a state anti-discrimination law. Similar disputes are brewing in other states.

Religious conservatives are also up in arms over efforts to ban what they contend are forms of “conversion therapy ” or “reparative therapy” aimed at getting gays and lesbians to become heterosexual.

Three states and Washington, D.C. have already banned such practices, which have been rejected by many professional groups, including the American Psychological Association. In April, the White House issued a statement that appeared supportive of efforts to implement a national ban on so-called conversion therapy, particularly when aimed at children.

However, some social conservatives insist the practices are religious in nature and that efforts to ban them violate the Constitution by intruding on religious freedom.",www.politico.com,left,PpB42A7lKYy9efeq

lgbt_rights,CNN (Web News),0,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/15/politics/joe-biden-hrc-dinner-2020/index.html,Joe Biden attacks Trump's use of power during LGBTQ dinner speech,2018-09-15,Arlette Saenz,"Washington ( CNN ) When Joe Biden addressed the national dinner for the Human Rights Campaign on Saturday night , he found himself at a familiar juncture .
Speaking at the same dinner three years ago , he was grappling with a decision to make a late entrance in the 2016 presidential race mere months after the passing of his son Beau .
The circumstances are different this time around ( it 's earlier in the process ) , but he is still mulling whether a third run for the White House could be the charm as he starts a campaign blitz for Democrats ahead of the midterm elections .
Biden , who ran failed bids in 1988 and 2008 , has publicly said he 'll decide about 2020 by January , a time frame that sources close to the former vice president say mirrors his private discussions . But as he travels across the country , including to key presidential battleground states , his longtime network of loyal donors and operatives are watching and waiting for signs that he is inching toward a presidential run .
`` He certainly feels the push from people who want him to run , so of course it 's there , '' one Biden adviser said . `` But in terms of the nuts and bolts of planning his time and thinking of what he 's doing , he 's focused on how he can be of most help to the Democratic Party . ''
Biden took direct aim at President Donald Trump on Saturday night , noting that `` forces of intolerance remain determined to undermine and roll back the progress you have made . ''
`` Instead of using the full might of the executive branch to secure justice , dignity , and safety for all , the President uses the White House as a literal , literal bully pulpit , callously exerting his power over those who have little or none , '' he said .
He kicked off his midterm campaign sprint by literally running through a Labor Day parade in Pittsburgh alongside union workers -- a group at the heart of his blue-collar , middle-class message .
`` I 've been with these guys my whole life , '' Biden said . `` These are the guys that brung me to the dance , as the saying goes . ''
In the first week of October , Biden will make a three-day swing to California and Nevada to raise money and hold public events , including a likely stop with Democratic Senate candidate Jacky Rosen in Nevada , a source with knowledge of the plans tells CNN . Democrats see a real pickup opportunity in Rosen 's race against incumbent GOP Sen. Dean Heller .
It 's all part of Biden 's push to be one of the most active Democratic surrogates on the trail this fall with the pace of his campaigning picking up in October . His team says he 's squarely focused on getting Democrats elected in 2018 -- - but nearly everywhere he goes questions about 2020 loom .
Headlining the dinner for the country 's largest lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and queer civil rights group on Saturday gave Biden , the first vice president to back same-sex marriage , a chance to stay connected to a key portion of the Democratic base . As the former vice president started his speech , a few people in the crowd yelled `` Run Joe ! '' He responded , `` Thank you . ''
Biden has said that after the midterms he 'll engage in an `` altar call '' to gauge whether the support exists for a run , and the final verdict about whether he 'll launch a bid will boil down to a family decision .
Biden 's brain trust includes longtime strategist Mike Donilon ; former chief of staff and the managing director of the Penn Biden Center Steve Ricchetti ; former Sen. Ted Kaufman of Delaware ; executive director of the American Possibilities PAC Greg Schultz ; and former communications director Kate Bedingfield . His sister , Valerie Biden Owens , who managed each of his campaigns , remains a trusted confidante .
Should he decide to launch a 2020 bid , Biden could tap into a network of supporters , donors and aides that spans decades .
`` As far as any candidate that I think has shown an interest , Joe would be by and far the one person that I would get out and support wholeheartedly , '' said Bruce Hunter , an Iowa state representative who 's a longtime supporter of Biden 's .
`` We are asking and he 's saying , ' I 'm not even going to contemplate that till after the midterms , ' `` said George Tsunis , an Obama bundler who wanted Biden to run in 2016 . `` I would be very excited for the country if he were to do that . I think he 's very , very capable . ''
For most of the last year , Biden 's campaign work primarily focused on doling out endorsements and raising money for Democratic candidates , particularly incumbent senators in states that Trump won in 2016 . Later this month , he 'll appear at a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee in Boston .
But his attention in these final weeks before the election will shift to classic Joe Biden retail politicking as his team crafts a robust but flexible schedule to appear with candidates .
`` I 'm updating my travel in real-time to make sure I 'm as effective a voice as I can possibly be for the incredible set of diverse , strong leaders we 've endorsed , '' Biden wrote in a fundraising email from his political action committee American Possibilities .
To date , Biden has publicly endorsed more than 75 Democratic candidates for Senate , House , governor and other state-level races . Those earning endorsements range from Obama administration alumni -- like Andy Kim in New Jersey 's 3rd Congressional District ; Gina Ortiz Jones in Texas ' 23rd Congressional District ; and Elissa Slotkin in Michigan 's 8th Congressional District -- to longtime friends like New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo , whom Biden praised in a TV ad that blanketed the New York media market ahead of this week 's primary .
Biden 's advisers say they are mapping out plans for the former vice president to hit industrial states in the Midwest as well as Florida to help in Senate and governors ' races . He 'll also be a frequent fixture in Pennsylvania and New Jersey -- where a handful of close races could help Democrats win control of the House .
`` I think that Vice President Biden resonates deeply throughout the country , '' said Valerie Jarrett , who was a top adviser to former President Barack Obama . She added that the Democratic Party is `` fortunate to have someone as compelling and popular as Vice President Joe Biden traveling as actively as he is in the midterms . ''
But there are two high-profile states Biden wo n't set foot in before Nov. 6 -- Iowa , where he endorsed state Rep. Abby Finkenauer in the state 's 1st Congressional District , and New Hampshire . His team says any visits to the early presidential caucus and primary states run the risk of shifting attention from the candidates to his presidential ambitions .
A visit to South Carolina , the third nominating contest , is under consideration , but his team argues that 's different due to Biden 's long-term connections to the state -- where he has endorsed Democratic gubernatorial nominee James Smith , who is a close friend of the Biden family , including the late Beau Biden .
`` Joe Biden 's been coming to South Carolina since the 1980s , '' said Dick Harpootlian , a longtime Biden supporter who earned the former vice president 's endorsement in his state Senate race this year . `` He 's participated in Democratic primary politics here . When he was vice president , he helped us raise money . He 's almost a local . ''
A stop in Georgia , where he endorsed Stacey Abrams , a progressive African-American candidate for governor , is also a potential option .
Aside from the avoiding-Iowa-and-New-Hampshire strategy , Biden 's team is adamant that 2020 will not play a factor as they plan out his trips .
But he is notably eyeing visits to help candidates in Florida , Ohio , Michigan , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- all competitive races but also five of the six states Trump flipped from blue to red in 2016 that Democrats are eager to win back .
The one Democratic surrogate who could eclipse Biden for attention during the midterms is Obama , who stepped into the political fray last week as he criticized Trump by name for the first time
Biden and Obama have maintained a close relationship since leaving office . They speak from time to time , but the contact is not as frequent as their daily check-ins and weekly lunches at the White House , of which Biden so often boasted . In July , they got the gang back together for lunch at a Georgetown bakery that helps veterans and military families .
When Biden debuted his Instagram account , which quickly racked up over a million followers , the former president welcomed him by posting a selfie of the two , writing , `` you 'll always be one of the rare exceptions to my no-selfies rule . ''
Obama has made few appearances with other candidates mulling 2020 bids . But he has held meetings with several Democrats considering runs to dole out advice about running in the Trump era and how to best set up the party for the future .
He has typically refrained from endorsing in primary races , so it 's unclear if he will wade into the presidential primaries in 2020 to endorse his close friend Biden or any other candidates he 's impressed by . One Democrat close to the former president said there have been no discussions of endorsements at this point .
Before any potential Biden-Trump campaign face-off , Biden would need to tackle a crowded Democratic primary field -- where dozens of names have been floated as possible contenders .
The former vice president could find himself competing against progressives like Sens . Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at a time when much of the energy in the Democratic Party comes from the left .
Biden , who would be 77 as the nominating contests get underway , may also be stacked up against a crop of younger , fresh-faced Democrats such as Sens . Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California . The current President is three years younger than Biden .
`` I think Vice President Biden is one of those candidates who actually can go to any place in America and be well received , whereas others may be less well received , '' said Robert Wolf , a Democratic donor and friend of Obama and Biden . `` He sits in a great seat -- but getting through a Democratic primary I have a feeling will not be easy for anyone . ''
That 's how Trump recently described a potential run against Biden in 2020 .
`` President Obama took him out of the garbage heap , and everybody was shocked that he did . I 'd love to have it be Biden , '' Trump said in an interview with CBS News .
Biden recently launched a sarcastic jab of his own at Trump .
`` I 'm clearly not as smart as Trump , the smartest man in the world , '' he said to laughter at a DC speech . `` But I have a relatively high IQ . ''
The verbal brawl between the two initially escalated earlier this year , when they started talking about physically fighting each other .
`` A guy who ended up becoming our national leader said , ' I can grab a woman anywhere and she likes it , ' `` Biden said in March referring to Trump 's `` Access Hollywood '' tape . `` They asked me if I 'd like to debate this gentleman , and I said no . I said , 'If we were in high school , I 'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him . ' `` Biden 's comments were similar to ones he had made in 2016 .
Trump bit back on Twitter , writing , `` Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy . Actually , he is weak , both mentally and physically , and yet he threatens me , for the second time , with physical assault . He does n't know me , but he would go down fast and hard , crying all the way . Do n't threaten people Joe ! ''
`` I should n't have said what I said . I should n't have brought it up again because I do n't want to get down in the mosh pit with this guy , '' he told `` Pod Save America . '' `` The idea that I would actually physically get in a contest with a President of the United States or anybody else now is not what I said , and it is not what this was about , but I should have just left it alone . ''
According to an Axios report , advisers to the President have said Biden is the Democrat he fears running against the most . A CNN poll of registered voters conducted in January found Biden leading Trump 57 % to 40 % in a hypothetical match-up .
One Biden adviser said they expect his criticism of the President this fall to be more implicit than explicit . Biden has already previewed some of that messaging as he 's talked about respect , dignity and American values , and he 's frequently lambasted the `` phony populism '' and `` naked nationalism '' he thinks the President and the Republican Party promote .
`` I think he will speak about his values and his core values of the Democratic Party that represents the best interest of all Americans , '' Jarrett said . `` I think he will also contrast to what 's happening today , similar to what President Obama -- the policies and the rhetoric that we 're hearing today is inconsistent with those values .

Those earning endorsements range from Obama administration alumni -- like Andy Kim in New Jersey's 3rd Congressional District; Gina Ortiz Jones in Texas' 23rd Congressional District; and Elissa Slotkin in Michigan's 8th Congressional District -- to longtime friends like New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whom Biden praised in a TV ad that blanketed the New York media market ahead of this week's primary.

Biden's advisers say they are mapping out plans for the former vice president to hit industrial states in the Midwest as well as Florida to help in Senate and governors' races. He'll also be a frequent fixture in Pennsylvania and New Jersey -- where a handful of close races could help Democrats win control of the House.

""I think that Vice President Biden resonates deeply throughout the country,"" said Valerie Jarrett, who was a top adviser to former President Barack Obama. She added that the Democratic Party is ""fortunate to have someone as compelling and popular as Vice President Joe Biden traveling as actively as he is in the midterms.""

But there are two high-profile states Biden won't set foot in before Nov. 6 -- Iowa, where he endorsed state Rep. Abby Finkenauer in the state's 1st Congressional District, and New Hampshire. His team says any visits to the early presidential caucus and primary states run the risk of shifting attention from the candidates to his presidential ambitions.

A visit to South Carolina, the third nominating contest, is under consideration, but his team argues that's different due to Biden's long-term connections to the state -- where he has endorsed Democratic gubernatorial nominee James Smith, who is a close friend of the Biden family, including the late Beau Biden.

""Joe Biden's been coming to South Carolina since the 1980s,"" said Dick Harpootlian, a longtime Biden supporter who earned the former vice president's endorsement in his state Senate race this year. ""He's participated in Democratic primary politics here. When he was vice president, he helped us raise money. He's almost a local.""

A stop in Georgia, where he endorsed Stacey Abrams , a progressive African-American candidate for governor, is also a potential option.

Aside from the avoiding-Iowa-and-New-Hampshire strategy, Biden's team is adamant that 2020 will not play a factor as they plan out his trips.

But he is notably eyeing visits to help candidates in Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- all competitive races but also five of the six states Trump flipped from blue to red in 2016 that Democrats are eager to win back.

Navigating Obama and the Democratic field

The one Democratic surrogate who could eclipse Biden for attention during the midterms is Obama, who stepped into the political fray last week as he criticized Trump by name for the first time

Biden and Obama have maintained a close relationship since leaving office. They speak from time to time, but the contact is not as frequent as their daily check-ins and weekly lunches at the White House, of which Biden so often boasted. In July, they got the gang back together for lunch at a Georgetown bakery that helps veterans and military families.

When Biden debuted his Instagram account, which quickly racked up over a million followers, the former president welcomed him by posting a selfie of the two, writing, ""you'll always be one of the rare exceptions to my no-selfies rule.""

Obama has made few appearances with other candidates mulling 2020 bids. But he has held meetings with several Democrats considering runs to dole out advice about running in the Trump era and how to best set up the party for the future.

He has typically refrained from endorsing in primary races, so it's unclear if he will wade into the presidential primaries in 2020 to endorse his close friend Biden or any other candidates he's impressed by. One Democrat close to the former president said there have been no discussions of endorsements at this point.

Before any potential Biden-Trump campaign face-off, Biden would need to tackle a crowded Democratic primary field -- where dozens of names have been floated as possible contenders.

The former vice president could find himself competing against progressives like Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at a time when much of the energy in the Democratic Party comes from the left.

Biden, who would be 77 as the nominating contests get underway, may also be stacked up against a crop of younger, fresh-faced Democrats such as Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California. The current President is three years younger than Biden.

""I think Vice President Biden is one of those candidates who actually can go to any place in America and be well received, whereas others may be less well received,"" said Robert Wolf, a Democratic donor and friend of Obama and Biden. ""He sits in a great seat -- but getting through a Democratic primary I have a feeling will not be easy for anyone.""

Trump vs. Biden

""A dream.""

That's how Trump recently described a potential run against Biden in 2020.

""President Obama took him out of the garbage heap, and everybody was shocked that he did. I'd love to have it be Biden,"" Trump said in an interview with CBS News.

Biden recently launched a sarcastic jab of his own at Trump.

""I'm clearly not as smart as Trump, the smartest man in the world,"" he said to laughter at a DC speech. ""But I have a relatively high IQ.""

The verbal brawl between the two initially escalated earlier this year, when they started talking about physically fighting each other.

""A guy who ended up becoming our national leader said, 'I can grab a woman anywhere and she likes it,' "" Biden said in March referring to Trump's ""Access Hollywood"" tape. ""They asked me if I'd like to debate this gentleman, and I said no. I said, 'If we were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.' "" Biden's comments were similar to ones he had made in 2016.

Trump bit back on Twitter, writing, ""Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault. He doesn't know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don't threaten people Joe!""

Biden later expressed regret for his comments.

""I shouldn't have said what I said. I shouldn't have brought it up again because I don't want to get down in the mosh pit with this guy,"" he told ""Pod Save America."" ""The idea that I would actually physically get in a contest with a President of the United States or anybody else now is not what I said, and it is not what this was about, but I should have just left it alone.""

According to an Axios report , advisers to the President have said Biden is the Democrat he fears running against the most. A CNN poll of registered voters conducted in January found Biden leading Trump 57% to 40% in a hypothetical match-up.

One Biden adviser said they expect his criticism of the President this fall to be more implicit than explicit. Biden has already previewed some of that messaging as he's talked about respect, dignity and American values, and he's frequently lambasted the ""phony populism"" and ""naked nationalism"" he thinks the President and the Republican Party promote.

""I think he will speak about his values and his core values of the Democratic Party that represents the best interest of all Americans,"" Jarrett said. ""I think he will also contrast to what's happening today, similar to what President Obama -- the policies and the rhetoric that we're hearing today is inconsistent with those values.""",www.cnn.com,left,7A60Nw72kNSrwT1d

Kim Davis could become the first Christian in America jailed as a result of the Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage.

“I’ve weighed the cost and I’m prepared to go to jail, I sure am,” Mrs. Davis told me in an exclusive interview. “This has never been a gay or lesbian issue for me. This is about upholding the word of God.”

Davis is the clerk of Rowan County, Ky. – a small patch of earth in the northeastern part of the state. She was elected last November – taking the place of her mother, who held the position for nearly 40 years.

It’s fair to say that issuing marriage licenses was something of a family business – until the day the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage.

Davis is a devout Apostolic Christian, and she knew that should gay marriage become legal, she could not and would not sign her name on a same-sex marriage certificate.

“I would have to either make a decision to stand or I would have to buckle down and leave,” she said, pondering her choices. “And if I left, resigned or chose to retire, I would have no voice for God’s word.

So when that day came, she issued an edict: No more marriage licenses would be issued in Rowan County. It was a decision that would bring down the wrath of militant LGBT activists and their supporters.

“They told my husband they were going to burn us down while we slept in our home,” she said. “He’s been told that he would be beaten up and tied up and made to watch them rape me. I have been told that gays should kill me.”

Liberty Counsel, the public interest law firm that represents Davis, says forcing her to issue same-sex marriage licenses violates her religious beliefs. But the courts don’t seem interested in that argument.

A federal judge ordered her to issue the licenses, an appeals court upheld that decision and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene. Should Davis continue to defy the law, she could be fined or sent to jail.

No matter what the court decides, Davis says she will not violate her religious beliefs – and she will not resign her post.

“I’m very steadfast in what I believe,” she told me. “I don’t leave my conscience and my Christian soul out in my vehicle and come in here and pretend to be something I’m not. It’s easy to talk the talk, but can you walk the walk?”

The mainstream media and the activists have been ruthless. They’ve portrayed her as a monster – a right-wing, homophobic hypocrite. She’s been smeared by tabloid-style reports on her checkered past. They’ve written extensively about her failed marriages.

It’s true, she’s been married four times. But what’s missing in the mainstream media coverage is the context. Her life was radically changed by Jesus Christ in 2011, and since then she has become a different person.

“My God in heaven knows every crack, every crevice, every deep place in my heart,” she said. “And he knows the thoughts that are in my mind before I even think them. And he has given me such a beautiful and wonderful grace through all of this.”

She once lived for the devil, but now she lives for God. She’s a sinner saved by grace.

Three days later , the Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision in Bostock v. Clayton County , which casts the legality of this regulation into serious doubt .
The Court ’ s decision in Bostock does not raise significant clouds of doubt over the new health care regulation alone : Trump ’ s education department also opposes anti-discrimination protections for transgender students , but education discrimination against LGBTQ students is now likely to be held illegal after Bostock .
Bostock held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , which bans discrimination “ because of ... sex , ” is broad enough to forbid workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity . If an employer “ intentionally relies in part on an individual employee ’ s sex when deciding to discharge the employee ” or “ if changing the employee ’ s sex would have yielded a different choice by the employer , ” then an employer violates Title VII , according to Bostock .
For example , if an employer permits male employees to date and have sex with women , but doesn ’ t permit female employees to do the same , then it engages in forbidden sex discrimination .
But Title VII is hardly the only federal law prohibiting sex discrimination . Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provides that “ no person in the United States shall , on the basis of sex , be excluded from participation in , be denied the benefits of , or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. ” The Affordable Care Act similarly prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex by “ any health program or activity , any part of which is receiving Federal financial assistance . ”
As a practical matter , these two provisions apply to nearly all public schools , colleges , universities , and hospitals , because nearly all of those institutions receive federal assistance of some kind — such as through student financial aid or through Medicare and Medicaid .
Bostock , in other words , strongly suggests that neither educational institutions nor health care providers may discriminate against LGBTQ individuals . If that ’ s the case , the Trump administration ’ s new health care regulation should fall .
Indeed , it is likely that lawyers challenging anti-LGBTQ discrimination by schools and health providers are already notifying judges of the Court ’ s decision in Bostock — and that other lawyers are already preparing new lawsuits hoping to strike down the new health care regulation .
Both the Affordable Care Act and Title IX ban discrimination “ on the basis of sex. ” Although this language is different from the statutory language in Bostock , which forbids discrimination “ because of ... sex , ” the Supreme Court has indicated that the words “ on the basis of ” and “ because of ” have the same meaning .
In Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools ( 1992 ) , for example , the Supreme Court held that Title IX ’ s ban on discrimination “ on the basis of sex ” imposes the same duty to avoid sexual harassment that Title VII imposes on employers . Similarly , in Safeco Ins . Co. of America v. Burr ( 2007 ) , the Court considered an amendment to a federal law that changed the language of a statute from “ because of ” to “ based on. ” But the Court concluded that this amendment did not matter because “ there was no indication that this change was meant to be a substantive alteration of the statute ’ s scope . ”
Until Bostock , however , the meaning of the word “ sex ” was hotly contested . Though the Court briefly considered a case brought by a trans plaintiff challenging discrimination by a public school district , the Supreme Court punted that case back down to a lower court . Bostock is the Court ’ s first direct pronouncement on whether anti-LGBTQ discrimination constitutes “ sex ” discrimination .
The Obama administration read Obamacare ’ s ban on discrimination “ on the basis of sex ” broadly and similarly to the way the Supreme Court interpreted the word “ sex ” in Bostock . The Trump administration ’ s new regulations , by contrast , read the word “ sex ” much more narrowly . The Trump administration claims that its narrow interpretation reads Obamacare “ according to the plain meaning of the word ‘ sex ’ as male or female and as determined by biology . ”
When a federal statute is ambiguous and can reasonably be interpreted in multiple ways , the Supreme Court ’ s decisions permit federal regulators to choose from among those reasonable interpretations . But Bostock eliminates any ambiguity regarding the meaning of the word “ sex . ”
It has now been firmly established by the Supreme Court of the United States that a ban on “ sex ” discrimination also bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity . Bostock , in other words , should establish once and for all that no educational institution or health provider may discriminate against LGBTQ individuals — at least if they wish to receive federal funds .
There is , however , at least one part of the Trump administration ’ s anti-LGBTQ agenda that is likely to survive contact with the courts . In 2017 , Trump announced his intention to prohibit transgender service members from openly serving in the military . Although some lower courts struck down this ban , the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to temporarily reinstate the ban .
It ’ s likely that the Court did so because it often defers to the elected branches on questions relating to the military or to national security . Indeed , in Rostker v. Goldberg ( 1981 ) , the Supreme Court permitted the Selective Service System to engage in sex discrimination . So Rostker suggests that this administration might enjoy similar deference if it wishes to discriminate against transgender service members .

Indeed, it is likely that lawyers challenging anti-LGBTQ discrimination by schools and health providers are already notifying judges of the Court’s decision in Bostock — and that other lawyers are already preparing new lawsuits hoping to strike down the new health care regulation.

The new anti-LGBTQ rules, briefly explained

Both the Affordable Care Act and Title IX ban discrimination “on the basis of sex.” Although this language is different from the statutory language in Bostock, which forbids discrimination “because of ... sex,” the Supreme Court has indicated that the words “on the basis of” and “because of” have the same meaning.

Bostock, in other words, should establish once and for all that no educational institution or health provider may discriminate against LGBTQ individuals — at least if they wish to receive federal funds.

The trans military ban may still survive

lgbt_rights,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/27/high-court-told-wait-different-gay-marriage-case/,"Supreme Court justices question DOMA's range, consider effect act has in states",2013-03-27,Cheryl Wetzstein,"The federal government has a “ powerful interest ” in a single , uniform definition of marriage , even if it excludes gay unions that are legal in individual states , the lawyer defending the federal Defense of Marriage Act said Wednesday as the Supreme Court concluded two days of landmark arguments on gay marriage .
But Paul D. Clement , hired by the House of Representatives to argue for DOMA after the Obama administration refused to do so , faced often skeptical questions from the justices in nearly two hours of arguments centering on the clash between the law ’ s traditional definition of marriage between one man and one woman and a growing number of states that now sanction gay unions .
The justices , in particular key swing vote Justice Anthony M. Kennedy , seemed to be struggling with the impact that DOMA had in an area traditionally reserved for the states . As several justices noted , the DOMA statute affects more than 1,100 federal laws , programs , taxes and benefits that differ for married and single people .
The broad sweep of DOMA “ in our society means that the federal government is intertwined with citizens ’ day-to-day life , ” Justice Kennedy said . This puts the federal law “ at real risk of running in conflict with what was always thought to be the essence of state police power , which is to regulate marriage , divorce , custody . ”
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg added that for the federal government to tell legally married , same-sex couples they ’ re ineligible to file a joint tax return , take marital deduction or have surviving-spouse Social Security benefits , “ One might well ask , what kind of marriage is this ? ” The result , she said , would be “ two kinds of marriage : the full marriage and then this sort of skim-milk marriage . ”
But as with Tuesday ’ s equally dramatic arguments over California ’ s Proposition 8 statute that bans gay marriage , the justices gave no clear indication of how they would rule on these gay marriage cases . And as in Tuesday ’ s arguments , the justices spent a considerable amount of time considering legal off-ramps that would allow them not to decide the cases , or to issue a far less sweeping ruling than many gay marriage advocates had hoped .
SEE ALSO : LATEST UPDATES : Supreme Court weighs gay marriage , DOMA on second day
The justices are expected to issue their rulings by June .
The session again inspired colorful , sign-filled demonstrations for and against gay marriage on the plaza outside the Supreme Court building .
Alexandria lawyer Jim McDonald said he would not oppose civil unions for same-sex couples , but not marriage : “ I think whatever my wife and I are doing is not the same to what a homosexual couple does , whether they were involved in a wedding or not . I don ’ t think the word marriage is appropriate for the coupling of people of the same sex . ”
But Dalton Collins , a gay rights activist studying law at the University of the District of Columbia , argued that “ every American deserves to be treated equally under the law . … Justice is supposed to be blind . ”
Wednesday ’ s case , United States v. Edith Windsor , revolves around an estate tax bill levied by the IRS against Ms. Windsor , now 83 , after the death of her lesbian partner . Ms. Windsor was forced to pay $ 363,000 in federal estate taxes because the government would not recognize her 2007 Canadian marriage to her late partner , Thea Spyer .
Mr. Clement said rationale behind the traditional marriage definition approved overwhelmingly by Congress and signed by President Clinton was “ all it has ever purported to be ” — a definitional provision .
“ When Congress passed every one of the 1,100 statutes affected by DOMA ’ s definition , the Congress that was passing that statute had in mind the traditional definition , ” he said .
DOMA tells states “ we ’ re going to stick with what we ’ ve always had , which is traditional definition ” of marriage , he said . “ No state loses any benefits by recognizing same-sex marriage . Things stay the same . ”
But it appeared that at least five justices — Justice Kennedy and the court ’ s four more liberal members — had great difficulty accepting Mr. Clement ’ s line of reasoning , even as nine states and the District of Columbia have now legalized same-sex marriage .
“ What gives the federal government the right to be concerned at all with what the definition of marriage is ? ” asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor .
Another issue explored by justices was the “ sea change ” in the popular attitudes about gay marriage since 1996 , and whether that was the result of the “ political effectiveness ” of gay-rights advocates .
Attorney Roberta Kaplan , representing Ms. Windsor , downplayed the influence of advocates . The nation ’ s sea change on gay marriage is due to a “ societal understanding ” that came from places beyond political power of gay people , she said .
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was skeptical : “ As far as I can tell , political figures are falling over themselves to endorse your side of the case . ”
The political-power question is important because one of the tests to give sexual orientation a heightened level of scrutiny is that the group is politically powerless .
The impetus for DOMA — especially the extent of “ moral disapproval ” noted in a 1996 House report accompanying its debate on the measure — was also examined .
“ Is that what happened in 1996 ? ” Justice Elena Kagan pointedly asked Mr. Clement .
Such language appears in the House report , he replied , “ and if that ’ s enough to invalidate the statute , then you should invalidate the statute . But that has never been your approach . ”
Ms. Kaplan agreed that “ moral disapproval ” was a factor in the 1996 vote — DOMA “ was enacted to defend against the marriages of gay people , ” she said . But when asked by Chief Justice Roberts if she believed that 84 senators who voted for DOMA based their vote on moral disapproval of gay people , she softened her response . “ I ’ m not saying it was animus or bigotry ; I think it was based on a misunderstanding of gay people . ”
Earlier in the session , the court queried Mr. Clement and two other attorneys on whether the Windsor case was properly before them , and whether the House of Representatives had legal “ standing ” to defend DOMA in light of the Obama administration ’ s refusal to do so .
Mr. Clement argued that the House has historically had the ability to defend its laws , especially when the executive branch declines to do so .
But court-invited amicus Harvard Law School professor Vicki C. Jackson said the House of Representatives had no “ injury , ” and the Obama administration wasn ’ t asking the court to redress any injuries either . “ There is no justiciable case before this court , ” said Ms. Jackson , adding that it should “ await another case , another day to decide this question . ”
Deputy Solicitor General Sri Srinivasan , arguing for the administration , said the high court should issue a ruling on DOMA , and that there is precedent for the executive branch to not defend a law even while it was enforcing it . But Chief Justice Roberts challenged that line of argument , saying the high court was being asked to do something “ totally unprecedented . ”
Justice Kennedy also objected , saying , “ I ’ m wondering if we are living in this new world where the attorney general can simply decide , ‘ Yeah , it ’ s unconstitutional , but it ’ s not so unconstitutional that I ’ m not willing to enforce it . ’ ”
After Wednesday ’ s session , Ms. Windsor told reporters she thought the arguments over her case “ went beautifully . ”
The justices took the case “ very seriously , ” she said , adding that the session was a “ spectacular event for my life . ”
Ms. Kaplan said she was “ hopeful ” following the oral arguments , and expressed skepticism that — as many legal observers have speculated — the high court might avoid a sweeping decision .
The court “ has an obligation to decide ” such momentous legal and social questions , Ms. Kaplan told reporters , adding she did not see evidence in the questioning that the justices were shying away from a decision .
Mr. Clement did not talk to reporters after the arguments .
Ms. Windsor repeatedly remarked on the significance of the day , noting that she still had not publicly revealed her sexuality when she married her late partner .
“ I ’ m talking to you guys freely , ” she told reporters . “ I ’ d have been hiding in the closet 10 years ago . ”","The federal government has a “powerful interest” in a single, uniform definition of marriage, even if it excludes gay unions that are legal in individual states, the lawyer defending the federal Defense of Marriage Act said Wednesday as the Supreme Court concluded two days of landmark arguments on gay marriage.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg added that for the federal government to tell legally married, same-sex couples they’re ineligible to file a joint tax return, take marital deduction or have surviving-spouse Social Security benefits, “One might well ask, what kind of marriage is this?” The result, she said, would be “two kinds of marriage: the full marriage and then this sort of skim-milk marriage.”

But as with Tuesday’s equally dramatic arguments over California’s Proposition 8 statute that bans gay marriage, the justices gave no clear indication of how they would rule on these gay marriage cases. And as in Tuesday’s arguments, the justices spent a considerable amount of time considering legal off-ramps that would allow them not to decide the cases, or to issue a far less sweeping ruling than many gay marriage advocates had hoped.

The justices are expected to issue their rulings by June.

The session again inspired colorful, sign-filled demonstrations for and against gay marriage on the plaza outside the Supreme Court building.

Alexandria lawyer Jim McDonald said he would not oppose civil unions for same-sex couples, but not marriage: “I think whatever my wife and I are doing is not the same to what a homosexual couple does, whether they were involved in a wedding or not. I don’t think the word marriage is appropriate for the coupling of people of the same sex.”

But Dalton Collins, a gay rights activist studying law at the University of the District of Columbia, argued that “every American deserves to be treated equally under the law. … Justice is supposed to be blind.”

Estate tax bill

Wednesday’s case, United States v. Edith Windsor, revolves around an estate tax bill levied by the IRS against Ms. Windsor, now 83, after the death of her lesbian partner. Ms. Windsor was forced to pay $363,000 in federal estate taxes because the government would not recognize her 2007 Canadian marriage to her late partner, Thea Spyer.

Mr. Clement said rationale behind the traditional marriage definition approved overwhelmingly by Congress and signed by President Clinton was “all it has ever purported to be” — a definitional provision.

“When Congress passed every one of the 1,100 statutes affected by DOMA’s definition, the Congress that was passing that statute had in mind the traditional definition,” he said.

DOMA tells states “we’re going to stick with what we’ve always had, which is traditional definition” of marriage, he said. “No state loses any benefits by recognizing same-sex marriage. Things stay the same.”

But it appeared that at least five justices — Justice Kennedy and the court’s four more liberal members — had great difficulty accepting Mr. Clement’s line of reasoning, even as nine states and the District of Columbia have now legalized same-sex marriage.

“What gives the federal government the right to be concerned at all with what the definition of marriage is?” asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

Another issue explored by justices was the “sea change” in the popular attitudes about gay marriage since 1996, and whether that was the result of the “political effectiveness” of gay-rights advocates.

Attorney Roberta Kaplan, representing Ms. Windsor, downplayed the influence of advocates. The nation’s sea change on gay marriage is due to a “societal understanding” that came from places beyond political power of gay people, she said.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was skeptical: “As far as I can tell, political figures are falling over themselves to endorse your side of the case.”

The political-power question is important because one of the tests to give sexual orientation a heightened level of scrutiny is that the group is politically powerless.

The impetus for DOMA — especially the extent of “moral disapproval” noted in a 1996 House report accompanying its debate on the measure — was also examined.

“Is that what happened in 1996?” Justice Elena Kagan pointedly asked Mr. Clement.

Such language appears in the House report, he replied, “and if that’s enough to invalidate the statute, then you should invalidate the statute. But that has never been your approach.”

Ms. Kaplan agreed that “moral disapproval” was a factor in the 1996 vote — DOMA “was enacted to defend against the marriages of gay people,” she said. But when asked by Chief Justice Roberts if she believed that 84 senators who voted for DOMA based their vote on moral disapproval of gay people, she softened her response. “I’m not saying it was animus or bigotry; I think it was based on a misunderstanding of gay people.”

Questioning ‘standing’

Earlier in the session, the court queried Mr. Clement and two other attorneys on whether the Windsor case was properly before them, and whether the House of Representatives had legal “standing” to defend DOMA in light of the Obama administration’s refusal to do so.

Mr. Clement argued that the House has historically had the ability to defend its laws, especially when the executive branch declines to do so.

But court-invited amicus Harvard Law School professor Vicki C. Jackson said the House of Representatives had no “injury,” and the Obama administration wasn’t asking the court to redress any injuries either. “There is no justiciable case before this court,” said Ms. Jackson, adding that it should “await another case, another day to decide this question.”

Deputy Solicitor General Sri Srinivasan, arguing for the administration, said the high court should issue a ruling on DOMA, and that there is precedent for the executive branch to not defend a law even while it was enforcing it. But Chief Justice Roberts challenged that line of argument, saying the high court was being asked to do something “totally unprecedented.”

Justice Kennedy also objected, saying, “I’m wondering if we are living in this new world where the attorney general can simply decide, ‘Yeah, it’s unconstitutional, but it’s not so unconstitutional that I’m not willing to enforce it.’”

The plaintiff speaks

After Wednesday’s session, Ms. Windsor told reporters she thought the arguments over her case “went beautifully.”

The justices took the case “very seriously,” she said, adding that the session was a “spectacular event for my life.”

Ms. Kaplan said she was “hopeful” following the oral arguments, and expressed skepticism that — as many legal observers have speculated — the high court might avoid a sweeping decision.

The court “has an obligation to decide” such momentous legal and social questions, Ms. Kaplan told reporters, adding she did not see evidence in the questioning that the justices were shying away from a decision.

Mr. Clement did not talk to reporters after the arguments.

Ms. Windsor repeatedly remarked on the significance of the day, noting that she still had not publicly revealed her sexuality when she married her late partner.

“I’m talking to you guys freely,” she told reporters. “I’d have been hiding in the closet 10 years ago.”

Someone said to her , “ Hey there ’ s a girl crying over there , you should go hug her. ” Christine ran up to an Asian woman who appeared to be in her early 20s .
“ I asked her what was up , and she pointed at a sign that said , ‘ I am an Asian lesbian and I respect my family , ’ ” Christine recalled . “ And she said , ‘ You never see that . You never see that kind of representation within LGBT culture . ’ ”
The moment made Christine , who declined to use her full name because she ’ s not out to her parents , realize how important it was to be in that parade—even though , she confessed , “ I hate walking. ” That ’ s why this year , she ’ s an organizing member of Lunar New Year for All , a coalition of LGBTQ+ Asian and Pacific Islander groups ( including Q-Wave , GAPIMNY , Project Reach , and API Rainbow Parents ) working to increase queer Asian representation in the annual Lunar New Year parades throughout New York City . On Sunday , the group will celebrate its 10th year of marching in the Manhattan Chinatown parade — a trailblazing moment that both built upon and helped pave the way for other marginalized groups seeking acceptance in the wider mainstream community , by joining in a moment of communal celebration .
When Lunar New Year for All formed 10 years ago , queer Asian groups had already been marching in New York 's main Pride Parade for many years . But the coalition ’ s co-founders felt it was important to be represented within their own community , too . “ Our mission statement was to dismantle homophobia and discrimination within Asian communities , ” said co-founder Karen Lee . “ Because that can lead to acceptance of us. ” Still , on the West Coast where Lee grew up , out , queer Asian contingents have been marching in the Lunar New Year parades for decades .
Christine said that many of the issues she and many of her gay friends deal with are especially common among Asian people . Chief among them is the East Asian concept of “ filial piety. ” The term can mean different things to different people , but suggests an obligation to demonstrate respect to your parents and elders by obeying their wishes , supporting them financially , serving as a caregiver as they get older , and having children within a straight marriage . “ These are all things you are raised to do , but reconciling that with your queerness—that ’ s a challenge that ’ s very much an Asian thing , ” Christine said .
“ Some white people will be like , ‘ Why do you even bother [ with your parents ] if they don ’ t accept you ? Why do you do so much for them ? ’ And it ’ s like , they don ’ t get it , ” said Christine . She points out that many immigrants rely on their American-born children to serve as translators and go-betweens from a very young age . “ It ’ s like you ’ re their guide in America ; there ’ s that dependence early on . You can ’ t just not do that . ”
Some Asians also see being gay as something of a white , Western concept . Chinatowner Olympia Moy ( a friend of yours truly ) recalled that when she came out to her immigrant parents , they initially told her , “ You got too much diversity training to be an [ residential advisor ] in college , to help those gay kids , now you think you ’ re one of them ! ”
In 2018 Moy wrote about a certain cultural pressure to keep “ private ” matters private . She described meeting a Chinese-American woman who said that “ between her and her mom , being gay was ‘ understood. ’ ” As the woman put it , “ My partner comes with me to my parents ’ house , we sit at the same dinner table , but we don ’ t say it . That ’ s the ‘ Chinese way. ’ ” The woman also said that having a gay contingent march openly down Mott Street , in the heart of Chinatown , would be “ culturally inappropriate . ”
Moy was shaken by those words , because for her , the most painful aspect of coming out to her parents had been them urging her to not tell other relatives—and by extension , anyone else in Chinatown , a hub for Chinese Americans throughout the East Coast ever since its founding more than a century ago . Each year , about 500,000 people attend the famed parade . “ Deep inside , ” Moy wrote , “ I knew that being out at home , in your community of heritage , should not be disrespectful , should not be ‘ inappropriate . ’ ”
For these reasons and more , Lunar New Year for All ’ s battle to make queer Asians visible was a watershed moment . When the organization first applied to the 2010 parade , the organizers “ initially showed a lot of interest [ but ] when we said we were a queer Asian contingent , ” Lee recalled , but then the organizers essentially ghosted them .
They set out to whip up support for their cause , reaching out to Asian organizations like OCA Asian Pacific American Advocates and the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center , and big-name personalities like the actress Joan Chen , journalist and activist Helen Zia , and Christine Quinn , then New York City ’ s first openly gay City Council Speaker . They also issued press releases in Chinese and English , did radio segments , and garnered coverage in English and Chinese newspapers both local and national . “ It got to a point where the organizers felt a lot of pressure , ” Lee said . “ Where if they said no to us , they would hear from their constituents . ”
Their coalition was allowed in . And not only did they join the dragon dancers and confetti in Chinatown , but they also invited other groups who ’ d been waging similar battles to march alongside them . Those included St. Pat ’ s for All , an organization that had been fighting to get into the St. Patrick ’ s Day parade on Fifth Avenue for nearly two decades , and SALGA-NYC , which after being allowed into the India Day Parade in 2000 , had not been allowed back since . Later in 2010 , though , SALGA was accepted into the India Day Parade , thanks in part to the experience , resources , and political contacts that Lunar New Year for All was able to share , Lee said .
“ Parades in New York City have this heightened sense of significance that they might not even have back in the old country , ” said Brendan Fay , an immigrant from Ireland who co-founded the LGBTQ Irish group Lavender and Green Alliance , and spent 25 years fighting to be allowed into New York 's St. Patrick ’ s Day Parade . An LGBTQ Irish contingent marched in 1991—with New York 's first African American mayor David Dinkins alongside them—but was not allowed to do so under their own banner , Fay said , or any banner containing the words lesbian or gay . The alliance was finally welcomed in 2016 .
Fay also co-founded St. Pat ’ s for All , an alternate St. Patrick ’ s Day parade in Queens that embraces inclusivity . The one-of-a-kind event opens with a remembrance of the Choctaw of Oklahoma ( among the first to donate money to Ireland during the famine , Fay said ) , and features banners of Frederick Douglass , who spent a year in Ireland “ speaking up for the starving Irish , and pleaded with the Irish to join the movement for abolition , ” Fay said . Through the years , it also has invited Asian and South Asian LGBTQ organizations , and other Asian groups .
“ Sometimes I get , ‘ Brendan , parades ? Really ? ’ ” Fay said . “ But I have come to understand the importance of community rituals. ” When he came to New York , he found himself seeking out other gay people and Irish people . “ It ’ s natural that immigrants and ethnic groups look for our kind , to celebrate our culture . It all comes out of a human need to belong . And that ’ s at the heart of what parades are about : the instinct to connect , to be part of the human family . If you ’ re an immigrant , that longing is even deeper . ”
In recent years , Lunar New Year for All has expanded beyond Manhattan to march in Lunar New Year parades in Flushing , Queens . Next year , they plan to apply and march for the first time in Brooklyn ’ s parade in Sunset Park as well .
“ I think this year our messaging will be more vocal , ” Lee mused . “ Our first year we were more timid , so we used a lot of euphemisms like ‘ rainbow family. ’ But now we want people to know exactly what we are : a queer Asian contingent . ”
Which isn ’ t to imply that there ’ s been any conflict with parade organizers . The group is invited back every single year since their first parade , Lee said . “ There ’ s never been any issue or break . We ’ re just part of the community now . ”","Christine tears up every time she tells the story: the 20-something was marching in New York City’s Pride parade last summer with Q-Wave, a group for lesbian, bi, queer, trans, and gender-variant people of Asian and Pacific Islander descent.

The one-of-a-kind event opens with a remembrance of the Choctaw of Oklahoma (among the first to donate money to Ireland during the famine, Fay said), and features banners of Frederick Douglass, who spent a year in Ireland “speaking up for the starving Irish, and pleaded with the Irish to join the movement for abolition,” Fay said. Through the years, it also has invited Asian and South Asian LGBTQ organizations, and other Asian groups.

“Sometimes I get, ‘Brendan, parades? Really?’” Fay said. “But I have come to understand the importance of community rituals.” When he came to New York, he found himself seeking out other gay people and Irish people. “It’s natural that immigrants and ethnic groups look for our kind, to celebrate our culture. It all comes out of a human need to belong. And that’s at the heart of what parades are about: the instinct to connect, to be part of the human family. If you’re an immigrant, that longing is even deeper.”

In recent years, Lunar New Year for All has expanded beyond Manhattan to march in Lunar New Year parades in Flushing, Queens. Next year, they plan to apply and march for the first time in Brooklyn’s parade in Sunset Park as well.

“I think this year our messaging will be more vocal,” Lee mused. “Our first year we were more timid, so we used a lot of euphemisms like ‘rainbow family.’ But now we want people to know exactly what we are: a queer Asian contingent.”

Which isn’t to imply that there’s been any conflict with parade organizers. The group is invited back every single year since their first parade, Lee said. “There’s never been any issue or break. We’re just part of the community now.”

One hundred thirty-one prominent Republicans have signed a pro-same-sex marriage legal brief that is clearly at odds with the House GOP leadership and the party's platform in the most recent election. Because of the prominence of the signers, the brief stands out among the more than 150 friend-of-the-court briefs filed in two same-sex marriage cases to be argued at the U.S. Supreme Court this week.

The man who rounded up the group is Ken Mehlman, the former political director for the George W. Bush White House.

For years, Mehlman forged a path as a Republican leader — chairman of the Republican National Committee and head of the 2004 Bush re-election campaign. And all the while he had a secret. In August 2010, he came out of the closet and is now arguably the most high-profile openly gay Republican in the country.

He has used his newfound openness to promote what he emphasizes is ""the conservative case"" for gay marriage. He says, ""It's amazing what happens when you make the case in terms that people who are on the right side of the political aisle find familiar, with voices that they find familiar, and they realize that if you believe in freedom, if you believe in limited government, if you believe in family values, then allowing adults who love each other to form families is something that makes a lot of sense.""

Mehlman, a lawyer and businessman, is no stranger to the Supreme Court. In fact, he helped get some of the conservative justices confirmed.

""I thought that it would be beneficial for the justices to hear those of us who are judicial conservatives explaining why, from our perspective, we saw Proposition 8 should be overturned,"" he says. Proposition 8 is the California ballot initiative that banned same-sex marriage.

An 'Inflexion Point'

Mehlman compares the right to marry to other fundamental rights conservatives embrace — for example, the right to bear arms and the right of corporate free speech embodied in the Supreme Court's controversial 2010 decision striking down the ban on corporate spending in candidate elections.

But what makes this brief different from others are the signers — an astonishing array of conservatives.

Hearing The 'Nightingale'

Pulling together such a wide-ranging group of people is never as easy as it looks. Another brief signed by 278 corporations urging the court to recognize same-sex marriage as a fundamental right was a heavy lift, according to some who were involved in the process. And like that brief, the Mehlman brief is the product of hundreds of long conversations — and many rejections, too.

The Supreme Court ’ s decision late last week to take a federal and a California case that go to the heart of the legal questions over same-sex marriage had both sides trying to determine what it means for the legal battles ahead what the court did — and how it did it .
On Friday , the Supreme Court said it will review Windsor v. United States , which involves the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) , and Hollingsworth v. Perry , which involves a challenge to Proposition 8 , the California voter-passed measure that effectively ended gay marriage in that state in 2008 .

But traditional-values groups are also heartened that the marriage issue will finally be heard , noting that gay marriages are still not recognized in more than 80 percent of the states .
Taking the case sends “ a strong signal that the justices are concerned with the rogue rulings that have come out of San Francisco , at both the trial court and appellate levels , ” said law scholar John Eastman , chairman of the National Organization for Marriage , which opposes gay marriage . “ Had the Supreme Court agreed with ” the rulings , it could have simply declined to accept the cases and let the decisions stand , he added .
Supreme Court oral arguments are expected to be held in late winter or early spring , with decisions issued by summer .
The high court proceedings are likely to take on new urgency given the activity in states such as Washington , where voters last month rejected an initiative to overturn the state ’ s gay marriage law . Last Wednesday , Washington Democratic Gov . Christine Gregoire and Secretary of State Sam Reed certified the election results , permitting the law to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. Thursday . There was a three-day waiting period before weddings could take place .

( We most recently updated the top of this post at 1:45 p.m . ET . )
There seem to be four solid votes on the Supreme Court — and possibly a fifth — to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act that bars federal recognition of same-sex marriages , NPR 's Nina Totenberg told us after Wednesday 's oral arguments before the nine justices .
As in : There 's possibly a 5-vote majority to strike down the law if the court first decides it should even issue an opinion .
NPR 's Nina Totenberg : If the court strikes down DOMA , what would be the grounds ? Listen
NPR 's Nina Totenberg : An interesting exchange about the 'power ' of DOMA opponents . Listen
NPR 's Nina Totenberg : On what happens if the court declines to decide . Listen
Judging from what was said by the justices during the second day of historic hearings on issues related to gay marriages , Nina said , it is n't clear that a majority will conclude they should rule on the merits of the law .
That 's because the Obama administration has decided not to defend the law 's constitutionality . The only entity to come to the law 's defense has been the Republican leadership in the House .

There seem to be four solid votes on the Supreme Court — and possibly a fifth — to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act that bars federal recognition of same-sex marriages, NPR's Nina Totenberg told us after Wednesday's oral arguments before the nine justices.

But there's a big ""if.""

As in: There's possibly a 5-vote majority to strike down the law if the court first decides it should even issue an opinion.

NPR's Nina Totenberg: An interesting exchange about the 'power' of DOMA opponents. Listen

NPR's Nina Totenberg: On what happens if the court declines to decide. Listen

Judging from what was said by the justices during the second day of historic hearings on issues related to gay marriages, Nina said, it isn't clear that a majority will conclude they should rule on the merits of the law.

That's because the Obama administration has decided not to defend the law's constitutionality. The only entity to come to the law's defense has been the Republican leadership in the House. A majority of the justices, Nina said, seemed doubtful about ""whether that's enough [of a defense] for there to even be a decision."" The case, she said, lacks ""the traditional type of conflict"" that comes before the court.

According to Nina, it seemed clear that the court's four ""liberal"" justices — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — would vote to strike down DOMA. It's also likely that the four ""conservatives"" — Chief Justice John Roberts and Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito — would vote to uphold the law. The ""swing"" vote, Anthony Kennedy, appeared to lean toward striking down the law, Nina told us. Among Kennedy's concerns: that the act infringes on states' rights to define marriage and affects the daily lives of gay couples because it touches hundreds of federal laws.
