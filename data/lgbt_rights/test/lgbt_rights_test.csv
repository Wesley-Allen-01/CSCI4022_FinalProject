That something early in this cycle is Indiana 's Religious Freedom Restoration Act , which Republican Gov . Mike Pence , who is considering a run for president in 2016 , signed into law last week . It has caused a firestorm of criticism from those who say the law could lead to discrimination against gays and lesbians , including businesses like Apple and Angie 's List ; the NCAA , which is hosting the men 's college basketball Final Four in Indianapolis ; and even other states like Connecticut , which banned state-paid travel to Indiana .
Pence seemed surprised by the backlash and has had some difficulty explaining his position . Other potential 2016 candidates have leapt to his defense , and some , like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , went further than the Indiana governor .
Supporters say Indiana 's law is similar to the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act passed in 1993 .
As is often the case in controversies , however , the facts have become muddled and conflated . So what are the facts ? How are the two laws different ? And how have politics on both sides shaped the response ?
Seeking 'Clarification ' And A 'Fix , ' As The Contenders Weigh In
On Tuesday , Pence said there has `` been misunderstanding and confusion and mischaracterization of this law . '' But he said he is seeking `` clarification '' and a `` fix '' to the law with legislation `` that makes it clear that this law does not give businesses a right to deny services to anyone . ''
On Monday , though , the law became part of the presidential campaign with Republican presidential candidates weighing in after a Sunday show performance from Pence that raised more questions . Pence sidestepped half a dozen specific questions about whether the law could lead to discrimination against gays and lesbians .
Former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush contended that facts had not been established , and once they are , `` people are n't going to see this as discriminatory at all . ''
Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker backed the law and said through a spokesman that it was about `` the right for Americans to exercise their religion and act on their conscience . ''
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said the law `` is giving voice to millions of courageous conservatives . ''
Rubio , though , did something the other candidates did not . He more directly addressed the charge that businesses could discriminate against gay and lesbian couples . Gay-rights advocates , for example , say if a gay or lesbian couple wanted a flower arrangement or cake for a reception , a florist or caterer could lawfully choose not to fill the order , if he has a religious objection .
`` The issue we 're talking about here is should someone who provides a professional service be punished by the law because they refused to provide that professional service to a ceremony that they believe is in violation of their faith ? '' he said on Fox News Monday . `` I think people have a right to live out their religious faith in their own lives . ''
Most conservatives , including Pence , have mostly not addressed that charge head-on . Instead , they say , the law is unfairly maligned . After all , other states have similar laws and even Democrat Bill Clinton signed a federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law as president .
Hillary Clinton , for the record , tweeted : `` Sad this new Indiana law can happen in America today . We should n't discriminate against ppl bc of who they love . ''
The White House on Tuesday blasted Pence and others , who `` falsely suggest '' the two laws — Indiana 's and the federal one — are the same .
`` That is not true , '' White House press secretary Josh Earnest said at the White House daily briefing . He cited the spirit of the law as well as the text . He said the 1993 law `` was an effort to protect the religious liberty of religious minorities based on actions that could be taken by the federal government . ''
On the other hand , `` The Indiana law is much broader , '' Earnest continued . `` It does n't just apply to individuals or religious minorities . It applies to , and I 'm quoting here , ' a partnership , a limited liability company , a corporation , a company , a firm , a society , a joint stock company , or an unincorporated association . ' So this obviously is a significant expansion of the law in terms of the way that it would apply . ... [ T ] his is a much more open-ended piece of legislation that could reasonably be used to try to justify discriminating against somebody because of who they love . ''
First , let 's start with how and why the 1993 law came to be . The federal law stemmed from an Oregon Native American man , who lost his job in 1990 after testing positive for drugs . He had used peyote as part of a religious ritual . The `` fix '' to that problem became the federal RFRA , introduced by soon-to-be Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , then a House member from New York . A companion bill passed the Senate and was introduced by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy .
Nineteen states , in addition to Indiana , have since enacted their own RFRAs , but as The Atlantic notes , just South Carolina and Texas have similar variations to Indiana 's and neither seems to go quite as far .
The Federal RFRA states that `` Government shall not substantially burden a person 's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability . ... ''
The Indiana law also states , `` A governmental entity may not substantially burden a person 's exercise of religion , even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability . ''
That is , the federal law states , except when it `` is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest ; and is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest . ''
Indiana also states the exception as `` ( 1 ) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest ; and ( 2 ) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest . ''
The federal law does not go so far as to define a `` person . '' Indiana 's law does . And a `` person , '' by its standard , is not what you might think .
Section 7 of the Indiana code includes people , churches and corporations in that definition :
As related to whether , why or who can sue , the federal law says :
The Indiana law goes further . In Section 9 , it states that `` a person , '' in this case meaning an individual , church , limited liability company , etc. , `` whose exercise of religion has been substantially burdened , or is likely to be substantially burdened , by a violation of this chapter may assert the violation or impending violation as a claim or defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding , regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding . ''
So , in other words , while the federal law states that a person can sue the government for a grievance , Indiana makes a point of stating that it does n't matter if government is involved .
Josh Blackman , a constitutional law professor at South Texas College , notes in National Review that while some read the federal provision as pertaining only to government , it has actually split federal courts . `` Private parties , '' he points out , `` had brought suits against corporations . ''
For example : `` [ T ] he D.C . Circuit held that the Catholic University of America could raise RFRA as a defense against a sex-discrimination claim brought by a nun and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alike . ''
That said , the Indiana law explicitly wipes away any ambiguity .
Support for gay rights has increased dramatically over the past decade . Since former President George W. Bush proposed a ban on same-sex marriage during his 2004 presidential re-election campaign , support for same-sex marriage has reversed .
In 2004 , a majority of the country — 55 percent — was against it , while 42 percent was in favor , according to Gallup . Now , it 's exactly the opposite , with 55 percent saying they 're in favor of same-sex marriage and 42 percent saying they 're against it .
What 's more , in 2004 , 54 percent said gay or lesbian relations were `` morally wrong . '' In 2014 , 58 percent said it was `` morally acceptable , '' while just 38 percent said it was wrong . That is a huge cultural and political shift in a relatively short time .
It 's something Republican pollster Whit Ayres likens to approval of interracial marriage in the 1970s to 1990s . In his book , 2016 and Beyond : How Republicans Can Elect a President in the New America , he points out , citing Gallup numbers , that in 1972 , some 60 percent of Americans disapproved of interracial marriage . Twenty-five years later , 64 percent approved with the lines crossing when the country split about evenly in 1983 .
`` It looks similar to gay marriage , '' Ayres told reporters at a breakfast meeting Tuesday sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor . `` The values of young people , I believe , this is where we are headed as a country . '' He added , `` We are headed to where a political candidate who is perceived as anti-gay will never connect with people under 30 years old . ''
But going inside the numbers helps explain why both sides are singing very different tunes on the Indiana law . For example , Gallup found that 3 in 4 Democrats are in favor of same-sex marriage ( as were almost 60 percent of independents ) , but the opposite was true for Republicans with 72 percent opposed , as of 2013 .
That makes it difficult to get through a Republican primary being too strongly in favor of gay rights with a significant portion of the base considering themselves `` social values '' religious voters .
He points out that Republicans under 30 support same-sex marriage . A Pew poll in 2014 , in fact , found 61 percent of young Republicans in favor .
So , while times are changing with Republicans on gay rights , they are doing so more slowly than the more rapid change taking place in the country at large .","Indiana Law: Sorting Fact From Fiction From Politics

The culture wars are always percolating beneath the surface in presidential politics — until something or someone pushes them to the surface.

That something early in this cycle is Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which Republican Gov. Mike Pence, who is considering a run for president in 2016, signed into law last week.

Pence seemed surprised by the backlash and has had some difficulty explaining his position. Other potential 2016 candidates have leapt to his defense, and some, like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, went further than the Indiana governor.

Supporters say Indiana's law is similar to the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act passed in 1993.

As is often the case in controversies, however, the facts have become muddled and conflated. So what are the facts? How are the two laws different? And how have politics on both sides shaped the response?

Seeking 'Clarification' And A 'Fix,' As The Contenders Weigh In

On Tuesday, Pence said there has ""been misunderstanding and confusion and mischaracterization of this law."" But he said he is seeking ""clarification"" and a ""fix"" to the law with legislation ""that makes it clear that this law does not give businesses a right to deny services to anyone.""

The Background

First, let's start with how and why the 1993 law came to be. The federal law stemmed from an Oregon Native American man, who lost his job in 1990 after testing positive for drugs. He had used peyote as part of a religious ritual. The ""fix"" to that problem became the federal RFRA, introduced by soon-to-be Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, then a House member from New York. A companion bill passed the Senate and was introduced by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy.

Nineteen states, in addition to Indiana, have since enacted their own RFRAs, but as The Atlantic notes, just South Carolina and Texas have similar variations to Indiana's and neither seems to go quite as far.

Indiana Vs. Federal Law — What Do They Say?

The Federal RFRA states that ""Government shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability. ...""

The Indiana law also states, ""A governmental entity may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability.""

That is, the federal law states, except when it ""is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.""

Indiana also states the exception as ""(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.""

But that's where the similarities end.

The federal law does not go so far as to define a ""person."" Indiana's law does. And a ""person,"" by its standard, is not what you might think.

Section 7 of the Indiana code includes people, churches and corporations in that definition:

As related to whether, why or who can sue, the federal law says:

The Indiana law goes further. In Section 9, it states that ""a person,"" in this case meaning an individual, church, limited liability company, etc., ""whose exercise of religion has been substantially burdened, or is likely to be substantially burdened, by a violation of this chapter may assert the violation or impending violation as a claim or defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding, regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding.""

So, in other words, while the federal law states that a person can sue the government for a grievance, Indiana makes a point of stating that it doesn't matter if government is involved.

But no , they ’ re trying to figure it out too , and so are most of their constituents . Meanwhile , one-by-one ( or so it seems ) political figures are coming out for gay marriage .
Most recently , that ’ s US Rep. Justin Amash , ( R ) of Michigan , a conservative who used to defend the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) , which was argued before the US Supreme Court this past week .
“ Real threat to traditional marriage & religious liberty is government , not gay couples who love each other & want to spend lives together , ” Rep. Amash wrote in a Twitter exchange with The Huffington Post . “ I support repealing federal definition of marriage portion of DOMA . Always have . ”
Asked if gay couples should have the option to marry , Amash tweeted : “ Of course . How can anyone stop a couple from getting married in their own way ? I just want government out. ” ( Read the full exchange here . )
That ’ s essentially the position Sen. Rand Paul voiced recently , although the Kentucky Republican focused on the US tax code , which ( as now enforced ) prohibits the survivors in same-sex marriages allowed in nine states and the District of Columbia from receiving certain financial benefits when their spouses die .
It ’ s hard for many Republican lawmakers to make the leap Amash did for fear of being challenged from the right by a social conservative in a party primary .
Former Utah governor , US Ambassador , and presidential candidate Jon Huntsman took the issue head-on in a column in The American Conservative last month .
“ My marriage has been the greatest joy of my life . There is nothing conservative about denying other Americans the ability to forge that same relationship with the person they love , ” Mr. Huntsman wrote .
“ All Americans should be treated equally by the law , whether they marry in a church , another religious institution , or a town hall… . The party of Lincoln should stand with our best tradition of equality and support full civil marriage for all Americans. ” ( Read his full column here . )
Huntsman was among more than 100 conservatives and Republicans who filed a friend of the court brief in the DOMA case before the Supreme Court , among them former governors , GOP administration senior officials , prominent right-leaning pundits , and actor Clint Eastwood .

The Supreme Court justices this week seemed in no hurry to declare the constitutionality of same-sex marriage .","This being the Easter/Passover Spring break for Congress, you’d think lawmakers back in their home districts would be eager to talk about the past week’s major news story – the latest developments on same-sex marriage, which has seen one of the most pronounced and rapid shifts in public opinion and political action in recent US history.

But no, they’re trying to figure it out too, and so are most of their constituents. Meanwhile, one-by-one (or so it seems) political figures are coming out for gay marriage.

Most recently, that’s US Rep. Justin Amash, (R) of Michigan, a conservative who used to defend the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which was argued before the US Supreme Court this past week.

“Real threat to traditional marriage & religious liberty is government, not gay couples who love each other & want to spend lives together,” Rep. Amash wrote in a Twitter exchange with The Huffington Post. “I support repealing federal definition of marriage portion of DOMA. Always have.”

Asked if gay couples should have the option to marry, Amash tweeted: “Of course. How can anyone stop a couple from getting married in their own way? I just want government out.” (Read the full exchange here.)

That’s essentially the position Sen. Rand Paul voiced recently, although the Kentucky Republican focused on the US tax code, which (as now enforced) prohibits the survivors in same-sex marriages allowed in nine states and the District of Columbia from receiving certain financial benefits when their spouses die.

It’s hard for many Republican lawmakers to make the leap Amash did for fear of being challenged from the right by a social conservative in a party primary.

But that hasn’t kept other Republicans from speaking out.

Former Utah governor, US Ambassador, and presidential candidate Jon Huntsman took the issue head-on in a column in The American Conservative last month.

“My marriage has been the greatest joy of my life. There is nothing conservative about denying other Americans the ability to forge that same relationship with the person they love,” Mr. Huntsman wrote.

“All Americans should be treated equally by the law, whether they marry in a church, another religious institution, or a town hall…. The party of Lincoln should stand with our best tradition of equality and support full civil marriage for all Americans.” (Read his full column here.)

Huntsman was among more than 100 conservatives and Republicans who filed a friend of the court brief in the DOMA case before the Supreme Court, among them former governors, GOP administration senior officials, prominent right-leaning pundits, and actor Clint Eastwood.

Intolerance of disagreement in the debate over transgender issues begins to creep into law.

Yesterday trans Twitter got very, very angry with me. I wrote a Corner post about Chelsea Manning’s release from prison, and the focus was squarely on Manning’s misconduct. Manning betrayed fellow soldiers, put their lives in danger, and did it simply because he wanted to stimulate debate. Trans twitter was angry not with my description of Manning’s actions (though some defended him) but with my description of Manning. I used male pronouns. I identified a man as a man.

Immediately I was deluged with passionate but reasonable tweets explaining to me exactly what was wrong with my pronoun usage. No, wait. That was in a parallel universe.

In the real world, I was called a transphobe, “America’s worst person,” and many other names simply because I wouldn’t identify Manning as a woman.

The latest ruling comes from the California-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , which said that Arizona 's recent attempt to strip health benefits for domestic partners of state workers is illegal .
Arizona moved in 2009 to take away the recently expanded benefit as part of an attempt to partially plug a $ 1.6 billion budget hole . Some gay workers countered that the savings were minimal -- no more than $ 2 million , according to one expert -- and that the law really targeted them . So they challenged it in court . And the court agreed .
But one veteran 9th Circuit judge thinks his colleagues have declared a war on marriage .
Those judges `` all but expressly held that opposite-sex-only marriage rules are unconstitutional -- indeed , that such rules are irrational per se because they can rest only on a 'bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group , ' '' Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain wrote in dissent of his court 's decision not to grant the case further review . He said his colleagues were ignoring Supreme Court precedent and all but called upon the high court to take the case . Arizona 's attorney general recently filed a brief with the justices asking them to accept O'Scannlain 's invitation .
Lawyer John Eastman , with the National Organization for Marriage , called the 9th Circuit ruling `` groundbreaking , '' and one that could render traditional marriage laws across the country `` unconstitutional '' if it takes hold .
Those challenging the Arizona decision , though , called the state 's actions discriminatory .
`` The legislature took aim at that system and dismantled it wholesale , '' lawyer Tara Borelli told ███ . `` There was nothing accidental or inadvertent about this . The legislature knew exactly what it was doing . And that 's what 's required to show that something is discriminatory . ''
A trial court judge agreed and so did a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit on appellate review . Arizona officials then asked for another chance to make its case before the 9th Circuit , but that was denied without comment , prompting O'Scannlain 's blistering dissent .
Keith Humphrey , an administrator at the University of Arizona in Tucson , said he was excited to learn that his partner , Robert , could be added to his employer-sponsored health plan . Then a year later , the state tried to take it away .
`` I felt very disappointed when the state said my employment is worth less than someone who is married , '' Humphrey told ███ . The couple has three kids and until the change in law , Robert , who stays at home with the children , was on the state 's Medicaid roll . The pair still receives health benefits under Humphrey 's plan because the courts have put a hold on the benefit revocation .
Those defending the legislature 's action say there was no intent to discriminate against Humphrey , his partner or anyone else . It was simply a budgetary decision with no hidden ulterior motive . Further , they note the law 's provision removing benefits for domestic partners is very broad .
`` In 2008 they expanded ( dependent health coverage ) to include any other person who had a domestic financial relationship with someone they 'd been living with for 12 months , '' Eastman observed . `` That could be same-sex couples . It could be opposite-sex couples who are unmarried . It could even be roommates who had shared a checking account and rent expenses for 12 months . ''
An outside expert provided testimony that only a fraction -- as little as 7 percent -- of the domestic partners actually receiving state benefits were of the same sex and cost Arizona no more than one-quarter of 1 percent of the state 's health care costs .
But the legal issue for Borelli and her clients is n't about a budgetary squeeze or statistics . `` The fact that the state of Arizona may have wanted to save some negligible amount of money by cutting out this very small percent of the population , does n't excuse the discrimination , '' she said . She points out that opposite-sex partners can still obtain health benefits from the state if they get married -- an option that 's foreclosed for gay workers .
`` It 's as if the state were saying to same-sex couples , 'you can have access to this health insurance as long as you do this thing that is legally impossible for you to do . ' Well that 's not equal treatment , and everybody can see that , '' she said .
A major legal question is whether Arizona lawmakers had a rational basis to remove the benefit . O'Scannlain 's assessment of what his colleagues decided makes clear his view of the case . `` The panel concluded -- in a way that is veiled but unmistakable -- that rules benefiting only traditional marriage serve no conceivable rational purpose . '' He said that determination prevents Arizona voters -- and those in other states -- from passing laws that protect traditional marriage .
Eastland says the legislature 's action was perfectly reasonable given the budgetary fix it was in and that courts are supposed to defer to elected lawmakers to make difficult decisions -- like what programs or benefits to cut when money is tight . `` The 9th Circuit has now effectively gone on record as saying it 's irrational for the state to provide benefits to traditional married couples that it does n't extend to everybody else . And that the only explanation for it is bigotry toward homosexuality . ''
The Supreme Court is unlikely to decide whether to take the case until the fall . This case is different from another 9th Circuit ruling that invalidated the controversial Prop 8 referendum in California banning same-sex marriage . A third high-profile case over the federal Defense of Marriage Act is also expected to reach the Supreme Court .

""The freedom to democratically address the most pressing social issues of the day is the heart of liberty.""

*** Many faith leaders believe the Supreme Court ruling recognizing gay marriage will put religious liberty will be at risk.

In the weeks before the ruling came down, the Southern Baptist Convention partnered with the Alliance Defending Freedom to provide guidance for churches and other faith-based institutions called Protecting Your Ministry. CBN News interviewed Dr. Russell Moore about the booklet earlier this month. Watch our interview below.



Rev. Samuel Rodriguez says the decision ""serves as a defacto and legal catalyst for the marginalization of Americans who embrace a biblical worldview.""



Many leaders, such as Liberty Counsel's Mat Staver, have already called for civil disobedience in response to such a ruling. Others individuals and organizations are studying the ruling to determine the best ways to respond.",www.cbn.com,right,mRDNv95vn8yuUyKZ

In her decision, the New Jersey judge argued that the state's continuing allowance only of civil unions for gay and lesbian couples was discriminatory.

Among those granting the early-morning marriages was Democratic Senator-elect Cory Booker, the Newark, New Jersey mayor who overwhelmingly won his bid last week to fill out the remainder of the term of the late Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg, who died in June.

New Jersey's Assembly Speaker, Democrat Sheila Oliver, who had urged Christie to drop his fight, praised the governor's decision in a statement Monday.

According to France24 , a source in Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault ’ s office said Monday that France ’ s socialist government would no longer present a bill to modernize family law to reflect “ diversity ” of families .
Over 100,000 protesters in Paris and Lyon , many Catholic and some Muslim , and thousands more in Brussels , Bucharest , Madrid , Warsaw , and Rome , demonstrated in favor of marriage and the traditional family last Sunday .
The demonstrations were led by La Manif Pour Tous ( Protest for Everyone ) , a fast-growing coalition of groups that has organized massive rallies against same-sex marriage legislation throughout Europe .
Though France ’ s Interior Minister Manuel Valls warned the marchers that “ no excesses ” would be tolerated during the protests , and subsequently ordered a heavy security presence , the demonstrations , composed mostly of families with young children in strollers , were peaceful .
Ludovine de la Rochère , head of La Manif Pour Tous , said the government ’ s decision was a victory for the conservative movement .
“ What was outlined in this bill was not conducive to the interests of children or of the family , ” de la Rochère said .
As Edward Pentin reports at Newsmax , Jean-Pierre Delaume-Myard , a spokesman for La Manif Pour Tous – who is himself gay – told Vatican Radio Friday that children are the “ first victims ” of same-sex marriage .
“ It deprives them of a father and a mother , ” he said . “ The desire to have a child by a homosexual can not justify any kind of solution to fill this gap . Every child has the right to have a father and a mother . ”
Delaume-Myard added that France ’ s same-sex marriage legislation – known as “ Taubira law ” – was imposed on the French people , even by repressing opposition through violence , a charge that is currently under investigation .
Claiming that “ the majority of homosexuals had never asked for such a thing , ” Delaume-Myard said the fact that “ civil unions ” have been in existence in France for years and have only been chosen by four percent of gay people in the country is evidence that same-sex marriage is not a popular cause for this group .
Moreover , medically assisted procreation and surrogate pregnancies , he said , turn women and children into mere commodities .
Protesters in other parts of Europe were demonstrating as well against the Lunacek report on equality regarding sexual orientation and gender identity . The report calls for a new “ road map ” within the European Union to attack “ homophobia ” and demand that gay and lesbian rights be considered human rights .
The Lunacek report also demands the promotion of “ equality and non-discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity throughout its youth and education programmes . ”
In Italy , La Manif Pour Tous demonstrated against the Lunacek report . Director Jacopo Coghe said the rally was “ to affirm that we will not be instruments of violence and destruction ” and will “ defend the family , paying in person if necessary . ”
Coghe added that “ only the union between a man and a woman can form a stable construct that is the family , the place par excellence of solidarity and acceptance . ”
In the United States , as ███ reported , Attorney General Eric Holder set into motion new measures that will expand same-sex marriage privileges in all federal courtrooms to eliminate distinctions between traditional marriages and same-sex unions .
Equating protests against same-sex “ marriage ” with racial discrimination , Holder said , “ As all-important as the fight against racial discrimination was then , and remains today , know this : My commitment to confronting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity runs just as deep . ”
The Coalition of African-American Pastors ( CAAP ) , however , sharply disagrees with Holder .
Last August , Rev . William Owens , chairman of CAAP , told ███ that the black community “ knows that our civil rights were won through a strong faith in God , and most still believe that the truths of our faith say that marriage should be between a man and a woman . ”
Owens said the Obama administration ’ s announcement of support for same-sex marriage was a turning point for him .
“ Obama is the most powerful man in the country , and he sent a signal that same-sex marriage is okay . Well , we don ’ t think it ’ s right , and that day was the day the dynamics changed , ” he asserted .

It ’ s the same things that are important to other Americans , ” he adds . “ That ’ s to not be [ criminalized ] ; to have our families recognized ; and to have jobs and not to be discriminated against . ”
While questions of religious liberty remain to be addressed , the ruling is a momentous one . Title VII is a “ super statute , ” says Yale law professor William Eskridge . For individual rights , “ It has more ramifications for most Americans than the Constitution . ”
“ Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not have anticipated their work would lead to this particular result , ” wrote Justice Gorsuch . “ But the limits of the drafters ’ imagination supply no reason to ignore the law ’ s demands . ”
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on “ race , color , religion , sex and national origin. ” The majority held that “ sex ” covers “ gay or transgender ” people .

In a landmark , and unexpected , decision yesterday , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that firing an employee because of their sexual orientation or gender identity violates federal law .
In what could be a month of blockbuster decisions from the high court , the ruling immediately ranks among the most consequential civil rights rulings in the court ’ s history , experts say . The fact it came from a court with a small but deeply conservative majority – and that so many people tried to access the opinion online it crashed the court ’ s website – only heightened the drama .
To hear Justice Neil Gorsuch – who wrote the 6-3 majority opinion – tell it , the landmark ruling was a straightforward one . The 172 pages of opinions tell a more complicated story – one of three-pronged debate between the court ’ s conservative justices over the best practices of textualism , a judicial method of interpreting laws based on the “ ordinary meaning ” of the text .
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on “ race , color , religion , sex and national origin. ” In that statute , the majority held that “ sex ” covers people who are “ gay or transgender . ”
“ Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not have anticipated their work would lead to this particular result , ” wrote Justice Gorsuch . “ But the limits of the drafters ’ imagination supply no reason to ignore the law ’ s demands . ”
“ When the express terms of a statute give us one answer and extratextual considerations suggest another , it ’ s no contest , ” he added . “ Only the written word is the law , and all persons are entitled to its benefit . ”
The ground-level effects of the ruling are significant . In 25 states there are no explicit prohibitions against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity . It also came days after the Trump administration – which had opposed the LGBTQ employees in the case – eliminated regulations prohibiting discrimination against transgender patients in health care .
“ This is as important a ruling as Obergefell [ v. Hodges ] , ” the 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriage , says Michael Boucai , a professor at the University at Buffalo School of Law , “ simply because employment is such a basic human need . ”
Jonathan Ernst/Reuters/File U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch is shown during an official portrait June 1 , 2017 .
And when one of the high court ’ s staunchest defenders of LGBTQ rights , Justice Anthony Kennedy , retired in 2018 , most court watchers expected those rights only to get rolled back .
“ It ’ s a matter of great good luck that the arguments that could be made in this case are obviously going to appeal to someone like Gorsuch , ” says Mary Anne Case , a professor at the University of Chicago Law School .
“ It would have been hard for Gorsuch to cast a different vote without looking unprincipled , ” she adds .
All nine justices would consider themselves textualists , to the extent they give the actual text of a statute significant weight when they interpret it . But Justice Gorsuch may be the strictest .
“ The role of a judge is to say what the law is , ” he said during his 2017 confirmation hearings . “ Before I put a person in prison , before I deny someone of their liberty or property , I want to be very sure that I can look them square in the eye and say , ‘ You should have known . ’ ”
Yet he is also a conservative justice with a strong belief that the Supreme Court should not be driving social change . This case brought those two core principles to a head , and strict textualism won .
In a detailed , 32-page scrutiny of the “ because of ... sex ” phrase in Title VII , he makes the pivotal holding that while the law doesn ’ t explicitly reference LGBTQ employees , and while Congress in 1964 may not have intended it to cover them , it protects those employees nonetheless .
“ When an employer fires an employee for being homosexual or transgender , it necessarily and intentionally discriminates against that individual in part because of sex , ” he wrote .
Title VII “ is a major piece of federal civil rights legislation . It is written in starkly broad terms . It has repeatedly produced unexpected applications , ” he added . “ The same judicial humility that requires us to refrain from adding to statutes requires us to refrain from diminishing them . ”
Monday ’ s ruling also suggests that , if Congress were to pass clearly articulated legislation expanding protections for LGBTQ Americans , this court would uphold it . LGBTQ Americans are “ still unprotected from discrimination in housing , and discrimination in public accommodations , ” says Kimberly West-Faulcon , a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles .
Monday ’ s rationale for enshrining new civil rights for LGBTQ Americans differs markedly from Obergefell , the high court ’ s last major opinion in the area .
First , that case concerned a constitutional question instead of a statutory one . The Supreme Court is typically more reluctant to reinterpret the Constitution than a statute , but former Justice Kennedy was also plain in his opinion that while the 14th Amendment ’ s due process clause didn ’ t guarantee a right to same-sex marriage , it should .
“ The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times , ” he wrote . “ When new insight reveals discord between the Constitution ’ s central protections and a received legal stricture , a claim to liberty must be addressed . ”
Justice Kennedy was joined in that opinion by the court ’ s four liberal justices , and that judicial philosophy – that laws and the Constitution can and should evolve with the times – is traditionally popular on the left .
Textualism is traditionally popular on the right , but yesterday ’ s ruling showed that it can also contain multitudes .
As Justice Samuel Alito wrote in a dissent ( joined by his conservative colleague Justice Clarence Thomas ) , the majority opinion is not textbook textualism , but a “ pirate ship . ”
“ It sails under a textualist flag , ” he wrote . But “ there is only one word for what the Court has done today : legislation . ”
“ When textualism is properly understood , it calls for an examination of the social context in which a statute was enacted , ” he added .
The social context 50 years ago , he argued ( with 52 pages of appendices ) , included that sodomy was a crime in every state but Illinois , and that discrimination because of “ sex ” was understood “ to refer to men and women . ”
In his own dissent , Justice Brett Kavanaugh leveled a different textualist argument : that the majority doesn ’ t apply the “ ordinary meaning ” of the text of the law , and that it departs from how “ sex ” discrimination has been interpreted in federal law for 25 years .
The robust debate over how to interpret statutes by itself makes the case something of a landmark , says William Eskridge , a professor at Yale Law School and author of the forthcoming book “ Marriage Equality : From Outlaws to In-Laws. ” Both dissenters cited his research on statutory interpretation and the history of LGBTQ rights , but in his opinion , Justice Gorsuch won the debate .
“ He accounts and relies on more text than the dissenters do . He explains more text , he is more thorough on the textual front , ” adds Professor Eskridge , who also wrote an amicus brief supporting the LGBTQ employees in the case .
This kind of schism between the court ’ s five conservatives has not been unusual since President Donald Trump consolidated their majority with the appointments of Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh .
“ This is a 5-4 majority , so if even one vote defects that majority isn ’ t there , and the conservative justices do have many disagreements among themselves , ” says Ilya Somin , a professor at George Mason University ’ s Antonin Scalia Law School .
“ It varies by the issue , ” he adds . “ Gorsuch has been more willing to subvert expectations than other conservatives . ”
While this is a landmark ruling for LGBTQ civil rights , the majority acknowledged that some important questions remain unanswered . Notably , the degree to which this ruling might burden an employer ’ s free exercise of religion , and whether transgender people can use sex-segregated bathrooms or locker rooms in line with their gender identity .
“ What the court has given here it can potentially take away with a vengeance ” when it comes to religious employers , says Professor Case . “ And if they do that it [ could ] not just be LGBT employees left with little to no protection , it [ could ] be every employee on every ground , with perhaps the exception of race . ”
This move could begin as early as this month , with the justices deliberating over a case argued last month over the “ ministerial exception ” doctrine , which bars certain employees of churches or other religious institutions from suing their employers for employment discrimination .
But the ruling is still a momentous one . Title VII , as Professor Eskridge describes it , is a “ super statute . ”
“ It has more ramifications for most Americans than the Constitution does , in terms of individual rights , ” he says . “ Discrimination based on sex – that ’ s a whopper . It ’ s a broad statute , and it applies to us . ”
“ What is important to us ? It ’ s the same things that are important to other Americans , ” he adds . “ That ’ s to not be [ criminalized ] ; to have our families recognized ; and to have jobs and not to be discriminated against . ”","“What is important to us? It’s the same things that are important to other Americans,” he adds. “That’s to not be [criminalized]; to have our families recognized; and to have jobs and not to be discriminated against.”

While questions of religious liberty remain to be addressed, the ruling is a momentous one. Title VII is a “super statute,” says Yale law professor William Eskridge. For individual rights, “It has more ramifications for most Americans than the Constitution.”

“Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not have anticipated their work would lead to this particular result,” wrote Justice Gorsuch. “But the limits of the drafters’ imagination supply no reason to ignore the law’s demands.”

Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on “race, color, religion, sex and national origin.” The majority held that “sex” covers “gay or transgender” people.

“Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not have anticipated their work would lead to this particular result,” wrote Justice Gorsuch. “But the limits of the drafters’ imagination supply no reason to ignore the law’s demands.”

“When the express terms of a statute give us one answer and extratextual considerations suggest another, it’s no contest,” he added. “Only the written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to its benefit.”

Required reading

The ground-level effects of the ruling are significant. In 25 states there are no explicit prohibitions against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. It also came days after the Trump administration – which had opposed the LGBTQ employees in the case – eliminated regulations prohibiting discrimination against transgender patients in health care.

“This is as important a ruling as Obergefell [v. Hodges],” the 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriage, says Michael Boucai, a professor at the University at Buffalo School of Law, “simply because employment is such a basic human need.”

And when one of the high court’s staunchest defenders of LGBTQ rights, Justice Anthony Kennedy, retired in 2018, most court watchers expected those rights only to get rolled back.

“It’s a matter of great good luck that the arguments that could be made in this case are obviously going to appeal to someone like Gorsuch,” says Mary Anne Case, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.

“It would have been hard for Gorsuch to cast a different vote without looking unprincipled,” she adds.

All nine justices would consider themselves textualists, to the extent they give the actual text of a statute significant weight when they interpret it. But Justice Gorsuch may be the strictest.

“The role of a judge is to say what the law is,” he said during his 2017 confirmation hearings. “Before I put a person in prison, before I deny someone of their liberty or property, I want to be very sure that I can look them square in the eye and say, ‘You should have known.’”

Yet he is also a conservative justice with a strong belief that the Supreme Court should not be driving social change. This case brought those two core principles to a head, and strict textualism won.

In a detailed, 32-page scrutiny of the “because of ... sex” phrase in Title VII, he makes the pivotal holding that while the law doesn’t explicitly reference LGBTQ employees, and while Congress in 1964 may not have intended it to cover them, it protects those employees nonetheless.

“When an employer fires an employee for being homosexual or transgender, it necessarily and intentionally discriminates against that individual in part because of sex,” he wrote.

Title VII “is a major piece of federal civil rights legislation. It is written in starkly broad terms. It has repeatedly produced unexpected applications,” he added. “The same judicial humility that requires us to refrain from adding to statutes requires us to refrain from diminishing them.”

Monday’s ruling also suggests that, if Congress were to pass clearly articulated legislation expanding protections for LGBTQ Americans, this court would uphold it. LGBTQ Americans are “still unprotected from discrimination in housing, and discrimination in public accommodations,” says Kimberly West-Faulcon, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.

Monday’s rationale for enshrining new civil rights for LGBTQ Americans differs markedly from Obergefell, the high court’s last major opinion in the area.

First, that case concerned a constitutional question instead of a statutory one. The Supreme Court is typically more reluctant to reinterpret the Constitution than a statute, but former Justice Kennedy was also plain in his opinion that while the 14th Amendment’s due process clause didn’t guarantee a right to same-sex marriage, it should.

“The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times,” he wrote. “When new insight reveals discord between the Constitution’s central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed.”

“It applies to us”

Justice Kennedy was joined in that opinion by the court’s four liberal justices, and that judicial philosophy – that laws and the Constitution can and should evolve with the times – is traditionally popular on the left.

Textualism is traditionally popular on the right, but yesterday’s ruling showed that it can also contain multitudes.

As Justice Samuel Alito wrote in a dissent (joined by his conservative colleague Justice Clarence Thomas), the majority opinion is not textbook textualism, but a “pirate ship.”

“It sails under a textualist flag,” he wrote. But “there is only one word for what the Court has done today: legislation.”

“When textualism is properly understood, it calls for an examination of the social context in which a statute was enacted,” he added.

The social context 50 years ago, he argued (with 52 pages of appendices), included that sodomy was a crime in every state but Illinois, and that discrimination because of “sex” was understood “to refer to men and women.”

In his own dissent, Justice Brett Kavanaugh leveled a different textualist argument: that the majority doesn’t apply the “ordinary meaning” of the text of the law, and that it departs from how “sex” discrimination has been interpreted in federal law for 25 years.

The robust debate over how to interpret statutes by itself makes the case something of a landmark, says William Eskridge, a professor at Yale Law School and author of the forthcoming book “Marriage Equality: From Outlaws to In-Laws.” Both dissenters cited his research on statutory interpretation and the history of LGBTQ rights, but in his opinion, Justice Gorsuch won the debate.

“He accounts and relies on more text than the dissenters do. He explains more text, he is more thorough on the textual front,” adds Professor Eskridge, who also wrote an amicus brief supporting the LGBTQ employees in the case.

This kind of schism between the court’s five conservatives has not been unusual since President Donald Trump consolidated their majority with the appointments of Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh.

“This is a 5-4 majority, so if even one vote defects that majority isn’t there, and the conservative justices do have many disagreements among themselves,” says Ilya Somin, a professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School.

“It varies by the issue,” he adds. “Gorsuch has been more willing to subvert expectations than other conservatives.”

While this is a landmark ruling for LGBTQ civil rights, the majority acknowledged that some important questions remain unanswered. Notably, the degree to which this ruling might burden an employer’s free exercise of religion, and whether transgender people can use sex-segregated bathrooms or locker rooms in line with their gender identity.

“What the court has given here it can potentially take away with a vengeance” when it comes to religious employers, says Professor Case. “And if they do that it [could] not just be LGBT employees left with little to no protection, it [could] be every employee on every ground, with perhaps the exception of race.”

This move could begin as early as this month, with the justices deliberating over a case argued last month over the “ministerial exception” doctrine, which bars certain employees of churches or other religious institutions from suing their employers for employment discrimination.

But the ruling is still a momentous one. Title VII, as Professor Eskridge describes it, is a “super statute.”

“It has more ramifications for most Americans than the Constitution does, in terms of individual rights,” he says. “Discrimination based on sex – that’s a whopper. It’s a broad statute, and it applies to us.”

“What is important to us? It’s the same things that are important to other Americans,” he adds. “That’s to not be [criminalized]; to have our families recognized; and to have jobs and not to be discriminated against.”

The Obama administration made clear last year that it would no longer defend the Defense of Marriage Act, the 1996 law that denies federal benefits to same-sex married couples. Obama said he’d concluded that law was unconstitutional. It was the Justice Department that asked the Supreme Court to take a challenge to DOMA, hoping justices would agree to strike it down.

However, the federal government has never taken a stand on the other, potentially more significant case that the justices added to their calendar on Friday: the legal challenge to California’s ban on same-sex marriage, approved in 2008. In 2010, a district court judge struck down Proposition 8 as unconstitutional and found a broad federal right to same-sex marriage. In February, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit also found the measure unconstitutional, but on narrower grounds.

Lerner,"The Supreme Court ’ s recent same-sex marriage ruling left many conservative Christians steamed , with some calling for new constitutional amendments and others urging resistance against America ’ s new legal reality .
But many leaders on the religious right accepted defeat quietly , embraced their new underdog status , and began coalescing around an invigorated crusade for “ religious liberty , ” with a strategy modeled on the very social movement that just beat them in court : gay-marriage advocates .
“ Same-sex marriage has been the looming cultural issue of the moment , ” said Phillip Bethancourt , executive vice president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission , an offshoot of the right-leaning Southern Baptist Convention . “ Religious liberty issues are the next horizon . ”
The religious right rose to prominence in American politics in the 1980s , under the banner of Jerry Falwell ’ s now-defunct “ Moral Majority. ” But now , Bethancourt said , conservative Christians have become a “ moral minority ” living in a “ post-Bible belt ” America that discriminates against them .
Justice Samuel Alito employed similar rhetoric in his same-sex marriage dissent , warning that Justice Anthony Kennedy ’ s sweeping decision will be “ used to vilify Americans who are unwilling to assent to the new orthodoxy. ” Justice Clarence Thomas agreed , writing in his own dissent that the ruling could have “ potentially ruinous consequences for religious liberty . ”
“ It seems like the oppressor is now taking on the mentality of the oppressed , ” said Brandan Robertson , a self-described evangelical who supports same-sex marriage .
A number of Republican presidential candidates have echoed those arguments following the high court ’ s decision .
Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal told Fox News that “ already Christian businesses are facing discrimination if they don ’ t want to participate in wedding ceremonies that violate their sincerely held beliefs. ” Former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee similarly warned in a USA Today op-ed of businesses “ economically terrorized ” for their beliefs and the ruling ’ s coming “ collision with the First Amendment guarantee of religious liberty . ”
Similar worries about the plight of religious dissenters surfaced sporadically before the court ’ s decision — mostly in states with gay marriage and LGBT anti-discrimination laws or occasionally on a national scale , in reference to debates over abortion and contraception . But now , longtime evangelical leader Gary Bauer said , there ’ s widespread consensus among conservatives that “ the next battlefield is protecting religious liberty , ” with a particular emphasis on Americans whose religious beliefs prevent them from partaking in same-sex marriage ceremonies .
In the wake of the court ’ s decision , the religious right has already begun pushing new religious freedom laws and executive orders in state governments specifically targeted at preventing state agencies from penalizing businesses and individuals who refuse to participate in gay weddings .
Kansas Gov . Sam Brownback became the first Republican politician to take action , issuing an executive order Tuesday that forbids the state government from penalizing any religious leader or organization that refuses to participate in a same-sex marriage . In a statement accompanying the order , he cited a need to “ protect against any infringement ” of the “ right to worship according to ‘ dictates of conscience ’ . ”
Unlike Indiana or Arkansas ’ controversial religious freedom bills , which drew fire nationally for broad language that potentially extended to lawsuits between private individuals and businesses , Brownback ’ s order specifically dealt with government penalties for those who refuse to recognize gay-wedding ceremonies . The order made direct reference to Obergefell v. Hodges , the Supreme Court ’ s gay marriage decision , as an “ imposition ” that “ poses potential infringements on the civil right of religious liberty . ”
And in Congress , more than 100 members have followed suit by cosponsoring the First Amendment Defense Act , which would prevent the federal government from revoking the tax-exempt status of religious organizations that do not recognize same-sex marriages . The bill speaks to fears fueled by President Obama ’ s own solicitor general , Donald Verrilli , who said during Obergefell ’ s oral arguments that non-cooperative religious organizations ’ tax-exempt status is “ certainly going to be an issue ” for the court in the future .
A number of religious conservatives told ███ that the key to winning these upcoming legislative and legal battles will be employing tactics refined by the same-sex marriage movement that recently defeated them .
“ [ LGBT activists ] did a good job of making the stories of peoples ’ lives front and center and saying , ‘ Look at how these people are affected , ’ ” said Travis Weber of the Family Research Council . Groups like Freedom to Marry and the Human Rights Campaign used social media to promote popular gay and lesbian celebrities ’ viewpoints and encouraged Americans to look to their LGBT neighbors asking for acceptance .
Conservatives should follow suit , Weber said , by highlighting the stories of religious individuals he said had been “ demonized , ” pointing to businesses like Sweet Cakes by Melissa , an Oregon bakery that was fined $ 135,000 for refusing to bake a wedding wake for a lesbian couple , or the Odgaard family , who shut down their Iowa bistro after a legal battle over their refusal to host a same-sex wedding . These cases , he believes , can serve as the same sort of compelling hook that Justice Kennedy used by putting James Obergefell ’ s heartfelt story of losing his husband at the beginning of his decision .
Another cue conservative Christians are taking from their Obergefell defeat : Don ’ t focus too heavily on gay and lesbian peoples ’ sex lives . Instead , focus on religious liberty issues that have nothing to do with the bedroom .
“ When sexual liberty and religious liberty are at odds with each other , in our culture , oftentimes sexual liberty prevails , ” Bethancourt said , noting that the same-sex marriage movement was ultimately successful in highlighting families seeking parental rights and access to loved ones in the hospital .
Bethancourt ’ s group wrote an amicus brief for the Supreme Court on behalf of a young Muslim woman who was denied a job at Abercrombie and Fitch on the presumption that she would not take off her head scarf during work . The case , he noted , was a clear-cut issue of religious liberty without an alienating sexual component , and it also allowed his movement to partner with other religious groups so that religious liberty arguments were no longer tethered to a particular denomination .
“ People of faith have to stand together , they have to look out for each other , ” Bethancourt said .
And there ’ s another lesson for religious conservatives : Build a diverse coalition . Bethancourt noted that progressive groups , from the NAACP to the ACLU , successfully expanded the base of support for marriage equality outside of traditional LGBT advocates .
But no matter how the Christian right evangelizes and markets itself , many same-sex marriage advocates see it as nothing more than bigotry in sheep ’ s clothing .
The religious right has employed the “ language of apocalyptic impending doom ” because “ religious leaders realize they ’ re losing their base , ” said Robertson , who characterized the right ’ s narrative as : “ We ’ ve lost our position of influence in our country , we ’ re now a minority , and [ thus ] persecution is coming . ”
“ LGBT activists [ were ] saying , ‘ Treat us the same as everyone else ’ for a long period of time , and conservative Christians are [ now ] saying , ‘ What we want is a carve out so we are exempt from parts of civil law , ’ ” said Clyde Wilcox , a professor at Georgetown University who wrote “ Onward Christian Soldiers : The Christian Right in American Politics . ”

As Joe Biden might say, it's a big family deal

These are no ordinary laws before the Supreme Court: They represent battles over a generations-old concept of marriage and the rights of an increasing number of families in legally recognized gay and lesbian relationships.

Nine states and the District of Columbia now allow same-sex couples to marry, and a dozen others recognize ""civil unions"" or ""domestic partnerships"" that grant some of the same benefits without full marriage rights.

How we got here

It starts back in 1993, when Hawaii's Supreme Court found that the state couldn't deny same-sex couples the right to marry without a ""compelling reason"" and sent the issue back to the state legislature. Hawaii lawmakers quickly passed a law banning gay marriage, and advocates of traditional marriage began mobilizing to fight the prospect of gays and lesbians being able to marry.

That led to the passage of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, the 1996 legislation that forbids the recognition of same-sex marriages nationwide and bars married gay and lesbian couples from receiving federal benefits.

But DOMA is becoming an orphan. Two federal appeals courts have already struck down its benefits provision; the Obama administration has refused to defend it; and former President Bill Clinton, who signed it, now calls it "" incompatible with our Constitution ."" With the Justice Department now arguing against it, Republicans in the House of Representatives hired their own lawyers to defend the act.

The California ban, known as Proposition 8, passed by a 52-48% margin in 2008. It eliminated the right to marry that had been recognized by California courts earlier that year. Opponents of the measure challenged it in court and have succeeded in convincing federal judges at the district and appellate levels to find the ban unconstitutional.

The justices will hear oral arguments on Proposition 8 on Tuesday. On Wednesday, they will take up DOMA.

A civil right, or a political question

One the biggest issues facing the justices is whether they can -- or should -- issue a ruling that will effectively broaden the legal definition of marriage, long restricted to heterosexual couples. Backers of DOMA and Proposition 8 say it should be up to the public to make that decision, not the courts.

""Our most fundamental right in this country is the right to vote and the right to participate in the political process, "" said Austin Nimocks of the Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian advocacy group.

""We don't need the Supreme Court to take that right away from Americans of good faith on both sides of this issue and impose its judicial solution,"" Nimocks told CNN's State of the Union. ""We need to leave this debate to the democratic process, which is working.""

The Supreme Court will hear arguments this week in two same-sex marriage cases . Whatever the justices do , the outcome seems foreordained . When 80 % of Americans under 30 agree about something , that something will happen -- it 's only a matter of time .
But while straight young Americans support marriage for gays , increasingly they opt against marriage for themselves . Nearly half of American children , 48 % , are now born to unmarried women . Among women without college degrees , and of all races , unwed motherhood has become the norm .
This is the crisis of the American family . Whether same-sex marriage proceeds fast or slow , whether it extends to all 50 states or stops with the current nine plus the District of Columbia , the crisis will be the same .
Children born to single parents face much longer odds in life than children born to married parents . ( A new study by ThirdWay.org suggests that the harms are especially intense for boys , less so for girls . ) `` Odds '' are not rules , of course . There are always exceptions .
On average , however , children born to married mothers and fathers are more likely to finish college , more likely to avoid prison and more likely to form marriages themselves than children born to single parents . And precisely because the harms of single parenthood tend to be self-replicating , the breakdown of marriage threatens to harden into a caste divide , with some families launched into cycles of downward mobility because of the unstable relationships of parents or grandparents or great-grandparents .
For 20 years , Americans have fiercely debated whether gays -- who constitute maybe 3 % of the population -- should be allowed to marry each other . Meanwhile , Americans have given short shrift to what is happening to the 97 % of the population that is allowed to marry , but increasingly opts not to do so .
One reason we 've given the single-parenthood problem short shrift is that we lack good ideas about how to address it . The core of the problem seems to be the decline of male wages relative to female wages . The New York Times this week quoted an MIT economist , Michael Greenstone :
`` I think the greatest , most astonishing fact that I am aware of in social science right now is that women have been able to hear the labor market screaming out 'You need more education ' and have been able to respond to that , and men have not . And it 's very , very scary for economists because people should be responding to price signals . And men are not . It 's a fact in need of an explanation . ''
As men ( on average ) finish less education , as male wages ( on average ) decline , men become less attractive as marital partners . As Harvard 's Christopher Jencks -- a left-leaning academic , it should be stressed -- said in that same New York Times piece : `` Single-parent families tend to emerge in places where the men already are a mess . ''
But how do we make men without a college education less of a mess ? This is the master problem of American society , and not only American society . Everywhere in the developed world , the decline of mass-production industries has put pressure on the roles and incomes of working-class and middle-class men . The expansion of government and service industries has opened new opportunities for women , of which working-class and middle-class men seem less able to avail themselves .

It 's important to note that men in full-time work continue to earn more than women in full-time work .
But that bottom-line number conceals a widening divergence between the family patterns of the college-educated top one-third , where family life is increasingly stable , and those of the non-college-educated bottom two-thirds , where family life is increasingly disrupted .
It 's the family life of the bottom two-thirds that is the family policy challenge of the 21st century . The debate over same-sex marriage is yesteryear 's issue .

One reason we've given the single-parenthood problem short shrift is that we lack good ideas about how to address it. The core of the problem seems to be the decline of male wages relative to female wages. The New York Times this week quoted an MIT economist , Michael Greenstone:

""I think the greatest, most astonishing fact that I am aware of in social science right now is that women have been able to hear the labor market screaming out 'You need more education' and have been able to respond to that, and men have not. And it's very, very scary for economists because people should be responding to price signals. And men are not. It's a fact in need of an explanation.""

As men (on average) finish less education, as male wages (on average) decline, men become less attractive as marital partners. As Harvard's Christopher Jencks -- a left-leaning academic, it should be stressed -- said in that same New York Times piece: ""Single-parent families tend to emerge in places where the men already are a mess.""

But how do we make men without a college education less of a mess? This is the master problem of American society, and not only American society. Everywhere in the developed world, the decline of mass-production industries has put pressure on the roles and incomes of working-class and middle-class men. The expansion of government and service industries has opened new opportunities for women, of which working-class and middle-class men seem less able to avail themselves.

It's important to note that men in full-time work continue to earn more than women in full-time work.

But that bottom-line number conceals a widening divergence between the family patterns of the college-educated top one-third, where family life is increasingly stable, and those of the non-college-educated bottom two-thirds, where family life is increasingly disrupted.

It's the family life of the bottom two-thirds that is the family policy challenge of the 21st century. The debate over same-sex marriage is yesteryear's issue. It's settled, whether the Supreme Court knows it or not. But how to ensure that the next generation of American children enjoys the more equal chance and the wider opportunities from a more universal commitment to marriage -- that debate needs to begin.",www.cnn.com,left,JWX5iF2fbaM66etj

lgbt_rights,Newsmax,2,http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/conservatives-gay-marriage-support/2013/03/25/id/496108,"Silent or Supportive, Conservatives Give Gay Marriage Momentum",2013-03-25,,"On a frosty December night last year , about two dozen guests slipped into the Alta Club , a century-old private retreat a block away from the temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that dominates Salt Lake City .
Two men , who did n't know each other , were the reason for the dinner : church lobbyist Bill Evans and gay rights leader Rick Jacobs . Evans was a point man for the church 's successful effort to pass California 's gay marriage ban , known as Prop 8 , in 2008 . Jacobs , leader of Courage Campaign , produced a 2008 commercial against the ban showing Mormon missionaries ransacking the home of a lesbian couple .
Politics was not on the agenda - just getting to know each other . `` The two hit it off , '' said host Greg Prince , a medical researcher and church member who had come to know both men . He noted that less than a month before the dinner , the church had launched a website with a major change in its view of gays : the site said homosexuality was not a choice .
`` There has been a shift of some tectonic plate somewhere , '' Prince said .
Shifting attitudes among some conservatives and many businesses is altering the landscape around gay marriage , long considered a uniquely liberal and political issue , at one of its most crucial junctures - its review by the U.S. Supreme Court .
On Tuesday and Wednesday , the court 's nine justices will hear arguments on the constitutionality of Prop 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act , which excludes gay couples from federal benefits .
Some jurists look to societal changes when interpreting the law , and scholars speculate that Justice Anthony Kennedy , the possible swing vote in the divided court , will be pondering increased public support for gay marriage .
A Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week found 63 percent of Americans supported gay marriage or civil unions .
While the Mormon Church has backed `` traditional marriage '' in Supreme Court briefs , it has been silent in recent ballot battles and has not promoted fundraising as it has in the past .
Republicans like Senator Rob Portman of Ohio are supporting gay marriage and publicly conflicting with party leaders , such as House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner . Portman this month said he had switched position on the issue after his son told him he was gay .
Corporations , including Goldman Sachs , whose chief executive , Lloyd Blankfein , has campaigned in support of gay marriage , have joined the battle , arguing in briefs to the court that federal policy of not allowing gay marriage is bad for business .
The issue is far from settled , however . Gay marriage opponents have been written off as dinosaurs before , including in California , and most states ban same-sex weddings . But the momentum has been moving towards the proponents of gay marriage .
Money has played a huge part in the pivot , both in terms of the financing of campaigns in favor of gay marriage and the funding of opposition groups .
When the New York State Senate voted to approve gay marriage in 2011 , four Republicans joined Democrats . Republicans led by hedge fund manager Paul Singer , whose son is gay , gave the four financial and moral support , and in the 2012 national race , Singer led a political action committee that spent more than $ 2 million to help pro-gay marriage Republicans .
`` You have billionaires telling Republicans 'Vote our way and you 'll receive more money than you 've ever seen , ' '' said Brian Brown , president of the National Organization for Marriage , the leader of the movement to stop gay marriage . `` That was new . ''
Pro-gay marriage groups have routed their opponents financially , outraising them three-to-one in November 2012 ballot races that legalized same-sex marriage in three more states , bringing the total to nine states and the District of Columbia .
The single biggest fundraising change between 2008 and 2012 was the disappearance from the political arena of the mightiest foe of gay marriage - the Mormon Church .
While the church has petitioned the Supreme Court in favor of Prop 8 , it has focused its public messages about gays on personal issues of respect and love rather than politics .
In the four November 2012 votes - Maine , Maryland , Washington and Minnesota - the top ballot committees raised about $ 30 million for gay marriage and $ 10 million against it . The $ 20 million difference between the two campaigns last year is close to several estimates of what the Mormon Church and its supporters gave to California 's Prop 8 in 2008 .
More than 800 Utahns gave $ 2.7 million to support Prop 8 in 2008 , state campaign finance records show . In 2012 , a total of 16 Utahns gave $ 1,264 to the main ballot committees against gay marriage .
`` The Mormon Church left as a major funder , '' concluded Chad Griffin , president of the Human Rights Campaign ( HRC ) , the biggest gay rights group .
Frank Schubert , who ran the 2008 and 2012 anti-gay-marriage campaigns , downplayed the Church hierarchy 's silence last year . `` Not having a direct statement encouraging people to get involved in the campaign naturally would result in fewer people getting involved in the campaigns , but there were fewer Mormons in these states to begin with , and there was never any expectation that they would be involved . ''
California Mormon Brooke Crosland , 27 , gave $ 1,000 in 2008 for Prop 8 and made campaign phone calls , but she stayed out of politics in 2012 . She described a personal search for understanding , which she saw reflected in the church . `` I feel like the ideal for a child is a father and a mother , but I also feel under the law we should have equal rights , '' she said .
Screenwriter Dustin Lance Black , whose portrait of gay rights pioneer Harvey Milk won an Academy Award , was approached for informal talks by Mormon officials after he narrated a documentary critical of the church called `` 8 : The Mormon Proposition . '' Church officials were surprised to learn that he , a young , gay man , deeply wanted a family . `` That was this big 'ah ha ' moment , '' he said .
But Black said the initial invitation came only after the church was pilloried in public . `` They did n't contact me after making 'Milk ' . They contacted me after making ' 8 : The Mormon Proposition ' , '' said Black , who was raised a Mormon . He since has introduced HRC leader Griffin to church officials , at the December dinner and a concert following , while continuing talks .
Church spokesman Michael Purdy said its hospitality did not signal a change in position . `` Being committed to marriage between a man and a woman does not mean that we do not love and care for all of God 's children . Having conversations with gay rights leaders , speaking about compassion and respect for all , and inviting people to attend a concert do not equal pulling back from supporting traditional marriage due to negative publicity during Prop 8 , '' he wrote by email .
Meanwhile , gay marriage fans and foes agree that same-sex-union proponents have improved their fundraising . Ted Olson , President George W. Bush 's Solicitor General , made it ok for conservatives to support gay marriage when he agreed to take the Prop 8 case , said Margaret Hoover , a pro-gay-marriage Republican activist .
When former Republican Party Chairman Ken Mehlman in 2010 came out as gay , it was critical mass . `` Nightingales do n't sing unless they hear another nightingale singing . As soon they hear one , another one sings , and another one sings , '' said Hoover .
Dozens of Republican leaders , including former California candidate for governor Meg Whitman and former presidential candidate Jon Huntsman , have signed a brief to the Supreme Court in favor of gay marriage .
Some 278 businesses , including Goldman Sachs and hotelier Marriott International , whose chairman and major stockholder is Mormon , have signed a similar brief opposing the Defense of Marriage Act . ( Thomson Reuters , the parent of Reuters News , is part of that group . )
The person credited by all sides with cementing the victory in California for the gay marriage ban was a little schoolgirl who told her mother she had just been taught , `` I can marry a princess ! '' The girl was in a commercial for Prop 8 , and for years Evan Wolfson , president of Freedom to Marry , has been asked whether he could beat the `` Princess '' ad .
Wolfson , a fundraising and strategy leader for most recent ballot campaigns in favor of gay marriage , said the answer was chiefly to change his own side 's message , rather than chase the opposition . The pro-gay-marriage campaign , which in 2008 had largely focused on appealing to voters to give gays rights because it said they deserved them , took a more personal tone , he said , of affirming the idea of equal rights and respecting loving couples .
David Blankenhorn , founder of the family-focused Institute for American Values think tank , was the prime witness in 2010 in the opening round of the federal trial of Prop . 8 . Blankenhorn struck up unlikely friendships with gays while debating the issue in public , and he was sitting at his desk one day last year , when one called and told him to go to a website with a strident , anti-gay article .
`` He said , 'Are you sure that this is the side you are on ? ' '' Blankenhorn recalled . He put down the phone , and in that moment realized he had already changed his mind .
`` I have a kind of intellectual reason for shifting from one foot to the other foot , '' he said `` But I really , honestly think that it was through just personal interactions ... if you want to stick with your position , do n't get to know people who disagree with you . ''
Gay marriage foe Brown says he is not worried by polls that show gay marriage support snowballing . It 's all about how you ask the question , he said , and a majority of voters do not want to redefine marriage . His side has always been behind in the money battle , he added , but has had some banner successes .
Politicians can see the danger of switching sides , he said . Of the four New York State Senate Republicans who voted for same-sex marriage , only one returned to office , despite financial backing from sources as diverse as the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) union , Wall Street Republicans , and libertarian David Koch .
Back in California , Rick Jacobs , the Courage Campaign chief , thinks Prop 8 was the best thing that ever happened to his movement . People sat up and started paying attention when liberal California overturned its own state Supreme Court and took away the right to marry , he said , and the court fight has kept the issue alive .
`` It not only galvanized a lot of people who did n't really care about it before that - gay people - but it also galvanized straight people , '' he said . `` People said , 'wait a minute , we do n't like voting on people 's rights . ' ''
The night in Salt Lake City left little doubt things had changed since 2008 . After the dinner , the gay rights leaders all headed over to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir 's Christmas spectacular . It was the hottest ticket in town and , as guests of the church , they had VIP seats .","On a frosty December night last year, about two dozen guests slipped into the Alta Club, a century-old private retreat a block away from the temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that dominates Salt Lake City.



Two men, who didn't know each other, were the reason for the dinner: church lobbyist Bill Evans and gay rights leader Rick Jacobs. Evans was a point man for the church's successful effort to pass California's gay marriage ban, known as Prop 8, in 2008. Jacobs, leader of Courage Campaign, produced a 2008 commercial against the ban showing Mormon missionaries ransacking the home of a lesbian couple.



Politics was not on the agenda - just getting to know each other. ""The two hit it off,"" said host Greg Prince, a medical researcher and church member who had come to know both men. He noted that less than a month before the dinner, the church had launched a website with a major change in its view of gays: the site said homosexuality was not a choice.



""There has been a shift of some tectonic plate somewhere,"" Prince said.



Shifting attitudes among some conservatives and many businesses is altering the landscape around gay marriage, long considered a uniquely liberal and political issue, at one of its most crucial junctures - its review by the U.S. Supreme Court.



On Tuesday and Wednesday, the court's nine justices will hear arguments on the constitutionality of Prop 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act, which excludes gay couples from federal benefits.



Some jurists look to societal changes when interpreting the law, and scholars speculate that Justice Anthony Kennedy, the possible swing vote in the divided court, will be pondering increased public support for gay marriage.



A Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week found 63 percent of Americans supported gay marriage or civil unions.



While the Mormon Church has backed ""traditional marriage"" in Supreme Court briefs, it has been silent in recent ballot battles and has not promoted fundraising as it has in the past.



Republicans like Senator Rob Portman of Ohio are supporting gay marriage and publicly conflicting with party leaders, such as House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner. Portman this month said he had switched position on the issue after his son told him he was gay.



Corporations, including Goldman Sachs, whose chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, has campaigned in support of gay marriage, have joined the battle, arguing in briefs to the court that federal policy of not allowing gay marriage is bad for business.



The issue is far from settled, however. Gay marriage opponents have been written off as dinosaurs before, including in California, and most states ban same-sex weddings. But the momentum has been moving towards the proponents of gay marriage.



MORMON MONEY, NO MORE



Money has played a huge part in the pivot, both in terms of the financing of campaigns in favor of gay marriage and the funding of opposition groups.



When the New York State Senate voted to approve gay marriage in 2011, four Republicans joined Democrats. Republicans led by hedge fund manager Paul Singer, whose son is gay, gave the four financial and moral support, and in the 2012 national race, Singer led a political action committee that spent more than $2 million to help pro-gay marriage Republicans.



""You have billionaires telling Republicans 'Vote our way and you'll receive more money than you've ever seen,'"" said Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, the leader of the movement to stop gay marriage. ""That was new.""



Pro-gay marriage groups have routed their opponents financially, outraising them three-to-one in November 2012 ballot races that legalized same-sex marriage in three more states, bringing the total to nine states and the District of Columbia.



The single biggest fundraising change between 2008 and 2012 was the disappearance from the political arena of the mightiest foe of gay marriage - the Mormon Church.

Harris, Alexander Burns, Maggie Haberman","Rob Portman and Hillary Clinton have both come out in support of gay marriage . | AP Photos Politicians and gay marriage calculus
When historians write the story of America ’ s cultural revolution on gay marriage , March of 2013 may well get its own chapter — the month when the political balance on this issue shifted unmistakably from risky to safe .
But historians will surely also note that this was a movement in which the politicians , for the most part , were mere passengers along for the ride . With very few exceptions , elected officials remain profiles in caution and calculation , while activists and courts are the real engines of change .
All of this month ’ s three big gay-marriage moments — in which prominent politicians repudiated their past positions — highlighted how much vacillation , equivocation , and even hypocrisy continue to define the political response to this issue . That ’ s true even as , in many cases and especially for Democrats , it is now riskier to be seen as a laggard in embracing gay marriage than to rush in line behind what just not long ago was a radical stand .
Hillary Clinton caught bouquets from many liberals for her video this week backing gay marriage , a stance which now enjoys majority support in national polls . She cited how the experience of knowing gay friends caused her to rethink her position . But does anyone really believe that Clinton ’ s actual views have changed since the 2008 presidential campaign , when she was against gay marriage , rather than her calculation that the safe position has changed ?
Bill Clinton himself had some explaining to do this month when he reversed course on the Defense of Marriage Act reviled by liberals , even though he signed it during the midst of his 1996 reelection campaign . Between the lines of his Washington Post op-ed , his argument was pretty simple : The politics of the issue were murder for Democrats back then .
Even the Republican making headlines on gay marriage this month , Ohio Sen . Rob Portman , is taking a stand that is less bold or principled than first meets the eye . He said his view changed because his son told him he was gay , two years ago . But every gay person is someone ’ s kid — a fact that surely occurred to him when he crafted his former position against same-sex marriage .
Amid this rapidly shifting ground , here are a half-dozen takeaways on the new politics of gay marriage :
As recently as 2008 , both major-party presidential nominees had nearly the same public position on marriage : let there be civil unions , not gay marriage , and let each state set its own policy . That was a safe view for pro-gay Democrats and moderate Republicans alike .

When historians write the story of America’s cultural revolution on gay marriage, March of 2013 may well get its own chapter — the month when the political balance on this issue shifted unmistakably from risky to safe.

But historians will surely also note that this was a movement in which the politicians, for the most part, were mere passengers along for the ride. With very few exceptions, elected officials remain profiles in caution and calculation, while activists and courts are the real engines of change.

All of this month’s three big gay-marriage moments — in which prominent politicians repudiated their past positions — highlighted how much vacillation, equivocation, and even hypocrisy continue to define the political response to this issue. That’s true even as, in many cases and especially for Democrats, it is now riskier to be seen as a laggard in embracing gay marriage than to rush in line behind what just not long ago was a radical stand.

Hillary Clinton caught bouquets from many liberals for her video this week backing gay marriage, a stance which now enjoys majority support in national polls. She cited how the experience of knowing gay friends caused her to rethink her position. But does anyone really believe that Clinton’s actual views have changed since the 2008 presidential campaign, when she was against gay marriage, rather than her calculation that the safe position has changed?

Bill Clinton himself had some explaining to do this month when he reversed course on the Defense of Marriage Act reviled by liberals, even though he signed it during the midst of his 1996 reelection campaign. Between the lines of his Washington Post op-ed, his argument was pretty simple: The politics of the issue were murder for Democrats back then.

Even the Republican making headlines on gay marriage this month, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, is taking a stand that is less bold or principled than first meets the eye. He said his view changed because his son told him he was gay, two years ago. But every gay person is someone’s kid — a fact that surely occurred to him when he crafted his former position against same-sex marriage.

Amid this rapidly shifting ground, here are a half-dozen takeaways on the new politics of gay marriage:

The middle ground on marriage is disappearing fast

As recently as 2008, both major-party presidential nominees had nearly the same public position on marriage: let there be civil unions, not gay marriage, and let each state set its own policy. That was a safe view for pro-gay Democrats and moderate Republicans alike.

Today, that position is fully acceptable only to a diminishing slice of the electorate. For supporters of gay marriage, it looks like an insulting, separate-but-equal proposition. For opponents of same-sex unions, it’s an invitation to a chaotic patchwork of laws governing an immutable human institution.

The `` Fairness in Women 's Sports Act '' ( HB 500 ) states that there are `` inherent differences between men and women , '' and these differences `` range from chromosonal and hormonal differences to physiological differences . '' It then cites numerous medical articles documenting the biological differences between men and women and how men , in general , have a quantifiable advantage over women in athletics .
One article , published in the Washington Post ( 4/29/19 ) and written by All-American track athlete Doriana Coleman and tennis champion Martina Navratilova , states , `` The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty , in every sport except sailing , shooting , and riding , there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls and women in head-to-head competition . Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science . ''
The Act then explains how any sports program in or affiliated with the Idaho public schools and universities must have sports teams based on biological sex : `` Males , men or boys ; females , women , or girls ; and coed or mixed . ''
`` Athletic teams or sports designated for females , women , or girls shall not be open to students of the male sex , '' reads the new law .
The pro-LGBT Human Rights Campaign ( HRC ) said , `` Idaho is now a national innovator in discrimination , having passed and signed into law first-of-its-kind anti-transgender legislation .

`` H.B . 500 forbids transgender girls from being able to play on sports teams with other girls , and it will subject all girls to the risk of invasive , expensive , and inappropriate testing , '' said the HRC .

The birth certificate bill ( HB 509 ) basically says that birth certificates will be issued based on a person 's biological , anatomical , chromosonal sex , and birth certificates can not be changed to represent someone 's preferred gender identity , such as a transgender `` woman '' -- a biological male -- claiming to be female .
The new law states , `` Any certificate of birth issued under the provisions of this chapter shall include the following quantitative statistics and material facts specific to that birth : time of birth , date of birth , sex , birth weight , birth length , and place of birth . ''
It further states , `` For purposes of this chapter , 'sex ' means the immutable biological and physiological characteristics , specifically the chromosomes and internal and external reproductive anatomy , genetically determined at conception and generally recognizable at birth , that define an individual as male or female . ''
Commenting on this legislation , the HRC said , `` HB 509 flouts a recent decision by a federal court and , again contrary to the advice of the Idaho Attorney General , guarantees that Idaho taxpayers will be paying to defend yet another discriminatory law -- this time one that impedes transgender people from obtaining a birth certificate updated with the correct gender marker .

She first stepped foot in the statehouse in 2017 , to testify against a bill that would bar her 7-year-old , transgender daughter from using the girl ’ s bathroom . Next came an effort to stop a bill to prohibit family courts from using a parent ’ s affirmation ( or lack thereof ) of a child ’ s transgender identity as a consideration in custody hearings .
Both bills eventually died , but Gonzales is now gearing up for yet another fight . This fall , two Republican lawmakers in the state vowed to introduce legislation barring trans kids from receiving certain gender-affirming health care and criminalizing parents who allow their children to transition .
And Texas isn ’ t the only place where conservatives are trying to make it harder for trans kids to live in accordance with their gender identity . In November , a Republican representative in South Carolina introduced legislation that would prohibit “ gender reassignment medical treatment ” for people under the age of 18 . Doctors who provide such care would be professionally sanctioned and could potentially lose their medical license . A bill that is being drafted in Georgia would make it a felony for medical professionals to aid in a minor ’ s gender transition . A lawmaker in Kentucky said in a public Facebook post that she is also at work on a similar bill .
“ I really wish that our politicians would stop using young children for their political gain , ” Gonzales says . “ It ’ s so frightening to have the people that are supposed to be protecting all kids across the state to be instead picking and choosing who they want to protect and targeting the ones that they don ’ t . ”
All of the bills were spurred by the sensationalized story of a Texas custody battle between two parents with vastly different views on gender identity . The case involved a 7-year-old kid who , according to reports , had been identifying as a transgender girl for years . Her father claimed the feminine gender identity was being forced on the child by her mother , and refused to help cover the costs of therapy or any gender-affirming care . Earlier this year , he made pleas at the state capitol and on several social media pages , claiming his child was being used as a pawn in some socially progressive scheme to revoke his parental rights .
The Daily Caller first picked up the story about the custody fight from a local news website run by a former Republican state senator . Then Fox News and conservative pundits like Matt Walsh joined in the fray . Some warned of “ chemical castration , ” even though the actual custody dispute revolved around social transitioning—affirming the person ’ s gender identity by using their chosen name and pronouns—which involves no medical interventions . They published video and photos of the child , supposedly proving their point . Soon , the story had been picked up by Donald Trump Jr .
Shortly after , Texas Rep. Matt Krause promised to introduce a bill in 2021 , the next time the state legislature will be in session , to bar minors from using puberty blockers , a gender-affirming medical treatment that allows transgender kids to temporarily postpone puberty so they have more time to explore their gender identity . Another Texas Republican , Rep. Steve Toth , vowed to introduce legislation that would criminalize parents who allow their child to transition . In a tweet , Toth said the legislation would be the very first bill he filed next session . The misconstrued facts of the case were like a dog whistle , rallying troops for the anti-LGBTQ culture war , and soon lawmakers in and out of Texas started to get involved .
Having lost the battle to stop transgender people from using public bathrooms that conform to their gender identity , conservatives have doubled down on trying to control the private lives of trans people . This time , Republican strategists are putting transgender kids , and the people who support them , at the center of an effort to shore up conservative support . According to Andrew Reynolds , a political science professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill , gender identity remains the most divisive identity issue—more so than race , ethnicity , sex , religion , disability status or even sexual orientation—for American voters , and conservatives in particular . In a recent study from the Public Religion Research Institute , nearly three-quarters of Republicans surveyed believe there are only two genders . Only one third said they would be “ somewhat or very comfortable ” with having their child come out as transgender . ( A little more than half of Democrats said they believe gender exists in spectrum , and 60 percent said they would be comfortable having a trans child . )
And this anti-trans strategy isn ’ t limited to local politics . An advocacy group called the American Principles Project waded into Kentucky ’ s gubernatorial elections this year by running a series of inflammatory ads warning that the Democratic candidate would let boys play on girls ’ sports teams . The New York Times described the effort as a pilot program to determine how to “ use the debate over transgender rights to rally conservative voters in support of President Trump . ”
Reynolds says if you look at it from a strictly strategic perspective , rights for transgender people are “ the only one of the LGBTQ+ issues that still has some resonance ” among voters . “ It ’ s the only lever , I would say , that still can drive conservative , religious , white voters—fearful voters—to Republicans . ”
This year , lawmakers in Illinois and New Hampshire tried to pass bills criminalizing parents and doctors who helped kids transition . South Dakota legislators proposed a bill that would allow parents to refuse transition-related health care for their kids . None of them passed .
Of the upcoming legislation , only the South Carolina bill text has been released so far , so the exact language in the others is unclear . But many of the announcements surrounding the proposals included hyperbolic talk of “ castration , ” “ genital mutilation ” and “ radical surgery. ” A pediatric endocrinologist quoted in the press release announcing the Georgia bill described medical transitioning for minors as “ medical experimentation based on wishful social theory . ”
Such criticism , says Cathryn Oakley , the state legislative director for Human Rights Campaign , stems from anti-LGBTQ backlash and fear mongering .
“ There ’ s been this incredibly wonderful and impactful rise in visibility of transgender people in the public sphere , ” Oakley said . “ But at the same time , I think there are many folks who are not educated who have a lot of confusion , who have a lot of questions . Opponents of equality have seized on that gap between visibility and understanding , and they ’ re trying to exploit that . ”
Dr. Izzy Lowell , an Atlanta-area doctor who primarily treats queer patients , says the transition process for young trans kids is often far less dramatic than opponents suggest . Lowell describes herself as conservative when it comes to prescribing hormones , and says for very young patients she tells their parents to “ do nothing other than social transition. ” She tells them to “ affirm that child ’ s gender , as much as you can , but let them lead—never impose a gender on them . ”
That ’ s more or less how things went for Gonzales ’ family .
“ There ’ s definitely this image put out there that your kid comes to you and says ‘ hey , I ’ m a girl , ’ and you ’ re like ‘ fantastic ! let ’ s go change your name at the courthouse , ' ” Gonzales says . The process looks different for every family , but “ by the time we decided to embrace [ my daughter ’ s ] social transition , she had been telling us who she is for at least two years , probably longer . ”
Gonzales ’ daughter is now nine years old and still not at a point where she is considering gender-affirming medical treatment .
“ We do nothing , medically , until they start puberty , ” says Lowell , who has treated hundreds of queer kids ( but not Gonzales ’ daughter ) . Hormone blockers are only meant to delay puberty , “ so that [ kids ] don ’ t develop characteristics of the wrong gender for them. ” The process is entirely reversible , as are the first few months of hormone therapy for older kids . She starts kids on very low doses of hormones until they ’ re sure the treatment is making them feel better . “ It doesn ’ t happen very often , almost never , ” that a patient asks to stop hormone therapy .
Opponents of medical transition for minors often argue that there hasn ’ t been enough research into the long-term effects of puberty blockers and cross-hormone therapy on things like brain development and fertility . But Lowell , Oakley and Reynolds all point to the well-established consequences of vilifying trans kids as reasons familial acceptance and puberty blockers are important . Transgender youth have a significantly higher suicide rate than their cisgender peers , and research has suggested that family acceptance and gender affirmation can go a long way toward reducing the risk of suicide attempts .
“ A whole bunch of really dangerous things are exaggerated when the state says you ’ re not valid or questions your existence , ” Reynolds says . “ This [ political ] strategy has significant consequences for individuals and their ability to function . ”
Though Gonzales hasn ’ t put much thought into puberty blockers and hormone therapy yet , she describes them as potentially “ lifesaving interventions ” for transgender kids . She says when the time comes , she won ’ t hesitate to start her own daughter on puberty blockers .
“ It ’ s insane that any legislator would suggest that they know better than me and our family medical professionals when it comes to my daughter ’ s health , ” Gonzales says . “ They ’ re writing a death sentence for our children if they pass a law that prevents them from receiving [ puberty ] blockers . ”","Rachel Gonzales has spent the last two years battling Texas lawmakers to protect her kid.

In November, a Republican representative in South Carolina introduced legislation that would prohibit “gender reassignment medical treatment” for people under the age of 18. Doctors who provide such care would be professionally sanctioned and could potentially lose their medical license. A bill that is being drafted in Georgia would make it a felony for medical professionals to aid in a minor’s gender transition. A lawmaker in Kentucky said in a public Facebook post that she is also at work on a similar bill.

“I really wish that our politicians would stop using young children for their political gain,” Gonzales says. “It’s so frightening to have the people that are supposed to be protecting all kids across the state to be instead picking and choosing who they want to protect and targeting the ones that they don’t.”

All of the bills were spurred by the sensationalized story of a Texas custody battle between two parents with vastly different views on gender identity. The case involved a 7-year-old kid who, according to reports, had been identifying as a transgender girl for years. Her father claimed the feminine gender identity was being forced on the child by her mother, and refused to help cover the costs of therapy or any gender-affirming care. Earlier this year, he made pleas at the state capitol and on several social media pages, claiming his child was being used as a pawn in some socially progressive scheme to revoke his parental rights.

The Daily Caller first picked up the story about the custody fight from a local news website run by a former Republican state senator. Then Fox News and conservative pundits like Matt Walsh joined in the fray. Some warned of “chemical castration,” even though the actual custody dispute revolved around social transitioning—affirming the person’s gender identity by using their chosen name and pronouns—which involves no medical interventions. They published video and photos of the child, supposedly proving their point. Soon, the story had been picked up by Donald Trump Jr.

Shortly after, Texas Rep. Matt Krause promised to introduce a bill in 2021, the next time the state legislature will be in session, to bar minors from using puberty blockers, a gender-affirming medical treatment that allows transgender kids to temporarily postpone puberty so they have more time to explore their gender identity. Another Texas Republican, Rep. Steve Toth, vowed to introduce legislation that would criminalize parents who allow their child to transition. In a tweet, Toth said the legislation would be the very first bill he filed next session. The misconstrued facts of the case were like a dog whistle, rallying troops for the anti-LGBTQ culture war, and soon lawmakers in and out of Texas started to get involved.

Having lost the battle to stop transgender people from using public bathrooms that conform to their gender identity, conservatives have doubled down on trying to control the private lives of trans people. This time, Republican strategists are putting transgender kids, and the people who support them, at the center of an effort to shore up conservative support. According to Andrew Reynolds, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, gender identity remains the most divisive identity issue—more so than race, ethnicity, sex, religion, disability status or even sexual orientation—for American voters, and conservatives in particular. In a recent study from the Public Religion Research Institute, nearly three-quarters of Republicans surveyed believe there are only two genders. Only one third said they would be “somewhat or very comfortable” with having their child come out as transgender. (A little more than half of Democrats said they believe gender exists in spectrum, and 60 percent said they would be comfortable having a trans child.)

And this anti-trans strategy isn’t limited to local politics. An advocacy group called the American Principles Project waded into Kentucky’s gubernatorial elections this year by running a series of inflammatory ads warning that the Democratic candidate would let boys play on girls’ sports teams. The New York Times described the effort as a pilot program to determine how to “use the debate over transgender rights to rally conservative voters in support of President Trump.”

Reynolds says if you look at it from a strictly strategic perspective, rights for transgender people are “the only one of the LGBTQ+ issues that still has some resonance” among voters. “It’s the only lever, I would say, that still can drive conservative, religious, white voters—fearful voters—to Republicans.”

This year, lawmakers in Illinois and New Hampshire tried to pass bills criminalizing parents and doctors who helped kids transition. South Dakota legislators proposed a bill that would allow parents to refuse transition-related health care for their kids. None of them passed.

Of the upcoming legislation, only the South Carolina bill text has been released so far, so the exact language in the others is unclear. But many of the announcements surrounding the proposals included hyperbolic talk of “castration,” “genital mutilation” and “radical surgery.” A pediatric endocrinologist quoted in the press release announcing the Georgia bill described medical transitioning for minors as “medical experimentation based on wishful social theory.”

Such criticism, says Cathryn Oakley, the state legislative director for Human Rights Campaign, stems from anti-LGBTQ backlash and fear mongering.

“There’s been this incredibly wonderful and impactful rise in visibility of transgender people in the public sphere,” Oakley said. “But at the same time, I think there are many folks who are not educated who have a lot of confusion, who have a lot of questions. Opponents of equality have seized on that gap between visibility and understanding, and they’re trying to exploit that.”

Dr. Izzy Lowell, an Atlanta-area doctor who primarily treats queer patients, says the transition process for young trans kids is often far less dramatic than opponents suggest. Lowell describes herself as conservative when it comes to prescribing hormones, and says for very young patients she tells their parents to “do nothing other than social transition.” She tells them to “affirm that child’s gender, as much as you can, but let them lead—never impose a gender on them.”

That’s more or less how things went for Gonzales’ family.

“There’s definitely this image put out there that your kid comes to you and says ‘hey, I’m a girl,’ and you’re like ‘fantastic! let’s go change your name at the courthouse,'” Gonzales says. The process looks different for every family, but “by the time we decided to embrace [my daughter’s] social transition, she had been telling us who she is for at least two years, probably longer.”

Gonzales’ daughter is now nine years old and still not at a point where she is considering gender-affirming medical treatment.

“We do nothing, medically, until they start puberty,” says Lowell, who has treated hundreds of queer kids (but not Gonzales’ daughter). Hormone blockers are only meant to delay puberty, “so that [kids] don’t develop characteristics of the wrong gender for them.” The process is entirely reversible, as are the first few months of hormone therapy for older kids. She starts kids on very low doses of hormones until they’re sure the treatment is making them feel better. “It doesn’t happen very often, almost never,” that a patient asks to stop hormone therapy.

Opponents of medical transition for minors often argue that there hasn’t been enough research into the long-term effects of puberty blockers and cross-hormone therapy on things like brain development and fertility. But Lowell, Oakley and Reynolds all point to the well-established consequences of vilifying trans kids as reasons familial acceptance and puberty blockers are important. Transgender youth have a significantly higher suicide rate than their cisgender peers, and research has suggested that family acceptance and gender affirmation can go a long way toward reducing the risk of suicide attempts.

“A whole bunch of really dangerous things are exaggerated when the state says you’re not valid or questions your existence,” Reynolds says. “This [political] strategy has significant consequences for individuals and their ability to function.”

Though Gonzales hasn’t put much thought into puberty blockers and hormone therapy yet, she describes them as potentially “lifesaving interventions” for transgender kids. She says when the time comes, she won’t hesitate to start her own daughter on puberty blockers.

“It’s insane that any legislator would suggest that they know better than me and our family medical professionals when it comes to my daughter’s health,” Gonzales says. “They’re writing a death sentence for our children if they pass a law that prevents them from receiving [puberty] blockers.”",www.motherjones.com,left,qG8cOtz58ytRm5jj

A mid-March Washington Post/ABC News poll underscored the extent to which the GOP is at odds with the public on gay marriage: Fifty-eight percent of respondents said they support gay marriage, and 64 percent said that the issue of gay marriage should be “decided for all states on the basis of the U.S. Constitution.”

But the Republican Party and its evangelical core have not moved with the rest of the country, tying the GOP — for now — to a position that’s anathema to the majority of younger, more educated and politically independent voters; precisely the voters the party needs to begin clearing out the wreckage of two consecutive presidential defeats.

The only obvious way to square that political circle in the short term is through a sweeping Supreme Court decision — one that strikes down the Defense of Marriage Act and invalidates California’s Proposition 8 law banning same-sex marriage.

That would be a crushing defeat for voters and politicians, predominantly on the right, who believe marriage is exclusively between one man and one woman. But to Republican consultants, fearful of ending up on the wrong side of political history, such a ruling would be a liberation.

“It removes the issue from the Democratic playbook of fundraising scare tactics and political demagoguery and breaks their usual messaging dynamic of, ‘You’re a beleaguered minority; let us protect you from the evil GOP — oh, and here’s your absentee ballot,’” said Florida-based Republican consultant Rick Wilson.

Stanley: Chick-fil-A protest support could preview voter turnout if Romney plays it right

Wednesday marked Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day . Across the United States, conservatives gathered in chicken restaurants to show support for the company after its president, Dan Cathy, came out against gay marriage. Democratic mayors in Chicago and Boston at first threatened to halt expansion of the Chick-fil-A chain to their cities, which turned a question of sexual morality into a debate about freedom of speech. The motto of conservative Christians seems to be, ""They'll take my chicken from my cold dead hand...""

Writing as a European, this story combines two of the things we most readily associate with America: Jesus Christ and fast food. It certainly reflects a uniquely American phenomenon. There are religious businesspeople and raging conservatives in other parts of the world, but only the United States enjoys all the elements that could turn a statement of conscience into nationwide movement.

Where else in the world would a) the president of a chicken restaurant chain feel it was within his remit to publicly endorse ""the traditional family,"" b) liberal mayors totally overreact by trying to stop his business' expansion, c) a former presidential candidate declare an ""appreciation day"" for the restaurant, and d) hundreds of people actually show up to eat there in solidarity?

But no, something more complex is taking place: Economics and culture are becoming synonymous.

In rallying to Cathy's defense, some conservatives have pointed out that his company has created jobs and that attempts to block its growth are bad for middle-class Americans. They made the same case against Michael Bloomberg's war on supersized drinks . There's a theme to the complaints emerging: that in their pursuit of liberal ends the Democrats are costing jobs, while patriotic conservatives like Cathy are repairing the economy and spreading the gospel.

Mitt Romney is now running billboard ads that lampoon Obama's claim that businesses need government support to flourish. The implicit choice that the right is trying to establish is ""hardworking, self-reliant Christian businessmen"" vs ""welfare-supporting, anti-growth, atheistic bureaucrats."" Hence, debates that can seem only to be about culture can actually become a way of discussing who is to blame for our economic woes.

Second, the sheer number of people involved in the Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day suggests that turnout will matter in November. A common theme among tweets coming out of the restaurant demonstrations Wednesday was that conservative strength lies in numbers. One photo caption read, ""Hey liberals, the turnout for Chick-fil-A appreciation day is a preview of the polling stations in November."" Maybe, maybe not. But the polls are close and the number of undecided voters is falling.

America is settling down into two, surprisingly partisan, camps of voters who probably won't change their minds significantly until voting day. If that pattern holds, then turnout is all important. In 2004, the ability of the Bush team to get out their religious vote swung them a relatively close election.

During a forum on LGBTQ issues hosted by GLAAD , the Advocate , and the Cedar Rapids Gazette , 10 Democratic candidates discussed their records on issues affecting the LGBTQ community , including the Trump administration ’ s transgender military ban , conversion therapy , protections for gender-nonconforming people , and court cases involving businesses that decline to cater to queer customers on religious grounds in front of about 700 people in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , on Friday .
During his session , Biden spoke with Lyz Lenz , a columnist for the Cedar Rapids Gazette , and worked to remind voters of his allyship , telling the room he believed in in LGTBQ rights from a young age . And he defended his record on same-sex marriage , reminding the room that he publicly supported it before President Barack Obama did .
“ I didn ’ t have to evolve , ” he said , a reference to Obama ’ s famous comments explaining his shift while in office from supporting civil unions to supporting full marriage rights for same-sex couples .
But Biden ’ s many years of public service have given him a long voting history that left the candidate open to sharp critique . Lenz pressed Biden about his extensive record on issues that affect the LGBTQ community , including his votes as a US senator for legislation like the Defense of Marriage Act , which defined marriage as existing between one man and one woman , and a spending bill that included “ don ’ t ask , don ’ t tell , ” the military policy that banned openly gay people from serving in the military .
At times , Biden seemed to struggle with his answers . The then-senator helped champion the 1994 crime bill that critics link to today ’ s cycle mass incarceration , and Lenz asked him about that bill ’ s specific impact on LGBTQ people of color . In response , Biden tried to argue that inmates should be imprisoned based on their gender identity , rather than on the sex they were assigned at birth — a stance in line with what advocates have called for — but appeared to conflate sexuality and gender identity .
“ In prison , the determination should be that your sexual identity is defined by what you say it is , not what in fact the prison says it is , ” Biden said .
Lenz also referred to Biden ’ s comments in February in which he referred to Vice President Mike Pence , a vocal opponent of many LGBTQ rights , as a “ decent guy. ” ( Biden walked back those comments on Twitter shortly afterwards , saying there is “ nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights . ” )
At the forum , Biden said that this was how one must speak when attempting to reach across the aisle “ when you want to get things done. ” When Lenz pushed back , saying Pence has not been decent to queer people , Biden responded , “ You ’ re a lovely person . ”
An attention grabbing moment from Biden ’ s time on stage when moderator ⁦ @ lyzl⁩ pushed Biden on past votes and calling ⁦ @ VP⁩ a “ decent guy . ”
“ You ’ re a lovely person , ” Biden tells the moderator to laugher .
“ Just asking the questions people want to know , ” she replied pic.twitter.com/DB10NGuBCP — Molly Nagle ( @ MollyNagle3 ) September 21 , 2019
Lenz wrote on Twitter afterwards that Biden also called her “ a real sweetheart ” backstage . She later called these interactions “ a little condescending , ” and told the USA Today , “ It ’ s 2019 , you shouldn ’ t be calling women sweethearts . ”
Lenz ’ s frustrations with Biden ’ s language mirror those of some others he has interacted with on the campaign trail . In June , student activist K.C . Cayo asked Biden about his stance about the Violence Against Women Act , and said the way he leaned in to answer and his tone changed how they saw Biden .
“ I can now make the connection between the man I saw and the man accused of harassment by multiple women , ” Cayo added . “ I saw a man capable of those things : A man who can ’ t take responsibility , who doesn ’ t respect women , and who gets in their personal space . ”
Biden has responded to past complaints by promising to change his behavior . And while Lenz ’ s concerns do not go as far as Cayo ’ s , they show he has not completely altered his approach . While that may not be a problem with his base , it could be a problem with voters he hopes to win over like members of the audience at Friday ’ s forum that Reuters spoke with , who were less than impressed with the candidate ’ s answers and behavior .
“ I think that he thinks he doesn ’ t need to [ change ] , but he does , ” college student Emmett Cory told Reuters . “ He can ’ t just ride [ his record ] without having to get with the times . ”
Criticism over Biden ’ s language has done little to damage his frontrunner status
Even while serving as a well-liked vice president in an administration that enjoyed pretty decent approval ratings , Biden was known for sticking his foot in his mouth . These gaffes were often treated with fondness , earning him the moniker “ Uncle Joe ” and inspiring a thousand memes .
But some of those so-called gaffes revealed more serious blind spots , especially on issues of race . When running for president in 2008 , Biden famously referred to Obama as “ articulate and bright and clean ” — implying that this was unusual for a black politician . In 2012 , when supporting the now-President Obama ’ s reelection bid , he told an audience of black voters that the Republican Party would “ put y ’ all back in chains. ” In August of this year , Biden made a similar misstep , when he put “ poor kids ” in opposition to “ white kids , ” implying an inherent link between whiteness and wealth ( and between poverty and children of color ) .
These gaffes are increasingly being seen through the lenses of his age ( he is nearly 80 ) and his record , leaving some voters concerned as to whether there ’ s any willingness on Biden ’ s part to evolve on issues of race , identity , and class , as ███ ’ s Tara Golshan and Ella Nilsen have written :
Frequent news about Biden ’ s gaffes has fueled these fears among voters in the key early states of Iowa and New Hampshire , especially as voters consider a potential general election matchup between the former vice president and Trump , who has already bestowed Biden with the nickname “ Sleepy Joe. ” Others concerned with Biden ’ s age said it had less to do with gaffes than with the perception that Biden is out of touch with the current Democratic Party because he is staunchly moderate and has some controversial past votes on racial issues . ( Of course , it ’ s worth noting that close to 40 percent of Democrats identify as moderates . ) “ Initially I really liked him but his actions and his voting history tainted [ that ] , ” said Kacey Marsh of Whitefield , New Hampshire , who is supporting the 77-year-old Sanders . Marsh said she didn ’ t think age mattered too much , adding , “ Age is a number ; it ’ s relative . ”
Beyond his record and comments on race , Biden ’ s relationship to women has also been , increasingly , a cause for concern among some . Another permutation of the “ Uncle Joe ” nickname is “ Creepy Uncle Joe , ” and that version has been applied with respect to the candidate ’ s interactions with women .
While many used the nickname as a joke in past decades , it took on a more sinister tone when earlier this year , when a series of women said that Biden had , at different times , touched them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable . These interactions included allegations of Biden invading their personal space , smelling their hair , as well as unwanted touching and kissing .
Separately , critics have called out Biden for comments he ’ s made while campaigning that they argue are sexist , including his comments about the appearances of women and girls , like when he called a 10-year-old girl “ good-looking , ” or when told the brothers of a 13-year-old girl to “ keep the guys away from your sister. ” The response to Lenz , the moderator at Friday ’ s event , which she deemed patronizing , is of a kind with these criticisms .
As ███ ’ s Anna North has written , Biden ’ s comments in these situations are a reflection of his old-school , pre- # MeToo training — and it often seems that he does not feel much need to change that behavior . “ He ’ s long cast himself as an old-school candidate who can bring Democrats back to an earlier era , ” she writes . “ Given that , his refusal to alter the way he interacts with women and girls may be part of his brand . Biden is a candidate from a time before # MeToo entered its most public phase , and for some voters , that might be a selling point — to change himself would be to leave them behind . ”
While his gaffes and criticisms over some of his interactions with women haven ’ t yet caused Biden significant damage in the polls — he is still the frontrunner , outpacing the other leading candidates Sens . Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders — his entire campaign is based not on specific policies but on the very likelihood of his victory . Repeated missteps and misstatements on serious issues that voters care about could erode the promise of his easy electability , as Golshan and Nilsen have written :
Unlike Warren ( the plans candidate ) and Sanders ( the political revolution candidate ) , the biggest part of Biden ’ s pitch to voters is that he has the best shot of unseating Trump in a general election and returning America to the normalcy it enjoyed in the pre-Trump era that Biden , as Obama ’ s vice president , embodies . This political message may be all the more salient considering Sanders and Warren are Biden ’ s biggest competition right now , and both are seen as considerably more progressive than him . But Biden ’ s electability message also has an inherent weakness : If voters start thinking he ’ s not as electable as he says he is , his pitch sounds hollow . “ The moment he ’ s shown not to be electable , since they have no other reason to be attached to Joe Biden , it ’ s easy to move these voters to someone else , at least temporarily , ” [ Monmouth University polling director Patrick Murray ] told ███ .
For now , however , his base is likely to continue supporting the man that they see as electable , likeable , and who often evokes the good-old-days of the pre-Trump Obama administration . He is , in many ways , a throw-back politician , a lifelong public servant whose work has spanned generations . His critics would argue that is precisely Biden ’ s problem , and that persona will keep him from winning over voters who are not yet onboard with his candidacy .
And in a crowded field that has seen support for certain rivals — most noticeably Elizabeth Warren — rising , Biden will need to ensure he wins a broad base of support that includes voters who take seriously how candidates position themselves on issues of race , class , gender and sexual identity , and more . According to the Human Rights Campaign , 23 percent of voters in the first four Democratic primary and caucus states ( Iowa , New Hampshire , Nevada , South Carolina ) take LGBTQ issues into account when voting .
Biden has said that he recognizes how social norms have changed , and that he is ready to change with them . But Friday ’ s forum performance suggests that he still may have some work to do .","Former Vice President Joe Biden, the leading Democratic presidential contender, defended his record on LGBTQ issues at a forum on Friday, but in doing so, once again raised questions about his comportment towards women, and — after a misstatement in which he conflated sexual and gender identities — about his understanding of issues that affect queer and gender nonconforming voters.

During a forum on LGBTQ issues hosted by GLAAD, the Advocate, and the Cedar Rapids Gazette, 10 Democratic candidates discussed their records on issues affecting the LGBTQ community, including the Trump administration’s transgender military ban, conversion therapy, protections for gender-nonconforming people, and court cases involving businesses that decline to cater to queer customers on religious grounds in front of about 700 people in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Friday.

During his session, Biden spoke with Lyz Lenz, a columnist for the Cedar Rapids Gazette, and worked to remind voters of his allyship, telling the room he believed in in LGTBQ rights from a young age. And he defended his record on same-sex marriage, reminding the room that he publicly supported it before President Barack Obama did.

“I didn’t have to evolve,” he said, a reference to Obama’s famous comments explaining his shift while in office from supporting civil unions to supporting full marriage rights for same-sex couples.

But Biden’s many years of public service have given him a long voting history that left the candidate open to sharp critique. Lenz pressed Biden about his extensive record on issues that affect the LGBTQ community, including his votes as a US senator for legislation like the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as existing between one man and one woman, and a spending bill that included “don’t ask, don’t tell,” the military policy that banned openly gay people from serving in the military.

At times, Biden seemed to struggle with his answers. The then-senator helped champion the 1994 crime bill that critics link to today’s cycle mass incarceration, and Lenz asked him about that bill’s specific impact on LGBTQ people of color. In response, Biden tried to argue that inmates should be imprisoned based on their gender identity, rather than on the sex they were assigned at birth — a stance in line with what advocates have called for — but appeared to conflate sexuality and gender identity.

“In prison, the determination should be that your sexual identity is defined by what you say it is, not what in fact the prison says it is,” Biden said.

Lenz also referred to Biden’s comments in February in which he referred to Vice President Mike Pence, a vocal opponent of many LGBTQ rights, as a “decent guy.” (Biden walked back those comments on Twitter shortly afterwards, saying there is “nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights.”)

At the forum, Biden said that this was how one must speak when attempting to reach across the aisle “when you want to get things done.” When Lenz pushed back, saying Pence has not been decent to queer people, Biden responded, “You’re a lovely person.”

An attention grabbing moment from Biden’s time on stage when moderator ⁦@lyzl⁩ pushed Biden on past votes and calling ⁦@VP⁩ a “decent guy.”



“You’re a lovely person,” Biden tells the moderator to laugher.



“Just asking the questions people want to know,” she replied pic.twitter.com/DB10NGuBCP — Molly Nagle (@MollyNagle3) September 21, 2019

Lenz wrote on Twitter afterwards that Biden also called her “a real sweetheart” backstage. She later called these interactions “a little condescending,” and told the USA Today, “It’s 2019, you shouldn’t be calling women sweethearts.”

Lenz’s frustrations with Biden’s language mirror those of some others he has interacted with on the campaign trail. In June, student activist K.C. Cayo asked Biden about his stance about the Violence Against Women Act, and said the way he leaned in to answer and his tone changed how they saw Biden.

“I can now make the connection between the man I saw and the man accused of harassment by multiple women,” Cayo added. “I saw a man capable of those things: A man who can’t take responsibility, who doesn’t respect women, and who gets in their personal space.”

Biden has responded to past complaints by promising to change his behavior. And while Lenz’s concerns do not go as far as Cayo’s, they show he has not completely altered his approach. While that may not be a problem with his base, it could be a problem with voters he hopes to win over like members of the audience at Friday’s forum that Reuters spoke with, who were less than impressed with the candidate’s answers and behavior.

“I think that he thinks he doesn’t need to [change], but he does,” college student Emmett Cory told Reuters. “He can’t just ride [his record] without having to get with the times.”

Criticism over Biden’s language has done little to damage his frontrunner status

Even while serving as a well-liked vice president in an administration that enjoyed pretty decent approval ratings, Biden was known for sticking his foot in his mouth. These gaffes were often treated with fondness, earning him the moniker “Uncle Joe” and inspiring a thousand memes.

But some of those so-called gaffes revealed more serious blind spots, especially on issues of race. When running for president in 2008, Biden famously referred to Obama as “articulate and bright and clean” — implying that this was unusual for a black politician. In 2012, when supporting the now-President Obama’s reelection bid, he told an audience of black voters that the Republican Party would “put y’all back in chains.” In August of this year, Biden made a similar misstep, when he put “poor kids” in opposition to “white kids,” implying an inherent link between whiteness and wealth (and between poverty and children of color).

These gaffes are increasingly being seen through the lenses of his age (he is nearly 80) and his record, leaving some voters concerned as to whether there’s any willingness on Biden’s part to evolve on issues of race, identity, and class, as Vox’s Tara Golshan and Ella Nilsen have written:

The Cuban government has cancelled the country's 12th annual march against homophobia.

In a Facebook post, the state-run National Centre for Sex Education (CENESEX) blamed ""new tensions in the international and regional context"" for the cancellation.

Activists have condemned the move and questioned the government's motives.

Cuba was set to approve same-sex marriage under a new constitution, but removed the clause after protests.

President Miguel Díaz-Canel publicly backed the change in September, saying it was ""part of eliminating any type of discrimination in society"".

But the government backtracked after an outcry from religious groups.

Cuba holds events at this time every year to mark the International Day Against Homophobia on 17 May.

Why has the march been cancelled?

CENESEX posted on Facebook that it was officially cancelling the Cuban Conga against Homophobia and Transphobia ""in compliance with the policy of the Party, the State and the Revolution"".

The group is led by Mariela Castro, daughter of the Communist Party of Cuba's leader Raúl Castro.

No specific reasons were given for the change, with the post blaming ""certain circumstances that do not help [the march's] successful development"".

However, only the conga itself is cancelled, with other events going ahead as planned to mark LGBT rights.

What have activists said?

“ Unconscionable , ” “ shameless , ” and “ dangerous ” were just a few of the reactions from lawmakers and civil rights advocates over the religious-exemption rule that seemed , in particular , to target LGBTQ employees . Patricia Shiu , who oversaw the federal contracting office under President Barack Obama , described it to ███ as shocking .
The proposed rule from the Department of Labor dramatically transforms the government ’ s decades-old policy that bars federal contractors from discriminating against employees based on their race , sex , religion , disability , or national origin . It would instead weaken these protections by expanding the policy ’ s one exemption : the religious exemption .
Religious organizations — such as a Catholic legal aid group , for example — are already allowed to reject certain job candidates of different faiths . The new rule would go far , far beyond that , letting Catholic-affiliated businesses fire an LGBTQ employee because their views on same-sex marriage conflict with Catholic teachings . Or fire a pregnant woman who is unmarried .
The new rule would gut anti-discrimination protections in a “ major and transformational way , ” Shiu , who is now an advisor for the Berkeley Center on Comparative Equality & Anti-Discrimination Law , told ███ . “ It ’ s so startling . ”
While the rule seems to target LGBTQ individuals , as most religious exemption policies do , it ’ s so broad that it creates a loophole for employers to discriminate against anyone , Shiu said . She points out that big contractors could ask for a religious exemption so they don ’ t have to hire women , by saying that their religion dictates that women can not work outside the home .
The Labor Department has played down this possibility , saying in its proposal that employers can ’ t use religion as an excuse to discriminate against protected groups . Right now , LGBTQ workers aren ’ t explicitly protected by federal anti-discrimination law , but even if they were , it would be awfully hard for an employee to prove that a company is using the exemption as a cover to discriminate .
The proposed change is , above all , a political move . By targeting the LGBTQ community , President Donald Trump is showing his support for the fundamentalist evangelical Christians who make up his base of support . These groups , which oppose same-sex marriage , have been fighting for years to weaken protections for LGBTQ Americans .
More than 42,000 US businesses hold federal contracts , and all of them agree to follow certain rules to keep their lucrative deals with the government . In 1965 , President Lyndon Johnson signed Executive Order 11246 , which prohibited contractors from discriminating against people on the basis of race — similar to protections Congress gave to individuals as part of the Civil Rights Act . At the time , many federal contractors would not hire black employees , so the goal was to make sure that taxpayer-funded contracts only go to businesses with integrated workforces .
Later on , the executive order would expand protections to employees based on other protected characteristics , such as a person ’ s sex , religion , national origin , or disability . In 2014 , Obama ’ s labor department expanded it further to include sexual orientation and gender identity . The religious exemption was meant to be super narrow . Past administrations have interpreted it to apply only to nonprofit organizations , such as churches or social service groups , and these groups could only turn away employees who don ’ t belong to their faith .
Trump ’ s executive order interprets that exemption far more broadly to include a much larger group of employers , such as for-profit companies that have a religious affiliation ( St. Jude ’ s Hospital , Goodwill , and Georgetown University , for example ) .
The new rule also explicitly creates a broader definition of the word “ religion. ” Instead of viewing religion as a particular organized religion , the government would now include “ all aspects of religious belief , observance , and practice as understood by the employer. ” That language is very vague .
But here is the most concerning line in the 46-page document : The rule would “ clarify that the religious exemption allows religious contractors not only to prefer in employment individuals who share their religion , but also to condition employment on acceptance of or adherence to religious tenets as understood by the employing contractor . ”
In other words , not only could a religious hospital that contracts with the government refuse to hire someone who is Muslim or Jewish , they could also refuse to hire someone in a same-sex marriage or fire someone who had sex before marriage .
Some religious groups have been trying to weaken anti-discrimination laws at every level .
The US Pastors Council and Texas Values , two nonprofit evangelical groups , filed multiple lawsuits in county and federal court in October , claiming that Christian businesses and churches have a constitutional right to fire — or not hire — LGBTQ workers .
One lawsuit challenged the federal Civil Rights Act , which makes it illegal for employers to discriminate against job candidates and workers based on their religion , sex , gender , or race . Two other lawsuits sought to strike down part of an Austin , Texas , city ordinance that prohibits employers from discriminating against similar groups , and explicitly includes protections based on “ sexual orientation ” and “ gender identity . ”
In one of the lawsuits against the city of Austin , lawyers for Texas Values said the organization will not comply with the law . “ Texas Values will not hire or retain practicing homosexuals or transgendered people as employees , because their lifestyles are contrary to the biblical , Judeo–Christian understandings of sexuality and gender that Texas Values seeks to promote , ” they wrote in the complaint .
The federal lawsuit was dismissed in March ; the county case is still pending .
The lawsuits marked a new front in the evangelical battle against the LGBTQ civil rights movement . Both right-wing Texas groups were also outspoken in the fight against the spread of so-called “ bathroom bills , ” which allow transgender individuals to use public restrooms designated for their identified gender .
In one of the Texas cases , the US Pastors Council argued Christian employers are allowed to discriminate against LGBTQ workers based on protections in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act .
The federal law , enacted in 1993 , sets a high standard for government legislators when writing laws that might burden a person ’ s right to exercise their religion . The act states that such a law must further a “ compelling government interest ” and must be tailored to minimize the burden on individual religious practices .
The law has generally been used to analyze other laws that might infringe on an individual ’ s religious freedom . But in a controversial 2014 ruling , the US Supreme Court extended the protection to Christian-owned corporations . In that case , Burwell v. Hobby Lobby , the arts and crafts store chain challenged the Affordable Care Act ’ s contraceptive mandate , which required businesses to offer health insurance plans that covered the cost of birth control .
David Green , the evangelical owner of Hobby Lobby , objected to the mandate on the grounds that he was religiously opposed to paying for employees ’ use of a form of contraception known as the “ morning-after pill. ” He considered this type of contraception similar to abortion .
The Supreme Court narrowly ruled in his favor , in a 5-4 decision . Justice Samuel Alito , in writing the majority opinion , said that the federal government had a compelling goal in crafting Obamacare ’ s contraceptive mandate : giving women free access to family planning services . But Alito argued that the government could achieve that goal without infringing on a business owner ’ s religious views . The government , for example , could pay for the contraception , or provide an exemption to businesses whose owners object to contraception on religious grounds .
The ruling was the first time the Supreme Court had extended the act ’ s individual religious freedom protection to a for-profit company .
That ’ s why the case raised so much alarm among LGBTQ advocates , who viewed it as potentially opening the door for businesses to discriminate against gay and transgender employees on the grounds that an employer is exercising religious beliefs .
However , in response to these concerns , Alito made clear that the court ’ s decision did not mean businesses could do such a thing . “ This decision concerns only the contraceptive mandate and should not be understood to … provide a shield for employers who might cloak illegal discrimination as a religious practice , ” Alito wrote in the majority opinion .
That same view was reiterated in the court ’ s 2018 ruling in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission , in which a Colorado cake shop owner refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple , based on the owner ’ s religious objection to same-sex marriage .
Though the court ruled in favor of the business owner , the majority said it did so because the Colorado government showed clear anti-religious bias when handling the case . Justice Anthony Kennedy , who wrote the majority opinion , made clear that religious beliefs do not justify discrimination against LGBTQ individuals .
Our society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples can not be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth . For that reason the laws and the Constitution can , and in some instances must , protect them in the exercise of their civil rights . The exercise of their freedom on terms equal to others must be given great weight and respect by the courts .
The problem with these rulings and with the latest labor department rule is that it will be almost impossible for marginalized workers to prove illegal discrimination : Employers could simply justify their actions by pointing to their religious beliefs .
Shiu , who led the federal contracting office from 2009 to 2016 , said the new rule is completely unnecessary . She said no federal contractors ever asked for a religious exemption to justify firing someone ( or to refuse hiring someone ) when she was the director .
“ It ’ s a terrible solution in search of a problem , ” she told ███ .","The Trump administration caused an uproar Wednesday for proposing a policy that would give certain federal contractors the right to discriminate against people who don’t share their employer’s religious views.

In one of the Texas cases, the US Pastors Council argued Christian employers are allowed to discriminate against LGBTQ workers based on protections in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

The federal law, enacted in 1993, sets a high standard for government legislators when writing laws that might burden a person’s right to exercise their religion. The act states that such a law must further a “compelling government interest” and must be tailored to minimize the burden on individual religious practices.

The law has generally been used to analyze other laws that might infringe on an individual’s religious freedom. But in a controversial 2014 ruling, the US Supreme Court extended the protection to Christian-owned corporations. In that case, Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, the arts and crafts store chain challenged the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate, which required businesses to offer health insurance plans that covered the cost of birth control.

David Green, the evangelical owner of Hobby Lobby, objected to the mandate on the grounds that he was religiously opposed to paying for employees’ use of a form of contraception known as the “morning-after pill.” He considered this type of contraception similar to abortion.

The Supreme Court narrowly ruled in his favor, in a 5-4 decision. Justice Samuel Alito, in writing the majority opinion, said that the federal government had a compelling goal in crafting Obamacare’s contraceptive mandate: giving women free access to family planning services. But Alito argued that the government could achieve that goal without infringing on a business owner’s religious views. The government, for example, could pay for the contraception, or provide an exemption to businesses whose owners object to contraception on religious grounds.

The ruling was the first time the Supreme Court had extended the act’s individual religious freedom protection to a for-profit company.

That’s why the case raised so much alarm among LGBTQ advocates, who viewed it as potentially opening the door for businesses to discriminate against gay and transgender employees on the grounds that an employer is exercising religious beliefs.

However, in response to these concerns, Alito made clear that the court’s decision did not mean businesses could do such a thing. “This decision concerns only the contraceptive mandate and should not be understood to … provide a shield for employers who might cloak illegal discrimination as a religious practice,” Alito wrote in the majority opinion.

That same view was reiterated in the court’s 2018 ruling in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, in which a Colorado cake shop owner refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, based on the owner’s religious objection to same-sex marriage.

Though the court ruled in favor of the business owner, the majority said it did so because the Colorado government showed clear anti-religious bias when handling the case. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion, made clear that religious beliefs do not justify discrimination against LGBTQ individuals.

Our society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth. For that reason the laws and the Constitution can, and in some instances must, protect them in the exercise of their civil rights. The exercise of their freedom on terms equal to others must be given great weight and respect by the courts.

The problem with these rulings and with the latest labor department rule is that it will be almost impossible for marginalized workers to prove illegal discrimination: Employers could simply justify their actions by pointing to their religious beliefs.

Shiu, who led the federal contracting office from 2009 to 2016, said the new rule is completely unnecessary. She said no federal contractors ever asked for a religious exemption to justify firing someone (or to refuse hiring someone) when she was the director.

Under the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) passed in 1996 , marriage is defined for federal purposes as between one man and one woman . That means the estimated 120,000 gay and lesbian couples legally married in nine states and the District of Columbia are still considered -- in the eyes of DOMA opponents -- the equivalent of girlfriend and boyfriend .
`` As a federal employee and as an airman , you get a constant reminder that you 're second class , '' Jamelle told CNN . `` I had to list Karane as my sister just so that someone would call her in the event that I 'm killed or missing in action , or I 'm hurt on the job .

Adding to the confusion is Karane 's status as a D.C. government employee . She enjoys the benefits of her relationship with Jamelle because her local government in the nation 's capital recognizes same-sex marriage .
`` But once we step outside of D.C. , it 's a whole other ballgame , '' said Karane . In neighboring Virginia , which does not recognize their marriage , the couple says they are viewed as `` legal strangers . ''
The larger debate over DOMA 's intent and impact 17 years after passage has driven a wedge between the executive and legislative branches .
At issue is what role the federal government should play when it comes to marriage -- something states have traditionally controlled .
`` What the court is being asked to decide is whether or not Congress can pass a law that treats same-sex couples , who are already married under the laws of their state , different from opposite-sex couples , '' said Amy Howe , a leading appellate attorney and editor of SCOTUSblog.com
Four federal district courts and two appeals courts have already struck down the law 's restrictive benefits provision . And in a rare move , the Obama administration also abandoned its defense of congressional authority , saying DOMA is unconstitutional .
That has left House Republicans in the unconventional position of stepping in to argue it should stay in place , at least for now .
Traditionally , the role of defending federal law would fall to the U.S. solicitor general 's office . But President Barack Obama , in an election-year stunner , said last May he now supported same-sex marriage . The president had already ordered Attorney General Eric Holder not to defend DOMA .
That raised the question of whether any party could rightfully step in and defend the law .
Besides the constitutional issue , the justices had specifically ordered opposing sides to argue a supplemental question : whether congressional Republicans -- operating officially as the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives -- have `` standing '' or legal authority to make the case .
`` Let 's not confuse the issue of DOMA and the administration 's decision that it was unconstitutional , '' House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , told CNN . `` It is not their role to decide what 's constitutional .

''
And many conservatives argue the courts should stay out of the larger constitutional issues and let citizens and the legislatures hash it out . Some activists worry nine unelected justices will issue a sweeping 50-state mandate and redefine marriage as whatever personal bond they now think it is .
Carrie Severino , chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network , says nothing in the Constitution tells states whether and how they should `` evolve '' on such an established institution . She said liberty is fundamental right , but that government also has broad discretion to affirm the idea marriage is mainly about ensuring biological children are raised in a stable two-parent family with a mother and father .
Same-sex marriage in the 21st century `` is clearly not what anyone understood as marriage at the time of the framing of the Constitution , '' she told CNN , saying that should be enough to keep the high court out of the current case .
Jamelle and Karane said they hit it off immediately after they met by chance at a downtown club 's Ladies Night , and felt like they had known each other forever . They were together four years before marrying last October .
Karane said she went to Jamelle 's mother first to ask her daughter 's hand in wedlock . Sitting in their comfortable Washington home , they appear blissfully happy being together , but DOMA has put unexpected strains on the marriage because of `` little frustrations . '' For one thing , they worry what could happen when Jamelle gets sent overseas in a war zone .
`` Technically , I am a single person deploying , '' she said . `` So I do n't have any protection for my family . I could deploy tomorrow and there would be nothing in place to help my family . It would be just me . So that 's definitely scary . Financially , making sure that the responsibility that we have to each other and to our families is taken care of , and it would be like I 'm leaving Karane in a lurch . ''
Karane added : `` It 's like we have to still go above and beyond just to get to where heterosexual couples already are . ''
They believe they are burdened by a triple social stigma -- as women , black and lesbians .
The couple hopes to have children someday , but that would create further layers of what they say are discriminatory rules . For now this self-described `` boring couple '' say they look forward to the day their children would be born and raised in a post-DOMA world .
But regardless how the Supreme Court rules , they say they will persevere .
`` I should be able to walk with my wife hand in hand and live our life . We should n't have to sit here on the edge of our seats , waiting for a decision , '' said Karane . `` Are we going to finally be able to just be recognized without any strings attached ? ... We 're humans , we live in a strange society , and we have to work with what we 've got . ''","Story highlights Court to rule on Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)

What is federal government's role in defining marriage?

The larger debate over DOMA's intent and impact 17 years after passage has driven a wedge between the executive and legislative branches.

At issue is what role the federal government should play when it comes to marriage -- something states have traditionally controlled.

Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network, says nothing in the Constitution tells states whether and how they should ""evolve"" on such an established institution. She said liberty is fundamental right, but that government also has broad discretion to affirm the idea marriage is mainly about ensuring biological children are raised in a stable two-parent family with a mother and father.

Same-sex marriage in the 21st century ""is clearly not what anyone understood as marriage at the time of the framing of the Constitution,"" she told CNN, saying that should be enough to keep the high court out of the current case.

Lack of protections, benefits if partner deploys

Jamelle and Karane said they hit it off immediately after they met by chance at a downtown club's Ladies Night, and felt like they had known each other forever. They were together four years before marrying last October.

Karane said she went to Jamelle's mother first to ask her daughter's hand in wedlock. Sitting in their comfortable Washington home, they appear blissfully happy being together, but DOMA has put unexpected strains on the marriage because of ""little frustrations."" For one thing, they worry what could happen when Jamelle gets sent overseas in a war zone.

""Technically, I am a single person deploying,"" she said. ""So I don't have any protection for my family. I could deploy tomorrow and there would be nothing in place to help my family. It would be just me. So that's definitely scary. Financially, making sure that the responsibility that we have to each other and to our families is taken care of, and it would be like I'm leaving Karane in a lurch.""

Karane added: ""It's like we have to still go above and beyond just to get to where heterosexual couples already are.""

They believe they are burdened by a triple social stigma -- as women, black and lesbians.

The couple hopes to have children someday, but that would create further layers of what they say are discriminatory rules. For now this self-described ""boring couple"" say they look forward to the day their children would be born and raised in a post-DOMA world.

But regardless how the Supreme Court rules, they say they will persevere.

""I should be able to walk with my wife hand in hand and live our life. We shouldn't have to sit here on the edge of our seats, waiting for a decision,"" said Karane. ""Are we going to finally be able to just be recognized without any strings attached?... We're humans, we live in a strange society, and we have to work with what we've got.""",www.cnn.com,left,urnrfmYW7A6vRG4d

As Democrats champion anti-discrimination protections for the LGBTQ community and Republicans counter with worries about safeguarding religious freedom , one congressional Republican is offering a proposal on Friday that aims to achieve both goals .
The bill that Utah GOP Rep. Chris Stewart plans to unveil would shield LGBTQ individuals from discrimination in employment , housing , education , and other public services — while also carving out exemptions for religious organizations to act based on beliefs that may exclude those of different sexual orientations or gender identities . Stewart ’ s bill counts support from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Seventh-day Adventist Church , but it has yet to win a backer among House Democrats who unanimously supported a more expansive LGBTQ rights measure in May .
But the uphill climb for his plan doesn ’ t daunt Stewart , who sees the bill as a way to “ bridge that gap ” between preventing discrimination and allowing religion to inform individual decisions .
“ I don ’ t know many people who wake up and say ‘ I want to discriminate ’ . Most people find that offensive , ” Stewart told The ███ . “ There are people who , and I ’ m included among them , have religious convictions that put them in a bind about how to reconcile those two principles . ”
The Utah lawmaker ’ s legislation comes as the Supreme Court prepares to rule on cases that touch squarely on the issue of employment discrimination against LGBTQ people , who currently do not receive specific protection in federal civil rights laws . While 21 states have laws that bar employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity , Democrats in Congress and running for president are pushing for a federal statute that would provide broader protections .
But that more sweeping bill ’ s chances of passage are low unless Democrats take back full control of Congress as well as the White House , given President Donald Trump ’ s opposition and Republican critics who warn of a risk to religious freedom . That prospect has informed Stewart and outside groups ’ work on a proposal to enshrine rights for the LGBTQ community while also preserving the right for religious groups to act in accordance with their faiths .
Among other faith-based exemptions to anti-discrimination protections in the bill is an allowance for religious groups such as churches and schools to employ those who align with their internal guidelines , according to a summary provided in advance of its release . The bill also would prohibit religious groups that oppose same-sex marriage from having their tax-exempt status revoked .
“ We have taken back the religious liberty principle from extremists who I think do want to do harm to LGBTQ people and minority rights , ” said Tyler Deaton , a senior adviser to the American Unity Fund , a nonprofit supporting Stewart ’ s bill that seeks to build conservative support for LGBTQ rights .

According to them , same sex marriage is now not only a “ right , ” no one has the right to oppose it . This new right is so powerful it has completely wiped out the old rights that our founding fathers enshrined in our Constitution : freedom of religion , freedom of speech , freedom of association .
But we saw in the first column , same sex marriage is not really a right but a preference . Some call it a “ right ” but they are actually stealing the authority of rights from God and misapplying it to sexual behavior . They have invented a new moral “ right ” and are attempting to legislate acceptance of it on everyone else ( actually , they are trying to have their new morality imposed by liberal judges ) .
Now , I ’ m sure you ’ ve heard , “ you can ’ t legislate morality. ” The truth is , all laws legislate morality . Morality is about right and wrong and all laws declare in a legal sense one behavior right and the opposite behavior wrong . So the question is not whether we can legislate morality , but “ Whose morality will we legislate ? ”
Many don ’ t realize this because they lump morality and religion together . But laws can and do legislate morality without legislating religion . Few people in the political process are trying to tell others what church to go to or what religious rituals to observe . That would be legislating religion . But everyone is trying to tell others how to treat one another . That ’ s legislating morality . While religions may teach that people have certain moral rights ( like a right to life or property ) , you don ’ t need to be religious to know those rights or to support them . You need God to justify them , but not to legislate them .
Liberals can ’ t justify why same-sex marriage is right . Nevertheless , they want to legislate it as a right and will convict you of heresy if you fail to bow to it . Florists , bakers , photographers , Internet CEOs and speakers like myself have all discovered personally that the people who say they are fighting for “ tolerance ” are often the most intolerant . In the name of “ inclusion and diversity , ” those of us who have a diverse view are being excluded because we don ’ t exhibit lock-step conformity to their intolerant agenda . We are being fired and fined for exercising our real God-given rights . How can this be ? We can ’ t work because of our political views—views that are firmly rooted in the biological facts of nature . Is this still America ?
At least one advocate of same sex marriage has a real problem with this . Homosexual author Andrew Sullivan expressed revulsion for the intolerance gay activists expressed to former Mozilla CEO Brandon Eich , which ultimately forced his resignation . Sullivan wrote , “ The whole episode disgusts me – as it should disgust anyone interested in a tolerant and diverse society . If this is the gay rights movement today – hounding our opponents with a fanaticism more like the religious right than anyone else – then count me out . If we are about intimidating the free speech of others , we are no better than the anti-gay bullies who came before us. ” ( Maybe Sullivan is speaking of another time , but most “ religious right ” people I know are tolerant—they would never usurp the free speech or freedom of association rights of those with whom they disagree . )
As headlines nearly every day affirm , there ’ s a growing clash between real rights and the new invented right of same sex marriage . Can anyone see any middle ground between 1 ) you must celebrate my same sex marriage , and 2 ) God or my conscience prevents me from doing so ? There is none . So which “ right ” will take precedence : the real right or the invented right ?
According to lesbian activist Chai Feldbaum , who was appointed by President Obama to the EEOC , it ’ s not the real right . Speaking about this inevitable conflict between homosexuality and religious liberty she said , “ I ’ m having a hard time coming up with any case in which religious liberty should win . ”

Did you think heresy was only a concern of traditional religion ? The religion of liberals is no more liberal than that of the most rabid fundamentalist church , which is why liberals have not only stolen rights from God , they ’ ve stolen heresy too .","Anyone who opposes same-sex marriage is wrong, says the “gay mafia”—the term the liberal TV personality Bill Maher gave to homosexual activists who “whack” dissenters. According to them, same sex marriage is now not only a “right,” no one has the right to oppose it. This new right is so powerful it has completely wiped out the old rights that our founding fathers enshrined in our Constitution: freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of association.

But we saw in the first column, same sex marriage is not really a right but a preference. Some call it a “right” but they are actually stealing the authority of rights from God and misapplying it to sexual behavior. They have invented a new moral “right” and are attempting to legislate acceptance of it on everyone else (actually, they are trying to have their new morality imposed by liberal judges).

Now, I’m sure you’ve heard, “you can’t legislate morality.” The truth is, all laws legislate morality. Morality is about right and wrong and all laws declare in a legal sense one behavior right and the opposite behavior wrong. So the question is not whether we can legislate morality, but “Whose morality will we legislate?”

Many don’t realize this because they lump morality and religion together. But laws can and do legislate morality without legislating religion. Few people in the political process are trying to tell others what church to go to or what religious rituals to observe. That would be legislating religion. But everyone is trying to tell others how to treat one another. That’s legislating morality. While religions may teach that people have certain moral rights (like a right to life or property), you don’t need to be religious to know those rights or to support them. You need God to justify them, but not to legislate them.

Liberals can’t justify why same-sex marriage is right. Nevertheless, they want to legislate it as a right and will convict you of heresy if you fail to bow to it. Florists, bakers, photographers, Internet CEOs and speakers like myself have all discovered personally that the people who say they are fighting for “tolerance” are often the most intolerant. In the name of “inclusion and diversity,” those of us who have a diverse view are being excluded because we don’t exhibit lock-step conformity to their intolerant agenda. We are being fired and fined for exercising our real God-given rights. How can this be? We can’t work because of our political views—views that are firmly rooted in the biological facts of nature. Is this still America?

At least one advocate of same sex marriage has a real problem with this. Homosexual author Andrew Sullivan expressed revulsion for the intolerance gay activists expressed to former Mozilla CEO Brandon Eich, which ultimately forced his resignation. Sullivan wrote, “The whole episode disgusts me – as it should disgust anyone interested in a tolerant and diverse society. If this is the gay rights movement today – hounding our opponents with a fanaticism more like the religious right than anyone else – then count me out. If we are about intimidating the free speech of others, we are no better than the anti-gay bullies who came before us.” (Maybe Sullivan is speaking of another time, but most “religious right” people I know are tolerant—they would never usurp the free speech or freedom of association rights of those with whom they disagree.)

As headlines nearly every day affirm, there’s a growing clash between real rights and the new invented right of same sex marriage. Can anyone see any middle ground between 1) you must celebrate my same sex marriage, and 2) God or my conscience prevents me from doing so? There is none. So which “right” will take precedence: the real right or the invented right?

According to lesbian activist Chai Feldbaum, who was appointed by President Obama to the EEOC, it’s not the real right. Speaking about this inevitable conflict between homosexuality and religious liberty she said, “I’m having a hard time coming up with any case in which religious liberty should win.”

So the true rights of freedom of religion, speech and association must give way to the invented right of same sex marriage. Your right to live Christianity, or any other faith, must give way to those who demand that you affirm their lifestyle. That isn’t tolerance. That’s totalitarianism. Conform or else!

Jesus loved sinners, which is why He wouldn’t affirm their sin. Neither can Christians. If we celebrate harmful behavior we are being unloving. Love requires we tell people the truth, even if it upsets them.

In fact, if you are upset with me for the thoughts I’ve expressed in these three columns, it means that in an important sense you agree with me. If you don’t like the behaviors and ideas I am advocating here, you are admitting that all behaviors and ideas are not equal—that some are closer to the real objective moral truth than others. But what is the source of that objective moral truth? As we saw in the first column, the source can’t be changeable you or me. It can only be God—the author of Nature’s Law.

Eyder is reporting today from Morehouse, Ky.

In what was an emotional and contentious scene at the Rowan County, Ky., Courthouse this morning, one dramatic legal standoff came to an end when a gay couple was issued a marriage license.

James Yates and William Smith, who had tried this five times before, arrived at the courthouse just as the sun started peeking out from under the mountains on the horizon.

They walked past protesters — some condemning them and some cheering them — and entered the clerk's office.

Kim Davis, the county clerk who had stood in their way those five previous attempts, was in jail. She was held in contempt by a federal judge Thursday for refusing to hand out marriage licenses in defiance of the U.S. Supreme Court. So early Friday, Yates and Smith walked up to Deputy Clerk Brian Mason.

Mason was all business. He checked their licenses, asked them if they were related, took their $35 and, in about five minutes, handed them an envelope and said, ""Congratulations.""

Yates and Smith had become the first same-sex couple to receive a marriage license from Rowan County.

They exited to chants of ""Love has won. Love has won.""

""I don't want her in jail,"" Yates said of Davis. ""No one wanted her in jail. We just wanted the licenses given out. This isn't a blessing. It's an official license.""

He grew emotional.

""This means, at least for this area, civil rights are civil rights and they're not subject to beliefs.""

Davis' husband, Joe Davis, was also outside the courthouse with a group of protesters who called this a moral fight.

""We don't hate these people. That's the furthest thing from our hearts,"" he said. ""We don't hate nobody. We just want to have the same rights that they have. They're saying, 'Hey we're gonna make you accept us.' But they don't want to accept our beliefs. But they want us to accept theirs.""

Hall said gay marriage supporters have told him he 's on the wrong side of history but , he said , `` the truth is I 'm more concerned about being on the right side of eternity . ''
But supporters , too , cited religious faith and relationships with gay family members and friends as shaping their vote for the bill . Many spoke of the benefits of their own marriages .

This is the point when Buttigieg talks about the first time he came here as a volunteer on Barack Obama ’ s 2008 campaign . “ I was here in Iowa when this state changed what the country and the world thought was possible in American presidential politics , ” he often says . “ This state gave me permission to believe that someone like me could be wearing this wedding ring I ’ ve got on right now. ” The ring flashes . The crowd cheers .
This closing pitch is part of Buttigieg ’ s not-so-subtle effort to link his candidacy to the last young outsider to win Iowa and then the presidency , another disciplined intellectual who ran on hope and unity . But it ’ s also a hint at the broader emotional arc of how Buttigieg ’ s identity informs his central argument about grace and belonging : that America is flawed but forgivable , that her sins are venial but not mortal , and that bigotry can be melted by love .
Just as Obama ’ s rhetoric on race was informed by his love for his white mother and grandparents , Buttigieg ’ s rhetoric about what he calls a “ crisis of belonging ” is rooted in his experience as a closeted gay man in Indiana .
Buttigieg is the first gay candidate for president to have a credible chance at winning , which is part of the reason why his bid for the White House gained notice in the first place . But perhaps the most remarkable part of this milestone is the degree to which his identity has faded into the background over the course of the campaign . It seems to have had little negative effect on his fundraising or poll numbers ; if anything , it may have helped him catch the attention of deep-pocketed donors in New York and San Francisco . And unlike his female opponents , Buttigieg has faced few questions about whether his sexuality diminishes his electability .
In interviews with dozens of voters across Iowa during Buttigieg ’ s final swing , not a single one brought up his sexuality until explicitly asked . When asked directly , voters said they considered it a non-issue , or even evidence of how far the country has come .
“ For the gay candidate to have twice the crowd of [ Elizabeth ] Warren or [ Bernie ] Sanders or anybody else in these little rural towns , that gives me some faith in humanity , ” says Scott Matter , a Buttigieg precinct captain and a former Republican . ” I get choked up just thinking about it . It says something really good about Iowa . They see who this guy is at his core . ”

Buttigieg ’ s sexuality appears to have shaped his personality and presentation in ways that explain both his formidable strengths as a candidate and his weaknesses . He is unusually controlled and disciplined . To supporters , this reads as reassuring , presidential . To skeptics , it reads as contrived , robotic .
Buttigieg was in his 30s when he came out publicly by writing an op-ed . By then he had amassed a glittering resume—Harvard , Oxford , McKinsey , Mayor the Navy—but no intimate personal life . That may not be a coincidence .
“ Externally , he had to be the best , prove himself , and strive and get the top mark . Internally , I could see how that ’ s tough , ” says one friend who has known him since high school . “ There ’ s two sides : you go home and it ’ s probably a little painful and lonely , and then when you go outside the best way to measure success or happiness or pleasure or fun is just by doing the best job you can . And that ’ s kind of how he ’ s gotten to this point . ”
Buttigieg himself has acknowledged this . “ You feel a different level of pressure to be the most , the best , the strongest , especially if there ’ s something gnawing at you that makes you think there ’ s something about you that ’ s wrong or off , ” Buttigieg told comedian Jon Lovett on his podcast , Lovett or Leave It , adding that he had “ a little more bandwidth because dating wasn ’ t available for me . ”
“ You just find places for your energy . You could even argue you find places for your love to go if it ’ s not going into a relationship , ” he said . “ There ’ s no question that so many gay people feel that pressure and it propels us in different ways . ”
In 1973 , writer Andrew Tobias first popularized the idea of the “ best little boy in the world , ” which suggests that closeted young men often become overachievers in order to deflect attention from their sexuality . In 2013 , this theory was substantiated in a study that found that closeted young men were more likely to derive their self-worth from external achievements— and that the longer they stayed in the closet , the more they accomplished .
Being in the closet didn ’ t just propel Buttigieg towards achievement . It also defined his personality , giving him a discipline and self-control that few politicians his age have mastered .
It doesn ’ t always go over well . He ’ s been called an “ ambitious apple-polisher ” and a “ build-a-Bear for middling Democrats. ” He was mocked in The Onion for “ speaking to manufacturing robots in fluent binary. ” He seems to have trouble relating to angry young protesters .
But critics who accuse him of contorting himself in a cynical bid to run for President are missing the point : He has always been like this . In interviews with dozens of people who have known Buttigieg throughout his life— family friends , middle-school classmates , high-school teachers , college roommates , disgruntled South Bend residents—they all say the same thing : the 38-year old Pete that voters see on the trail is the same Pete they knew when he was 30 or 13 .
Personality is the product of countless factors , from geography ( there ’ s that Midwestern niceness ) to education and privilege ( he ’ s a white man raised in an upper middle class family ) to family dynamics ( as an only child of two professors , he ’ s bookish and conflict-averse ) to parenting ( Buttigieg ’ s mother has a similarly calm and collected demeanor . )
But the intensity of his self-possession is obvious to anyone who has ever met Buttigieg : the absolute self-control , the infrequency of gaffes , the unwillingness to let the mask slip , even among his closest and most intimate friends . That ’ s because it ’ s not a mask . Or if it is , it ’ s one that he put on so long ago he doesn ’ t know how to take it off .
“ He ’ s someone who ’ s grappled with what it ’ s like to be gay in this liminal space between acceptance and a lack of acceptance , and I think you see that in his story , ” Lovett said in an interview , reflecting on their earlier conversation . “ I think that ’ s something that a lot of young gay people have been through : this desire to prove that you aren ’ t defined by it , while also going through that long and difficult process of not just viewing it as something you have to deal it but viewing it as a positive , important aspect of yourself that allows you to have insight into what it ’ s like to be marginalized in some way . ”
Buttigieg ’ s sexuality—and the years of struggle and isolation that came with it—have informed his central argument about difference and belonging , allowing him to position himself as the candidate of inclusion for anybody who feels excluded from the Democratic party . Nationwide , that argument could fall flat in the face of his dismal polling with voters of color , who are core to the Democratic base . But in Iowa , the Buttigieg campaign has calculated that his welcoming message of growth and acceptance could appeal to what he calls “ future former Republicans , ” who feel at once alienated by Trump but excluded from an increasingly vengeful Democratic party . People who are sick of feeling bad , and just want to feel good again . People who want forgiveness .
“ I think the pendulum has swung on that issue even more than we all understand , ” says Matter , the Buttigieg precinct captain . “ And it ’ s happened so fast that it ’ s almost jarring .","As Pete Buttigieg travels across Iowa, he has taken to ending his speeches by reaching out his hand and letting his wedding ring glint under the lights.

House Republican leaders had a uniform response to the Supreme Court’s decision to take up gay marriage: silence.

The high court’s decision last week to hear two cases relating to same-sex marriage puts that issue at the center of the national debate. And it does so at an exceedingly awkward time for Republicans, many of whom are trying to downplay or moderate their party’s views on social issues to chart a path back to electoral success.

The timing is most uncomfortable for House Republicans, who are playing a key role in one of the cases the court agreed to hear.

In June, the House of Representatives told the Supreme Court that the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act “is an issue of great national importance” that urgently requires the justices’ attention. The 1996 law denies federal benefits to same-sex married couples.

But when the court agreed on Friday to hear one of the DOMA cases early next year, the Republican leadership had nothing to say about it.

Advocates on both sides of the issue said they’d seen no statements from Republican lawmakers about the court’s decision to take on DOMA and an even more provocative dispute regarding a ban California voters approved on same-sex marriage.

“I’m personally grateful to Speaker [John] Boehner for being willing to defend the law, but it’s clear GOP elites don’t want to talk about it and want to keep it as quiet as possible,” said Maggie Gallagher, a founder of the National Organization for Marriage and a fellow at the conservative American Principles Project. “That’s so obvious, I don’t see any point in pretending otherwise.”

Tom McClusky of the Family Research Council said he assumes from conversations he’s had with congressional aides that lawmakers are pleased the high court is taking up the issue. “But there’s just radio silence” publicly, McClusky said. “I was disappointed there wasn’t more from the Hill.”

And a top gay-rights activist, who asked not to be named because of his outreach to Republicans, said he hasn’t “heard or seen anything” from GOP leaders or members. “They’re really just hoping this issue will go away.”

POLITICO placed calls or emails to about 10 House members on Monday requesting comment on the court’s announcement. None surfaced for an interview.

The hearing was the second in back-to-back gay marriage cases before the court this week , both of which have attracted intense public interest .

“ When all Americans are treated as equal , we are all more free , ” Mr. Obama said in the White House Rose Garden . “ This ruling will strengthen all our communities . America should be very proud . ”
He called the decision “ a victory for gay and lesbian couples who have fought so long for their basic civil rights . ”
Mr. Obama said during his 2008 presidential campaign that he did not support marriage for same-sex couples . Presidential adviser David Axelrod wrote in a book this year that Mr. Obama took that position only because it was politically expedient at the time .
In 1996 , as an Illinois state Senate candidate , Mr. Obama wrote on a questionnaire that he supported same-sex marriage . But in 2011 , then-White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer said someone else had filled out the questionnaire , and that Mr. Obama “ has never favored same-sex marriage . ”

Mr. Obama even tried to take a little credit for what he said is America ’ s shifting attitudes toward gay marriage .
“ In my second inaugural address [ in 2013 ] , I said that if we are truly created equal , then truly the love we commit to one another must be equal as well , ” Mr. Obama said . “ It is gratifying to see that principle enshrined into law by this decision . ”
The president said the ruling has brought equality to gay Americans “ like a thunderbolt , ” and that supporters of the ruling should acknowledge there are many people who still don ’ t accept same-sex marriage .
“ Compared to so many other issues , America ’ s shift [ on same-sex marriage ] has been so quick , ” Mr. Obama said . “ I know that Americans of goodwill continue to hold a wide range of views on this issue . Opposition in some cases has been based on sincere and deeply held beliefs . All of us who welcome today ’ s news should be mindful of that fact , recognize different viewpoints , revere our deep commitment to religious freedom . ”
But , he added , “ today should also give us hope that on the many issues with which we grapple , often painfully , real change is possible . Shifts in hearts and minds is possible . ”","President Obama, who opposed same-sex marriage until three years ago, hailed the Supreme Court’s ruling to legalize gay marriage Friday as “a victory for America.”

“When all Americans are treated as equal, we are all more free,” Mr. Obama said in the White House Rose Garden. “This ruling will strengthen all our communities. America should be very proud.”

He called the decision “a victory for gay and lesbian couples who have fought so long for their basic civil rights.”

Mr. Obama said during his 2008 presidential campaign that he did not support marriage for same-sex couples. Presidential adviser David Axelrod wrote in a book this year that Mr. Obama took that position only because it was politically expedient at the time.

The president publicly opposed same-sex marriage until 2012.

In 1996, as an Illinois state Senate candidate, Mr. Obama wrote on a questionnaire that he supported same-sex marriage. But in 2011, then-White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer said someone else had filled out the questionnaire, and that Mr. Obama “has never favored same-sex marriage.”

Why do you oppose same-sex marriage?

Indiana University sociologist Brian Powell posed this question to hundreds of people across the nation as part of a research project.

He was curious to see if what people say actually matches the legal arguments being made to justify bans on same-sex marriage.

The legal arguments are rooted in public policy considerations. The public responses decidedly were not.

From his survey results, published recently in the sociological journal Social Currents, here's one response that reflected the majority of opposition to same-sex marriage: ""Because I don't believe God intended them to be that way.""

""It's beastly,"" said another. A third: ""Well, they're sinners.""

Powell acknowledges there is nothing wrong with showing moral disapproval. People have a right to their beliefs and values.

But, if public opinion — either through pressure on lawmakers or directly at the ballot box — drives public policy, Powell's research suggests that the real motivation for banning same-sex marriage is moral disapproval over homosexuality.

And that, he says, could present a particular challenge for supporters of traditional marriage: Moral disapproval doesn't make a valid legal case. In fact, same-sex marriage proponents argue that would be unconstitutional.

That's why the longstanding courtroom debate over same-sex marriage has begun to address a particular legal term: ""animus.""

Animus is the notion that a law has no compelling public interest and is driven merely by a moral disapproval so strong that it causes harm to a group that's viewed as inferior. In the case of same-sex marriage, proponents argue that harm is to deny gays and lesbians the basic right to marry.

""This isn't about forcing people to believe or not believe in something,"" said IU law professor Steve Sanders. ""This is saying marriage is controlled by government, and government shouldn't discriminate against people for flimsy reasons.""

Sanders is co-counsel on an amicus brief from the Human Rights Campaign that claims state bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional because they're based on animus. The brief will be filed in the Supreme Court same-sex marriage case, which is poised to become the definitive ruling on the issue.

But those fighting same-sex marriage adamantly disagree that their stance is fueled by animus. Such an argument, they say, places blame on every person who supported same-sex marriage bans as having evil intent.

If animus motivated Indiana's former same-sex marriage ban, said Curt Smith of the Indiana Family Institute, ""that means that the 150 legislators — a majority of whom supported it — and former Gov. Frank O'Bannon had to have hatred for gays in their hearts when they voted for and supported that bill. I just think that's a wrong analysis, but it's also a tremendous discredit to the men and women who serve in the legislature and our governor.""

Animus has become a word ""grossly misapplied,"" he added.

""It's just an idea that's out there that's become a place to hang your hat,"" he said.

Instead, he points to specific public policy considerations: that traditional marriages produce ""wonderful benefits"" for couples, society and children — and he thinks research will show same-sex relationships do not bear out the same effects.

'Motivated out of spite'

But proponents of same-sex marriage argue that the public policy arguments are flimsy, at best.

For example, one such public policy argument is that marriage promotes ""responsible procreation"" and thus limits the number of children born accidentally.

But since same-sex couples can't naturally reproduce, they were excluded from the definition of marriage.

Judge Richard Posner addressed this in the recent 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals majority opinion that maintained same-sex marriage bans were unconstitutional in states including Indiana and Wisconsin.

Posner wrote that if responsible procreation were a real justification for banning same-sex marriages, the state also wouldn't allow people who are infertile to marry.

He added: ""Heterosexuals get drunk and pregnant, producing unwanted children; their reward is to be allowed to marry. Homosexual couples do not produce unwanted children; their reward is to be denied the right to marry. Go figure.""

That policy argument, Posner wrote, ""is so full of holes that it cannot be taken seriously."" He concluded that the states failed to show a valid policy interest for discriminatory bans on same-sex marriage.

Sanders, the IU law professor, explained further: If states merely want to ""protect marriage"" by denying same-sex couples from wedding, then why also refuse to recognize gay marriages from other states, prohibit civil unions and deny domestic partnership benefits?

""To do something like that,"" Sanders said, ""begins to feel like it's more motivated out of spite than any sort of sensible public policy.""

Truth is 'assuredly complicated'

But if that sounds like animus, not everyone — or court decision — concurs.

The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, which oversees states including Ohio, didn't agree that animus existed in its evaluation of same-sex marriage bans. The court upheld such bans, a decision out of chorus with other circuits that propelled the issue to be heard this summer in the U.S. Supreme Court.

""For most people,"" read the 6th Circuit majority opinion authored by Judge Jeffrey Sutton, ""whether for or against the amendment, the truth of why they did what they did is assuredly complicated, making it impossible to pin down any one consideration, as opposed to a rough aggregation of factors, as motivating them.""

Sutton also refused to impugn traditional marriage supporters for wanting to uphold what has been a longtime social norm that has only recently been thrown into flux.

""It is no less unfair to paint the proponents of the measures as a monolithic group of hate-mongers than it is to paint the opponents as a monolithic group trying to undo American families,"" Sutton wrote.

He accepted policy arguments for responsible procreation as a valid, rational basis for state bans while acknowledging flaws. And even if he didn't find animus, he was careful to note that allowing same-sex marriage seemed inevitable.

Still, he wrote that should be a decision left up not to the courts, but to the democracy — ""as fellow citizens seeking to resolve a new social issue in a fair-minded way.""

Backlash — or fewer fears?

Powell's sociology research notes that public opinion on same-sex marriage has been changing, and he gives a nod to some interesting questions that could tendril off the concept of animus as the debate moves forward.

What happens to public opinion if same-sex couples gain more legal rights?

Will it ""result in public backlash""?

Or, Powell wrote, will it subside fears and animosity toward same-sex couples?

An Arkansas clerk has issued the state's first gay marriage license, breaking a barrier that voters put in place with a constitutional amendment 10 years ago.

Carroll County Deputy Clerk Jane Osborn issued a license Saturday morning to Kristin Seaton and Jennifer Rambo of Fort Smith.

Pulaski County Circuit Judge Chris Piazza said there is ""no rational reason"" for preventing gay couples from marrying.

""This is an unconstitutional attempt to narrow the definition of equality,"" Piazza wrote. ""The exclusion of a minority for no rational reason is a dangerous precedent.""

Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel said he would appeal the ruling and asked that it be suspended during that process. No appeal was filed as of Saturday morning.

""We respect the court's decision, but, in keeping with the Attorney General's obligation to defend the state constitution, we will appeal,"" Aaron Sadler, spokesman for McDaniel's office, said. ""We will request that Judge Piazza issue a stay of his ruling so as not to create confusion or uncertainty about the law while the Supreme Court considers the matter.""

Federal judges have ruled against marriage bans in Michigan, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Texas, and ordered Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee to recognize same-sex marriages from other states.

In all, according to gay-rights groups, more than 70 lawsuits seeking marriage equality are pending in about 30 states. Democratic attorneys general in several states — including Virginia, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Oregon and Kentucky — have declined to defend same-sex marriage bans.

These companies would otherwise have a laudable pro-equality track record of conduct and spending .
The group , Zero for Zeros , just released its third and final list of companies it hopes to pressure to follow Microsoft ’ s lead .
Last month , Zero for Zeros released the first two batches of companies that had 100 % ratings from the Human Rights Campaign and long histories of inclusion , but had made substantial PAC contributions to members of Congress who virulently oppose LGBTQ rights . ███ reached out to those 27 companies and got responses from five . Each of those companies affirmed their support for the LGBTQ community , but none committed to change their political giving .

Zero for Zeros ’ campaign manager Lane Hudson told the Blade , “ Microsoft was the first company that engaged with Zero for Zeros in good faith . We discussed their concerns , they heard ours and their employees weighed in . We are thrilled that they have responded to our campaign . ”
Last month , he told ███ that the Zero for Zeros effort was not meant to not be an attack on these companies , “ because we view them as our allies . They have invested in their employees and customers and been with us in these court battles. ” Rather , they are requests for a “ conversation ” about PAC giving , “ so we can talk about why it ’ s important not only to the LGBTQ community but to their employees and their customers and to the overall movement in general and how it can be beneficial to their business . ”","Microsoft has suspended its political action committee giving to reassess its donation criteria after a pro-LGBTQ grassroots group launched a campaign to urge it and other companies to stop bankrolling anti-LGBTQ extremists. These companies would otherwise have a laudable pro-equality track record of conduct and spending.

The group, Zero for Zeros, just released its third and final list of companies it hopes to pressure to follow Microsoft’s lead.

Last month, Zero for Zeros released the first two batches of companies that had 100% ratings from the Human Rights Campaign and long histories of inclusion, but had made substantial PAC contributions to members of Congress who virulently oppose LGBTQ rights. ThinkProgress reached out to those 27 companies and got responses from five. Each of those companies affirmed their support for the LGBTQ community, but none committed to change their political giving.

On Thursday, The Washington Blade reported that Fred Humphries Jr., Microsoft’s corporate vice president for U.S. Government Affairs, authored an internal memo on July 23 — days after ThinkProgress reached out for comment on the Zero for Zeros — announcing the pause.

The U.S. Supreme Court directly confronts the question of gay marriage this week with a whopping 2 1/2 hours of oral argument, accompanied by plenty of prognostication afterward about the expected results. It won't be until June that we learn how the issue is settled nationally. In the meantime, though, we do know a good deal about the views of the justices already.

To say that there has been a revolution in the law when it comes to gay rights is an understatement.

In 1986, the Supreme Court upheld a Georgia state law that made private, consenting homosexual conduct a crime. Chief Justice Warren Burger, in a concurring opinion, quoted a description of homosexual sex as an ""infamous crime against nature,"" worse than rape, and ""a crime not fit to be named.""

Just 17 years later, however, the court reversed itself and struck down a Texas anti-sodomy law nearly identical to the Georgia one it had previously upheld.

The author of that opinion was Justice Anthony Kennedy.

""It is the promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter,"" Kennedy said, in summarizing his opinion from the bench.

Had the writers of the Constitution known all the possible components of liberty, Kennedy acknowledged, ""they might have been more specific."" But, ""they did not presume to have this insight.""

""They knew times can blind us to certain truths, and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress,"" he said.

Justice Antonin Scalia dissented vociferously.

""It is clear from this that the Court has taken sides in the culture war, and in particular, in that battle of the culture war that concerns whether there should be any moral opprobrium attached to homosexual conduct,"" Scalia said.

Fast forward 10 years to 2013. The leading players were the same. Kennedy again would write the decision for a five-justice majority, this time invalidating the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a 1996 law that had barred federal recognition of same-sex marriages in states where such unions were legal.

Roberts concluded that under the court's precedents, it should look at the broader question, the history of the right to marry.

Just what, if anything, that forecasts is unclear. The court has repeatedly said marriage is a fundamental right. But Roberts was a dissenter in the Defense of Marriage Act case. He would have upheld the law on the grounds that federal recognition justifies uniformity.

This week's case, though, is different. It is the direct challenge to bans on gay marriage that gay rights advocates have been seeking for 20 years. For the court, and the justices, it has all the earmarks of legacy.

It also would represent a serious setback for anyone committed to freedom , justice and equal rights , Obama said .
Obama said the United States stands for the protection of fundamental freedoms and universal human rights and believes people everywhere should be treated equally .
`` That is why I am so deeply disappointed that Uganda will shortly enact legislation that would criminalize homosexuality , '' Obama said in a written statement issued from Southern California , where he was spending the weekend . `` The Anti-Homosexuality Bill in Uganda , once law , will be more than an affront and a danger to the gay community in Uganda . It will be a step backward for all Ugandans and reflect poorly on Uganda 's commitment to protecting the human rights of its people . It also will mark a serious setback for all those around the world who share a commitment to freedom , justice and equal rights . ''
`` Enacting this legislation will complicate our valued relationship with Uganda , '' he said , adding that the U.S. has conveyed that message to Museveni .
Homosexuality already is illegal in Uganda under a colonial-era law that criminalizes sex acts `` against the order of nature . ''
Museveni said last week that he plans to sign the new legislation , which has alarmed rights activists because it prescribes life imprisonment for acts of `` aggravated homosexuality . '' Those acts are defined as sex acts where one of the partners is infected with HIV , sex with minors or the disabled and repeated sexual offenses among consenting adults .
It was unclear when Museveni will sign the bill . Ugandan lawmakers passed it in December and Museveni since has been under heavy pressure to enact it . The measure enjoys broad support among Christian clerics and lawmakers who say it is needed to deter Western homosexuals from `` recruiting '' Ugandan children .
Susan Rice , the U.S. national security adviser , said Sunday on Twitter that she spoke `` at length '' with Museveni on Saturday night and urged him not to sign the bill .
The United States is Uganda 's largest donor , sending more than $ 400 million in aid annually in recent years . If Museveni signs the bill , the U.S. is expected to review its relationship with the country with an eye on finding ways to register disappointment over the law .

A legal brief the Justice Department filed with the Supreme Court Friday asking the justices to strike down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act is raising hopes among gay rights advocates that President Barack Obama is on the verge of embracing a federal constitutional right to same-sex marriage .

A legal brief the Justice Department filed with the Supreme Court Friday asking the justices to strike down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act is raising hopes among gay rights advocates that President Barack Obama is on the verge of embracing a federal constitutional right to same-sex marriage.

The brief formally urges the court to declare unconstitutional the portion of the 1996 law barring recognition of same-sex marriages by the federal government for income tax purposes, federal employee benefits, immigration and myriad other programs.

The portion of DOMA barring federal benefits for same-sex spouses “targets the many gay and lesbian people legally married under state law for a harsh form of discrimination that bears no relation to their ability to contribute to society,” Solicitor General Donald Verrilli and other government lawyers write in the brief. “It is abundantly clear that this discrimination does not substantially advance an interest in protecting marriage, or any other important interest. The statute simply cannot be reconciled with the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection. The Constitution therefore requires that Section 3 [of DOMA] be invalidated.”

The brief pulls few punches in its effort to knock out DOMA, using sweeping language about the history of discrimination against gays and finding no legitimacy in the reasons some have offered for rejecting same-sex marriages. The unsparing tone of the government’s brief led some observers to suspect that the Justice Department is laying the groundwork to endorse a federal constitutional right to same-sex marriage in another pending case that addresses that question more directly.

The Obama administration must decide by next week whether to join with those urging the court to strike down California’s voter-approved ban on gay marriage, Proposition 8. The federal government is not required to file any brief in the Prop. 8 case, but those arguing against the measure and in favor of a constitutional right to gay marriage have until Thursday to weigh in with the high court.

“There is nothing at all tentative about the government’s embrace of gay equality in this brief.

Moore,"Governor 's position on gay marriage may reflect and effort to preserve opportunity to run for president in 2016
Advocates say marriage is a civil right that should not be ruled by majority vote
As activists push states to recognize gay marriages , New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie — conservative Republican governor in a blue state and a 2016 presidential possibility — is walking a fine line between two electorates and two elections .
Christie vetoed same-sex marriage legislation last year and severely criticized the Supreme Court 's decision striking down a ban on federal rights for same-sex married couples . At the same time , he is `` adamant '' that same-sex couples deserve equal legal protection , wants a referendum on gay marriage , and vows to abide by a same-sex marriage law if the voters approve it .
He 's tiptoeing between constituencies . First are the voters of New Jersey : polls show they favor same-sex marriage , and Christie wants them to reelect him in November by a big margin . Then there are Republican caucus-goers in Iowa . Christie needs their backing if he runs for president in 2016 ; in 2012 , evangelical conservatives , who generally oppose gay marriage , made up 57 % of Republican caucusgoers in the state , according to exit polls .
And there is a third group of voters to think about : swing voters across the nation , who might go for a Republican presidential nominee who is sufficiently centrist .
To appeal to those voters , Christie `` will want to not be perceived to be as far right as many Republicans are , '' says David Boaz of the Cato Institute , a libertarian think tank . `` That 's a lot of tightropes to walk . ''
Christie , who is Roman Catholic , has said he does not believe being gay is a choice , nor is it a sin , and that he has gay friends who argue the issue with him . Marriage , he said last year on CNN , is `` special and unique in society . '' He followed his veto in of the gay-marriage bill in February 2012 with a call for a statewide referendum on whether to allow same-sex marriage by constitutional amendment .
`` When you want to change the core of a 2,000 year-old institution , the way to do that is to put it in front of the voters , '' he told reporters July 2 .
A referendum would allow same-sex marriage to pass in New Jersey without his fingerprints — or as he said at a town-hall-style meeting last month : `` I do n't have to compromise my principles that I believe in and someone else does n't have to compromise theirs . ''
Christie is in the same position as his party . The Republican platform says marriage is only for couples of different sexes , but Chairman Reince Priebus has said that the Republican Party should be open to those who favor same-sex marriage . `` I do n't believe we need to act like Old Testament heretics , '' he told ███ in March . Instead , Republicans `` have to strike a balance between principle and grace and respect . ''
Garden State Equality , a leading advocate for same-sex marriage in New Jersey , opposes a referendum saying civil rights should not be on the ballot . `` It should never be up to the majority to vote on the rights of the minority , '' spokesman T.J. Helmstetter said .
Same-sex marriage advocates are now lobbying New Jersey legislators to override Christie 's veto before the end of the year , when the window to do so expires . Christie is too powerful a party leader to let that happen , says Ben Dworkin , director of Rider University 's Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics .
`` I ca n't envision a situation where the Republican votes that are needed to get the two-thirds override would come , given this administration 's history , '' Dworkin says . `` The Christie administration sees no reason why any Republican should really ever override a Republican governor . That 's their logic , so I 'd be shocked if it ever got to happen . ''
Last year , Christie nominated a gay judge ( a Republican ) to the state Supreme Court , a first for the state . Last month , when the Supreme Court ruled on Defense of Marriage Act , he called it `` insulting '' to the Congress and president which passed the law .
Troy Stevenson , executive director of Garden State Equality , said , `` I do n't like to pretend I can get inside the mind of the governor , but I think the closer we get to him having future political ambitions the more staunch his opposition gets to marriage equality . ''
But Jimmy LaSalvia , a founder of GOProud , a Republican gay-rights group that favors same-sex marriage , gives Christie credit for not trying to change the subject . `` He 's one Republican who does n't say ' I believe marriage is between a man and a woman . We need jobs and the economy is hurting , ' '' says LaSalvia , who now works with the ACLU trying to pass same-sex marriage state by state . `` He 's willing to talk through the issue in a way that no other Republican has the balls to do . ''
Christie has to make his political calculus now , even though `` he does n't know how much public opinion will change between now and 2016 , '' Boaz says . `` Will people be more liberal then ? Is the country ? Yes . But the Republican primary electorate , maybe not so much . ''
Public opinion on gay marriage has changed rapidly . Four years ago , 37 % of Americans favored same-sex marrage . Now , 51 % do , according to the Pew Research Center .

One commenter — who appeared to be a student and supported the winners — noted the following :
These lovely ladies happen to be a wonderful couple who happened to win the most votes for royalty .
Regardless of intent , couples are always voted in together . I 'm just confused as to why it 's OK for a male/female couple to win , but not any LGBTQ+ couples to win .
Our student body has always been loving and inclusive ( for the most part ) . And it would be a shame for someone to be automatically out of the running for royalty just simply because they like the same sex .
Also , the boys had a chance to win ; it just so happened that Abby got the most votes out of all of them . They 're not being excluded ; they just simply did n't get the votes .

As society's views have become more liberal, the church has struggled with how it addresses LGBT rights.

The Telegraph reports the CofE is conducting a ""major study"" on human sexuality which is to be published later this year.

Welby and Sentamu said they were committed to the study called Living in Love and Faith.

Same-sex weddings could come to a halt in many states , depending on a confusing mix of lower-court decisions and the sometimes-contradictory views of state and local officials .
Among the 36 states in which same-sex couples can now marry are 20 in which federal judges invoked the Constitution to strike down marriage bans .
Those rulings would be in conflict with the nation 's highest court if the justices uphold the power of states to limit marriage to heterosexual couples . A decision is expected by late June in cases from Kentucky , Michigan , Ohio and Tennessee .
Top officials in some states , including California , seem determined to allow gay and lesbian couples to continue to marry no matter how the court decision comes out . But some county clerks , who actually issue marriage licenses , might not go along , experts said .
In other states , a high court ruling in favor of state bans would serve to prohibit any more such unions , but also could give rise to new efforts to repeal marriage bans through the legislature or the ballot .
The scenario may be unlikely , given the Supreme Court 's role in allowing those lower court rulings to take effect before the justices themselves decided the issue .

Gay and lesbian couples could continue to marry in the 16 states that have same-sex marriage because of state court rulings , acts of the legislature or statewide votes .
Similarly , the 14 states that prohibit same-sex couples from marrying , including the four directly involved in the Supreme Court cases , could continue enforcing their state marriage laws . That would include Alabama , where a federal judge has struck down the state 's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage , but put her ruling on hold pending the high court 's decision .
Of the remaining 20 states , any that fought unsuccessfully to preserve marriage bans would not have much trouble resuming enforcement . `` That state can immediately start saying we 're going to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples going forward , '' said Cornell University law professor Michael Dorf .

But Gene Schaerr , a Washington-based lawyer who has defended same-sex marriage bans , said he thinks even in states where the political leadership favors gay and lesbian unions , county clerks who actually issue marriage licenses would be on safe ground if they were to deny licenses to same-sex couples .
In Schaerr 's view , only the clerks in Alameda and Los Angeles counties are bound by the 2010 injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker . A Supreme Court ruling rejecting a constitutional right to marry for same-sex couples would `` free the clerks in counties other than Los Angeles and Alameda to adhere to Proposition 8 , '' Schaerr said .

Christie signs ban on gay conversion therapy,2013-08-19,Martha T. Moore,"Christie 's action is seen as a victory for gay rights groups that want him to endorse same-sex marriage .
Christie 's decision seen as a victory for gay rights groups
Supporters of same-sex marriage say they have greater hope New Jersey will soon allow it after Republican Gov . Chris Christie signed legislation Monday banning the controversial practice of `` conversion '' therapy for gay youth .
New Jersey is only the second state in the nation , after California , to forbid licensed therapists from using therapy to try to change the sexual orientation of minors . But the state is the only one in the Northeast not to allow gay couples to marry : Christie vetoed same-sex marriage legislation last year .
Christie said that while he is concerned about `` government limiting parental choice on the care and treatment of their own children , '' he sided with expert opinion from the American Psychological Association that so-called conversion therapy can lead to depression , suicidal thoughts and substance abuse in teenagers .
The conversion therapy law `` sets a national precedent on not allowing this abuse to go forward , '' said Troy Stevenson , executive director of Garden State Equality , which supported the ban .
Christie has said that he believes that sexual preference is a trait people are born with and that , although his Catholic faith calls homosexuality a sin , he does not .
`` He recognizes what many opponents of marriage equality do not recognize , which is that gay people are not in need of treatment , '' said state Sen. Raymond Lesniak , a Democrat who sponsored the legislation . `` That 's certainly an important statement to make and he made that with his signing of the bill . '' Supporting same-sex marriage is `` a natural next step , '' Lesniak said .
Christie is cruising to re-election in November despite New Jersey 's Democratic lean . But as a likely 2016 presidential candidate who will have to appeal to party conservatives in early primary contests , Christie has walked a careful line on gay issues .
When he vetoed the same-sex marriage law last year , he said the state should hold a referendum on the issue instead . In June , he criticized the Supreme Court 's decision striking down a ban on federal rights for same-sex married couples . At the same time , the governor said he is `` adamant '' that same-sex couples deserve equal legal protection and vows to abide by a same-sex marriage law if the voters approve it . He also appointed the first openly gay judge to the state 's Supreme Court .
`` We welcome what he did today , we 're glad he agrees that people do n't choose their sexuality and we think that means that every person and every couple in New Jersey should be treated with full respect and that means freedom to marry , '' said Marc Solomon of Freedom to Marry , a same-sex marriage advocacy group .
Gay marriage advocates are pursuing two strategies . A court case argues that New Jersey 's civil unions law does not protect equal treatment for gay couples ; a decision is expected next month but may be appealed to the state Supreme Court . Gay rights groups are also intensively lobbying state legislators to overturn Christie 's veto of the same-sex marriage bill . An override must occur before mid-January .
`` I truly believe , if you look at this bill , if you look at the massive swell of support , there is definitely a road to getting this override accomplished . '' ' Stevenson said . The conversion therapy ban passed with a vetoproof majority . `` It definitely shows what the mindset of the legislature is . ''
But Christie has forbidden Republicans who support same sex marriage to overturn his veto , gay rights advocates say . `` The governor 's position is that you do n't override his vetoes . And we have n't been able to , '' says Senate President Steve Sweeney , a Democrat .
Groups lobbying for same sex marriage hope Republican legislators will be more willing to vote against the governor after November , when Christie , if re-elected , would become a lame duck . `` I would n't expect his colleagues to vote against his wishes right before the election . That might be a little too much , '' Lesniak said .
The political climate is quickly changing in favor of gay marriage , Solomon said . `` From my experience with and understanding of New Jersey , understanding of where voters are , where their constituents are , and how far Republicans have moved on this issue , particularly Republicans from the northeast – we 're not talking about Alabama here – this should not be impossible at all . ''","CLOSE

Christie's action is seen as a victory for gay rights groups that want him to endorse same-sex marriage.

Republican has walked line on same-sex marriage

Supporters of same-sex marriage say they have greater hope New Jersey will soon allow it after Republican Gov. Chris Christie signed legislation Monday banning the controversial practice of ""conversion"" therapy for gay youth.

New Jersey is only the second state in the nation, after California, to forbid licensed therapists from using therapy to try to change the sexual orientation of minors. But the state is the only one in the Northeast not to allow gay couples to marry: Christie vetoed same-sex marriage legislation last year.

Christie said that while he is concerned about ""government limiting parental choice on the care and treatment of their own children,'' he sided with expert opinion from the American Psychological Association that so-called conversion therapy can lead to depression, suicidal thoughts and substance abuse in teenagers.

The conversion therapy law ""sets a national precedent on not allowing this abuse to go forward,'' said Troy Stevenson, executive director of Garden State Equality, which supported the ban.

STORY: Christie walks line on gay marriage

Christie has said that he believes that sexual preference is a trait people are born with and that, although his Catholic faith calls homosexuality a sin, he does not.

""He recognizes what many opponents of marriage equality do not recognize, which is that gay people are not in need of treatment,'' said state Sen. Raymond Lesniak, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation. ""That's certainly an important statement to make and he made that with his signing of the bill.'' Supporting same-sex marriage is ""a natural next step,'' Lesniak said.

Christie is cruising to re-election in November despite New Jersey's Democratic lean. But as a likely 2016 presidential candidate who will have to appeal to party conservatives in early primary contests, Christie has walked a careful line on gay issues.

When he vetoed the same-sex marriage law last year, he said the state should hold a referendum on the issue instead. In June, he criticized the Supreme Court's decision striking down a ban on federal rights for same-sex married couples. At the same time, the governor said he is ""adamant'' that same-sex couples deserve equal legal protection and vows to abide by a same-sex marriage law if the voters approve it. He also appointed the first openly gay judge to the state's Supreme Court.

""We welcome what he did today, we're glad he agrees that people don't choose their sexuality and we think that means that every person and every couple in New Jersey should be treated with full respect and that means freedom to marry,'' said Marc Solomon of Freedom to Marry, a same-sex marriage advocacy group.

Gay marriage advocates are pursuing two strategies. A court case argues that New Jersey's civil unions law does not protect equal treatment for gay couples; a decision is expected next month but may be appealed to the state Supreme Court. Gay rights groups are also intensively lobbying state legislators to overturn Christie's veto of the same-sex marriage bill. An override must occur before mid-January.

""I truly believe, if you look at this bill, if you look at the massive swell of support, there is definitely a road to getting this override accomplished.'' ' Stevenson said. The conversion therapy ban passed with a vetoproof majority. ""It definitely shows what the mindset of the legislature is.''

But Christie has forbidden Republicans who support same sex marriage to overturn his veto, gay rights advocates say. ""The governor's position is that you don't override his vetoes. And we haven't been able to,'' says Senate President Steve Sweeney, a Democrat.

Groups lobbying for same sex marriage hope Republican legislators will be more willing to vote against the governor after November, when Christie, if re-elected, would become a lame duck. ""I wouldn't expect his colleagues to vote against his wishes right before the election. That might be a little too much,'' Lesniak said.

The political climate is quickly changing in favor of gay marriage, Solomon said. ""From my experience with and understanding of New Jersey, understanding of where voters are, where their constituents are, and how far Republicans have moved on this issue, particularly Republicans from the northeast – we're not talking about Alabama here – this should not be impossible at all.''

Black LGBTQ people are disproportionately concentrated in the states where they face racial discrimination and where it is `` legally permissible to discriminate against us based on actual or perceived sexual identity , gender orientation or expression , '' Johns said .
Jennings , who is also the founder of GLSEN , an education organization working to end LGBTQ bullying , pointed to legislation restricting LGBTQ rights . Just in 2019 , 240 anti-LGBT bills were introduced in state legislatures , according to the Equality Federation .
`` There are still important aspects of American life where LGBTQ people do not have the protections that we deserve as full and equal American citizens , '' Jennings said . `` There is no final victory , and there is no final defeat . ''

Rocero said last Monday 's Supreme Court decision , which held that civil rights law barring sex discrimination in the workplace applies to gay , lesbian and transgender workers , was `` the most important civil rights case '' outside of the 2015 marriage decision .
But Rocero , who spoke in front of the Supreme Court in October 2019 , said that there is more work to be done to achieve full equality .
`` This is a traumatic and stressful moment for particularly LGBTQ people , specifically trans people of color , that do n't even have basic access to shelter , for basic health care , '' she said .

Part of recognizing queer people of color is recognizing the history of racial exclusion within the LGBTQ community , advocates say .
While many recognize that transgender people of color were on the front lines at Stonewall 50 years ago , Rocero said queer people of color , especially transgender people of color , have often been `` forgotten . ''
`` It 's time to let trans people of color take over and let us lead this movement . Because if we are not free , nobody 's free , '' she added .

The Equality Act would amend the Civil Rights Act to prevent discrimination against LGBTQ people in places such as public facilities , housing and schools .
The act passed in the House of Representatives last May , and has remained in the Senate since then .
But the need for such measures is not agreed upon by the public at large . A 2019 Gallup poll found that 46 % of U.S. adults said that new civil rights laws are not needed to protect LGBTQ people .
Jennings said that activists must continue `` until every LGBTQ person has equal rights before the law in this nation . ''
`` We are not in a state in which LGBTQ people can rest on our laurels . We both have to finish the work that has yet to be done , and we have to safeguard the protections that we have won . ''
Patrick Ladonis Sutton , who married his husband Robert McMillian in 2016 after 14 years together , decided not to get married until marriage was `` legal everywhere . ''

`` It always has a symbolic meaning for the two of us , '' he said . `` We 've now been together 18 years , and we were not married for 14 years of them , and honestly we did n't think we would ever see it happen in our lifetime . ''
Sutton notes that in recent years there has been `` a struggle for same sex couples to adopt . '' Earlier this year , Tennessee 's governor signed a law allowing adoption agencies to deny same-sex couples .
`` There is a ton of work still to be done , '' Sutton said . `` But I do feel like where slowly moving there just not as fast as I would like . ''
Three-quarters of Americans polled said gays and lesbians should be allowed to adopt children in 2019 , compared to just 14 % in 1977 .

`` People made enormous sacrifices in terms of their career , their personal lives , sometimes their whole lives , so that the world would be better today than it was when I was born in 1963 , '' he said . `` And , boy , is it different for LGBTQ people compared to the year I was born .

lgbt_rights,ABC News,0,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obama-administration-join-opposition-prop-supreme-court/story?id=18561874,Will Obama Join Legal Fight for Gay Marriage?,,Ariane De Vogue,"There is one mystery left to solve before the Supreme Court gathers to hear a challenge to Proposition 8 in late March .
That is : Will the Department of Justice weigh in on the case in favor of opponents of Prop 8 , the California ballot measure that defined marriage as between one man and one woman ? And what will it say ?
Hollingsworth v. Perry concerns the California ballot initiative , enacted in 2008 . In a brief filed with the court on Thursday , opponents of Prop 8 made broad arguments claiming that it is unconstitutional .
`` Proposition 8 is an arbitrary , irrational and discriminatory measure that denies gay men and lesbians their fundamental right to marry in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses , '' the opponents said .
The brief was written by Theodore B. Olson and David Boies , who represent the American Foundation for Equal Rights .
They wrote , `` Because of their sexual orientation -- a characteristic with which they were born and which they can not change -- plaintiffs and hundreds of thousands of gay men and lesbians in California and across the country are being excluded from one of life 's most precious relationships .
`` They may not marry the person they love , the person with whom they wish to partner in building a family and with whom they wish to share their future and their most intimate and private dreams , '' they added .
The arguments tackled more than just the ruling that struck down Prop 8 on narrow grounds specific to California 's history on the issue of gay marriage .
The language was sweeping : `` The only substantive question in this case is whether the state is entitled to exclude gay men and lesbians from the institution of marriage and deprive their relationships -- their love -- of the respect , and dignity and social acceptance , that heterosexual marriages enjoy .
`` This badge of inferiority , separateness and inequality must be extinguished . When it is , America will be closer to fulfilling the aspirations of its citizens , '' they wrote .
A month ago , supporters of Prop 8 filed their brief in the case . Read it HERE .
While the administration will certainly weigh in on the other gay marriage case in front of the court -- a challenge to the federal law , the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) -- it has never filed a brief in the Prop 8 case because it was not directly involved .
While the DOMA case challenges a federal law that denies federal benefits to same-sex couples who are legally married in their state , the Prop 8 case asks a much broader question : Is there a fundamental right to gay marriage under the Constitution .
Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. is not required to file a so-called `` friend of the court '' brief in the Prop 8 case , but sources said the administration is considering the possibility at the highest levels . If it chooses to weigh in , it has to do so by the last week of February .
In San Francisco Wednesday , President Obama told ███ station KGO-TV , `` The solicitor general is still looking at this . I have to make sure I 'm not interjecting myself too much into this process , particularly when we 're not party to the case . I can tell you , though , that obviously my personal view is that I think that same-sex couples should have the same rights and be treated like everybody else . ''
At the White House briefing on Thursday , White House spokesman Jay Carney said , `` I think you have seen no expression from the president on the constitutional or legal aspects of this . He has an opinion , obviously , about Proposition 8 as policy , but we have no comment and nothing to say at this point about an issue that is properly looked at as a legal and constitutional matter over at the Department of Justice . ''
Back in May , the president told ███ ' Robin Roberts that he had evolved on the issue of gay marriage and had come to personally support it . He seemed to suggest in the interview , however , that he felt the issue should be left up to the states .
`` I continue to believe that this is an issue that is going to be worked out at the local level because , historically , this has not been a federal issue , what 's recognized as marriage , '' the president said .
But at the inauguration , he used much broader language : '' Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law -- for if we are truly created equal , then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal , as well . ''
Even if the Department of Justice files a brief , it does n't have to get to the broad question . It could , for example , limit its arguments to whether the supporters of Prop 8 -- in the absence of California officials who have refused to defend it -- have a legal right to bring the case . Or , it could argue in favor of the relatively narrow opinion from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals .
In a conference call on Thursday , Olson urged the administration to step in .
`` We very much would like the United States , in the form of the solicitor general , to file a brief , '' he said .
Olson , who served as the solicitor general under the George W. Bush administration , added that the justices pay particular attention when briefs come in on behalf of the government .","There is one mystery left to solve before the Supreme Court gathers to hear a challenge to Proposition 8 in late March.

The arguments tackled more than just the ruling that struck down Prop 8 on narrow grounds specific to California's history on the issue of gay marriage.

The language was sweeping: ""The only substantive question in this case is whether the state is entitled to exclude gay men and lesbians from the institution of marriage and deprive their relationships -- their love -- of the respect, and dignity and social acceptance, that heterosexual marriages enjoy.

""This badge of inferiority, separateness and inequality must be extinguished. When it is, America will be closer to fulfilling the aspirations of its citizens,"" they wrote.

A month ago, supporters of Prop 8 filed their brief in the case. Read it HERE.

While the administration will certainly weigh in on the other gay marriage case in front of the court -- a challenge to the federal law, the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) -- it has never filed a brief in the Prop 8 case because it was not directly involved.

While the DOMA case challenges a federal law that denies federal benefits to same-sex couples who are legally married in their state, the Prop 8 case asks a much broader question: Is there a fundamental right to gay marriage under the Constitution.

Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. is not required to file a so-called ""friend of the court"" brief in the Prop 8 case, but sources said the administration is considering the possibility at the highest levels. If it chooses to weigh in, it has to do so by the last week of February.

In San Francisco Wednesday, President Obama told ABC News station KGO-TV, ""The solicitor general is still looking at this. I have to make sure I'm not interjecting myself too much into this process, particularly when we're not party to the case. I can tell you, though, that obviously my personal view is that I think that same-sex couples should have the same rights and be treated like everybody else.""

At the White House briefing on Thursday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said, ""I think you have seen no expression from the president on the constitutional or legal aspects of this. He has an opinion, obviously, about Proposition 8 as policy, but we have no comment and nothing to say at this point about an issue that is properly looked at as a legal and constitutional matter over at the Department of Justice.""

Back in May, the president told ABC News' Robin Roberts that he had evolved on the issue of gay marriage and had come to personally support it. He seemed to suggest in the interview, however, that he felt the issue should be left up to the states.

""I continue to believe that this is an issue that is going to be worked out at the local level because, historically, this has not been a federal issue, what's recognized as marriage,"" the president said.

But at the inauguration, he used much broader language:""Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law -- for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal, as well.""

Even if the Department of Justice files a brief, it doesn't have to get to the broad question. It could, for example, limit its arguments to whether the supporters of Prop 8 -- in the absence of California officials who have refused to defend it -- have a legal right to bring the case. Or, it could argue in favor of the relatively narrow opinion from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

In a conference call on Thursday, Olson urged the administration to step in.

""We very much would like the United States, in the form of the solicitor general, to file a brief,"" he said.

Olson, who served as the solicitor general under the George W. Bush administration, added that the justices pay particular attention when briefs come in on behalf of the government.",www.abcnews.go.com,left,ABjaOAGxXGbupLv7

According to Erica Green , Katie Benner , and Robert Pear at the Times , Trump ’ s Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) is considering an interpretation of Title IX , the federal civil rights law that bans sex discrimination in federally funded schools , that “ would define sex as either male or female , unchangeable , and determined by the genitals that a person is born with. ” ( This would defy the scientific and medical evidence embraced by major organizations like the American Medical Association and American Psychiatric Association . )
HHS is the primary agency working on the draft proposal , but other agencies , including the departments of Education , Justice , and Labor , are expected to adopt it as well should the administration move forward with the change . It ’ s not clear when that will be , although the Times reported that HHS “ is preparing to formally present the new definition to the Justice Department before the end of the year . ”
The proposal would effectively erase protections for trans people , who identify with a gender different from the one assigned to them at birth , from federal civil rights laws — ensuring that the laws do not prohibit discrimination against trans people in any setting , including the workplace , housing , schools , and health care .
HHS has refused to comment on “ alleged leaked documents , ” CNN reported . Civil rights groups and LGBTQ advocacy organizations , meanwhile , have suggested that they will take the administration to court should it move forward with the change .
The move would be far from the first time that the Trump administration has taken action that hurts LGBTQ people . For much of the past couple of years , the administration has been mired in court battles over its attempts to ban transgender people from the military after the Obama administration lifted the original ban . And different parts of the Trump administration have already taken steps to prevent federal civil rights protections from applying to trans and gay people .
The anti-LGBTQ agenda stands in sharp contrast with Trump ’ s rhetoric on the campaign trail . The then-candidate held up a Pride flag at a campaign event , and he vowed to work for “ L , G , B , T … Q ” people at the 2016 Republican convention . Instead , Trump ’ s administration has done a lot to undermine LGBTQ — and particularly trans — rights .
One reason the Trump administration ’ s latest proposal is even possible : Under federal and most states ’ laws , discrimination against LGBTQ people , based on sexual orientation and gender identity , is not explicitly prohibited . The exclusion of LGBTQ people is a big hole in civil rights laws , which generally ban discrimination based on race , sex , and religion , among other protected categories .
This means that it ’ s not explicitly illegal for someone to be fired from a job , evicted from a home , or kicked out of a business just because an employer , landlord , or business owner doesn ’ t approve of the person ’ s sexual orientation or gender identity .
But civil rights advocates have long argued that federal law should already shield LGBTQ people from discrimination because , they say , bans on discrimination on the basis of sex should also bar discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity .
According to advocates , discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity is fundamentally rooted in prohibited sex-based expectations . For example , if someone discriminates against a gay man , that ’ s largely based on the expectation that a man should only love or have sex with a woman — a belief built on the idea of what a person of a certain sex should be like .
Similarly , if someone discriminates against a trans woman , that ’ s largely based on the expectation that a person designated male at birth should identify as a man — again , a belief built on the idea of what a person of a certain sex assigned at birth should be like .
On the other side , opponents argue that LGBTQ nondiscrimination protections aren ’ t included in existing federal civil rights laws , because the authors of federal civil rights laws never believed or intended that bans on sex discrimination also ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity . ( This is the Trump administration ’ s position . )
LGBTQ advocates , citing legal precedent , say that what the original laws ’ authors believe or intended is irrelevant . Joshua Block , an attorney with the ACLU LGBT and HIV Project , cited a 1998 Supreme Court case , Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services Inc. , in which the Court unanimously agreed that bans on sex discrimination prohibit same-sex sexual harassment . Sexual harassment between people of the same sex was not something the authors of federal civil rights laws considered , but it ’ s something , the Supreme Court said , that a plain reading of the law protects .
“ Oncale says that ’ s irrelevant whether [ Congress ] contemplated it , ” Block previously told me . “ This is literal sex discrimination . Whether or not that ’ s what Congress was focused on doesn ’ t make it any less a type of discrimination covered by the statute . ”
The Obama administration generally embraced this argument for trans people , interpreting federal civil rights protections — including those that ban discrimination in the workplace , housing , education , and health care — to apply to trans people , although not gay people . Most controversially , the administration took this to apply to school bathrooms and locker rooms , releasing a guidance that asked federally funded schools to let trans students use the facility that corresponded with their gender identity instead of the gender assigned to them at birth .
Several courts have also accepted this interpretation of federal law , though the US Supreme Court has yet to validate it .
The Trump administration ’ s move , however , would declare that federal sex discrimination bans do not cover trans people . This would not only flip the Obama administration ’ s move to protect trans people but would also attempt to apply the anti-trans interpretation across the entire federal government from this point forward . If allowed by the courts , that would ensure that future implementation of federal civil rights laws leaves trans people behind .
It would , however , be far from the first anti-LGBTQ step the Trump administration has taken .
The Trump administration has adopted a host of anti-LGBTQ actions over much of the past couple of years . Here are some of the major examples :
The administration ’ s anti-LGBTQ agenda even extends to more minor issues , such as Trump ’ s refusal to acknowledge LGBTQ Pride Month .
All of the moves amount to a comprehensive agenda — one that , short of actual legislation , has taken nearly every step possible to undermine the rights of LGBTQ people .
On the campaign trail , Trump said he would be different — the first Republican president to embrace LGBTQ people . He posed with the Pride flag and acknowledged “ L , G , B , T … Q ” people . He initially defended the right of Caitlyn Jenner , a transgender woman , to use the bathroom that aligns with her gender identity . He tweeted , in reference to a mass shooting at a gay club in Orlando , Florida , “ Thank you to the LGBT community ! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs . ”
There were warning signs , though . Trump had surrounded himself with people , like Pence and Sessions , who have long histories of opposition to LGBTQ people . And when the Obama administration put out a guidance protecting trans people in federally funded schools ( including in bathrooms and locker rooms ) , Trump vowed to do away with the guidance .
So the bulk of LGBTQ advocates never fell for the nice-sounding rhetoric .
As president , Trump has proven the skepticism right , establishing the types of policies one would expect from a typical anti-LGBTQ Republican president . Maybe that reflects his own opinions . Or maybe it reflects the views of the people he ’ s surrounded himself with in his administration .
Whatever the cause , the result is Trump ’ s presidency and administration have now adopted a broad anti-LGBTQ agenda — one that has gone after LGBTQ workers , students , troops , and patients .

“ People debate , ‘ Does he personally like or dislike LGBT people ? ’ That ’ s irrelevant , ” James Esseks , director of the ACLU ’ s LGBT and HIV Project , previously told me , reflecting on the administration ’ s first year . “ He has put in place people who have firmly anti-LGBT agendas , and he ’ s not just enabled but endorsed those agendas himself . He ’ s been a train wreck for LGBT people nationwide . ”

archived recording We ’ re coming on the air because of a major civil rights decision out of the United States Supreme Court .
From The New York Times , I ’ m Michael Barbaro . This is “ The Daily . ”
archived recording The decision now is clear from the Supreme Court —
archived recording — they have issued a ruling that now bans discrimination by employers against transgender individuals and gay individuals . crowd chanting Trans lives matter ! Trans lives matter ! Trans lives matter !
Adam Liptak on the surprise majority that decided the case . It ’ s Tuesday , June 16 . Adam , tell us about this ruling on Monday .
The Supreme Court issued a huge ruling , a very consequential ruling . It said that all across the nation , it ’ s no longer permissible for employers to fire people simply for being gay or transgender . Now , you might think that ’ s already the state of the world . But in 27 states , there ’ s no federal protection for gay and transgender workers . Gay people have a constitutional right to get married . They have since 2015 . They can get married on a Monday morning , and when their employer found out about it Monday afternoon , they could be fired without consequence , simply for being gay . Until Monday ’ s ruling from the Supreme Court .
So in the national debate over the rights for gay and transgender people , this was a kind of untouched area — employment .
Right , it ’ s sort of surprising . I mean , most people I think , think it ’ s unlawful to discriminate against them for being gay or transgender . But until this Supreme Court ruling on Monday , people were without protection in about half the nation .
And Adam , remind us of the specific cases that are involved in this ruling . I know we ’ ve talked about them in the past on the show .
Yeah , so there are actually three separate cases , two of them involving gay men , one involving a transgender woman . The cases involving gay men were a government worker in Georgia and a skydiving instructor , both of whom alleged in their lawsuits that they ’ d been fired for being gay . And the third was a transgender woman named Aimee Stephens , who , Michael , your listeners may remember , because —
— you had a conversation with her and she described how , when she announced she was going to assume the gender identity that she believed was hers , the reaction of the funeral home for whom she worked was to fire her .
Right , this letter that she had spent years composing in her head and on paper that told her friends and her colleagues and her boss who she was , was actually what ended up getting her fired .
And , Adam , what was the central legal question posed in these three different cases ?
The question in the case is whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 — a landmark piece of civil rights legislation which prohibits discrimination based on race , religion , ethnicity , and sex — applies to sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination . And drilling down just a little bit more , the key question is whether the phrase “ discrimination because of sex ” covers sexual orientation and gender identity .
Right , and as I recall from talking about these oral arguments with you many months ago , the case very much rested , not just on what the entire court thought of the phrase “ because of sex ” and what it meant , but specifically what the conservative justices on the court , who are now in the majority — what they thought that that phrase meant .
That ’ s right . I mean , you have a court where the four more liberal votes are pretty much locked in . You know what they ’ re going to do , and they have to pick up a conservative vote . And the question with this court was , the conservative vote they would ordinarily be sure of picking up was that of Justice Anthony Kennedy , who wrote all four of the major gay rights decisions before this one . But he retired in 2018 , replaced by Justice Brett Kavanaugh . And so the court has a five justice conservative majority . And for the liberals to win , they ’ d have to pick off at least one of them .
Oh , yeah , in fact they got two , Justice Gorsuch , President Trump ’ s first appointee , and they also picked up Chief Justice John G. Roberts . So you got a 6-3 decision in the end . And , Michael , just to put that in context , this is a very conservative court . This is a court that gay rights advocates were terrified of . So to get a 6-3 victory from this court on a consequential , stunning , vastly important decision is really something .
So let ’ s talk about these two conservative justices who sided with the liberal justices in this case .
Well , the key justice is Justice Gorsuch . He writes the majority opinion . He ’ s the only one whose language we have in front of us and whose reasoning we know for certain . And he says it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex . Consider , for example , an employer with two employees , both of whom are attracted to men . The two individuals are , to the employer ’ s mind , materially identical in all respects , except that one is a man and the other a woman . If the employer fires the male employee for no reason other than the fact he is attracted to men , the employer discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female colleague .
So Gorsuch is arguing , you can ’ t divorce discrimination based on sexual identity , sexual orientation , from gender , and perhaps cultural expectations of gender .
That ’ s right . He says , listen , it may not be the only factor , but it ’ s a factor and that ’ s good enough for this law .
Right , and therefore , by his logic , that word , that phrase , “ because of sex ” in 1964 , clearly applies to gay and transgender people today .
And so what explanation do the other conservative justices who did not join Gorsuch in the majority give for breaking with him , and with Roberts , if Gorsuch and Roberts found a pretty conservative justification for extending these rights to gay and transgender people ?
So there are two separate dissents , but the theme that runs through both of them , Michael , is that it ’ s just not a natural way to read this set of words . That in 1964 , nobody thought that they were prohibiting discrimination against gay people and transgender people . And Justice Kavanaugh in his dissent says , even today , when you ask people what “ because of sex ” means to them , they will not typically say oh , that means because of sexual orientation , because of gender identity . Then Alito and Thomas , but not Kavanaugh , go on to talk about what they view as the very pernicious consequences of the majority decision , which they say will have an impact on restrooms and locker rooms and college sports and maybe professional sports and religious employers and freedom of speech . Justice Alito even says it might prohibit people from using anything other than the preferred pronouns of the people to whom they talk .
Right , but of course in the end , those three justices were outvoted . And two of their conservative allies went in the other direction . And I have to say , and I don ’ t know if this is the case for you , it seems surprising that the majority opinion in this landmark gay and transgender rights case was written by a conservative member of the court .
Oh , yeah . No , I think it ’ s a big surprise to me , big surprise to gay rights advocates , big surprise to the L.G.B.T . community . I will say this , Michael , that if you ’ d asked me in September what the outcome of this case was going to be , I would have said it ’ s classic 5-4 , conservatives against liberals .
You said that on our show . You said this was —
Right , but once it was argued , once we saw Gorsuch struggling with this textual question at the argument in September , I started to think that there was a live possibility it would be 5-4 , the liberals plus Gorsuch . And I guess the chief justice came along for the ride .
But that makes me wonder , does a ruling like this , and the composition of the majority , does that make you conclude that ultimately , we don ’ t really know this relatively new Supreme Court , this conservative majority court , as well as perhaps , everyone thinks that they do ?
That ’ s a really important point . People on the left are very unhappy that President Trump got to appoint two people to the Supreme Court . But those two people don ’ t vote together all that often . Overall , their voting will be conservative . But they ’ re individual people with individual jurisprudential commitments , and they will from time to time surprise you as Justice Gorsuch surprised us in this one .
We ’ ll be right back . Adam , how is this ruling being received by those who are champions of religious liberty ? Because I have to imagine that they are not looking favorably on a ruling that says every employer , including employers run by people whose religion says that being homosexual is wrong , would welcome this ruling .
Sure , they ’ re nervous about this ruling . And in dissent , Justice Alito said they ’ re right to be nervous , that this ruling can make religious people and religious employers on the hook for employment discrimination if they just follow the dictates of their faith . Justice Gorsuch , who is ordinarily very sympathetic to those kinds of claims of religion said , listen , that ’ s not this case . We ’ ll deal with that case down the line . But he did say , let me tell you , first of all , Title VII itself has an exemption for religious employers . There are other laws and constitutional provisions which can protect religious people and religious employers . So his basic answer is , we ’ ll get back to you on that .
Hm , so this ruling may leave open the possibility that an employer could bring future cases that could make it all the way up to the Supreme Court challenging this ruling on the grounds of religious liberty , saying this ruling infringes on my right to practice my religion the way I see fit .
Yeah , clashes between religious employers and their employees are commonplace , and we ’ re waiting , even in this term , for a decision on whether employment discrimination laws apply to Catholic school teachers . So that clash is something that ’ s very much on the front burner at the court , but we don ’ t have an answer yet .
Adam , you ’ ve been covering the Supreme Court for The Times for more than a decade . And you have watched this debate over L.G.B.T.Q . rights play out before the justices on many occasions . Where does this decision stack up in that history of the decisions that they have made ?
Well , for gay rights , it easily ranks with the top three . It ranks with the decisions in which the court struck down a Texas law making gay sex a crime . It stands with the decision establishing a constitutional right to same sex marriage . And now for gay people , we have this enormously consequential decision protecting them from employment discrimination . And let ’ s not forget , for transgender people , we have the first major transgender rights case from the Supreme Court ever .
So by definition , this is a historic case when it comes to rights .
Some historic cases are symbolic only . This historic case will have a real-world impact for lots and lots of people .
It ’ s interesting that this decision comes three and a half years into an administration , the Trump administration , that has repeatedly taken actions to restrict the rights of transgender Americans , in particular . You know , banning them from serving in the military , telling the military to stop paying for gender confirmation surgery . And just about a week ago , narrowing the definition of sex discrimination in the Affordable Care Act to omit protections for transgender people . So how does Monday ’ s decision affect those ? Because after all , the United States government is a major employer , right ?
Yeah , so as an employer , it ’ s subject to Title VII like other kinds of employers . When it ’ s talking about health care , when it ’ s talking about the military , those are different statutes , and whether it has the power or not to disadvantage transgender people is an open question . This decision of course , gives you some sense that challenges to Trump administration actions would meet with positive reception at the court . But they ’ re different statutes in different settings , and the president gets a lot of deference when it ’ s the military who ’ s involved . We do have a quick sense that President Trump is prepared to accept the Supreme Court ’ s decision on Monday . He was asked about it at a press availability and he said , they ruled , and we live with their decision , a very powerful decision .
Speaking of that kind of atmospheric change , I have noticed that in the protests that we ’ ve been seeing all over the United States for the past few weeks , that in addition to protesting against racism , demonstrators have taken up the issue of trans rights and calling for the protection of black trans people , for example .
Yeah , so society is moving very fast on these issues . The protests reflect that . One thing that struck me that also reflects it is that more than 200 major corporations filed briefs in these cases saying , please subject us to these laws , please make it possible to sue us . Because the commitment among very large parts of society to equality for black people , gay people , trans people is moving quite quickly in the direction of equality . And the Supreme Court , which is seldom very far out of step with the American public , as reflected in this decision , seems to agree .
Adam , what has been the response from the plaintiffs in this case ? I remember speaking with Aimee Stephens after the oral arguments , and she had some real doubts about whether the court was going to ultimately rule in her favor .
Yeah , that ’ s right , Michael . There are three plaintiffs in the three cases , two of them have sadly died , including Aimee Stephens , who died just a few weeks ago . So she didn ’ t see the result of her lawsuit . But she did sketch out some thoughts in anticipation that the court might rule in her favor . So she wrote these words . “ Firing me because I ’ m transgender was discrimination , plain and simple . And I am glad the court recognized that what happened to me is wrong and illegal . I am thankful that the court said my transgender siblings and I have a place in our laws . It made me feel safer and more included in society . ”
They asked me a question . And that question was , are you willing to see this through to the end ? And I told them then that I was raised on a farm , that I was used to hard work , and that I didn ’ t give up so easily . They ’ ve had people , I guess , in the past , who started this process , and it can get to you to the point that you just want it to be over . And you say well , I ’ m done . I ’ m not going any further . Or perhaps they try to settle out of court . I had in my mind what I needed to do , and it wasn ’ t to really settle out of court . It wasn ’ t to just give up and walk away . And that yes , I would see this to the end .
We ’ ll be right back . Here ’ s what else you need to know today .

Oh, yeah. No, I think it’s a big surprise to me, big surprise to gay rights advocates, big surprise to the L.G.B.T. community. I will say this, Michael, that if you’d asked me in September what the outcome of this case was going to be, I would have said it’s classic 5-4, conservatives against liberals.

michael barbaro

You said that on our show. You said this was —

adam liptak

Right, but once it was argued, once we saw Gorsuch struggling with this textual question at the argument in September, I started to think that there was a live possibility it would be 5-4, the liberals plus Gorsuch. And I guess the chief justice came along for the ride.

But they’re individual people with individual jurisprudential commitments, and they will from time to time surprise you as Justice Gorsuch surprised us in this one.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Adam, how is this ruling being received by those who are champions of religious liberty? Because I have to imagine that they are not looking favorably on a ruling that says every employer, including employers run by people whose religion says that being homosexual is wrong, would welcome this ruling.

adam liptak

Sure, they’re nervous about this ruling. And in dissent, Justice Alito said they’re right to be nervous, that this ruling can make religious people and religious employers on the hook for employment discrimination if they just follow the dictates of their faith. Justice Gorsuch, who is ordinarily very sympathetic to those kinds of claims of religion said, listen, that’s not this case. We’ll deal with that case down the line. But he did say, let me tell you, first of all, Title VII itself has an exemption for religious employers. There are other laws and constitutional provisions which can protect religious people and religious employers. So his basic answer is, we’ll get back to you on that.

michael barbaro

Hm, so this ruling may leave open the possibility that an employer could bring future cases that could make it all the way up to the Supreme Court challenging this ruling on the grounds of religious liberty, saying this ruling infringes on my right to practice my religion the way I see fit.

adam liptak

Yeah, clashes between religious employers and their employees are commonplace, and we’re waiting, even in this term, for a decision on whether employment discrimination laws apply to Catholic school teachers. So that clash is something that’s very much on the front burner at the court, but we don’t have an answer yet.

michael barbaro

Adam, you’ve been covering the Supreme Court for The Times for more than a decade. And you have watched this debate over L.G.B.T.Q. rights play out before the justices on many occasions. Where does this decision stack up in that history of the decisions that they have made?

adam liptak

Well, for gay rights, it easily ranks with the top three. It ranks with the decisions in which the court struck down a Texas law making gay sex a crime. It stands with the decision establishing a constitutional right to same sex marriage. And now for gay people, we have this enormously consequential decision protecting them from employment discrimination. And let’s not forget, for transgender people, we have the first major transgender rights case from the Supreme Court ever.

michael barbaro

So by definition, this is a historic case when it comes to rights.

adam liptak

Some historic cases are symbolic only. This historic case will have a real-world impact for lots and lots of people.

michael barbaro

It’s interesting that this decision comes three and a half years into an administration, the Trump administration, that has repeatedly taken actions to restrict the rights of transgender Americans, in particular. You know, banning them from serving in the military, telling the military to stop paying for gender confirmation surgery. And just about a week ago, narrowing the definition of sex discrimination in the Affordable Care Act to omit protections for transgender people. So how does Monday’s decision affect those? Because after all, the United States government is a major employer, right?

adam liptak

Yeah, so as an employer, it’s subject to Title VII like other kinds of employers. When it’s talking about health care, when it’s talking about the military, those are different statutes, and whether it has the power or not to disadvantage transgender people is an open question. This decision of course, gives you some sense that challenges to Trump administration actions would meet with positive reception at the court. But they’re different statutes in different settings, and the president gets a lot of deference when it’s the military who’s involved. We do have a quick sense that President Trump is prepared to accept the Supreme Court’s decision on Monday. He was asked about it at a press availability and he said, they ruled, and we live with their decision, a very powerful decision.

michael barbaro

Speaking of that kind of atmospheric change, I have noticed that in the protests that we’ve been seeing all over the United States for the past few weeks, that in addition to protesting against racism, demonstrators have taken up the issue of trans rights and calling for the protection of black trans people, for example.

adam liptak

Yeah, so society is moving very fast on these issues. The protests reflect that. One thing that struck me that also reflects it is that more than 200 major corporations filed briefs in these cases saying, please subject us to these laws, please make it possible to sue us. Because the commitment among very large parts of society to equality for black people, gay people, trans people is moving quite quickly in the direction of equality. And the Supreme Court, which is seldom very far out of step with the American public, as reflected in this decision, seems to agree.

michael barbaro

Adam, what has been the response from the plaintiffs in this case? I remember speaking with Aimee Stephens after the oral arguments, and she had some real doubts about whether the court was going to ultimately rule in her favor.

adam liptak

Yeah, that’s right, Michael. There are three plaintiffs in the three cases, two of them have sadly died, including Aimee Stephens, who died just a few weeks ago. So she didn’t see the result of her lawsuit. But she did sketch out some thoughts in anticipation that the court might rule in her favor. So she wrote these words. “Firing me because I’m transgender was discrimination, plain and simple. And I am glad the court recognized that what happened to me is wrong and illegal. I am thankful that the court said my transgender siblings and I have a place in our laws. It made me feel safer and more included in society.”

michael barbaro

Thank you, Adam.

adam liptak

Thank you, Michael.

aimee stephens

They asked me a question. And that question was, are you willing to see this through to the end? And I told them then that I was raised on a farm, that I was used to hard work, and that I didn’t give up so easily. They’ve had people, I guess, in the past, who started this process, and it can get to you to the point that you just want it to be over. And you say well, I’m done. I’m not going any further. Or perhaps they try to settle out of court. I had in my mind what I needed to do, and it wasn’t to really settle out of court. It wasn’t to just give up and walk away. And that yes, I would see this to the end.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (dermot shea) Good afternoon, everyone. It’s been a tough few weeks for the N.Y.P.D., for the city, really, for the whole country.

michael barbaro

In a major reform by the nation’s largest police force, New York City is disbanding its anti-crime unit, a team of 600 officers who patrol the city in plain clothes that has been involved in some of the city’s most notorious police shootings.

archived recording (dermot shea) Make no mistake, this is a seismic shift in the culture of how the N.Y.P.D. polices this great city. It will be felt immediately in the communities that we protect.

michael barbaro

The decision makes the N.Y.P.D. one of the first police departments in the country to begin defunding and dismantling its operations in the wake of nationwide protests.

archived recording (dermot shea) We can do it better. We can do it smarter. And we will.

We see it because of judges like Margaret Marshall, the former Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, who wrote the first decision legalizing same-sex marriage almost 12 years ago. A native of South Africa and a former anti-Apartheid activist, Marshall has said she had given no thought to the issue before the case came to her court — but she knew discrimination when she saw it.

We see it because of civil rights lawyers like Mary Bonauto, the legal architect of the marriage cases who argued that Massachusetts case and earlier this year stood before the Supreme Court seeking national recognition of those same rights in Obergefell, and because of her colleagues at Boston’s Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, who worked tirelessly for more than 30 years to fight government discrimination against LGBT Americans in areas like criminal prosecution, adoption, medical treatment, and marriage.

We see it because of people like Jim Obergefell — who married his husband John on the tarmac at the Baltimore airport in 2013. Months later, John lost his fight with ALS. Years later, Jim took his fight to be listed on John’s death certificate in their native Ohio all the way to the Supreme Court — and won.

In America, because of our Constitution, senseless discrimination – discrimination that demeans the worth of our neighbors and our coworkers and our family members – cannot survive when it is brought out of the darkness. It has never been easy for us to shine the light on such discrimination. But when we see it, when we stop looking away and finally acknowledge it, it is never long before we formally recognize what is compelled by our Constitution. We recognize what has always been there: equality and dignity under the law, for all Americans, no matter who they are.

When looking at this equal marriage decision, Chief Justice John Roberts asserts that the Constitution “had nothing to do with it.” He’s wrong. Our Constitution had everything to do with it — with the liberty of two adults to have their love treated the same as that of any other couple. And it is because of the tireless work of jurists, lawyers, husbands like Jim Obergefell, and countless other LGBT Americans who stepped forward to speak out, that our nation will no longer look away from what our Constitution requires.

It’s the culture war no one wants — except the base.

Obama’s reelection prospects are bound up in the hope that he can convince people he actually is digging the country out of a hole, which means keeping the attention on those efforts and how deep the hole was. For Romney, with polls that consistently show him climbing when the focus is on the election but dipping when it goes elsewhere, the political path through November is clear.

( Also on POLITICO: 10 other food boycotts)

But in an election in which stoking the base is crucial for both candidates and gay marriage is a flashpoint for activists on both sides, that’s what the candidates are getting anyway.

Obama, already in favor of gay marriage, has little to gain by weighing in against a private company that operates primarily in red states on an issue that has already inflamed social conservatives. He has treaded lightly on the issue on the campaign trail, touting the repeal of the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy but avoided new calls for legalizing gay marriage since announcing he supported it in May.

Several officials in Obama’s White House and campaign did not respond Friday to requests for comment about Chick-fil-A. And there’s reason for the president to keep the issues away from the center of his reelection campaign. Obama can’t afford to alienate religious conservatives in the black community or give blue-collar Democratic whites in Ohio and Virginia another reason to vote against him.

Romney favors a constitutional amendment forbidding gay marriage, but like nearly all traditional culture war issues, it’s a topic he avoids. And he’s no stranger to the chicken franchise: Back in May, in his commencement address to evangelical Liberty University, Romney praised Chick-fil-A founder Truett Cathy — whose son, Dan, sparked the latest controversy by saying gay marriage invites “God’s judgment.”

But he hasn’t said anything on the topic since. On Friday, speaking to reporters in Las Vegas, Romney said Chick-fil-A is among issues that “are not things that are part of my campaign.”

The candidate on Friday refused to weigh in on former rival Rick Santorum and celebrity Republicans Sarah Palin and Mike Huckabee bringing cameras with them as they dined on fast food and wouldn’t repeat his endorsement of the sandwiches. Lumped in with Republican attacks on Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, Romney said, “I’m not going to tell other people what to talk about.”

Capturing the line he’s walking, an adviser explained later that Romney “authentically loves” the fast-food chain but doesn’t need a distraction from his economic message.

Romney falls within the new mainstream Republican critique of Obama’s gay marriage evolution. When the president announced his support for the practice in May, the GOP criticism was muted. House Speaker John Boehner tried to pivot back to the economy while others mocked the president for the election-year change of heart. Romney asserted his opposition to gay marriage and tried to move on.

That’s a mistake, said Ralph Reed, the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, who argued that Romney has ground to gain not just with the social conservative base from jumping into the fray.

“ I can ’ t believe we have come this far , frankly , ” says Nowlin Haltom , a real estate agent in the Los Angeles suburb of Studio City . He married his partner of 15 years in New York two years ago and says he has been in this fight “ for a long time . ”
Meanwhile , Tim Wildmon , president of the American Family Association , says the Supreme Court is considering toying with thousands of years of human history . “ There is nothing in the history of the world culture that supports redefining marriage as an institution between a man and a man or a woman and a woman , ” he says .
Possible outcomes from Tuesday ’ s arguments range from the case being dismissed all the way up to a broad ruling on whether or not there is a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry , says Rebecca Brown , a constitutional law professor at the University of Southern California 's Gould School of law .
“ They ’ ve heard all the arguments , now they will go away and sort through them , ” she says . A decision is expected by early June .

“I can’t believe we have come this far, frankly,” says Nowlin Haltom, a real estate agent in the Los Angeles suburb of Studio City. He married his partner of 15 years in New York two years ago and says he has been in this fight “for a long time.”

Meanwhile, Tim Wildmon, president of the American Family Association, says the Supreme Court is considering toying with thousands of years of human history. “There is nothing in the history of the world culture that supports redefining marriage as an institution between a man and a man or a woman and a woman,” he says.

Possible outcomes from Tuesday’s arguments range from the case being dismissed all the way up to a broad ruling on whether or not there is a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry, says Rebecca Brown, a constitutional law professor at the University of Southern California's Gould School of law.

“They’ve heard all the arguments, now they will go away and sort through them,” she says. A decision is expected by early June.

lgbt_rights,Fox News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/06/12/southern-baptists-expected-to-address-boy-scouts-homosexuality-decision-at/,Southern Baptists condemn Boy Scouts over admission of gays  ,2013-06-12,,"The nation 's largest Protestant denomination stopped short of calling for its member churches to boycott the Boy Scouts , but voiced strong opposition to acceptance of gay scouts - with a top church leader predicting at the annual gathering of Southern Baptists that a `` mass exodus '' of youths from the program that has been a rite of passage for more than a century .
The move by the Southern Baptist Convention came at its annual , four-day meeting in Houston , and three weeks after the Boy Scouts of America voted to allow gay youth to join . With more than two-thirds of Boy Scout troops sponsored by religious organizations , and Baptists being the nation 's largest protestant denomination , the resolution could have a crippling effect on the Boy Scouts .
`` There will be a mass exodus over time , '' said Frank Page , president of the Southern Baptist Convention Executive Committee . “ Churches are finally going to have to come to realize – there is a point when you say , ‘ sorry , no more . ’ ''
The resolution did not call on churches to stop sponsoring troops , but urged ones that do to push to have the decision to admit gay scouts reversed . It seemed to be largely aimed at what church leaders believe is the inevitable inclusion of gay scout leaders .
“ We express our well-founded concern that the current executive leadership of the BSA , along with certain board members , may utilize this membership policy change as merely the first step toward future approval of homosexual leaders in the Scouts , ” the resolution said .
The Southern Baptist Convention claims to represent more than forty-five thousand churches and church-type missions as well as nearly 16 million members .
“ Over time we will see a dramatic drop in overall scouting numbers , '' added Page .

Mormons , Methodists and Catholics have all urged their churches to continue to sponsor Boy Scout troops in the wake of the policy change .","The nation's largest Protestant denomination stopped short of calling for its member churches to boycott the Boy Scouts, but voiced strong opposition to acceptance of gay scouts - with a top church leader predicting at the annual gathering of Southern Baptists that a ""mass exodus"" of youths from the program that has been a rite of passage for more than a century.

The move by the Southern Baptist Convention came at its annual, four-day meeting in Houston, and three weeks after the Boy Scouts of America voted to allow gay youth to join. With more than two-thirds of Boy Scout troops sponsored by religious organizations, and Baptists being the nation's largest protestant denomination, the resolution could have a crippling effect on the Boy Scouts.

""There will be a mass exodus over time,"" said Frank Page, president of the Southern Baptist Convention Executive Committee. “Churches are finally going to have to come to realize – there is a point when you say, ‘sorry, no more.’""

The resolution did not call on churches to stop sponsoring troops, but urged ones that do to push to have the decision to admit gay scouts reversed. It seemed to be largely aimed at what church leaders believe is the inevitable inclusion of gay scout leaders.

“We express our well-founded concern that the current executive leadership of the BSA, along with certain board members, may utilize this membership policy change as merely the first step toward future approval of homosexual leaders in the Scouts,” the resolution said.

The Southern Baptist Convention claims to represent more than forty-five thousand churches and church-type missions as well as nearly 16 million members.

“Over time we will see a dramatic drop in overall scouting numbers,"" added Page.

Familiarity with terminology can help gauge expectations -- thinking big or small
The justices are working separately in their chambers , trying to forge opinions
There are no hints and trying to predict an outcome is a slippery slope . But for those anxiously awaiting a Supreme Court decision on same-sex marriage -- arguably its biggest issue this term -- knowing potential scenarios is key .
Familiarity with legal terminology , like `` DIG '' or `` standing '' also can help prepare both sides to gauge expectations -- thinking really big or really small -- when rulings on two cases are issued this month .
This is especially true in the petition from California over a voter-approved ban on gays and lesbians marrying .
`` The court has several ways to decide this case -- from a very broad , sweeping conclusion with respect to the rights of our citizens in this country , to a narrower ruling that would be limited basically to California , '' attorney Theodore Olson told CNN .
He argued on behalf of homosexual couples before the high court in March .
The justices are working separately in their chambers , trying to forge opinions on same-sex marriage and more than two dozen other cases .
Ten states now allow gays and lesbians to legally wed : Connecticut , Iowa , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , New York , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington , as well as the District of Columbia . Delaware and Minnesota 's recently passed laws take effect this summer .
It is estimated about 120,000 legally married homosexual couples live in the United States .
There is division within the ranks of both sides about whether the high court will or even should issue a sea-change ruling on the constitutional `` equal protection '' question .
Some activists and politicians -- even some justices -- think the elected branches may be in a better position to drive the same-sex marriage issue , not the courts .
`` For those hoping the Supreme Court will say there is a broad right for same-sex couples to be married , they 're likely to be disappointed , '' said Thomas Goldstein , SCOTUSblog.com publisher and a Washington lawyer .
`` In the end , probably the wording of the decision will give more momentum to those states that are recognizing those rights but it wo n't force them to do so . ''
One involves an appeal of the Defense of Marriage Act , which was approved by Congress in 1996 and defines marriage as that between a man and a women . It says in part that legally married same-sex couples can not enjoy the range of financial and other benefits enjoyed by heterosexual married couples .
Edie Windsor , an 84-year-old New York woman , is the key plaintiff . She was forced to pay extra estate taxes when her longtime spouse , Thea Spyer , died .
The court has set itself up to `` punt '' on both Proposition 8 and defense of marriage , avoiding for now consideration of the constitutional questions .
This legal letdown could turn on `` standing , '' or the legal authority or eligibility to make the case .
California 's governor has refused to defend Proposition 8 in court , leaving a coalition of private groups to step in before the courts .
Can they establish a legitimate `` harm '' to satisfy court scrutiny ?
The justices could also `` DIG '' it -- or have the case `` dismissed as improvidently granted . '' Basically , the justices would be saying they should not have taken the appeal in the first place .
`` If the issue is letting the states experiment and letting the society have more time to figure out its direction , why is taking a case now the answer ? '' Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked at March oral arguments .
Some of her conservative colleagues seemed to agree as well .
Whether on standing or `` DIG '' grounds , the differences are important .
`` 'Digging '' would likely mean lower court rulings striking down Proposition 8 would hold , allowing California gay and lesbian couples to marry if they choose . How quickly that would happen is unclear if further legal challenges are filed .
But a `` standing '' ruling would likely nullify everything , perhaps forcing both sides to start all over again in the lower courts , and limiting the reach of gay marriage to perhaps only a few California counties .
Another likely statewide referendum next year could preempt the legal battles and finally settle the matter , at least in that state .
Recent polls show growing support for same-sex marriage in California , a trend reflected nationwide .
So , the court really has four options to rule on Proposition 8 and same-sex marriage supporters believe in each scenario , they would win .
Lawyers for the two couples at the center of the fight are cautiously optimistic , with the emphasis on `` cautiously . ''
`` Trying to read too much into to those questions is a risky proposition , '' attorney David Boies told CNN . `` The court is exploring all four of these options . ''
But backers of Proposition 8 think the court will want to stay of the political fight , and allow the measure to stand , at least for now .
`` A victory for us means to issue returns to the people , to the legislatures , and to the elected representatives -- where this debate belongs , '' said Charles Cooper , the lawyer who argued at the Supreme Court for Proposition 8 .
The federal law , DOMA , has its own sticky procedural questions .
President Barack Obama now believes the federal law is unconstitutional , and has refused to defend it in court .
Traditionally that role would fall to the solicitor general 's office . That executive refusal raised the question of whether any party could now rightfully step in and defend the law -- the idea being in any such fight you need opposing sides with a valid stake in the outcome .
Congressional Republicans , operating officially as the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives , took over the role normally filled by the Justice Department .
`` Without the House 's participation , '' said attorney Paul Clement , representing House leaders , `` it is hard to see how there is any case or controversy here at all . Both Ms. Windsor and the executive [ branch ] agree that DOMA is unconstitutional and that Ms. Windsor was entitled to a [ tax ] refund . And the lower courts granted them all the relief they requested . Only the House 's intervention provides the adverseness that Article III [ federal court jurisdiction ] demands . ''
The court could dismiss that case on standing grounds , but most legal analysts see a more substantive ruling on the merits .
Confusing enough ? Legal experts , government and private lawyers , and the blogosphere have been waging a war of words in recent months , expressing varying amounts of certainty of what the court will do when deciding those questions .
But inside the court , there are no hints . It is familiar refrain among its nine members over the Washington parlor game of guessing the outcomes : `` At the Supreme Court , those who know , do n't talk . And those who talk , do n't know . ''","Story highlights No hints how justices might rule in two big cases this month

'DIG' or 'standing'

It is estimated about 120,000 legally married homosexual couples live in the United States.

There is division within the ranks of both sides about whether the high court will or even should issue a sea-change ruling on the constitutional ""equal protection"" question.

Some activists and politicians -- even some justices -- think the elected branches may be in a better position to drive the same-sex marriage issue, not the courts.

""For those hoping the Supreme Court will say there is a broad right for same-sex couples to be married, they're likely to be disappointed,"" said Thomas Goldstein, SCOTUSblog.com publisher and a Washington lawyer.

""In the end, probably the wording of the decision will give more momentum to those states that are recognizing those rights but it won't force them to do so.""

Two marriage cases are before the court:

One involves an appeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, which was approved by Congress in 1996 and defines marriage as that between a man and a women. It says in part that legally married same-sex couples cannot enjoy the range of financial and other benefits enjoyed by heterosexual married couples.

Edie Windsor, an 84-year-old New York woman, is the key plaintiff. She was forced to pay extra estate taxes when her longtime spouse, Thea Spyer, died.

The second involves the California ban or Proposition 8.

The court has set itself up to ""punt"" on both Proposition 8 and defense of marriage, avoiding for now consideration of the constitutional questions.

This legal letdown could turn on ""standing,"" or the legal authority or eligibility to make the case.

California's governor has refused to defend Proposition 8 in court, leaving a coalition of private groups to step in before the courts.

Can they establish a legitimate ""harm"" to satisfy court scrutiny?

The justices could also ""DIG"" it -- or have the case ""dismissed as improvidently granted."" Basically, the justices would be saying they should not have taken the appeal in the first place.

""If the issue is letting the states experiment and letting the society have more time to figure out its direction, why is taking a case now the answer?"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked at March oral arguments.

Some of her conservative colleagues seemed to agree as well.

Whether on standing or ""DIG"" grounds, the differences are important.

""'Digging"" would likely mean lower court rulings striking down Proposition 8 would hold, allowing California gay and lesbian couples to marry if they choose. How quickly that would happen is unclear if further legal challenges are filed.

But a ""standing"" ruling would likely nullify everything, perhaps forcing both sides to start all over again in the lower courts, and limiting the reach of gay marriage to perhaps only a few California counties.

Multiple options for ruling

Another likely statewide referendum next year could preempt the legal battles and finally settle the matter, at least in that state.

Recent polls show growing support for same-sex marriage in California, a trend reflected nationwide.

So, the court really has four options to rule on Proposition 8 and same-sex marriage supporters believe in each scenario, they would win.

Lawyers for the two couples at the center of the fight are cautiously optimistic, with the emphasis on ""cautiously.""

""Trying to read too much into to those questions is a risky proposition,"" attorney David Boies told CNN. ""The court is exploring all four of these options.""

But backers of Proposition 8 think the court will want to stay of the political fight, and allow the measure to stand, at least for now.

""A victory for us means to issue returns to the people, to the legislatures, and to the elected representatives -- where this debate belongs,"" said Charles Cooper, the lawyer who argued at the Supreme Court for Proposition 8.

The federal law, DOMA, has its own sticky procedural questions.

President Barack Obama now believes the federal law is unconstitutional, and has refused to defend it in court.

Traditionally that role would fall to the solicitor general's office. That executive refusal raised the question of whether any party could now rightfully step in and defend the law -- the idea being in any such fight you need opposing sides with a valid stake in the outcome.

Congressional Republicans, operating officially as the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives, took over the role normally filled by the Justice Department.

""Without the House's participation,"" said attorney Paul Clement, representing House leaders, ""it is hard to see how there is any case or controversy here at all. Both Ms. Windsor and the executive [branch] agree that DOMA is unconstitutional and that Ms. Windsor was entitled to a [tax] refund. And the lower courts granted them all the relief they requested. Only the House's intervention provides the adverseness that Article III [federal court jurisdiction] demands.""

War of words

The court could dismiss that case on standing grounds, but most legal analysts see a more substantive ruling on the merits.

Confusing enough? Legal experts, government and private lawyers, and the blogosphere have been waging a war of words in recent months, expressing varying amounts of certainty of what the court will do when deciding those questions.

But inside the court, there are no hints. It is familiar refrain among its nine members over the Washington parlor game of guessing the outcomes: ""At the Supreme Court, those who know, don't talk. And those who talk, don't know.""",www.cnn.com,left,uXpUptNHq0PxXOab

They cause cosmetic changes that are difficult to reverse , including body fat redistribution and voice changes . For this reason , medical guidelines recommend that they generally not be provided until age 16 , or at the earliest , 14 . Though the evidence is still emerging , all existing data suggests that access to estrogen or testosterone is associated with improved mental health for these kids .
There has been growing attention to the idea that some youth who start estrogen or testosterone will later choose to stop it . That appears to be rare . Our group from Harvard Medical School recently published a case of an adolescent who started estrogen and chose to stop . That young person told us they did not regret the trial of estrogen and that it helped them to better understand their gender identity , even though they now have some cosmetic changes to their body ( mostly body fat and hair redistribution ) . In other cases , kids “ de-transition ” because their communities place so much pressure on them to be cisgender that they feel they have no choice .
While conservatives highlight that youth may later regret the physical changes from estrogen or testosterone , the doctors who take care of these patients know it is far more likely that a young transgender person will have regrets when physicians refuse to provide the medical care to pause the puberty that is actively distressing them .
The potential benefits of providing gender-affirmative care typically outweigh the minor risks associated with treatment . These medications are administered only after thoughtful conversations between patient , family and physician . Medical interventions are not started without all three being on board and understanding the risks and benefits . Legislation that puts these decisions in the hands of the government instead of families and physicians is dangerous .
Conservatives also like to use phrases like “ sex change surgery ” to scare the general public . Under current medical guidelines , genital surgeries for transgender patients are never offered before adulthood . The only surgeries that are sometimes considered before the patient is an adult is the removal of breast tissue . It is something that requires careful evaluation before proceeding . Furthermore , youth who need this surgery are generally those who were not able to obtain puberty blockers , subsequently developed significant breast tissue , then had strong negative emotional reactions to their chest . Easier access to puberty blockers in the first place could eliminate the need for this kind of surgery .
State legislators need to educate themselves about these young people and their medical care before introducing legislation that will hurt them .

They cause cosmetic changes that are difficult to reverse, including body fat redistribution and voice changes. For this reason, medical guidelines recommend that they generally not be provided until age 16, or at the earliest, 14. Though the evidence is still emerging, all existing data suggests that access to estrogen or testosterone is associated with improved mental health for these kids.

There has been growing attention to the idea that some youth who start estrogen or testosterone will later choose to stop it. That appears to be rare. Our group from Harvard Medical School recently published a case of an adolescent who started estrogen and chose to stop. That young person told us they did not regret the trial of estrogen and that it helped them to better understand their gender identity, even though they now have some cosmetic changes to their body (mostly body fat and hair redistribution). In other cases, kids “de-transition” because their communities place so much pressure on them to be cisgender that they feel they have no choice.

While conservatives highlight that youth may later regret the physical changes from estrogen or testosterone, the doctors who take care of these patients know it is far more likely that a young transgender person will have regrets when physicians refuse to provide the medical care to pause the puberty that is actively distressing them.

The potential benefits of providing gender-affirmative care typically outweigh the minor risks associated with treatment. These medications are administered only after thoughtful conversations between patient, family and physician. Medical interventions are not started without all three being on board and understanding the risks and benefits. Legislation that puts these decisions in the hands of the government instead of families and physicians is dangerous.

Conservatives also like to use phrases like “sex change surgery” to scare the general public. Under current medical guidelines, genital surgeries for transgender patients are never offered before adulthood. The only surgeries that are sometimes considered before the patient is an adult is the removal of breast tissue. It is something that requires careful evaluation before proceeding. Furthermore, youth who need this surgery are generally those who were not able to obtain puberty blockers, subsequently developed significant breast tissue, then had strong negative emotional reactions to their chest. Easier access to puberty blockers in the first place could eliminate the need for this kind of surgery.

State legislators need to educate themselves about these young people and their medical care before introducing legislation that will hurt them. They need to reach out to physicians and professional medical societies for input. They need to talk to the researchers in this area, and most important, they need to bring in the transgender youth themselves. If their bodies are going to be legislated, they should have the opportunity to be heard by the legislators who would do this to them. The medical profession has made it clear: This kind of legislation is dangerous and should not become law.

lgbt_rights,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/31/8319415/indiana-religious-freedom-discrimination,Why a pro-same-sex-marriage law professor supports Indiana's religious freedom law,2015-03-31,"Dylan Matthews, Alexia Fernández Campbell, Tara Golshan, Li Zhou, Jen Kirby, Aja Romano","Indiana 's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) has provoked a firestorm of criticism from activists who fear that it could be invoked as a defense of discrimination against LGBT people . And on the other side , many have embraced the law for exactly the same reason . The Indiana religious right group Advance America praised the law , saying it would help ensure that `` Christian bakers , florists and photographers [ are not ] punished for refusing to participate in a homosexual marriage . ''
But religious liberty expert Douglas Laycock , a law professor at the University of Virginia , thinks this is all confused . RFRAs are n't about enshrining discrimination , he argues ; they 're about preventing discrimination against small , vulnerable religious groups . The point is n't to help homophobic bakers ; it 's to protect Muslim women against discrimination for wearing veils , or to ensure that Sikh men can wear turbans and kirpans in the workplace .
Laycock has a long history of defending religious groups in cases involving freedom-of-worship questions . He successfully argued on behalf of a Santeria church in Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah , a case in which the Supreme Court unanimously struck down a local ordinance meant to stop the church from conducting animal sacrifices . He has also advocated on behalf of the separation of church and state , arguing Town of Greece v. Galloway on behalf of plaintiffs who objected to the town board opening meetings with prayers ; the Court ruled that the prayers were constitutional , 5-4 . He is a vocal supporter of same-sex marriage , but supports protections for the religious liberties of opponents .
We spoke on the phone Monday afternoon ; here 's a lightly edited transcript of our conversation .
Dylan Matthews : Opponents of the Indiana RFRA argue that it 's really unprecedented , because while a number of other states and the federal government have RFRAs , Indiana 's explicitly applies to conflicts between private parties , not just to the government . How big of a deal is that ?
Douglas Laycock : It 's not much of a distinction . If the neighbors are mad that you 're feeding the homeless , it really does n't matter if the neighbor sues you or the city sues you . The discrimination cases , which the religious side always loses , it 's always the same . Most of the cases about discrimination have been filed by the state human rights commission or the state attorney general and not by the gay couple who says they were discriminated against .
Here 's the history on suits by private citizens . The federal RFRA was plainly intended to provide a defense if a church or religious believer was sued by a private citizen . They wanted to make clear that it also covered litigation against the government , because there 's this issue of sovereign immunity , that you generally can not sue a state . So they were trying to clarify , and they put in , specifically , that you can get relief against the government . Later , people began to say , `` That means only against the government . '' It does n't say only , and the courts are divided , but some have read it to mean only against the government . There 's an article by a student in the Virginia Law Review that carefully collects the drafting history . It 's very clear how this happened .
A lot of the states just copied the federal language , so the New Mexico RFRA had the same ambiguity , and then the New Mexico Supreme Court said suits by private citizens are n't covered . Indiana decided to clarify that ambiguity and make clear that suits by private citizens are covered . I think that goes back to the original meaning of the federal RFRA .
`` The ultimate nightmare scenario is a case in Kansas where a woman literally died for her faith ''
On discrimination cases , in particular , the state is nearly always authorized to sue on behalf of the victim of discrimination . It not only restores the original intent , but it also does n't matter for the kinds of cases the gay rights folks worried about .
DM : The nightmare scenario , from a gay rights perspective , seems to be that this would provide a defense for discriminatory practices . If a same-sex couple sues a florist who refuses to work on their wedding , the florist could use this defense . Would that happen ? What is this defense used for in practice ?
DL : No , I do n't think that 's the nightmare scenario , because religious folks have n't been winning discrimination cases anyway . There are n't that many of these cases , and they 're quite diverse . They involve all sorts of religious practices , usually from non-mainstream religions , small minority-group religions .
But at mainstream churches , there has been litigation about religious feeding programs . The one case everyone has heard about is Hobby Lobby , which is almost the only case that became at all controversial . That 's a case where , really for the first time in our history , the government made it illegal in certain contexts to practice a core teaching of the largest churches in the country . They knew what evangelicals and Catholics thought about these forms of contraception that they think cause abortions , and said they needed to pay for them and provide them anyway . That 's an unprecedented intrusion into religious liberty .
Even so , that case was decided on the premise that the government had another way to provide free contraception without making the employer pay for it , so the impact on female employees , the court said , was basically zero . They 'd still get their contraception . So nothing in Hobby Lobby suggests that employees or customers have to do without to accommodate the merchants ' or the employers ' religious beliefs . The ultimate nightmare scenario is a case in Kansas where a woman literally died for her faith because of government intransigence , and for lack of a state RFRA . It does n't happen very often , but it 's at least a real case , and all the complaints about the discrimination that 's going to be authorized by the Indiana RFRA is not based on any real case ; it 's all completely hypothetical .
DM : I 'm not familiar with that Kansas case . What happened ?
DL : The Kansas case concerned a woman named Mary Stinemetz who needed a liver transplant . She was a Jehovah 's Witness , so she could n't have a blood transfusion . It turns out that there are bloodless liver transplants , and they were available in Omaha , and it was actually cheaper in Omaha than it would have been anywhere in Kansas .
And Kansas Medicaid said , `` We do n't pay for out-of-state medical care , period . '' So she filed a lawsuit under the state constitution , and the state said , `` Well , our state constitution means the same thing the Supreme Court says the federal constitution means . It means we do n't have to make any exceptions for religious people . ''
It took two years to litigate that , and finally the Kansas court of appeals said basically that the Kansas constitution means the standard of a RFRA applies . The government needs a compelling interest to refuse an exception , and it did n't have any interests at all here . She won her lawsuit , but it took two years , and by that point her medical condition had deteriorated . She was no longer medically eligible for the transplant , and she died in 2012 .
DL : It 's horrible . And it was all motivated by this rule , `` We do n't have to make exceptions . '' That 's the government 's understanding of the law in most places , apart from a state RFRA .
DM : Why is n't the First Amendment enough in cases like this ?
DL : The First Amendment has been interpreted by the Supreme Court not to require exemptions for religious practice . So if a law is generally applicable , it can be applied even to a worship service , and the state has no duty to justify that or show a need or a reason for that . The federal RFRA was in response to that decision , and the state RFRAs have mostly been to a second decision that said the federal RFRA did n't apply to states .
`` There are hardly any cases about discrimination , and the ones there are the government has won ''
There are also state constitutions . The state constitutional standard in Indiana is unique and ambiguous and fuzzy . Only one claimant has ever won a religious exemption under the Indiana constitution . Without the state RFRA , there 's really no protection for most religious practices , and the kind of cases that arise are unpredictable conflicts between the vast diversity of religious practices in America and the great diversity of different kinds of regulation .
There are cases about churches feeding the homeless . Sometimes neighbors object to that . There are cases about Muslim women wearing scarfs or veils , there are cases about Amish buggies , there are cases about Sabbath observants . There are hardly any cases about discrimination , and the ones there are the government has won .
There are never very many cases under a state RFRA , but they 're terribly important to the religious believers who are caught up in them .
DM : You suggested that most RFRA cases involve small religious groups , like Jehovah 's Witnesses or Muslims or the Amish . Has someone actually tallied that up , or is that just your impression as an expert ?
DL : I do n't know if anyone 's counted . There was a survey by a guy named Chris Lund that 's several years old now . He collected all the state RFRA cases ; it 's remarkable how few there were . Some of them , of course , are evangelical Christians or Catholics , but a lot of them were smaller minority groups . I do n't know if there 's a big enough sample to make a strong claim . But it 's typically a somewhat unusual religious practice , even if it 's a Christian practice . It 's not something that 's all that widespread .
DM : Your argument depends a lot on courts consistently finding that states have a compelling interest in fighting discrimination , such that the RFRA does n't justify an exemption . How do courts actually compare those interests ? Are there doctrines or tests that have developed , or do judges just weigh the intangibles in each case ?
DL : To some extent , in each case they weigh the intangibles , but they certainly look to precedent in similar cases . No one has ever won an exemption from a discrimination law under a RFRA standard , so there 's plenty of precedent saying that if you 're seeking exemption from a discrimination law , you lose . I say plenty — there are n't dozens of cases , there 's a relative handful of cases , but they all go the same way .
In the gay rights context , which seems to be fueling this , there 's the New Mexico wedding photographer who got a fair amount of press . New Mexico has a RFRA . Twelve different judges heard that case as it worked its way up from the human rights commission to the state Supreme Court , and the religious wedding photographer did not get even a single vote from a single judge . It was ultimately decided on the grounds that RFRA just did n't apply to a suit by a private citizen , but they rejected every other argument she made , and it was perfectly clear they would have found a compelling government interest if they had gone to the next step .
A florist in Washington just lost in the state trial court . That court found a compelling state interest under the state constitution , which is interpreted as including the RFRA standard . There 's a wedding case in Colorado that has n't gone to court ; it 's in the state administrative agency . That 's not a RFRA state , so that 'd be a different standard . There was a doctor in California who did n't want to do an in vitro fertilization for a lesbian couple . She referred the couple to her partner in the same practice . They said , `` Not good enough , we 're terribly insulted '' and so forth . California is not a RFRA state and the doctor lost .
Those are the only recent cases I 'm aware of . There 's one more , 30 years ago . A fitness club in Minnesota said they just did n't hire gays and they offered a religious reason for it , and that was a different time for gay rights — but the owner of the fitness club lost under the compelling interest test under the state constitution , basically the RFRA standard . The court said there was a compelling interest in nondiscrimination . There are no modern cases about race discrimination . There were a few back in the 1960s , and the person offering a religious justification to discriminate always lost . But the ones I walked you through are the only recent cases that I 'm aware of .
DM : Another point opponents of the law have made is that it explicitly applies to corporations . What does extending RFRA protections to companies do , in practice ?
DL : It does n't come up a lot . The US Code defines `` person '' to include corporations , and RFRA protects persons . It should not have been a surprise in Hobby Lobby that corporations were covered . The question was compelling interest and least restricting means . But there are hardly any cases by corporations , because corporations mostly are not run for religious purposes , certainly if they 're not closely held . The key to the Hobby Lobby case is that it was owned by one family , and they were unanimous about the religious commitments of the business .
As soon as you take in outside shareholders , that becomes untenable as a practical matter . They do n't want to sacrifice profit for your religious concerns . There are very few corporate claims and it 's not likely , to the extent there are any , that they 're going to win many . Hobby Lobby is a very special context . It is closely held by one family , that family believes they 're being asked to kill innocent babies , and the court says , `` Well , that may be true , but the government has another way to kill those babies , so we can exempt you . '' It 's an extremely narrow ruling , in spite of all the extravagant rhetoric you 've heard from both sides about it .
I do n't agree with what they believe about abortion , and I 'm sure many of your readers do n't , but if you believe that — if you believe you 're really being asked to kill babies — that 's an extraordinary thing for the government to ask you to do . It 's not unreasonable to seek an exemption from that .
DM : Are there other aspects of the law that you think are being misreported or misinterpreted ?
DL : I think the main thing is this charge that it 's a license to discriminate . That 's the principal allegation , and it 's based on nothing in real experience . You 've got Republican legislators fueling the fire by saying when the bill was under consideration that this would protect Christians against gay rights . They either do n't know what they 're talking about , do n't know what the bills have actually done , or they 're just pandering to the base and promising things they ca n't deliver . There 's blame to go around here , but neither side is talking much about what these bills have actually done in practice .
`` it really is possible to protect liberty and justice for all here ''
DM : Why do you think that there 's been such a mobilization against this , if the practical effects are as small as you say ?
DL : I think the lawyers for the gay rights movement know exactly what they 're doing . This works , right ? They killed a bill in Arizona , and it worked so well that they 're doing it again . As the movement succeeds , as marriage equality nationwide seems within their reach , they also become more extreme in their demands , and more resistant to any kind of exemption for anybody . They just do n't want to take any chance , they do n't want to ever have to prove a compelling interest or worry that some red-state judge somewhere might decide differently from how every other judge everywhere in the country has decided .
I think it really is possible to protect liberty and justice for all here . I filed a brief in the marriage cases saying , `` Protect marriage equality , and after you 've done that , protect the religious liberty of churches and religious organizations and very small vendors in the wedding business . '' We can do that . We can be fair to both sides . But neither side seems much interested in it . They want to crush the other side .

Maybe then. Not anymore.

Not three short months later, amid the biggest crisis of his political life, that line rings comical.

At least three of those 49 governors Pence taunted—from Connecticut, New York, Washington and counting—have banned nonessential government travel from their states to Indiana in just the six days since Pence signed Senate Bill 101, the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act, in a behind-closed-doors ceremony March 26. Meanwhile, another of the 49, Arkansas Republican Asa Hutchinson, is expected to sign a similar religious freedom bill on Wednesday—joining Pence in offering the opening salvo in a new front of the culture wars.

But Pence is in trouble, because there is already collateral damage.

At least 10 national conventions are threatening to pull out of commitments to meeting in Indianapolis, according to city tourism officials, who have spent late nights talking down convention organizers in an attempt to keep a grip on the industry that brings in $4.4 billion annually and supports 75,000 jobs. Comedian Nick Offerman and indie band Wilco scuttled upcoming engagements here. Even NASCAR, not known for leftie or social-justice bona fides, expressed disappointment in the legislation.

And just days before the NCAA Final Four Championship is set to tip off, a different kind of March Madness has settled over the city. NCAA President Mark Emmert expressed doubts about maintaining its Indianapolis headquarters—a short walk from the Statehouse.

In a hastily called news conference on Tuesday, Pence—usually keen on playing the happy warrior in public—looked wan and defeated, though his hair was still shaped into its perfect and immoveable silver part. At some turns, in a dulcet tone, Pence employed a humble tack, suggesting the law needed “a fix” and admitting that his defensive performance in a Sunday appearance with George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s “This Week” likely made things worse (“I could have handled that better,” Pence told reporters). At others, he defended the religious freedom bill, criticizing press coverage of it as “reckless” and “sloppy,” and said he harbored no regrets in signing it.

“It’s been a tough week here in the Hoosier State, but we’re going to move forward,” Pence assured state and national media who had gathered at the Indiana State Library, an unconventional choice for a news conference but a sop to the national interest in the roiling imbroglio. Pence’s regular briefing area wasn’t large enough to accommodate reporters who had descended on the city. (Even Olympic diver Greg Louganis, in town to promote a new book with the mother of Ryan White, the Kokomo teen who died of AIDS 25 years ago this month, surfaced at the presser, ambling around with his black and white Jack Russell terrier, Dobby.)

The optics of the moment—a governor once mentioned as a potential 2016er now trying to sort through political wreckage amid dusty tomes in the building’s History Reference room—seemed to suggest one potential outcome of Pence’s rightward lurch: Were Pence’s presidential chances history now, too?

Back in the chamber on that January evening, Pence found himself experiencing more heady days. He had been hailed as a favorite of the billionaire Koch brothers and had just passed up a chance to chair the Republican Governors Association, saying his focus was on ""serving the people of Indiana and working with legislators in our state to ensure a successful 2015 session of the Indiana General Assembly.” Still, members of his inner circle pitched him as a 2016 dark horse, a potential unity candidate in a coming fractious primary fight.

Since Pence resigned as chairman of the House Republican Conference in November 2010 to run for governor, conventional wisdom held that he would bide his time in Indianapolis, padding his résumé with executive experience before mounting a presidential bid. After all, no one gets elected president from the House—American voters prefer governors, chief executives who have actually governed.

The working theory of a Pence bid, according to his allies, such as Kellyanne Conway, his longtime pollster, was somewhat Rube Goldbergian but plausible: If establishment and movement conservatives deadlocked in a primary, Pence could emerge as the consensus candidate.

But when Pence signed the religious freedom bill into law last Thursday, that theory began to crumble.

On Friday afternoon, a delegation of Indiana business leaders convened in a closed-door session with Pence, including Republican Mayor Greg Ballard—an otherwise even-keeled mayor who passionately opposed the religious freedom law this week—a representative of Visit Indy, the city’s tourism arm, and the city’s Chamber of Commerce. It was a candid confab, as the delegation laid out the economic impact of Pence’s decision to sign the bill.

The meeting’s tone was “cordial but concerned,” said Chris Gahl, vice president of Visit Indy. Pence listened. In a decreasingly barn-red state whose capital city is enjoying a boom of downtown development and a cultural renaissance, this week’s controversy has proved a buzz kill for a city that has boosters drunk with civic optimism. “The bill has impeded our efforts,” says Gahl, who cited 2,500 press clips questioning Indy’s hospitality in recent days as a huge public-relations hole to dig out from. Among the biggest potential losses: Gen Con, the world’s biggest gaming convention, which would generate about $56 million for the city. Pence personally called the convention leaders at their Seattle headquarters this week, urging them to stay.

Mr. Verrilli, for his part, finds himself in an awkward position. It is ordinarily the job of the executive branch to defend laws enacted by Congress, and the Justice Department did defend the marriage law early in the Obama administration. Last year, though, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. announced an about-face, saying he and President Obama had concluded that the law was unconstitutional.

The administration would continue to enforce the law, Mr. Holder said, but would no longer defend it in court.

After the administration’s move, House Republicans intervened in the case to defend the law. They turned to Mr. Clement, who sometimes seems to be handling every important case on the Supreme Court docket.

Let's talk about the integrity thing specifically.

This week's big story is the saga of a Rowan County, KY, clerk Kim Davis, who was jailed indefinitely Thursday by U.S. District Judge David Bunning for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in compliance with an earlier court order. Davis will remain in federal custody until she agrees to issue the appropriate licenses. Last month, meanwhile, a Texas clerk named Katie Lang was hit with a court settlement to the tune of $44,000 in damages and legal fees for refusing to issue a license for a gay couple. But it clearly wasn't punitive enough to scare Davis who's clearly acting in contempt of Judge Bunning's order.

Davis believes that by issuing the licenses she'll be condemned to Hell. Of course her perceived biblical trespass is ridiculously cherrypicked, as it always is. Homophobes like Davis seem to only zero-in on Leviticus and a few letters written by the apostle Paul. (Regarding the latter, and briefly put, Paul was merely recruiting pagan gentiles to the ascetic Christian lifestyle. Paganism often included sex acts in temple rituals, so naturally converts would have to reject those old forms of worship. Paul, by the way, in Romans, also expressly forbid debating, boasting, deception, being unmerciful and wine-drinking. That'd be a quintuple Hell-worthy condemnation for John Boehner. It's also worth noting that the terms ""homosexuality"" and ""same-sex marriage"" were anachronistic in the ancient world, making it impossible for the Bible to explicitly condemn either.)

Incidentally, it's come to light that Davis has been divorced three times and married four. So much for the sanctity of marriage. And in the various video clips and photos of Davis, she's clearly wearing two types of cloth at the same time, which is a direct violation of God's decree in Leviticus 19:19.

But I nitpick.

The bottom line here is that Davis works in the public sector and therefore is forbidden by the establishment clause of the First Amendment from imposing her (blindingly contradictory) faith on the public. Naturally, she's also acting in defiance of the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. My cynical side tells me there's more to Davis' motives. She's already been lionized by the bigoted far-right, with at least two GOP presidential candidates rushing to her support, so it's not unfair to speculate that she's gripped by the lure of national attention.

Speaking of which, let's return to integrity. A third presidential candidate, Lindsey Graham, also weighed in on the Davis story, but not in the way you'd expect from a conservative Republican. It turns out Graham said exactly what any sane, rational human being might say.

Said the South Carolina Republican:

Okay, that was precisely the correct reaction to the story. (Except, of course, the thing about supporting traditional marriage, but nobody's perfect.) What's more noteworthy, however, is that Graham said this in total defiance of both his party and his congressional delegation, each of which routinely scrambles over itself to pander as much if not more to anti-gay Americans as it does to racists and sexists. Additionally, Graham had the guts to say it to one of the top-shelf nationally syndicated conservative radio hosts, Hugh Hewitt. The liberal equivalent might've been, for example, Elizabeth Warren hypothetically defending the NRA on ""Real Time with Bill Maher.

No wonder Graham is losing badly in a GOP presidential field populated by goofballs, racists and over-paid comment trolls. While he's not going to win any popularity polls on the left, there are two things any liberal ought to be able to say about Graham: (1) He obviously possesses at least a modicum of integrity that's unmatched by the majority of his colleagues; and (2) he appears to be one of the few remaining national politicians who, at least in the here and now, hasn't sold out to the inchoate screeching and personality politics of the Tea Party and Fox News Channel. And that's a real accomplishment, given the strong incentives in the other direction.

In the blurting culture of Trump-era politics we need more leaders like Graham who are willing to take the rational high-road rather than dutifully falling in line with the fire-eaters, extremists and carnival geeks of his party.",www.salon.com,left,eB9gOfoD4F4sGBPO

Organizers who announced the effort Tuesday hope to spur action by the Republican-led Legislature , whose leaders have cited religious freedom concerns in resisting similar legislation , or put the issue on the November ballot for voters to decide .
Petition language submitted to state election officials would expand the definition of “ sex ” in the Michigan Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act of 1976 to include “ sexual orientation ” and “ gender identity or expression , ” guaranteeing safeguards in housing , public accommodation and employment .
It ’ s an idea first proposed in 1983 , and one supporters say has grown increasingly popular with the public following nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage in 2015 .
“ We just want to be judged on the job we do -- now who we are or who we love -- and we want to be treated equally in the eyes of government , ” said Trevor Thomas , a co-chair of the new Fair and Equal Michigan ballot committee and board chair for Equality Michigan Action .
Current Michigan law prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion , race , color , national origin , age , sex , height , weight , familial status or marital status .
The initiative would expand and codify a 2018 interpretation from the Michigan Civil Rights Commission , which held that bias against gay and transgender residents is already illegal under a prohibition on “ sex ” discrimination .
If enacted , Michigan would join 21 other states with laws that explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity , according to the non-profit Movement Advancement Project .

“The rights of these 300 couples are just as valid as the rights of every other Michigander, and they — and every Michigan resident — deserve to have the same rights and responsibilities as other married couples,” they wrote in the letter.

In 2004, Michigan voters approved a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage in the state. After Holder’s ruling last year, Snyder wrote that the decision would “create more complexity” for the state.

Snyder defeated former Democratic Rep. Mark Schauer in November to win his second term as governor.",www.politico.com,left,E1dNNc0zoQlX0qLI

He is running for president against a notably homophobic president and administration , and—right now , in his bit of the contest—he ’ s winning , rising , and creating a memorable public silhouette .

The issue of LGBTQ rights in the election campaign is just as tricky . Democrat strategists worry about identity politics on the left , fracturing electability chances .

Buttigieg has been praised for making history , praised ( alongside his charismatic , witty husband Chasten ) for being not just public about his relationship but vocal too . Surely they both deserve credit for how they have done this .

Mayor Pete ’ s progress stands in stark contrast to Trump and his compadres ’ sewage pipe of bigotry and prejudice .

Transgender travelers are “ particularly vulnerable to invasive searches at airport checkpoints , ” according to a new ProPublica report . The report , which reviewed complaint data from Transportation Security Administration ’ s website and collected 174 anecdotal accounts , found that trans and non-binary people can be forced to discuss their genitals with TSA agents in non-private areas , are sometimes subject to invasive pat-downs by officers they don ’ t consent to , forced to reveal their genitals to TSA agents , or otherwise humiliated following full-body scans .
The TSA began using full-body scanners in 2010 in order to check for non-metal weapons . Unlike metal detectors , however , these scanners require agents to scan travelers as either male or female , something that is determined by a TSA agent ’ s perception of travelers ’ appearance . The scanner scans male and female bodies differently , based on cis anatomy . Yet , according to the TSA , “ Screening is conducted without regard to a person 's race , color , sex , gender identity , national origin , religion or disability . ”
In at least one case the publication reviewed , after being scanned TSA reportedly told one trans woman that she would not be allowed to board her flight unless she consented to a pat-down by a man .
To many trans and non-binary people , the report is not at all surprising . Though trans people make up less than 1 percent of the U.S. population , over 5 percent of online complaints against TSA from January 2016 to April 2018 dealt with the screening of trans people . In February , after urging from Congress , the TSA rolled out online “ transgender awareness ” training for its employees who screen travelers , but some trans and non-binary people say they have yet to see any improvements .
We spoke to seven trans people about the horrible and ridiculous experiences they ’ ve had with airport security .
I 've never been given a full-body search but do experience extreme anxiety leading up to my travels . [ ... ] When going through a body scanner , they immediately label me as a male so when the scan is done , there is always a spot on the screen signaling an anomaly with my chest . I 've been through this so many times , I know what to tell TSA officers confidently , and as soon as it happens , but the responses are always varied . The first few times , I was so anxious , I had a hard time explaining myself properly so it would cause more confusion .
Most recently , at LAX , I went through the scanner , popped out on the other side and said , `` It 's popping up that way because I 'm transgender and wearing a chest binder , which is like a girdle . If you scan me as a woman , it would come out clear . '' There was a long pause and the male officer said , `` So who do you want to pat you down ? '' I suggested scanning me again if they did n't mind and the male officer said , `` So you prefer to be scanned as a woman ? '' It was 5:30 in the morning , and I was feeling extremely over it and I said , `` Not really but y'all do n't know how to scan outside of the binary so you 're going to have to ... '' I 'm pretty lucky they did n't get mad at [ me ] but they did scan me as a woman and as predicted , my screen then flashed a green `` clear . '' As I was grabbing my stuff off the conveyor belt , the female officer came up to me and I immediately had a wave of bad anxiety because I thought maybe they were mad at my comment , but she thanked me for explaining so thoroughly to them and said I helped educate them in that situation . I said , “ No problem , ” at the moment but after I had time to calm down , my first thought was Why do I have to be the one to educate them ? I often wonder why my negative experience gets to become a teaching moment for them when their job should provide the training .
All , if not most , of my flights are in the morning or really late at night , so I ’ m usually presenting masculine in my outward appearance . This leads to TSA officials asking if I ’ m a boy or girl so they can determine which person to pat me down . This usually takes more time than needed , and it ’ s super uncomfortable standing there . I usually get frustrated at them , so I try and dress more feminine for the ease of getting through it—which sucks because I ’ m more comfortable looking masculine or playing with androgyny in my appearance . It always feels like I have to accommodate someone else ’ s belief of gender for my safety .
I wanted to get my ID changed to an X because the state where I ’ m from had that option , but I just know that will cause multiple problems on top of my appearance that I don ’ t think I ’ m ready for in the airport . It ’ s pretty disappointing that this fear is holding me back from what I actually want .
I would say nine out of ten times that I ’ ve gone through a ProVision L3 body scan machine , I ’ ve been flagged for having an “ abnormality in the groin region ” ... In my opinion , there ’ s no way this isn ’ t direct , targeted harassment of trans people . If it ’ s someone ’ s job to sit there behind a closed door and watch the body scans of people as they go through the machine , and this person is flagging you because the shape of your flesh doesn ’ t align with their idea of how a body should look , what else could it be ? Neither my tits nor my dick are made of metal . If you ’ re taking a full 3D scan of a body , it should be pretty obvious which parts are attached and part of a person .
Then after being flagged , TSA agents always , always seem confused as to who should be giving me a pat down , because they don ’ t know how to interpret my gender . Not too long ago , after I was finished getting patted down , I heard a TSA agent turn to another and say “ this is why I hate my job . ”
Ever since I got TSA Precheck , it ’ s been fine . With TSA Pre , you don ’ t have to pass through the body scanner , just a metal detector , and you leave on your shoes , leave your laptop in your bag . It makes the security process a lot easier .
Every time I have to go through the Gender Tube there 's always a moment of hesitation that I can feel from the TSA agents when they have to decide whether to scan my body as a man 's or a woman 's . Sometimes , I can hear them quietly talking among themselves as they speculate on my genitals . Sometimes they 'll ask me if I have anything in my pockets or some other random inquiry presumably in an attempt to parse my voice , which is equally as androgynous . The worst times are when my chest is flagged as an anomaly and a male TSA agent feels me up . It 's a violation of consent that feels awful regardless of sexuality , I 'm sure , but being a butch lesbian with chest dysphoria makes it worse , especially while knowing the history of butches ' bodily autonomy being violated by the state . When I was more feminine presenting , going through TSA was annoying , but did n't cause me any anxiety . As soon as I cut my hair and started dressing more masculine , though , all of the above started happening pretty much immediately .
I have traveled internationally three times in the past year . Each time , TSA has selected me for a pat-down . They may as well have “ penis ” and “ vagina ” buttons they press—if you do not conform to the TSA agent ’ s expectation of what your genitals should be , they will single you out and pat you down .
The last time this happened to me , the TSA agent recognized it as discriminatory and was taken aback that she needed to participate in this grotesque process . She complained to her supervisor and was extremely apologetic .
TSA ’ s website ’ s tiny Civil Rights page states that they do not discriminate based on gender OR sex . This is clearly patently false .
Some will say this process is “ to make sure a woman ’ s cock is not a bomb or explosive of some sort. ” It ’ s interesting and crazy-making , as a trans woman , to have a government agency making determinations about whether I “ pass ” or not . Next time I go through airport security , if I am not singled out to be manhandled by an agent , I will wonder whether they see me as a man . TSA calls this whole process “ clearing an alarm. ” It ’ s galling , but not surprising that , as a trans woman , my genitals cause alarm . I know this already , but it ’ s nice to have TSA confirm it .
I 've had a mixed bag when it comes to security . Most experiences have been fairly neutral . I 've even had one really positive one where a Covenant Aviation Security ( [ San Francisco Airport ] does n't use TSA ) agent and I ended up in a nice conversation about their own trans niece . That said , I am usually flagged for additional checks .
I 'd say the worst experience I ever had was flying out of Logan International Airport in Boston two years ago . I just approached the body scanner when the TSA agent , with a quizzical look on his face , said , `` I 'm not trying to be rude but , uh , what should we scan you as ? '' I said female . The machine flagged me and I was directed to wait for a secondary scan . A female TSA agent was eventually brought over , and she examined my chest by hand . I do n't have any implants or anything , nor a metal underwire , so I am really unsure what they thought they 'd find .
For an agency that manages to miss actual weapons 70 % of the time , I would think that my body would be the least of their concerns . Also , a machine that offers a binary gender check like the body scanners do is never going to be able to get things right , ever . It 's just a mess .
Oftentimes , I have walked through a scanner and the machine picks up the metal in my bra hooks , and then I have to be unnecessarily patted down . It 's inefficient , annoying , and invasive . Had I been a victim of physical assault , which many transgender folks are due to the nature of our social status , this would likely be a highly triggering experience .
Frequency of negative TSA experiences related to my transness are hard to gauge , because I have gone through security pretending to be male due to my transphobic family 's presence with me during travel , and they do n't want me presenting female publicly . This has reduced recently due to my newfound financial independence and the subsequent freedom allowing me to present how I want without worrying about their power over me . However , I have n't traveled recently to countries like India or Bangladesh , where there are separate lines and scanners for women and men , and my sex marker on my passport still says `` Male '' so no doubt I would be subjected to major dysphoria , stares , and possibly harassment in that situation—as is the case based on the stories my trans friends who 've been in that situation tell me .
I 'm in the process of transitioning but I do n't pass . I 've had an awkward experience when a TSA agent mentioned that his 'son ' was suicidal , and then once his 'son ' became a daughter , she was much happier . He was likely trying to be nice to me , but it ended up making me feel singled out because I was already on edge walking through security , as I usually am , due to racial profiling of brown Muslims combined with my transness . Intersectionality makes security more anxiety-inducing rather than just a headache . A smile , acknowledgment , or statement reassuring me that Islamophobia and transphobia would not affect the treatment I 'd receive from the officer , would have been much better on my already taxed nerves . ( Even though we know that top-down Islamophobia and transphobia affect the administrative policies TSA must follow , hint hint , the Trump administration 's Muslim ban , transphobic policies , etc . ) Most of the negative treatment is non-verbal , when I see people 's shoulders or facial expressions stiffen upon seeing me . This sets the tone for the rest of the interaction as 'strictly professional ' , like the tone of 'random ' security checks Muslims often complain about .","Going through airport security is never enjoyable, but for some the experience is far worse than others.

In February, after urging from Congress, the TSA rolled out online “transgender awareness” training for its employees who screen travelers, but some trans and non-binary people say they have yet to see any improvements.

We spoke to seven trans people about the horrible and ridiculous experiences they’ve had with airport security.

I've never been given a full-body search but do experience extreme anxiety leading up to my travels. [...] When going through a body scanner, they immediately label me as a male so when the scan is done, there is always a spot on the screen signaling an anomaly with my chest. I've been through this so many times, I know what to tell TSA officers confidently, and as soon as it happens, but the responses are always varied. The first few times, I was so anxious, I had a hard time explaining myself properly so it would cause more confusion.

Most recently, at LAX, I went through the scanner, popped out on the other side and said, ""It's popping up that way because I'm transgender and wearing a chest binder, which is like a girdle. If you scan me as a woman, it would come out clear."" There was a long pause and the male officer said, ""So who do you want to pat you down?"" I suggested scanning me again if they didn't mind and the male officer said, ""So you prefer to be scanned as a woman?"" It was 5:30 in the morning, and I was feeling extremely over it and I said, ""Not really but y'all don't know how to scan outside of the binary so you're going to have to..."" I'm pretty lucky they didn't get mad at [me] but they did scan me as a woman and as predicted, my screen then flashed a green ""clear."" As I was grabbing my stuff off the conveyor belt, the female officer came up to me and I immediately had a wave of bad anxiety because I thought maybe they were mad at my comment, but she thanked me for explaining so thoroughly to them and said I helped educate them in that situation. I said, “No problem,” at the moment but after I had time to calm down, my first thought was Why do I have to be the one to educate them? I often wonder why my negative experience gets to become a teaching moment for them when their job should provide the training.

All, if not most, of my flights are in the morning or really late at night, so I’m usually presenting masculine in my outward appearance. This leads to TSA officials asking if I’m a boy or girl so they can determine which person to pat me down. This usually takes more time than needed, and it’s super uncomfortable standing there. I usually get frustrated at them, so I try and dress more feminine for the ease of getting through it—which sucks because I’m more comfortable looking masculine or playing with androgyny in my appearance. It always feels like I have to accommodate someone else’s belief of gender for my safety.

I wanted to get my ID changed to an X because the state where I’m from had that option, but I just know that will cause multiple problems on top of my appearance that I don’t think I’m ready for in the airport. It’s pretty disappointing that this fear is holding me back from what I actually want.

I would say nine out of ten times that I’ve gone through a ProVision L3 body scan machine, I’ve been flagged for having an “abnormality in the groin region”... In my opinion, there’s no way this isn’t direct, targeted harassment of trans people. If it’s someone’s job to sit there behind a closed door and watch the body scans of people as they go through the machine, and this person is flagging you because the shape of your flesh doesn’t align with their idea of how a body should look, what else could it be? Neither my tits nor my dick are made of metal. If you’re taking a full 3D scan of a body, it should be pretty obvious which parts are attached and part of a person.

Then after being flagged, TSA agents always, always seem confused as to who should be giving me a pat down, because they don’t know how to interpret my gender. Not too long ago, after I was finished getting patted down, I heard a TSA agent turn to another and say “this is why I hate my job.”

Ever since I got TSA Precheck, it’s been fine. With TSA Pre, you don’t have to pass through the body scanner, just a metal detector, and you leave on your shoes, leave your laptop in your bag. It makes the security process a lot easier.

Every time I have to go through the Gender Tube there's always a moment of hesitation that I can feel from the TSA agents when they have to decide whether to scan my body as a man's or a woman's. Sometimes, I can hear them quietly talking among themselves as they speculate on my genitals. Sometimes they'll ask me if I have anything in my pockets or some other random inquiry presumably in an attempt to parse my voice, which is equally as androgynous. The worst times are when my chest is flagged as an anomaly and a male TSA agent feels me up. It's a violation of consent that feels awful regardless of sexuality, I'm sure, but being a butch lesbian with chest dysphoria makes it worse, especially while knowing the history of butches' bodily autonomy being violated by the state. When I was more feminine presenting, going through TSA was annoying, but didn't cause me any anxiety. As soon as I cut my hair and started dressing more masculine, though, all of the above started happening pretty much immediately.

I have traveled internationally three times in the past year. Each time, TSA has selected me for a pat-down. They may as well have “penis” and “vagina” buttons they press—if you do not conform to the TSA agent’s expectation of what your genitals should be, they will single you out and pat you down.

The last time this happened to me, the TSA agent recognized it as discriminatory and was taken aback that she needed to participate in this grotesque process. She complained to her supervisor and was extremely apologetic.

TSA’s website’s tiny Civil Rights page states that they do not discriminate based on gender OR sex. This is clearly patently false.

Some will say this process is “to make sure a woman’s cock is not a bomb or explosive of some sort.” It’s interesting and crazy-making, as a trans woman, to have a government agency making determinations about whether I “pass” or not. Next time I go through airport security, if I am not singled out to be manhandled by an agent, I will wonder whether they see me as a man. TSA calls this whole process “clearing an alarm.” It’s galling, but not surprising that, as a trans woman, my genitals cause alarm. I know this already, but it’s nice to have TSA confirm it.

I've had a mixed bag when it comes to security. Most experiences have been fairly neutral. I've even had one really positive one where a Covenant Aviation Security ([San Francisco Airport] doesn't use TSA) agent and I ended up in a nice conversation about their own trans niece. That said, I am usually flagged for additional checks.

I'd say the worst experience I ever had was flying out of Logan International Airport in Boston two years ago. I just approached the body scanner when the TSA agent, with a quizzical look on his face, said, ""I'm not trying to be rude but, uh, what should we scan you as?"" I said female. The machine flagged me and I was directed to wait for a secondary scan. A female TSA agent was eventually brought over, and she examined my chest by hand. I don't have any implants or anything, nor a metal underwire, so I am really unsure what they thought they'd find.

For an agency that manages to miss actual weapons 70% of the time, I would think that my body would be the least of their concerns. Also, a machine that offers a binary gender check like the body scanners do is never going to be able to get things right, ever. It's just a mess.

Oftentimes, I have walked through a scanner and the machine picks up the metal in my bra hooks, and then I have to be unnecessarily patted down. It's inefficient, annoying, and invasive. Had I been a victim of physical assault, which many transgender folks are due to the nature of our social status, this would likely be a highly triggering experience.

Frequency of negative TSA experiences related to my transness are hard to gauge, because I have gone through security pretending to be male due to my transphobic family's presence with me during travel, and they don't want me presenting female publicly. This has reduced recently due to my newfound financial independence and the subsequent freedom allowing me to present how I want without worrying about their power over me. However, I haven't traveled recently to countries like India or Bangladesh, where there are separate lines and scanners for women and men, and my sex marker on my passport still says ""Male"" so no doubt I would be subjected to major dysphoria, stares, and possibly harassment in that situation—as is the case based on the stories my trans friends who've been in that situation tell me.

I'm in the process of transitioning but I don't pass. I've had an awkward experience when a TSA agent mentioned that his 'son' was suicidal, and then once his 'son' became a daughter, she was much happier. He was likely trying to be nice to me, but it ended up making me feel singled out because I was already on edge walking through security, as I usually am, due to racial profiling of brown Muslims combined with my transness. Intersectionality makes security more anxiety-inducing rather than just a headache. A smile, acknowledgment, or statement reassuring me that Islamophobia and transphobia would not affect the treatment I'd receive from the officer, would have been much better on my already taxed nerves. (Even though we know that top-down Islamophobia and transphobia affect the administrative policies TSA must follow, hint hint, the Trump administration's Muslim ban, transphobic policies, etc.) Most of the negative treatment is non-verbal, when I see people's shoulders or facial expressions stiffen upon seeing me. This sets the tone for the rest of the interaction as 'strictly professional', like the tone of 'random' security checks Muslims often complain about.",www.vice.com,left,fXjqomNl2f5am30c
lgbt_rights,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/12/27/21028342/trans-visibility-backlash-internet-2010,The internet made trans people visible. It also left them more vulnerable.,2019-12-27,Katelyn Burns,"In 2010 , the US had its first Black president , Facebook hadn ’ t yet gone public , and people still thought I was a man .
The way I experienced these past 10 years as a trans woman almost mirrors the status of the trans community at large . I entered the decade ostensibly as a happily married man , trying to build my life and career while repressing my gender identity . Five years in , I found my true self through persistent self-exploration . And I ’ m now leaving the decade scared shitless .
Few marginalized communities have experienced such dramatic whiplash of fortunes over the course of the 2010s as trans people . Where once the public only had access to trans stories through traditional media coverage ( that was rarely flattering ) , we exit the decade with trans people starring in regular roles on television and in film , and transgender journalists beginning to break through into the traditionally cisgender-controlled media apparatus .
This year , 24 percent of Americans reported having a close friend or family member who is transgender , according to a Public Religion Research Institute poll — that ’ s more than double the 11 percent who reported knowing a trans person in 2011 .
Visibility has had an impact on our rights as well . In 2010 , only trans people who could afford expensive surgery were able to legally change genders , and often the cisgender men who controlled psychology dictated that trans women must be attracted to men only in order to medically transition . Nonbinary people , meanwhile , were seldom given a thought even by some trans people . Now , just nine states require surgery in order to change gender marker on state IDs , while 13 states plus the District of Columbia allow nonbinary gender markers on IDs . The singular “ they ” was named 2019 ’ s word of the year by Merriam-Webster .
We didn ’ t arrive at this moment overnight , though . The story of how we got to a point where centuries-old conceptions of gender are now being regularly challenged in popular culture begins and ends with the thing that we love to hate : the internet .
While the early internet of the 2000s established a way for trans people to connect with each other quickly and over long distances , the second wave of web progress — social media and YouTube — has helped trans people leverage visibility into substantial policy gains . But with that progress also came a conservative backlash and campaigns to discredit our basic human rights . The internet , and trans visibility at large , has devolved into a double-edged sword for the trans community . It ’ s a dynamic I am all too familiar with .
I don ’ t remember the name of the first trans person I ever knowingly met . But around 2011 , I was working at a bank when a customer informed me that his daughter would be helping with his finances . He also warned me that his daughter was a little different .
“ When my late wife was pregnant , we were in a car crash , ” he explained . “ So when my daughter was born , we thought she was a boy , but it turns out she wasn ’ t. ” It was a sweet if inaccurate attempt at explaining his daughter ’ s gender identity .
The first time I met his daughter , I remember registering her trans identity . I had already been secretly reading any trans-related news I could dig up but was still feeling like an outsider to the language of the community . Despite having a million questions for her ( that were really about myself ) , I didn ’ t say anything .
Over the course of increasingly frequent interactions , she never talked about her trans status , but I learned more about the rest of her life : She was a pilot and owned her own single-engine plane , flying into Maine from out of state on frequent visits to care for her aging father . She was the first trans person I had ever encountered outside of sensationalized Hollywood portrayals of deranged trans women . At the beginning of the decade , media attention was limited to the exploitative Jerry Springer episode or deceptive villain role in a movie . Trans people likely only existed in the back of the average cis person ’ s mind .
And then one day she opened up and thanked me for making her feel like a normal human . She said that she didn ’ t trust anyone else to help her at the bank because many had been dismissive of judgmental . It was a moment I ’ ll never forget — because it also started a long thaw of repression I had maintained for my own gender feelings . And yet , it would take several more years to work out whether and how to transition .
These years of questioning and exploration aligned with a series of high-profile trans people coming out . It was also when public consciousness on trans people and out issues starting to shift .
Chelsea Manning came out as a trans woman on the eve of her sentencing hearing in 2013 , accompanied by a grainy black and white photo of her in a blond wig . While discussion of her crimes was highly politicized , for many Americans , Manning was the first trans person to receive wall-to-wall coverage in the 24/7 cable news cycle .
Then came Time Magazine ’ s “ Transgender Tipping Point ” cover featuring Laverne Cox in 2014 . The magazine declared that the transgender moment had arrived , presenting trans rights as the next great civil rights struggle . Even after the “ tipping point , ” though , journalists and media still struggled with how to talk about trans lives and experiences .
“ Anytime a transgender person would speak about their experiences in a talk show or a journalistic setting [ before 2014 ] , people felt that it was perfectly appropriate to ask detailed questions about our genitals , our bodies , our sex lives , surgeries that we ’ ve had , up to asking is whether or not we have orgasms . It was just the way things were , ” Nick Adams , director of transgender representation at the LGBTQ media advocacy organization GLAAD , told ███ .
That media dynamic only began to shift after another pivotal Cox moment . In a 2014 interview , Katie Couric asked trans model and actress Carmen Carrera invasive questions about her genitalia and her transition . Couric ’ s next guest was Cox , who pointed out how Couric had been out of line . According to Adams , Cox was one of the first trans people to immediately push back on an interviewer ’ s inappropriate questions .
But that moment would be topped by the most public transition thus far : In 2015 , Caitlyn Jenner appeared on a glamorous Vanity Fair cover . By the end of that year , most Americans were finally at least aware of the existence of a trans person .
The internet boosted trans visibility . At first , there were many positives .
In the background of all these high-profile transitions , a decade and a half of digital organizing had already been taking place , positioning the trans community for its moment in the sun . Since the trans community is relatively small , roughly only 0.6 percent of adults in the US , traditional local organizing was next to impossible outside of large cities like New York or San Francisco . For trans people , the internet became a critical revolutionary tool .
In the early 2010s , I was still closeted , with a wife and children . I didn ’ t access the local trans community where I lived in Maine , and I mainly used my Twitter account to follow soccer news . But around the middle of the decade , I first realized that I might need to transition and started following a handful of trans people .
Seeing them discuss topics that I was interested in , alongside trans issues or their personal transitions , was how I eased into accepting my own trans identity . Eventually , I started my own anonymous trans account , which initially was meant to document the tragicomedy of being a closeted trans woman , but it quickly became a place to take baby steps into expressing my authentic identity without suddenly jumping into real world situations .
“ [ The internet ] was a game-changer as far as I ’ m concerned , ” trans writer and activist Monica Roberts told ███ . “ Unlike the ’ 90s , we now have real-time communication links where we can not only talk to each other nationally , but internationally and in an inexpensive way . ”
According to Roberts , the early internet not only helped trans people organize politically , but also gave trans people access to transition resources and language to describe their gender identity on a massive scale . Starting with the rise of blogs in the early 2000s , trans people created internet spaces and conversations for their own survival . Roberts ’ s own blog , TransGriot , has been one of the most important sources of trans news , analysis , and activism over the course of the decade .
While trans people were discovering themselves and self-advocating over the web , the internet itself was going through a huge overhaul by 2010 . The rise of YouTube and Tumblr allowed trans people to become content creators on their own , cutting out the cis media gatekeepers that long held sway over how trans people were perceived within society . Adams told ███ that trans young people have been “ able to go onto YouTube and develop these really strong relationships with trans content creators who talk about their transitions , because they ’ re interactive in a way that mainstream media is not . ”
While relatively well-known YouTubers like Gigi Gorgeous or ContraPoints announced their transitions on their channels , other smaller content creators on the medium centered their trans experiences . YouTubers like Kat Blaque , a Black trans woman , struck an interesting balance between speaking to trans issues on their channels while also offering a broader assortment of content .
For me , it was a steady mix of YouTube , Reddit , and other internet forums that eased my transition-related anxiety . One result of anti-trans propaganda is that , even for trans people , it ’ s hard to trust that treatments like surgery or hormones will produce the results you want . Seeing before and after photos on transition timelines of other trans people helped me conceptualize how hormone replacement therapy would work on my own body and appearance , and I eventually took the plunge .
But it wasn ’ t just trans people watching trans content creators — cis people were paying attention as well . According to Adams , some of the most valuable trans educators on YouTube became those who had appeal in other areas besides leading a trans life .
“ People who aren ’ t able to get into a writers room in Hollywood , or who are not journalists , can create a cool platform on social media that extends out past the trans community and [ appeal to ] other people who don ’ t know someone who ’ s transgender in their life , ” Adams said . Those cisgender people “ are able to learn something about us because they follow someone on social media who has a smart and intelligent voice — that is a way in which I think social media can help change public attitudes about transgender people . ”
Along with changing public attitudes and more awareness came initial gains in trans rights . First and perhaps most importantly , trans people in the US gained the ability to change their gender on their passports without surgery in 2010 . In a time when most states still required surgery for trans people to have identification matching their lived gender , loosening the passport requirement allowed thousands of people to have accurate government ID to be able to apply for jobs and housing , cross borders , vote , and even buy alcohol without outing themselves as trans to perfect strangers .
Then in 2014 , President Barack Obama ’ s Affordable Care Act barred insurance companies from excluding people with preexisting conditions — among them people with gender dysphoria . Before that , trans people with a gender dysphoria diagnosis often couldn ’ t access health insurance at all .
The Obama administration also barred insurance companies from making blanket exclusions on trans-related health care , opening the door for thousands of trans people to medically transition who couldn ’ t previously afford it . It also pressed for more trans-friendly school and anti-bullying regulations , and sought to create a safer prison environment for incarcerated trans people .
Thanks to Obama , and the sudden societal shift towards trans acceptance , I believed I would be transitioning into a more tolerant world than the one tread by my trans predecessors . The internet had been crucial in paving the way for easier trans lives through social change and policy reforms . But a new threat was looming in the background , and it was also feeding off the internet beast .
Midway through the 2010s came the serious backlash to trans visibility
After the Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that same-sex couples could legally marry , the religious right seemed poised to lose the so-called “ culture wars. ” The biggest LGBTQ fight in legislatures and courts until then had resulted in a devastating loss for religious and cultural conservatives . But instead of packing up and going home , the far right simply shifted their focus to a new , more vulnerable group — trans people .
That effort kicked off in earnest in 2015 , mere months after Caitlyn Jenner ’ s Vanity Fair cover and the Supreme Court ’ s landmark Obergefell ruling , in a Houston referendum over the city ’ s LGBTQ nondiscrimination ordinance . Focusing on the law ’ s public accommodation protections allowing trans people to use bathrooms according to their lived gender , conservatives seized upon a narrative that trans women are really just creepy men who didn ’ t belong in women ’ s restrooms . “ No men in women ’ s bathrooms ” became the latest right-wing rallying cry as conservatives melted down over the prospect of a society that might become slightly easier for trans people to live in .
“ There is an inevitable backlash against progress , ” said Roberts , who lives in Houston and saw the referendum battle in person . “ The conservative movement has this major feature — they always have to have an enemy to organize around . ”
Though one prominent conservative would later admit that the bathroom predator narrative was based on a total myth , the Houston campaign became an early turning point in the political battle over trans rights . The following year would see North Carolina enact its now-infamous “ bathroom bill ” requiring trans people to use the restroom denoted by their original birth certificate in all publicly owned buildings , which included schools . Through it all , the internet was a powerful messaging and recruiting tool for the anti-trans activist movement .
It also had the desired effect of making trans people second guess whether to appear in public spaces . Around the time of North Carolina ’ s bathroom bill , I went to the local mall wearing a little makeup , a horrid wig , and a women ’ s top and jeans . I was a nervous wreck .
Due to a design quirk , the door for the family restroom was inside the women ’ s room . I walked inside and tried to quickly jerk the door open , but it didn ’ t budge . The noise drew the attention of about a half-dozen women washing their hands . My face flushed with embarrassment and fear . One mom , who was there with her little girl , chuckled and told me the same thing had just happened to her moments earlier . I half-smiled in response , not daring to use my voice while quickly sliding into a stall to do my business . Even though that woman was kind to me , growing anti-trans sentiment had put me on edge .
According to Brennan Suen , who analyzes LGBTQ media coverage for Media Matters , fear is the key factor that makes trans content go viral on social media . Where once fear of trans progress was based in part on the bathroom predator myth , it has since evolved to worries of people about trans athletes taking away athletic opportunities or trans people trying to recruit and “ trans ” children with irreversible medical procedures .
Trans people have “ become so visible in the last 10 years , even though the community has always existed , ” Suen told ███ . “ It feels new to people , even if it ’ s not , and that is an area that is fruitful for the right to take advantage of — because when you don ’ t understand something and it seems strange or a little bit scary and then you ’ re being fed more information that is scary , ” you tend to believe it .
The existence of trans people presents a fundamental threat to the gender hierarchy pushed by cultural and religious conservatives . Many Christian fundamentalists envision a particular family structure where God looks over the patriarch of the family , who is responsible for protecting and providing for his wife and kids . The mother of the family is responsible for managing the home and producing Christian children , while children must be obedient to their parents .
Raised by lenient Catholics , I too went along with gendered expectations into adulthood , mainly because I just thought that ’ s what a person was supposed to do . I waited to meet the love of my life to have sex . We got married , we had kids , we bought a house and moved to the suburbs . By all outside accounts , I had a good , normal life . But it didn ’ t feel like my life to me . The bright moments were dulled , as if felt by another person entirely .
Then I started to explore my identity . Eventually , I told my wife everything — my dysphoria as a child , how I had locked away my female side when she asked me to at age 18 , how I had tried to take my own life .
I remember she and I holding each other as it became clear that things were ending . She kept asking me why . Why did I have to do this ? Why did I have to do this to her ? And the truth is , I never really had an answer that made sense . Nonetheless , I knew it was something I had to do for my own survival . I hit a point where I couldn ’ t spend another day as “ him. ” It physically hurt to go on . So I let him go .
Giving up my gendered spot in society has come with difficult repercussions . The little house on a hill in Maine is gone ; my ex-wife and kids are no longer in my daily life . I live in a city again , by myself . It ’ s hard , but at least I can feel again . The good moments are sweeter , and the bad moments are sharper .
Cultural sexism — ingrained in all of us on some level — has been at the core of the conservative backlash against trans rights over the last half-decade , so it didn ’ t take long for far-right conservative groups to quickly spring into action to drive social fear of trans progress . In 2015 , the Family Research Council developed a document that spelled out how religious conservatives should respond to the trans rights movement — and then it found its most critical partner the following year .
The election of Donald Trump was a key turning point in the conservative war on trans rights . He helped put FRC ’ s anti-trans plan immediately into motion ; a month into office , he rolled back Obama-era guidance aimed at protecting the educational experience of trans students . Since then , the Trump administration has engaged in a widespread campaign across virtually every federal government agency to repeal or outright erase trans rights and people from government documents .
Among the administration ’ s efforts : banning trans troops from serving in the military , petitioning the Supreme Court to roll back employment protections under Title VII , proposing a rule to undo Affordable Care Act nondiscrimination protections for trans patients , allowing federally funded shelters to bar trans people from homeless shelters consistent with their gender identity , and requiring prisons to house trans prisoners according to their assigned sex at birth .
By the tail end of the decade , the culture war was successfully killing trans rights , and the targets were both sweeping and personal .
Behind the conservative backlash is a vast right-wing network of media , social media , and online gathering places for anti-trans activists , all devoted to spreading misinformation . Far-right website Breitbart regularly puts out headlines out like “ Transgender : Prediction of Malpractice Lawsuits for ‘ Gender-Affirming ’ Doctors. ” Meanwhile , forums like Mumsnet , which began as a community message board for British mums , have become havens for transphobic comments and harassment . Other conservative outlets and anti-trans web forums try to push false information about trans-affirming medical practices under a veneer of “ reasonable concerns . ”
Online harassment is particularly concentrated on trans people through social media . Any trans person who receives public attention , even for non-trans related news items , is likely to face a torrent of online abuse in return . And it ’ s often organized behind the scenes through various anti-trans web forums and Facebook groups .
Early on in my journalism career , pretransition pictures of myself with my young children were posted and mocked on the “ GenderCritical ” subreddit , a gathering place for self-proclaimed feminists who oppose trans rights . I ’ ve since been doxed on other online forums and face a near-daily drumbeat of transphobic comments on my Twitter account . I ’ ve come to accept this as the necessary cost for being a trans journalist who covers trans issues .
Media Matters ’ s Suen said the rise of online anti-trans sentiment can be traced to the merging of the US right wing with British anti-trans feminists , which have formed an alliance to specifically target trans people with online harassment and misinformation . One particularly pernicious theory that ’ s been latched onto by those opposing trans rights is the concept of “ rapid-onset gender dysphoria. ” In 2018 , Brown University researcher Lisa Littman published a survey of parents purporting to investigate transness in adolescents as being caused by social contagion .
The theory , in essence , claims that young people are being incorrectly convinced that they are trans through reading Tumblr blogs or watching YouTube videos about being trans . While Littman never spoke to trans children themselves to form her theory , she concludes that there may be a new type of gender dysphoria being spread through social media and peer pressure . Her study has since been heavily revised following critique from trans people and the wider scientific community .
Ironically , it ’ s trans visibility that forms the basis for the theory of “ rapid-onset gender dysphoria. ” According to Suen , Littman correctly cites evidence of growing numbers of trans adolescents presenting at gender clinics as evidence of a possible new type of gender dysphoria diagnosis . But it ’ s likely Littman is really just seeing the inevitable result of a commensurate growth in trans youth visibility — children more comfortable to express their gender identity because of trans YouTube creators and reality shows like I Am Jazz , about the life of young trans girl Jazz Jennings , who transitioned at age 5 .
Despite relatively little scientific and academic grounding , “ rapid-onset gender dysphoria ” has become part of a full-fledged media narrative , especially within right-wing and British media . Over the past few years , the theory has been discussed deeply in the pages of the Wall Street Journal , the Times of London , and many other far-right blogs in part because numerous online anti-trans spaces have popped up in recent years to push conspiracy theories about the trans community and trans health care .
According to Suen , it ’ s up to the media to pushback on anti-trans disinformation campaigns in a more substantial way than they are currently . “ Mainstream media has a responsibility to not just treat [ trans people ] with dignity , but to give accurate information , ” he said . “ The big issue here is that the conversation on the right is extremely loud and it is very often factually incorrect ... There ’ s a true public health crisis that can arise from allowing the right to dominate the conversation . ”
Though the financial state of media , and specifically LGBTQ media , is currently fairly grim , there has been a substantial change in the way mainstream media has covered trans issues . Katie Couric ’ s 2014 interview with Carmen Carrera and Laverne Cox came just months after the publication of “ Dr . V ’ s Magical Putter , ” by now-defunct sports outlet Grantland , in which a cisgender male journalist investigated the creator of an allegedly high-tech putter , and then discovered that its creator , Essay Anne Vanderbilt , was a trans woman .
Rather than pausing to consider the implications of revealing that information to the public , the writer and editors pressed on , and Vanderbilt herself ended up taking her own life just weeks before the story was published . Grantland ran it anyway , not putting it together that their reporting probably contributed to the woman ’ s death . An overwhelming backlash from the trans community made a lot of high-level editors realize that they needed more trans perspectives in their work .
My own writing career started shortly into 2016 , and I was definitely a beneficiary of a media industry looking for more trans voices . What started with self-published essays about my own transition turned into reported pieces tied to trans news like North Carolina ’ s bathroom bills . From there , I challenged myself to do more and more complex reporting about the gains in rights we experienced in Obama ’ s final year , followed by the sudden impact of Trump ’ s anti-trans agenda .
The past several years have felt a bit like those first few years after graduating college : I ’ m learning how to adult in a new gender , in a new career , and doing it all in a new city . I find myself at peace with the life I ’ ve left behind to live the life I needed to live . I am filled with equal parts hope and trepidation for the next chapter .
As trans people enter the new decade , many of us also find ourselves and our rights on knife ’ s edge . Trans issues have hit the Supreme Court for the first time , with a case that could determine trans employment rights for a generation . Then there is the 2020 election , which could determine whether our rights will be further eroded or finally protected .
In the meantime , the internet is now the battleground on which we fight — against hate , against intolerance , against disinformation . But mostly , we fight for the right to exist in our own bodies . In the past decade , we have proven we are capable of taking a political punch and remaining on our feet . The trans community is stronger than we know .","In 2010, the US had its first Black president, Facebook hadn’t yet gone public, and people still thought I was a man.

The way I experienced these past 10 years as a trans woman almost mirrors the status of the trans community at large. I entered the decade ostensibly as a happily married man, trying to build my life and career while repressing my gender identity. Five years in, I found my true self through persistent self-exploration. And I’m now leaving the decade scared shitless.

Few marginalized communities have experienced such dramatic whiplash of fortunes over the course of the 2010s as trans people. Where once the public only had access to trans stories through traditional media coverage (that was rarely flattering), we exit the decade with trans people starring in regular roles on television and in film, and transgender journalists beginning to break through into the traditionally cisgender-controlled media apparatus.

This year, 24 percent of Americans reported having a close friend or family member who is transgender, according to a Public Religion Research Institute poll — that’s more than double the 11 percent who reported knowing a trans person in 2011.

Visibility has had an impact on our rights as well. In 2010, only trans people who could afford expensive surgery were able to legally change genders, and often the cisgender men who controlled psychology dictated that trans women must be attracted to men only in order to medically transition. Nonbinary people, meanwhile, were seldom given a thought even by some trans people. Now, just nine states require surgery in order to change gender marker on state IDs, while 13 states plus the District of Columbia allow nonbinary gender markers on IDs. The singular “they” was named 2019’s word of the year by Merriam-Webster.

We didn’t arrive at this moment overnight, though. The story of how we got to a point where centuries-old conceptions of gender are now being regularly challenged in popular culture begins and ends with the thing that we love to hate: the internet.

While the early internet of the 2000s established a way for trans people to connect with each other quickly and over long distances, the second wave of web progress — social media and YouTube — has helped trans people leverage visibility into substantial policy gains. But with that progress also came a conservative backlash and campaigns to discredit our basic human rights. The internet, and trans visibility at large, has devolved into a double-edged sword for the trans community. It’s a dynamic I am all too familiar with.

How we arrived at trans visibility

I don’t remember the name of the first trans person I ever knowingly met. But around 2011, I was working at a bank when a customer informed me that his daughter would be helping with his finances. He also warned me that his daughter was a little different.

“When my late wife was pregnant, we were in a car crash,” he explained. “So when my daughter was born, we thought she was a boy, but it turns out she wasn’t.” It was a sweet if inaccurate attempt at explaining his daughter’s gender identity.

The first time I met his daughter, I remember registering her trans identity. I had already been secretly reading any trans-related news I could dig up but was still feeling like an outsider to the language of the community. Despite having a million questions for her (that were really about myself), I didn’t say anything.

Over the course of increasingly frequent interactions, she never talked about her trans status, but I learned more about the rest of her life: She was a pilot and owned her own single-engine plane, flying into Maine from out of state on frequent visits to care for her aging father. She was the first trans person I had ever encountered outside of sensationalized Hollywood portrayals of deranged trans women. At the beginning of the decade, media attention was limited to the exploitative Jerry Springer episode or deceptive villain role in a movie. Trans people likely only existed in the back of the average cis person’s mind.

And then one day she opened up and thanked me for making her feel like a normal human. She said that she didn’t trust anyone else to help her at the bank because many had been dismissive of judgmental. It was a moment I’ll never forget — because it also started a long thaw of repression I had maintained for my own gender feelings. And yet, it would take several more years to work out whether and how to transition.

These years of questioning and exploration aligned with a series of high-profile trans people coming out. It was also when public consciousness on trans people and out issues starting to shift.

Chelsea Manning came out as a trans woman on the eve of her sentencing hearing in 2013, accompanied by a grainy black and white photo of her in a blond wig. While discussion of her crimes was highly politicized, for many Americans, Manning was the first trans person to receive wall-to-wall coverage in the 24/7 cable news cycle.

Then came Time Magazine’s “Transgender Tipping Point” cover featuring Laverne Cox in 2014. The magazine declared that the transgender moment had arrived, presenting trans rights as the next great civil rights struggle. Even after the “tipping point,” though, journalists and media still struggled with how to talk about trans lives and experiences.

“Anytime a transgender person would speak about their experiences in a talk show or a journalistic setting [before 2014], people felt that it was perfectly appropriate to ask detailed questions about our genitals, our bodies, our sex lives, surgeries that we’ve had, up to asking is whether or not we have orgasms. It was just the way things were,” Nick Adams, director of transgender representation at the LGBTQ media advocacy organization GLAAD, told Vox.

That media dynamic only began to shift after another pivotal Cox moment. In a 2014 interview, Katie Couric asked trans model and actress Carmen Carrera invasive questions about her genitalia and her transition. Couric’s next guest was Cox, who pointed out how Couric had been out of line. According to Adams, Cox was one of the first trans people to immediately push back on an interviewer’s inappropriate questions.

But that moment would be topped by the most public transition thus far: In 2015, Caitlyn Jenner appeared on a glamorous Vanity Fair cover. By the end of that year, most Americans were finally at least aware of the existence of a trans person.

The internet boosted trans visibility. At first, there were many positives.

In the background of all these high-profile transitions, a decade and a half of digital organizing had already been taking place, positioning the trans community for its moment in the sun. Since the trans community is relatively small, roughly only 0.6 percent of adults in the US, traditional local organizing was next to impossible outside of large cities like New York or San Francisco. For trans people, the internet became a critical revolutionary tool.

In the early 2010s, I was still closeted, with a wife and children. I didn’t access the local trans community where I lived in Maine, and I mainly used my Twitter account to follow soccer news. But around the middle of the decade, I first realized that I might need to transition and started following a handful of trans people.

Seeing them discuss topics that I was interested in, alongside trans issues or their personal transitions, was how I eased into accepting my own trans identity. Eventually, I started my own anonymous trans account, which initially was meant to document the tragicomedy of being a closeted trans woman, but it quickly became a place to take baby steps into expressing my authentic identity without suddenly jumping into real world situations.

“[The internet] was a game-changer as far as I’m concerned,” trans writer and activist Monica Roberts told Vox. “Unlike the ’90s, we now have real-time communication links where we can not only talk to each other nationally, but internationally and in an inexpensive way.”

According to Roberts, the early internet not only helped trans people organize politically, but also gave trans people access to transition resources and language to describe their gender identity on a massive scale. Starting with the rise of blogs in the early 2000s, trans people created internet spaces and conversations for their own survival. Roberts’s own blog, TransGriot, has been one of the most important sources of trans news, analysis, and activism over the course of the decade.

While trans people were discovering themselves and self-advocating over the web, the internet itself was going through a huge overhaul by 2010. The rise of YouTube and Tumblr allowed trans people to become content creators on their own, cutting out the cis media gatekeepers that long held sway over how trans people were perceived within society. Adams told Vox that trans young people have been “able to go onto YouTube and develop these really strong relationships with trans content creators who talk about their transitions, because they’re interactive in a way that mainstream media is not.”

While relatively well-known YouTubers like Gigi Gorgeous or ContraPoints announced their transitions on their channels, other smaller content creators on the medium centered their trans experiences. YouTubers like Kat Blaque, a Black trans woman, struck an interesting balance between speaking to trans issues on their channels while also offering a broader assortment of content.

For me, it was a steady mix of YouTube, Reddit, and other internet forums that eased my transition-related anxiety. One result of anti-trans propaganda is that, even for trans people, it’s hard to trust that treatments like surgery or hormones will produce the results you want. Seeing before and after photos on transition timelines of other trans people helped me conceptualize how hormone replacement therapy would work on my own body and appearance, and I eventually took the plunge.

But it wasn’t just trans people watching trans content creators — cis people were paying attention as well. According to Adams, some of the most valuable trans educators on YouTube became those who had appeal in other areas besides leading a trans life.

“People who aren’t able to get into a writers room in Hollywood, or who are not journalists, can create a cool platform on social media that extends out past the trans community and [appeal to] other people who don’t know someone who’s transgender in their life,” Adams said. Those cisgender people “are able to learn something about us because they follow someone on social media who has a smart and intelligent voice — that is a way in which I think social media can help change public attitudes about transgender people.”

Along with changing public attitudes and more awareness came initial gains in trans rights. First and perhaps most importantly, trans people in the US gained the ability to change their gender on their passports without surgery in 2010. In a time when most states still required surgery for trans people to have identification matching their lived gender, loosening the passport requirement allowed thousands of people to have accurate government ID to be able to apply for jobs and housing, cross borders, vote, and even buy alcohol without outing themselves as trans to perfect strangers.

Then in 2014, President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act barred insurance companies from excluding people with preexisting conditions — among them people with gender dysphoria. Before that, trans people with a gender dysphoria diagnosis often couldn’t access health insurance at all.

The Obama administration also barred insurance companies from making blanket exclusions on trans-related health care, opening the door for thousands of trans people to medically transition who couldn’t previously afford it. It also pressed for more trans-friendly school and anti-bullying regulations, and sought to create a safer prison environment for incarcerated trans people.

Thanks to Obama, and the sudden societal shift towards trans acceptance, I believed I would be transitioning into a more tolerant world than the one tread by my trans predecessors. The internet had been crucial in paving the way for easier trans lives through social change and policy reforms. But a new threat was looming in the background, and it was also feeding off the internet beast.

Midway through the 2010s came the serious backlash to trans visibility

After the Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that same-sex couples could legally marry, the religious right seemed poised to lose the so-called “culture wars.” The biggest LGBTQ fight in legislatures and courts until then had resulted in a devastating loss for religious and cultural conservatives. But instead of packing up and going home, the far right simply shifted their focus to a new, more vulnerable group — trans people.

That effort kicked off in earnest in 2015, mere months after Caitlyn Jenner’s Vanity Fair cover and the Supreme Court’s landmark Obergefell ruling, in a Houston referendum over the city’s LGBTQ nondiscrimination ordinance. Focusing on the law’s public accommodation protections allowing trans people to use bathrooms according to their lived gender, conservatives seized upon a narrative that trans women are really just creepy men who didn’t belong in women’s restrooms. “No men in women’s bathrooms” became the latest right-wing rallying cry as conservatives melted down over the prospect of a society that might become slightly easier for trans people to live in.

“There is an inevitable backlash against progress,” said Roberts, who lives in Houston and saw the referendum battle in person. “The conservative movement has this major feature — they always have to have an enemy to organize around.”

Though one prominent conservative would later admit that the bathroom predator narrative was based on a total myth, the Houston campaign became an early turning point in the political battle over trans rights. The following year would see North Carolina enact its now-infamous “bathroom bill” requiring trans people to use the restroom denoted by their original birth certificate in all publicly owned buildings, which included schools. Through it all, the internet was a powerful messaging and recruiting tool for the anti-trans activist movement.

It also had the desired effect of making trans people second guess whether to appear in public spaces. Around the time of North Carolina’s bathroom bill, I went to the local mall wearing a little makeup, a horrid wig, and a women’s top and jeans. I was a nervous wreck.

Due to a design quirk, the door for the family restroom was inside the women’s room. I walked inside and tried to quickly jerk the door open, but it didn’t budge. The noise drew the attention of about a half-dozen women washing their hands. My face flushed with embarrassment and fear. One mom, who was there with her little girl, chuckled and told me the same thing had just happened to her moments earlier. I half-smiled in response, not daring to use my voice while quickly sliding into a stall to do my business. Even though that woman was kind to me, growing anti-trans sentiment had put me on edge.

According to Brennan Suen, who analyzes LGBTQ media coverage for Media Matters, fear is the key factor that makes trans content go viral on social media. Where once fear of trans progress was based in part on the bathroom predator myth, it has since evolved to worries of people about trans athletes taking away athletic opportunities or trans people trying to recruit and “trans” children with irreversible medical procedures.

Trans people have “become so visible in the last 10 years, even though the community has always existed,” Suen told Vox. “It feels new to people, even if it’s not, and that is an area that is fruitful for the right to take advantage of — because when you don’t understand something and it seems strange or a little bit scary and then you’re being fed more information that is scary,” you tend to believe it.

The existence of trans people presents a fundamental threat to the gender hierarchy pushed by cultural and religious conservatives. Many Christian fundamentalists envision a particular family structure where God looks over the patriarch of the family, who is responsible for protecting and providing for his wife and kids. The mother of the family is responsible for managing the home and producing Christian children, while children must be obedient to their parents.

Raised by lenient Catholics, I too went along with gendered expectations into adulthood, mainly because I just thought that’s what a person was supposed to do. I waited to meet the love of my life to have sex. We got married, we had kids, we bought a house and moved to the suburbs. By all outside accounts, I had a good, normal life. But it didn’t feel like my life to me. The bright moments were dulled, as if felt by another person entirely.

Then I started to explore my identity. Eventually, I told my wife everything — my dysphoria as a child, how I had locked away my female side when she asked me to at age 18, how I had tried to take my own life.

I remember she and I holding each other as it became clear that things were ending. She kept asking me why. Why did I have to do this? Why did I have to do this to her? And the truth is, I never really had an answer that made sense. Nonetheless, I knew it was something I had to do for my own survival. I hit a point where I couldn’t spend another day as “him.” It physically hurt to go on. So I let him go.

Giving up my gendered spot in society has come with difficult repercussions. The little house on a hill in Maine is gone; my ex-wife and kids are no longer in my daily life. I live in a city again, by myself. It’s hard, but at least I can feel again. The good moments are sweeter, and the bad moments are sharper.

Cultural sexism — ingrained in all of us on some level — has been at the core of the conservative backlash against trans rights over the last half-decade, so it didn’t take long for far-right conservative groups to quickly spring into action to drive social fear of trans progress. In 2015, the Family Research Council developed a document that spelled out how religious conservatives should respond to the trans rights movement — and then it found its most critical partner the following year.

The election of Donald Trump was a key turning point in the conservative war on trans rights. He helped put FRC’s anti-trans plan immediately into motion; a month into office, he rolled back Obama-era guidance aimed at protecting the educational experience of trans students. Since then, the Trump administration has engaged in a widespread campaign across virtually every federal government agency to repeal or outright erase trans rights and people from government documents.

Among the administration’s efforts: banning trans troops from serving in the military, petitioning the Supreme Court to roll back employment protections under Title VII, proposing a rule to undo Affordable Care Act nondiscrimination protections for trans patients, allowing federally funded shelters to bar trans people from homeless shelters consistent with their gender identity, and requiring prisons to house trans prisoners according to their assigned sex at birth.

By the tail end of the decade, the culture war was successfully killing trans rights, and the targets were both sweeping and personal.

The far-right crusade against trans people rages on

Behind the conservative backlash is a vast right-wing network of media, social media, and online gathering places for anti-trans activists, all devoted to spreading misinformation. Far-right website Breitbart regularly puts out headlines out like “Transgender: Prediction of Malpractice Lawsuits for ‘Gender-Affirming’ Doctors.” Meanwhile, forums like Mumsnet, which began as a community message board for British mums, have become havens for transphobic comments and harassment. Other conservative outlets and anti-trans web forums try to push false information about trans-affirming medical practices under a veneer of “reasonable concerns.”

Online harassment is particularly concentrated on trans people through social media. Any trans person who receives public attention, even for non-trans related news items, is likely to face a torrent of online abuse in return. And it’s often organized behind the scenes through various anti-trans web forums and Facebook groups.

Early on in my journalism career, pretransition pictures of myself with my young children were posted and mocked on the “GenderCritical” subreddit, a gathering place for self-proclaimed feminists who oppose trans rights. I’ve since been doxed on other online forums and face a near-daily drumbeat of transphobic comments on my Twitter account. I’ve come to accept this as the necessary cost for being a trans journalist who covers trans issues.

Media Matters’s Suen said the rise of online anti-trans sentiment can be traced to the merging of the US right wing with British anti-trans feminists, which have formed an alliance to specifically target trans people with online harassment and misinformation. One particularly pernicious theory that’s been latched onto by those opposing trans rights is the concept of “rapid-onset gender dysphoria.” In 2018, Brown University researcher Lisa Littman published a survey of parents purporting to investigate transness in adolescents as being caused by social contagion.

The theory, in essence, claims that young people are being incorrectly convinced that they are trans through reading Tumblr blogs or watching YouTube videos about being trans. While Littman never spoke to trans children themselves to form her theory, she concludes that there may be a new type of gender dysphoria being spread through social media and peer pressure. Her study has since been heavily revised following critique from trans people and the wider scientific community.

Ironically, it’s trans visibility that forms the basis for the theory of “rapid-onset gender dysphoria.” According to Suen, Littman correctly cites evidence of growing numbers of trans adolescents presenting at gender clinics as evidence of a possible new type of gender dysphoria diagnosis. But it’s likely Littman is really just seeing the inevitable result of a commensurate growth in trans youth visibility — children more comfortable to express their gender identity because of trans YouTube creators and reality shows like I Am Jazz, about the life of young trans girl Jazz Jennings, who transitioned at age 5.

Despite relatively little scientific and academic grounding, “rapid-onset gender dysphoria” has become part of a full-fledged media narrative, especially within right-wing and British media. Over the past few years, the theory has been discussed deeply in the pages of the Wall Street Journal, the Times of London, and many other far-right blogs in part because numerous online anti-trans spaces have popped up in recent years to push conspiracy theories about the trans community and trans health care.

According to Suen, it’s up to the media to pushback on anti-trans disinformation campaigns in a more substantial way than they are currently. “Mainstream media has a responsibility to not just treat [trans people] with dignity, but to give accurate information,” he said. “The big issue here is that the conversation on the right is extremely loud and it is very often factually incorrect... There’s a true public health crisis that can arise from allowing the right to dominate the conversation.”

Though the financial state of media, and specifically LGBTQ media, is currently fairly grim, there has been a substantial change in the way mainstream media has covered trans issues. Katie Couric’s 2014 interview with Carmen Carrera and Laverne Cox came just months after the publication of “Dr. V’s Magical Putter,” by now-defunct sports outlet Grantland, in which a cisgender male journalist investigated the creator of an allegedly high-tech putter, and then discovered that its creator, Essay Anne Vanderbilt, was a trans woman.

Rather than pausing to consider the implications of revealing that information to the public, the writer and editors pressed on, and Vanderbilt herself ended up taking her own life just weeks before the story was published. Grantland ran it anyway, not putting it together that their reporting probably contributed to the woman’s death. An overwhelming backlash from the trans community made a lot of high-level editors realize that they needed more trans perspectives in their work.

My own writing career started shortly into 2016, and I was definitely a beneficiary of a media industry looking for more trans voices. What started with self-published essays about my own transition turned into reported pieces tied to trans news like North Carolina’s bathroom bills. From there, I challenged myself to do more and more complex reporting about the gains in rights we experienced in Obama’s final year, followed by the sudden impact of Trump’s anti-trans agenda.

The past several years have felt a bit like those first few years after graduating college: I’m learning how to adult in a new gender, in a new career, and doing it all in a new city. I find myself at peace with the life I’ve left behind to live the life I needed to live. I am filled with equal parts hope and trepidation for the next chapter.

As trans people enter the new decade, many of us also find ourselves and our rights on knife’s edge. Trans issues have hit the Supreme Court for the first time, with a case that could determine trans employment rights for a generation. Then there is the 2020 election, which could determine whether our rights will be further eroded or finally protected.

In the meantime, the internet is now the battleground on which we fight — against hate, against intolerance, against disinformation. But mostly, we fight for the right to exist in our own bodies. In the past decade, we have proven we are capable of taking a political punch and remaining on our feet. The trans community is stronger than we know.",www.vox.com,left,fkNy144reXhwPFf1

The announcement left the room in stunned silence, except for a small child asking over and over, ""Why?""

""We were past the metal detectors, we were just a few feet away from the clerk,"" said Amber Beierle. ""And then our attorney was handed a one-page document. Apparently, it was Justice Kennedy telling us, No.""

Beierle said the toughest moment was when she called her mother, who was driving into town to help celebrate. ""There's just something about hearing your mom's voice that makes everything seem a little more real,"" she said.

Beierle began to choke up on the phone as she tried to fight back tears. She said she and her partner, Rachael Beierle, were not going to give up their fight, but it was an especially bitter moment since they had never been this close to getting married before.

In Las Vegas, wedding chapels had photographers ready to capture two brides in white dresses while ordained Elvis impersonators practiced their lines.

At several points throughout the day, couples thought marriages might begin. But as courts began to close, Diana Alba, the Clark County clerk, said no one in the state would be issuing marriage licenses Wednesday, and she didn't know when they might begin. ""I wish I knew a date,"" she said.

Tara Traynor and her fiancee, Cathy Grimes, had been among those waiting at the Clark County Marriage License Bureau, checking their phones for court developments and letting straight couples cut in front of them while they waited for the legal OK to get a license themselves.

""It's kind of disheartening,"" Traynor said. ""We wait and wait, and we're hopeful.""

Traynor and Grimes have been together for eight years and were among the first couples to register as domestic partners in Nevada. They went straight to the bureau when they thought they could get a license.

""We wanted to be a part of history,"" Traynor said.",www.foxnews.com,right,TBbkLDPYn11PR0sX

While boycott petitions against `` Duck Dynasty '' home A & E take off , the network itself is staying quiet .
Since its Wednesday decision to `` indefinitely '' suspend Phil Robertson , one of the stars of its highly rated reality series , A & E has yet to publicly clarify what the future of the show might be , what they 'll do with their block of reruns , or even what it really means to be `` indefinitely '' suspended .
The network 's lack of communication has done nothing to stem the tide of detractors who strongly disagree with its decision to put Robertson on the bench over remarks quoted in GQ magazine , in which he called homosexuality a sin , citing the Bible . A Change.org petition demanding that Robertson be reinstated and the network issue an apology was steadily climbing toward 100,000 signatures Friday .
A separate petition at a website called IStandWithPhil.com makes a similar appeal . Hosted by the online community Faith Driven Consumers , the website helps its members spend their money with companies that fall in line with their spiritual beliefs . The petition on IStandWithPhil.com had surpassed 130,000 signatures by Friday evening .
Those who 've signed the IStandWithPhil.com petition are asking for their `` views ( to ) be treated with equality and respect in America 's rich rainbow of diversity , '' and for the `` network to immediately reinstate Mr. Robertson to 'Duck Dynasty , ' and to formally apologize to him , his family , and the millions of viewers who tune in every week , stand by him , and share his worldview .

Stelter ca n't see the Robertsons or A & E wanting to end the televised hunting-business fun so soon , but if it were to happen , it would undoubtedly be a blow to the network , he said .

lgbt_rights,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/iowa-faith-freedom-summit-2015-117346.html?hp=t4_r,"In Iowa, GOP field stresses opposition to same-sex marriage ",2015-04-26,James Hohmann,"WAUKEE , Iowa—Leading Republican presidential candidates came to Iowa Saturday to assure social conservatives that they still oppose gay marriage , despite shifting public attitudes and the recent backlash against religious liberty laws .
Speaking to some 1,000 evangelicals at the Point of Grace Church in this suburb of Des Moines , a procession of presidential candidates expressed support for a constitutional amendment that would allow states to re-ban gay marriage if the Supreme Court recognizes a right to such unions .
Many GOP elites , in the donor and operative class , want to move beyond gay marriage . They think it ’ s a losing issue for the party in the long-term and makes outreach to younger voters more difficult . But social conservatives are the most influential constituency in the caucuses , which kick off the nominating process .
The nuanced answers from many Republican candidates in recent months took a backburner Saturday night , as several of the candidates tried to outdo one another on who could speak out most strongly against a right to gay marriage .
“ Marriage as an institution existed before even government itself , ” declared Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , kicking off the five-hour Faith & Freedom Summit , at which nine likely presidential candidates spoke . “ The institution of marriage as between one man and one woman existed even before our laws existed . ”
Scott Walker noted that he voted for Wisconsin ’ s constitutional ban and defended it through the judicial process , until the Supreme Court refused to review a lower court ruling that his state issue marriage licenses to gay couples .
“ Let me be clear , I believe marriage is between one man and one woman , ” the Wisconsin governor said . “ I still hold out hope that the Supreme Court will rule , as has been the tradition in the past , that the states are the places that get to define what marriage is . If for some reason they don ’ t … I believe it ’ s reasonable for the people of America to consider a constitutional amendment that would affirm the ability of states to do just that . ”
Bobby Jindal got out front on the topic by writing an op-ed this week that was headlined , “ I ’ m holding firm against gay marriage. ” There were hundreds of printouts of the piece , which ran in the New York Times , scattered throughout the mega-church .
The Louisiana governor ’ s speech was interrupted twice by standing ovations as he pledged his support for a religious freedom law in his home state that ’ s as strong as the one enacted in Indiana . The Republican governor there , Mike Pence , prodded his legislature to enact a “ fix ” after threats of boycotts on the state and massive backlash from the business community .
Jindal said he won ’ t back down . “ Corporate America is not going to bully the governor of Louisiana , ” he said . “ Here ’ s my message to Hollywood : the United States of America did not create religious liberty . Religious liberty created the United States of America. ” Both lines got him standing ovations .
Asked after his speech whether he would attend a gay wedding , Jindal told reporters that he would “ if it ’ s someone I loved and cared for. ” So far , he has not been to one .
Other speakers , including former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee , praised Jindal for the Times piece .
Steve King , the Republican congressman from northwest Iowa , devoted his entire speech at the event to arguing that a Supreme Court decision recognizing a right to gay marriage would be illegitimate . He compared such a decision to the 1857 Dred Scott decision , which upheld slavery and said African-Americans were not entitled to the protections of U.S. citizens .
“ This Supreme Court has made some good decisions too , but we should not see them as the final answer , ” King said . “ There ’ s no way I can accept that kind of decision . ”
King touted legislation he introduced that would limit the jurisdiction of federal courts to hear marriage cases . He said he ’ ll be at the Supreme Court Tuesday when the justices hear arguments , and he asked the crowd to pray with him that they make the right choice .
“ Marriage is at stake , ” he said . “ The arguments before that court may well determine the future of this country . ”
Ted Cruz is seen by many Iowa GOP insiders as having the upper hand right now with social conservatives . But the Texas senator has taken heat in the state this week for appearing at a fundraiser at the home of two openly gay men . At that private event , he was asked how he would react if he found out one of his daughters was gay , and he said he would love her unconditionally .
Cruz vigorously defended his appearance at the fundraiser , which he said does not reflect his steadfast opposition to gay marriage . Asked twice if he was aware that a 23-year-old had apparently overdosed on drugs at the same apartment where he went for the fundraiser just six months ago , Cruz declined to answer .
“ You don ’ t have to like my answer , but I do get to give my answer , ” Cruz told reporters , stressing that it was primarily a pro-Israel fundraiser .
He declined to say whether he regretted the venue choice but attacked the media for covering the appearance .
“ Unfortunately , our good friends in the press caricature support for traditional marriage in terms of animus , ” he said . “ The only explanation that makes sense to reporters is that anyone who supports traditional marriage … must be somehow motivated by hatred for those who are homosexuals . It ’ s why this story seems so puzzling to the media . ”
Cruz said he is concerned that women like the owner of an Indiana pizzeria will suffer because they oppose gay marriage . “ The Scripture commands us to love everyone , and that ought to be a standard that applies across the board , ” he said .
During his speech to the group , Cruz said liberals are obsessed with “ mandatory gay marriage in all 50 states. ” Like King , he asked the audience to join him in prayer on the day of the oral arguments . He told the story of an Iowa couple who stopped putting on weddings after a court ordered them to perform services for gays .
He touted his support for the constitutional amendment that would let states choose , and he said he has introduced a bill similar to King ’ s that strips the federal courts of any jurisdiction over gay marriage-related litigation .
Huckabee has taken heat this week in the press for saying that the United States is rapidly moving toward “ the criminalization of Christianity . ”
The former governor , who won the 2008 Iowa caucuses and is expected to announce he ’ s running again on May 5 , doubled down on his comment .
“ Let me be clear : I ’ m not backing off because what I ’ m saying is true , ” he said . “ We ’ re criminalizing Christianity in this country by telling people who hold to an orthodox worldview of biblical marriage that if you still believe that … you will be guilty of discrimination , which could result in some kind of civil or criminal action against you . ”
Jeb Bush skipped the cattle call – this crowd is unlikely to go for him in the caucuses – but sent a surrogate to speak for him . Jordan Sekulow told the room that “ Gov . Bush supports traditional marriage . ”
“ He was the first of the potential candidates to say , ‘ I stand with Gov . Pence in doing the right thing , ’ ” said Sekulow , who added that a Bush Justice Department would protect religious freedom .
One of the only potential candidates who did not mention gay marriage in his speech was Rand Paul , the Kentucky senator who is trying to appeal to libertarians and social conservatives . He ’ s taken a nuanced position , in which he says he believes in traditional marriage but that the law should be neutral on the matter and that it should ultimately be up to the states .
What Paul focused on instead was his strong opposition to abortion . He said he wants to put Democrats on the defensive this cycle over their support for partial-birth abortion , which he said the vast majority of Americans oppose .
“ Are there no exceptions to abortion ? ” he asked . “ I think we can win this argument . I plan on being part of it . ”","WAUKEE, Iowa—Leading Republican presidential candidates came to Iowa Saturday to assure social conservatives that they still oppose gay marriage, despite shifting public attitudes and the recent backlash against religious liberty laws.

Speaking to some 1,000 evangelicals at the Point of Grace Church in this suburb of Des Moines, a procession of presidential candidates expressed support for a constitutional amendment that would allow states to re-ban gay marriage if the Supreme Court recognizes a right to such unions.

Many GOP elites, in the donor and operative class, want to move beyond gay marriage. They think it’s a losing issue for the party in the long-term and makes outreach to younger voters more difficult. But social conservatives are the most influential constituency in the caucuses, which kick off the nominating process.

The nuanced answers from many Republican candidates in recent months took a backburner Saturday night, as several of the candidates tried to outdo one another on who could speak out most strongly against a right to gay marriage.

“Marriage as an institution existed before even government itself,” declared Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, kicking off the five-hour Faith & Freedom Summit, at which nine likely presidential candidates spoke. “The institution of marriage as between one man and one woman existed even before our laws existed.”

Scott Walker noted that he voted for Wisconsin’s constitutional ban and defended it through the judicial process, until the Supreme Court refused to review a lower court ruling that his state issue marriage licenses to gay couples.

“Let me be clear, I believe marriage is between one man and one woman,” the Wisconsin governor said. “I still hold out hope that the Supreme Court will rule, as has been the tradition in the past, that the states are the places that get to define what marriage is. If for some reason they don’t … I believe it’s reasonable for the people of America to consider a constitutional amendment that would affirm the ability of states to do just that.”

Bobby Jindal got out front on the topic by writing an op-ed this week that was headlined, “I’m holding firm against gay marriage.” There were hundreds of printouts of the piece, which ran in the New York Times, scattered throughout the mega-church.

The Louisiana governor’s speech was interrupted twice by standing ovations as he pledged his support for a religious freedom law in his home state that’s as strong as the one enacted in Indiana. The Republican governor there, Mike Pence, prodded his legislature to enact a “fix” after threats of boycotts on the state and massive backlash from the business community.

Jindal said he won’t back down. “Corporate America is not going to bully the governor of Louisiana,” he said. “Here’s my message to Hollywood: the United States of America did not create religious liberty. Religious liberty created the United States of America.” Both lines got him standing ovations.

Asked after his speech whether he would attend a gay wedding, Jindal told reporters that he would “if it’s someone I loved and cared for.” So far, he has not been to one.

Other speakers, including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, praised Jindal for the Times piece.

Steve King, the Republican congressman from northwest Iowa, devoted his entire speech at the event to arguing that a Supreme Court decision recognizing a right to gay marriage would be illegitimate. He compared such a decision to the 1857 Dred Scott decision, which upheld slavery and said African-Americans were not entitled to the protections of U.S. citizens.

“This Supreme Court has made some good decisions too, but we should not see them as the final answer,” King said. “There’s no way I can accept that kind of decision.”

King touted legislation he introduced that would limit the jurisdiction of federal courts to hear marriage cases. He said he’ll be at the Supreme Court Tuesday when the justices hear arguments, and he asked the crowd to pray with him that they make the right choice.

“Marriage is at stake,” he said. “The arguments before that court may well determine the future of this country.”

Ted Cruz is seen by many Iowa GOP insiders as having the upper hand right now with social conservatives. But the Texas senator has taken heat in the state this week for appearing at a fundraiser at the home of two openly gay men. At that private event, he was asked how he would react if he found out one of his daughters was gay, and he said he would love her unconditionally.

Cruz vigorously defended his appearance at the fundraiser, which he said does not reflect his steadfast opposition to gay marriage. Asked twice if he was aware that a 23-year-old had apparently overdosed on drugs at the same apartment where he went for the fundraiser just six months ago, Cruz declined to answer.

“You don’t have to like my answer, but I do get to give my answer,” Cruz told reporters, stressing that it was primarily a pro-Israel fundraiser.

He declined to say whether he regretted the venue choice but attacked the media for covering the appearance.

“Unfortunately, our good friends in the press caricature support for traditional marriage in terms of animus,” he said. “The only explanation that makes sense to reporters is that anyone who supports traditional marriage … must be somehow motivated by hatred for those who are homosexuals. It’s why this story seems so puzzling to the media.”

Cruz said he is concerned that women like the owner of an Indiana pizzeria will suffer because they oppose gay marriage. “The Scripture commands us to love everyone, and that ought to be a standard that applies across the board,” he said.

During his speech to the group, Cruz said liberals are obsessed with “mandatory gay marriage in all 50 states.” Like King, he asked the audience to join him in prayer on the day of the oral arguments. He told the story of an Iowa couple who stopped putting on weddings after a court ordered them to perform services for gays.

He touted his support for the constitutional amendment that would let states choose, and he said he has introduced a bill similar to King’s that strips the federal courts of any jurisdiction over gay marriage-related litigation.

Huckabee has taken heat this week in the press for saying that the United States is rapidly moving toward “the criminalization of Christianity.”

The former governor, who won the 2008 Iowa caucuses and is expected to announce he’s running again on May 5, doubled down on his comment.

“Let me be clear: I’m not backing off because what I’m saying is true,” he said. “We’re criminalizing Christianity in this country by telling people who hold to an orthodox worldview of biblical marriage that if you still believe that … you will be guilty of discrimination, which could result in some kind of civil or criminal action against you.”

Jeb Bush skipped the cattle call – this crowd is unlikely to go for him in the caucuses – but sent a surrogate to speak for him. Jordan Sekulow told the room that “Gov. Bush supports traditional marriage.”

“He was the first of the potential candidates to say, ‘I stand with Gov. Pence in doing the right thing,’” said Sekulow, who added that a Bush Justice Department would protect religious freedom.

One of the only potential candidates who did not mention gay marriage in his speech was Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator who is trying to appeal to libertarians and social conservatives. He’s taken a nuanced position, in which he says he believes in traditional marriage but that the law should be neutral on the matter and that it should ultimately be up to the states.

What Paul focused on instead was his strong opposition to abortion. He said he wants to put Democrats on the defensive this cycle over their support for partial-birth abortion, which he said the vast majority of Americans oppose.

“Are there no exceptions to abortion?” he asked. “I think we can win this argument. I plan on being part of it.”",www.politico.com,left,jG1iURJpRBammKzj

Byron Wolf","U.S. Sen . Rob Portman , R-Ohio , once on the short-list to be Mitt Romney 's 2012 running mate , has reversed his opposition to gay marriage , revealing that his own son is gay .
Portman Thursday told reporters from several Ohio newspapers that when his son , Will , 21 , informed him that he was gay two years ago , `` It allowed me to think of this issue from a new perspective , and that 's of a dad who loves his son a lot and wants him to have the same opportunities that his brother and sister would have , to have a relationship like Jane and I have had for over 26 years , '' according to an interview with the Cleveland Plain Dealer .
The newspaper also noted that Portman , who as a congressman backed the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act , thinks part of the law should be repealed . The Supreme Court is set to hear a challenge to the case later this month .

Portman said he believes that same-sex couples who marry legally in states where it 's allowed should get the federal benefits that are granted to heterosexual married couples but are n't currently extended to gay married couples because of the Defense of Marriage Act , such as the ability to file joint tax returns .
The news comes at a time when several high-profile Republicans , including former presidential candidate Jon Huntsman , have endorsed gay marriage and when public opinion on the issue appears to be shifting .

I ’ m no theologian , but I ’ m pretty sure the Bible is against sex with anyone you ’ re not married to , so forgive me if I take Cruz ’ s word with a grain of self-serving salt .
Once the suspension was announced Cruz retorted , “ By taking quick action and removing Robertson from future filming , A & E has sent a strong message that discrimination is neither a Christian nor an American value . ”
Phil Robertson expressed a personal belief based on his religious faith . He harmed no one . He suggested harming no one . What discrimination did he commit ?
For his words , Phil Robertson has been labeled “ anti-gay ” and “ intolerant. ” Those labeling him have routinely mocked him as ignorant , stupid , a redneck , hillbilly , trash and pretty much every pejorative you can think of to describe someone of his background . How tolerant .
Tolerance is a one-way street , and it has nothing to do with tolerance at all .
Merriam-Webster defines tolerance as “ sympathy or indulgence for beliefs or practices differing from or conflicting with one 's own ” and “ the act of allowing something : toleration. ” Since Phil Robertson did not harm anyone nor call for anyone to be harmed , but rather simply stated his religious belief that homosexuality is a sin , he has conformed perfectly with the actual definition of “ tolerance . ”
Progressives are offended by what he said , but , in all sincerity , who gives a damn ?
In a few short decades we ’ ve transformed from a nation of Americans who laughed at Richard Pryor , George Carlin , Airplane ! and Mel Brooks movies to a nation overrun with hyphenates , self-segregated subsets and adult children with fragile psyches who demand any perceived affront be remedied immediately in a manner they so choose . Essentially , we ’ re being ruled by the whims of a temper tantrum .
We have gone from the Land of the Free to the family living in fear in the Twilight Zone episode “ It ’ s a Good Life. ” Upset the child with enormous powers and be thought out of existence .
I ’ m generally indifferent on so-called “ gay issues. ” I don ’ t care what anyone does in their personal lives as long as whoever they do it with is old enough and willing . I oppose gay marriage on grounds of language , not morality . On the issue of sin – it ’ s not government ’ s job and they can explain their lives to God , as I ’ ll have to explain mine . But fascism is fascism , and it has to stop .
It has to stop not only from gay groups , but from every progressive victim-porn peddler organization . And for their own good , too . If they care at all , and I mean really care , about the causes they claim to fight for , crying “ wolf ” will serve only to numb the public to real affronts to individuals by others .
The incessant cries of racism by progressives on MSNBC to any policy critique of the president has done more damage to victims of racism than all those southern Democrat Party Klansmen ever did . By making the word mean anything , they make it mean nothing , and real racism is met with a collective “ here we go again . ”
This won ’ t happen , of course , because although diluting real victims of bigotry with political ploys harms people , it ’ s great for fundraising . And therein lies the rub .
How about we all agree on a simple , basic principle : We won ’ t care what you do in your private life and you extend the same courtesy to our minds .
This deal will never , and can never , be accepted by progressives because your mind is the most dangerous obstacle their agenda faces . As long as you are able and allowed to think for yourself , they can ’ t fully win . If people are exposed to the ideals and values of the Robertsons , they will be reminded that the keys to success and happiness lie not in government but in family . If they don ’ t , we ’ ll all be “ ducked ” one day .","I’m not a fan of Duck Dynasty. There, I said it.

I’m no theologian, but I’m pretty sure the Bible is against sex with anyone you’re not married to, so forgive me if I take Cruz’s word with a grain of self-serving salt.

Once the suspension was announced Cruz retorted, “By taking quick action and removing Robertson from future filming, A&E has sent a strong message that discrimination is neither a Christian nor an American value.”

Forgive my ignorance, but what discrimination?

Phil Robertson expressed a personal belief based on his religious faith. He harmed no one. He suggested harming no one. What discrimination did he commit?

For his words, Phil Robertson has been labeled “anti-gay” and “intolerant.” Those labeling him have routinely mocked him as ignorant, stupid, a redneck, hillbilly, trash and pretty much every pejorative you can think of to describe someone of his background. How tolerant.

Tolerance is a one-way street, and it has nothing to do with tolerance at all.

Merriam-Webster defines tolerance as “sympathy or indulgence for beliefs or practices differing from or conflicting with one's own” and “the act of allowing something : toleration.” Since Phil Robertson did not harm anyone nor call for anyone to be harmed, but rather simply stated his religious belief that homosexuality is a sin, he has conformed perfectly with the actual definition of “tolerance.”

Progressives are offended by what he said, but, in all sincerity, who gives a damn?

In a few short decades we’ve transformed from a nation of Americans who laughed at Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Airplane! and Mel Brooks movies to a nation overrun with hyphenates, self-segregated subsets and adult children with fragile psyches who demand any perceived affront be remedied immediately in a manner they so choose. Essentially, we’re being ruled by the whims of a temper tantrum.

We have gone from the Land of the Free to the family living in fear in the Twilight Zone episode “It’s a Good Life.” Upset the child with enormous powers and be thought out of existence.

I’m generally indifferent on so-called “gay issues.” I don’t care what anyone does in their personal lives as long as whoever they do it with is old enough and willing. I oppose gay marriage on grounds of language, not morality. On the issue of sin – it’s not government’s job and they can explain their lives to God, as I’ll have to explain mine. But fascism is fascism, and it has to stop.

It has to stop not only from gay groups, but from every progressive victim-porn peddler organization. And for their own good, too. If they care at all, and I mean really care, about the causes they claim to fight for, crying “wolf” will serve only to numb the public to real affronts to individuals by others.

The incessant cries of racism by progressives on MSNBC to any policy critique of the president has done more damage to victims of racism than all those southern Democrat Party Klansmen ever did. By making the word mean anything, they make it mean nothing, and real racism is met with a collective “here we go again.”

This won’t happen, of course, because although diluting real victims of bigotry with political ploys harms people, it’s great for fundraising. And therein lies the rub.

How about we all agree on a simple, basic principle: We won’t care what you do in your private life and you extend the same courtesy to our minds.

This deal will never, and can never, be accepted by progressives because your mind is the most dangerous obstacle their agenda faces. As long as you are able and allowed to think for yourself, they can’t fully win. If people are exposed to the ideals and values of the Robertsons, they will be reminded that the keys to success and happiness lie not in government but in family. If they don’t, we’ll all be “ducked” one day.",www.townhall.com,right,ynRyUXJLouZJWbGw

lgbt_rights,The Daily Caller,2,https://dailycaller.com/2019/07/18/transgender-brazilian-wax-jessica-yaniv-predator/,Trans Woman Shutters Immigrant’s Business For Refusing To Wax Male Genitalia,2019-07-18,,"Jessica Yaniv , a transgender Canadian woman , has filed over a dozen gender-identity discrimination complaints against women in the Vancouver area who have refused to perform Brazilian bikini wax procedures on her male genitalia .
Yaniv ’ s identity was revealed Wednesday after the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal overturned an order protecting Yaniv ’ s identity from being disclosed by the Canadian press . However , Yaniv ’ s identity has long been suspected by the public , according to John Carpay , President of the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms , which is representing five women Yaniv has filed complaints against .
One proud lesbian . I ’ ll never give up fighting for human rights equality . # LGBTQoftwitter pic.twitter.com/sKyjJ0Um39 — Jessica Yaniv ( @ trustednerd ) June 16 , 2019
Carpay says the women Yaniv has filed complaints against are mostly poor immigrant women who speak English as a second language . He believes multiple women have likely been forced to shut down their businesses as a result of Yaniv ’ s complaints , as he told ███ . In the hearing Wednesday , Maria Da Silva , an immigrant from Brazil with young children , testified that Yaniv ’ s complaint forced her to close the Brazilian wax business she operated out of her home .
The women who refused Yaniv the procedure say they are not qualified to perform a Brazilian wax service on male genitalia , as it is entirely different from the service intended for women . An esthetician who does perform Brazilian waxes on men testified at an earlier hearing that this service requires completely different expertise .
The Human Rights Tribunal has not announced their decision on the cases , and will not do so until a few weeks or months have passed , according to Carpay .
Besides being unqualified for the procedure , Carpay says the women facing complaints have religious and safety reasons for denying Yaniv the service . Esthetician Sukhi Hehar Gill , a practicing Sikh , says she denied Yaniv ’ s request for the procedure because it is contrary to her faith to travel to a client ’ s house if they are biologically male , according to the Justice Centre .
Yaniv posted a tweet Thursday arguing the refusal of women to wax her genitalia is “ about businesses and individuals using their religion and culture to refuse service to protected groups . ”
This is not about waxing . This is about businesses and individuals using their religion and culture to refuse service to protected groups because -they- don ’ t agree with it or the person and use that to illegally discriminate contrary to the BC Human Rights Code and the CHRC . https : //t.co/34XIklXXbh — Jessica Yaniv ( @ trustednerd ) July 18 , 2019
It is “ certainly very traumatic ” for these women to go before the Human Rights Tribunal , said Carpay .
“ Some of my clients have been very significantly affected on a personal level .

Yaniv also faces accusations of online predatory behavior towards underage girls , but this was not introduced in court proceedings .
Morgane Oger , a transgender woman who is a candidate for the Vancouver-Centre National Democratic Party nomination and is a transgender activist , says she spent months researching allegations of inappropriate online predatory behavior by Yaniv , according to her April 2019 blog post . Oger says she spoke to women and girls who have accused Yaniv of predatory behavior .
“ I tracked down and heard witnesses with first-person accounts of Jessica ’ s online behaviour spanning 2013 to 2018 , ” Oger said . “ Their stories included reports and evidence of outrageously inappropriate acts , some towards children who are tweens and teens . Some of the material has survived as screenshots , and what I saw shows what strikes me as a pattern of predatory behaviour . ”
Oger says she “ urged each woman to make a complaint with police , ” about Jessica Yaniv ’ s alleged behavior towards them .
As a transgender woman herself , Oger was careful to stress her belief that Yaniv ’ s behavior is entirely separate from her transgender identity , and to condemn those who echoed the allegations in a way that was “ steeped in transphobia. ” Oger noted the allegations against Yaniv have not been proven or ruled on by a court .
Oger says Yaniv told her the allegedly predatorial statements were taken out of context . Oger added that to her knowledge , Yaniv has never come publicly clean about this behavior .

Carpay expressed confidence in the arguments the estheticians made . “ We believe the women have strong grounds for having refused the request , ” he told ███ . “ We think we have a strong argument . ”","Jessica Yaniv, a transgender Canadian woman, has filed over a dozen gender-identity discrimination complaints against women in the Vancouver area who have refused to perform Brazilian bikini wax procedures on her male genitalia.

Yaniv’s identity was revealed Wednesday after the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal overturned an order protecting Yaniv’s identity from being disclosed by the Canadian press. However, Yaniv’s identity has long been suspected by the public, according to John Carpay, President of the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms, which is representing five women Yaniv has filed complaints against.

Carpay says the women Yaniv has filed complaints against are mostly poor immigrant women who speak English as a second language. He believes multiple women have likely been forced to shut down their businesses as a result of Yaniv’s complaints, as he told the Daily Caller. In the hearing Wednesday, Maria Da Silva, an immigrant from Brazil with young children, testified that Yaniv’s complaint forced her to close the Brazilian wax business she operated out of her home.

The women who refused Yaniv the procedure say they are not qualified to perform a Brazilian wax service on male genitalia, as it is entirely different from the service intended for women. An esthetician who does perform Brazilian waxes on men testified at an earlier hearing that this service requires completely different expertise.

The Human Rights Tribunal has not announced their decision on the cases, and will not do so until a few weeks or months have passed, according to Carpay.

Besides being unqualified for the procedure, Carpay says the women facing complaints have religious and safety reasons for denying Yaniv the service. Esthetician Sukhi Hehar Gill, a practicing Sikh, says she denied Yaniv’s request for the procedure because it is contrary to her faith to travel to a client’s house if they are biologically male, according to the Justice Centre.

Yaniv posted a tweet Thursday arguing the refusal of women to wax her genitalia is “about businesses and individuals using their religion and culture to refuse service to protected groups.”

This is not about waxing. This is about businesses and individuals using their religion and culture to refuse service to protected groups because -they- don’t agree with it or the person and use that to illegally discriminate contrary to the BC Human Rights Code and the CHRC. https://t.co/34XIklXXbh — Jessica Yaniv (@trustednerd) July 18, 2019

It is “certainly very traumatic” for these women to go before the Human Rights Tribunal, said Carpay.

“Some of my clients have been very significantly affected on a personal level. [Another client also] closed her business, she has been depressed, anxious, sleepless and that has gone on for a period of many many months,” said Justice Centre lawyer Jay Cameron, according to the Post Millennial.

Even if the women are successful in defending themselves against the allegations of discrimination in violation of section eight of the British Columbia Human Rights Code, the complaint could cost them $10,000, $20,000 or even $30,000 in legal fees, said Carpay.

Alliance Defending Freedom is representing Donald and Evelyn Knapp , ordained ministers who own the Hitching Post Wedding Chapel in Coeur d ’ Alene .
“ Right now they are at risk of being prosecuted , ” their ADF attorney , Jeremy Tedesco , told me . “ The threat of enforcement is more than just credible . ”
According to the lawsuit , the wedding chapel is registered with the state as a “ religious corporation ” limited to performing “ one-man-one-woman marriages as defined by the Holy Bible . ”
But the chapel is also registered as a for-profit business – not as a church or place of worship – and city officials said that means the owners must comply with a local nondiscrimination ordinance .
That ordinance , passed last year , prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation , and it applies to housing , employment and public accommodation .
City Attorney Warren Wilson told The Spokesman-Review in May that the Hitching Post Wedding Chapel likely would be required to follow the ordinance .
“ I would think that the Hitching Post would probably be considered a place of public accommodation that would be subject to the ordinance , ” he said .
He also told television station KXLY that any wedding chapel that turns away a gay couple would in theory be violating the law , “ and you ’ re looking at a potential misdemeanor citation . ”
Wilson confirmed to Knapp my worst fear -- that even ordained ministers would be required to perform same-sex weddings .
“ Wilson also responded that Mr. Knapp was not exempt from the ordinance because the Hitching Post was a business and not a church , ” the lawsuit states .
And if he refused to perform the ceremonies , Wilson reportedly told the minister that he could be fined up to $ 1,000 and sentenced to up to 180 days in jail .
Now all of that was a moot point because , until last week , gay marriage was not legal in Idaho .
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued an order on May 13 allowing same-sex marriages to commence in Idaho on Oct. 15 . Two days later , the folks at the Hitching Post received a telephone call .
A man had called to inquire about a same-sex wedding ceremony . The Hitching Post declined , putting it in violation of the law .
City officials did not respond to my requests for an interview , nor did they respond to requests from local news outlets .
“ The government should not force ordained ministers to act contrary to their faith under threat of jail time and criminal fines , ” Tedesco said .
“ The city is on seriously flawed legal ground , and our lawsuit intends to ensure that this couple ’ s freedom to adhere to their own faith as pastors is protected , just as the First Amendment intended . ”
Alliance Defending Freedom also filed a temporary restraining order to stop the city from enforcing the ordinance .
“ The Knapps are in fear that if they exercise their First Amendment rights they will be cited , prosecuted and sent to jail , ” Tedesco told me .
It ’ s hard to believe this could happen in the United States . But as the lawsuit states , the Knapps are in a “ constant state of fear that they may have to go to jail , pay substantial fines , or both , resulting in them losing the business that God has called them to operate and which they have faithfully operated for 25 years . ”
The lawsuit came the same week that the city of Houston issued subpoenas demanding that five Christian pastors turn over sermons dealing with homosexuality and gender identity .
What in heaven ’ s name is happening to our country , folks ? I was under the assumption that churches and pastors would not be impacted by same-sex marriage .
“ The other side insisted this would never happen – that pastors would not have to perform same-sex marriages , ” Tedesco told me . “ The reality is – it ’ s already happening . ”
Tony Perkins , president of the Family Research Council , told me it ’ s “ open season on Americans who refuse to bow to the government ’ s redefinition of marriage . ”
“ Americans are witnesses to the reality that redefining marriage is less about the marriage altar and more about fundamentally altering the freedoms of the other 98 percent of Americans , ” Perkins said .
Why should evangelical Christian ministers be forced to perform and celebrate any marriage that conflicts with their beliefs ?
“ This is the brave new world of government-sanctioned same-sex unions – where Americans are forced to celebrate these unions regardless of their religious beliefs , ” Perkins told me .
As I write in my new book , “ God Less America , ” we are living in a day when those who support traditional marriage are coming under fierce attack .
The incidents in Houston and now in Coeur d ’ Alene are the just the latest examples of a disturbing trend in the culture war – direct attacks on clergy .
“ Government officials are making clear they will use their government power to punish those who oppose the advances of homosexual activists , ” Perkins said .
No one should be discriminated against but have you noticed that any time a city passes a “ nondiscrimination ” ordinance , it ’ s the Christians who wind up being discriminated against ?","Two Christian ministers who own an Idaho wedding chapel were told they had to either perform same-sex weddings or face jail time and up to a $1,000 fine, according to a lawsuit filed Friday in federal court.

Nathan Deal is facing mounting pressure from Hollywood heavyweights to veto a religious liberty bill that critics describe as anti-gay , with some threatening a boycott that could cost the state billions in business and thousands of jobs .
In the past week , nearly three-dozen actors , directors and studio companies have threated to pull out of lucrative projects in Georgia -- a popular filming location dubbed the “ Hollywood of the South ” -- if Deal signs the bill . The Republican governor has until May 3 to decide whether to do so .
“ I ’ ll try to act as expeditiously as possible , especially on major pieces of legislation . We don ’ t have a time frame , ” Deal told the Atlanta Journal Constitution Thursday night , referring to the measure .
The bill would allow faith-based organizations to deny services to those who violate their “ sincerely held ” religious beliefs . It also would let employers retain the right to fire employees not aligned with those beliefs .
Supporters like Mike Griffin , a pastor and communications representative of the Georgia Baptist Mission Board , say the bill protects religious viewpoints and in turn prevents discrimination against faith-based groups . Griffin told FoxNews.com he believes threats to pull profits from the state are “ nothing but fear mongering . ”
Critics , though , claim the bill legalizes discrimination and would hurt Georgia ’ s reputation .
Similar efforts in Indiana and Arkansas also ignited battles over the past year but a movie boycott in Georgia could have a disastrous economic fallout . The Peach State ranks third behind California and New York in terms of its entertainment industry .

Disney and Marvel were the first movie studios to come out against the bill . GM , Sony , Lionsgate and 21st Century Fox , parent company of FoxNews.com , also have spoken out against the bill .
The Weinstein Company said if the legislation is signed , they will pull an upcoming project .
“ We have plans in place to begin filming Lee Daniels ’ new film in Georgia later this year , but will move the production if this unlawful bill in enacted , ” the company said in a written statement . “ We hope Governor Deal will veto bill HB 757 and not allow sanctioned bigotry to become law in Georgia . ”

Some of that shift in national polling is due to the increasing impact 18 to 32 year olds , known as the millennial generation , have on American politics . Among that age group , support for same-sex marriage is at an all-time high of 70 percent , according to the latest Pew Research poll .
Michael Dimock , director of Pew Research Center for the People and the Press , tells Don Gonyea , host of weekends on All Things Considered , that the pace at which millennials back gay marriage has rarely been matched .
`` You saw radical transformations in American attitudes about race in the '60s , '70s and '80s , '' Dimock says , `` this is n't inherently unprecedented , but for the past decade or so this is certainly one of the biggest shifts we 've seen . ''
That shift also extends to young conservatives and those that identify as Republicans , Dimock says , a group whose support for same-sex marriage has nearly doubled in the past 10 years .
`` The trajectory is happening across party lines [ and ] across religious lines , '' he says .
There 's no denying , however , that the issue of same-sex marriage is still divisive , Dimock says . As it stands , 44 percent of Americans still oppose same-sex marriage compared to the 49 percent in favor , hardly a public consensus , he says .
Even among young people , Dimock says the debate is not over despite the high percentage supporting the issue .
`` The issue of marriage is still a stumbling block for some people even in this generation ; it 's a minority , but it is still a stumbling block , '' he says .
Common among conservatives are views like those of 24-year-old Allison Howard .
`` I think we need to keep the debate open , '' Howard says . `` I just do n't think we need the Supreme Court to step in next week and decide for all 50 states what marriage is . ''
Howard , a communications director for the group Concerned Women for America , says how she was raised shaped her views on same-sex marriage .
`` How I was raised , my belief , my worldview and ... two millennia of history has shown the importance of marriage between a man and a woman , '' she says .
Eric Teetsel agrees . Teetsel is the 29-year-old executive director of the Manhattan Declaration , an organization founded in 2009 by conservative activist Chuck Colson to tackle the issues of `` life , marriage and religious freedom . ''
Teetsel tells NPR 's Gonyea that he was disappointed to see so many young people come out in support of same-sex marriage at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference .

The U.S. Supreme Court hears two important cases this week on the on same-sex marriage, an issue that a new poll says young Americans support in ever larger numbers.

Some of that shift in national polling is due to the increasing impact 18 to 32 year olds, known as the millennial generation, have on American politics. Among that age group, support for same-sex marriage is at an all-time high of 70 percent, according to the latest Pew Research poll.

Michael Dimock, director of Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, tells Don Gonyea, host of weekends on All Things Considered, that the pace at which millennials back gay marriage has rarely been matched.

""You saw radical transformations in American attitudes about race in the '60s, '70s and '80s,"" Dimock says, ""this isn't inherently unprecedented, but for the past decade or so this is certainly one of the biggest shifts we've seen.""

That shift also extends to young conservatives and those that identify as Republicans, Dimock says, a group whose support for same-sex marriage has nearly doubled in the past 10 years.

""The trajectory is happening across party lines [and] across religious lines,"" he says.

There's no denying, however, that the issue of same-sex marriage is still divisive, Dimock says. As it stands, 44 percent of Americans still oppose same-sex marriage compared to the 49 percent in favor, hardly a public consensus, he says.

Even among young people, Dimock says the debate is not over despite the high percentage supporting the issue.

""The issue of marriage is still a stumbling block for some people even in this generation; it's a minority, but it is still a stumbling block,"" he says.

Same-Sex Marriage And Young Conservatives

Common among conservatives are views like those of 24-year-old Allison Howard.

""I think we need to keep the debate open,"" Howard says. ""I just don't think we need the Supreme Court to step in next week and decide for all 50 states what marriage is.""

Howard, a communications director for the group Concerned Women for America, says how she was raised shaped her views on same-sex marriage.

""How I was raised, my belief, my worldview and ... two millennia of history has shown the importance of marriage between a man and a woman,"" she says.

Eric Teetsel agrees. Teetsel is the 29-year-old executive director of the Manhattan Declaration, an organization founded in 2009 by conservative activist Chuck Colson to tackle the issues of ""life, marriage and religious freedom.""

Teetsel tells NPR's Gonyea that he was disappointed to see so many young people come out in support of same-sex marriage at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference.

""Those of us who understand the meaning of marriage and why it matters simply have to do a better job of educating everyone ... on these issues,"" Teetsel says.

Teetsel says he's also disappointed by the position that Republicans just need to stop belaboring the issue and focus on issues on which they can gain ground.

""It's just unprincipled,"" he says. ""You don't hear us talking about backing away from other core principles that aren't necessarily popular. ... to change your principles in order to win voters over is the kind of thing that we view negatively in American politics.""

An Impending Shift

Shifting views, even among Republicans, create practical political challenges for leaders of the GOP looking at how the issue will affect voters.

""If we are to build a big-tent party, and we are to start winning elections, what we have to stop being is exclusive,"" says Ana Navarro, a veteran Republican strategist who supports same-sex marriage. ""We have to stop telling Republicans that they don't pass a litmus test because we may disagree on one or two or three issues. We have to have much more diversity of thought and much more tolerance within the Republican Party.""

Navarro says the Republican Party simply cannot close its eyes to an inevitable shift.

""At some point, it's going to be an irrelevant question, because it's going to happen whether we like it or not,"" she says.

The shift in attitudes toward same-sex marriage has been steady and fast. But whether that movement will eventually lead to any kind of policy shift within the Republican Party remains an open question.

A key legal question : Can House defend DOMA when executive branch wo n't ?
Justice Elena Kagan 's reading from 1996 act provides Wednesday 's `` moment ''
The question of same-sex marriage went again before the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday in the last of two oral arguments this week in separate appeals .
This session dealt with the Defense of Marriage Act , passed by Congress in 1996 . It said , in part , that legally married same-sex couples can not enjoy the range of financial and other benefits enjoyed by heterosexual married couples .
Here are five things we learned from arguments in this case :
A Supreme Court justice is sometimes like a fussy 8-year-old . She must eat her peas before any dessert . The dessert , of course , in the same sex-marriage cases are the constitutional `` equal protection questions '' -- the ones that get to the heart of defining what marriage is all about , the ones the entire nation wants answered .

But Wednesday 's green vegetables are the gateway or the jurisdictional barriers that must first be confronted . The justices spent the first 50 minutes of their two-hour argument deciding whether they should even be there . Can House Republicans defend the Defense of Marriage Act when the president refuses to do so ?
It 's no small matter . The executive branch , by tradition and statute , is charged with defending acts of Congress . The Obama Justice Department was doing just that when DOMA was being adjudicated by a federal judge in New York . Then an abrupt about-face . So one house of Congress decided it had to step in .
`` Let 's not confuse the issue of DOMA and the administration 's decision that it was unconstitutional , '' House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , told CNN last week . `` It is not their role to decide what 's constitutional . DOMA was a law that was passed by the House and Senate and signed into law by President Clinton .
`` In our system of government , the administration does n't get to decide what 's constitutional -- the Supreme Court does . ... Our financing the lawsuit was to make sure the proper forum was used to make sure that we know what 's constitutional and what is n't . ''
Chief Justice John Roberts at argument seemed to agree , suggesting the White House was trying to have it both ways -- believing DOMA was unconstitutional but continuing to defend it anyway .
If Obama `` has made a determination that executing the law by enforcing the terms is unconstitutional , I do n't see why he does n't have the courage of his convictions and execute not only the statute , but do it consistent with his view of the Constitution , rather than saying -- oh , we 'll wait until the Supreme Court tells us we have no choice . ''
Most hot-button Supreme Court cases have a `` moment , '' a comment or heated exchange that leaves onlookers with mouths agape and reporters scribbling furiously to mine the gold . Wednesday 's memorable remarks came from Justice Elena Kagan , about 68 minutes into the arguments .
Paul Clement , the attorney representing the House GOP , suggested that when DOMA was passed `` in 1996 , something was happening '' -- states were considering whether to upset the `` traditional '' view of marriage and include gay and lesbian couples .
`` In a sense , '' said Clement , `` it was forcing Congress to choose between its historic practice of deferring to the states and its historic practice of preferring uniformity . ''
`` I 'm going to quote from the House Report here , '' said Kagan firmly , referring to the official recommendation from various congressional committees on the law 's intent . `` That 'Congress decided to reflect an honor of collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality . ' Is that what happened in 1996 ? ''
There were audible gasps in the courtroom . It deflated suggestions Congress merely wanted federal uniformity .
`` When Congress targets a group that is not everybody 's favorite group in the world , that we look at those cases -- even if they 're not suspect -- with some rigor to say : Do we really think that Congress was doing this for uniformity reasons , or do we think that Congress ' judgment was infected by dislike , by fear , by animus ? '' she asked . `` And whether that sends up a pretty good red flag that that 's what was going on . ''
It was a simple , direct and stunningly effective tactic by the so-called `` junior '' justice . She did not need to express her own personal judicial views on the law . She let Congress ' own words speak for itself -- albeit in a 2013 political and social lens .
New members to the bench have their own internal `` learning curve , '' where they try to navigate the complexities and rhythms of their new home -- oral argument , opinion writing and the personal dynamics between one 's eight colleagues , all brilliant legal minds .
But Kagan has seemed to pick things up quickly , especially remarkable since she 's the only current member of the Supreme Court never to have been a judge before . She is confident at oral argument and can write opinions quickly . She and Justice Sonia Sotomayor , who preceded Kagan by a year , have found their footing . In their own way , they have become forces unto themselves .
As subdued as the more liberal justices were Tuesday over California 's Proposition 8 , the voter initiative banning same-sex marriage , so conservatives appeared Wednesday over DOMA .
Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia have been known to dominate especially high-profile debates , by turns passionate , clever and funny . Much of their energy was missing when the debate turned to congressional authority .
Roberta Kaplan , attorney for key plaintiff Edith Windsor , made a bold statement in favor of gay rights , saying a `` sea change '' was happening in the country in favor of same-sex marriage . Such sweeping rhetoric from counsel is usually an invitation to a verbal smackdown from the justices . They like specifics , not speeches . Scalia had his chance for a tailor-made `` moment '' of his own but did not pounce .
`` Why are you so confident in that judgment ? '' he asked mildly . `` How many states permit gay couples to marry ? '' When told just nine , all Scalia could retort was , `` So there has been this sea change between now and 1996 . ''
The conservative justices were not exactly sitting on their hands , but aside from Justice Clarence Thomas , who never speaks at argument , their energy was noticeably absent .
It 's an almost reflexive attitude among many legal and political experts to downplay the influence Justice Anthony Kennedy possesses as the so-called swing vote among the divided conservative-liberal bench . Giving any one person in Washington that much credit just does n't seem right , in the view of some . He certainly has done everything in his power to dismiss it , calling his ability to make or break a hot-button appeal a `` myth . ''
But it was hard to ignore remarks Kennedy made about an hour into the argument , which may give cheer to gay rights supporters .
He pointed out there are about 1100 various federal provisions that legally married same-sex couples can not use because of DOMA -- everything from taxes to family medical leave .
`` Which in our society means that the federal government is intertwined with the citizens ' day-to-day life , you are at real risk of running in conflict with what has always been thought to be the essence of the state police power , which is to regulate marriage , divorce , custody , '' he said .
They were brief comments , delivered in the typical droll manner that is the low-key justice . He never dominates arguments , but when he talks , ears perk up . Even the justices on the bench were looking his way , absorbing the impact of what Kennedy was trying to convey .
Any real power would be felt behind the red velvet curtains of the courtroom , where all important opinions are written . That is where the court derives its power and authority and where the views of this 76-year-old Californian must be respected .
So what 's next ? In short , the public waits while the justices write .
The members will meet privately later this week in a special conference room -- just the nine of them with no clerks , staff or reporters allowed .
There , the court is expected to vote -- at least preliminarily -- on the two same-sex marriage appeals . Opinion writing will commence , endless drafts will be exchanged among chambers and suggestions for changes will come flooding .
Bit by bit , the makings of legal opinion take shape . Justices are free to change their mind midstream -- and they do . Witness Roberts last year during the challenge to the health care reform law championed by Obama . Government sources confirm Roberts switched sides several weeks after an initial vote and was the controlling vote to uphold Obamacare .
The internal drama will play out over the next three months , unseen by the public . The court 's high profile will re-emerge when their ruling is issued , but the guessing game has already begun .","Story highlights Supreme Court hears a challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act

The U.S. Supreme Court is taking up the issue of same-sex marriage in two momentous cases on Tuesday, March 26, and Wednesday, March 27. In the California one, the court will be asked to decide whether same-sex couples have a right to marry despite the passage of a state referendum against it. In the other, the parties will argue over the Defense of Marriage Act, which forbids the recognition of same-sex marriages nationwide and bars married gay and lesbian couples from receiving federal benefits.

But Wednesday's green vegetables are the gateway or the jurisdictional barriers that must first be confronted. The justices spent the first 50 minutes of their two-hour argument deciding whether they should even be there. Can House Republicans defend the Defense of Marriage Act when the president refuses to do so?

It's no small matter. The executive branch, by tradition and statute, is charged with defending acts of Congress. The Obama Justice Department was doing just that when DOMA was being adjudicated by a federal judge in New York. Then an abrupt about-face. So one house of Congress decided it had to step in.

""Let's not confuse the issue of DOMA and the administration's decision that it was unconstitutional,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told CNN last week. ""It is not their role to decide what's constitutional. DOMA was a law that was passed by the House and Senate and signed into law by President Clinton.

""In our system of government, the administration doesn't get to decide what's constitutional -- the Supreme Court does. ... Our financing the lawsuit was to make sure the proper forum was used to make sure that we know what's constitutional and what isn't.""

Chief Justice John Roberts at argument seemed to agree, suggesting the White House was trying to have it both ways -- believing DOMA was unconstitutional but continuing to defend it anyway.

If Obama ""has made a determination that executing the law by enforcing the terms is unconstitutional, I don't see why he doesn't have the courage of his convictions and execute not only the statute, but do it consistent with his view of the Constitution, rather than saying -- oh, we'll wait until the Supreme Court tells us we have no choice.""

2. The moment, courtesy of Kagan

Most hot-button Supreme Court cases have a ""moment,"" a comment or heated exchange that leaves onlookers with mouths agape and reporters scribbling furiously to mine the gold. Wednesday's memorable remarks came from Justice Elena Kagan, about 68 minutes into the arguments.

Paul Clement, the attorney representing the House GOP, suggested that when DOMA was passed ""in 1996, something was happening"" -- states were considering whether to upset the ""traditional"" view of marriage and include gay and lesbian couples.

""In a sense,"" said Clement, ""it was forcing Congress to choose between its historic practice of deferring to the states and its historic practice of preferring uniformity.""

Pause.

""I'm going to quote from the House Report here,"" said Kagan firmly, referring to the official recommendation from various congressional committees on the law's intent. ""That 'Congress decided to reflect an honor of collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality.' Is that what happened in 1996?""

There were audible gasps in the courtroom. It deflated suggestions Congress merely wanted federal uniformity.

""When Congress targets a group that is not everybody's favorite group in the world, that we look at those cases -- even if they're not suspect -- with some rigor to say: Do we really think that Congress was doing this for uniformity reasons, or do we think that Congress' judgment was infected by dislike, by fear, by animus?"" she asked. ""And whether that sends up a pretty good red flag that that's what was going on.""

It was a simple, direct and stunningly effective tactic by the so-called ""junior"" justice. She did not need to express her own personal judicial views on the law. She let Congress' own words speak for itself -- albeit in a 2013 political and social lens.

New members to the bench have their own internal ""learning curve,"" where they try to navigate the complexities and rhythms of their new home -- oral argument, opinion writing and the personal dynamics between one's eight colleagues, all brilliant legal minds.

But Kagan has seemed to pick things up quickly, especially remarkable since she's the only current member of the Supreme Court never to have been a judge before. She is confident at oral argument and can write opinions quickly. She and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who preceded Kagan by a year, have found their footing. In their own way, they have become forces unto themselves.

3. Court's conservatives go tepid

As subdued as the more liberal justices were Tuesday over California's Proposition 8, the voter initiative banning same-sex marriage, so conservatives appeared Wednesday over DOMA.

Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia have been known to dominate especially high-profile debates, by turns passionate, clever and funny. Much of their energy was missing when the debate turned to congressional authority.

Roberta Kaplan, attorney for key plaintiff Edith Windsor , made a bold statement in favor of gay rights, saying a ""sea change"" was happening in the country in favor of same-sex marriage. Such sweeping rhetoric from counsel is usually an invitation to a verbal smackdown from the justices. They like specifics, not speeches. Scalia had his chance for a tailor-made ""moment"" of his own but did not pounce.

""Why are you so confident in that judgment?"" he asked mildly. ""How many states permit gay couples to marry?"" When told just nine, all Scalia could retort was, ""So there has been this sea change between now and 1996.""

The conservative justices were not exactly sitting on their hands, but aside from Justice Clarence Thomas, who never speaks at argument, their energy was noticeably absent.

4. So is DOMA doomed?

It's an almost reflexive attitude among many legal and political experts to downplay the influence Justice Anthony Kennedy possesses as the so-called swing vote among the divided conservative-liberal bench. Giving any one person in Washington that much credit just doesn't seem right, in the view of some. He certainly has done everything in his power to dismiss it, calling his ability to make or break a hot-button appeal a ""myth.""

But it was hard to ignore remarks Kennedy made about an hour into the argument, which may give cheer to gay rights supporters.

He pointed out there are about 1100 various federal provisions that legally married same-sex couples cannot use because of DOMA -- everything from taxes to family medical leave.

""Which in our society means that the federal government is intertwined with the citizens' day-to-day life, you are at real risk of running in conflict with what has always been thought to be the essence of the state police power, which is to regulate marriage, divorce, custody,"" he said.

They were brief comments, delivered in the typical droll manner that is the low-key justice. He never dominates arguments, but when he talks, ears perk up. Even the justices on the bench were looking his way, absorbing the impact of what Kennedy was trying to convey.

Any real power would be felt behind the red velvet curtains of the courtroom, where all important opinions are written. That is where the court derives its power and authority and where the views of this 76-year-old Californian must be respected.

5. Waiting for the final act

So what's next? In short, the public waits while the justices write.

The members will meet privately later this week in a special conference room -- just the nine of them with no clerks, staff or reporters allowed.

There, the court is expected to vote -- at least preliminarily -- on the two same-sex marriage appeals. Opinion writing will commence, endless drafts will be exchanged among chambers and suggestions for changes will come flooding.

Bit by bit, the makings of legal opinion take shape. Justices are free to change their mind midstream -- and they do. Witness Roberts last year during the challenge to the health care reform law championed by Obama. Government sources confirm Roberts switched sides several weeks after an initial vote and was the controlling vote to uphold Obamacare.

The internal drama will play out over the next three months, unseen by the public. The court's high profile will re-emerge when their ruling is issued, but the guessing game has already begun.",www.cnn.com,left,5VKT4yM7VSk2VxDM

Days ago, Bachmann said she might run for president again in 2016. ""The only thing that the media has speculated on is that it's going to be various men that are running,"" she told Scott Conroy of RealClearPolitics. ""They haven't speculated, for instance, that I'm going to run. What if I decide to run? And there's a chance I could run.""",www.vox.com,left,R739yQE5ElFXSOVi

""Since it has, one thing should be clear. Liz has always believed in the traditional definition of marriage,"" the Cheneys added, saying Liz Cheney has ""always treated her sister and her sister's family with love and respect, exactly as she should have done.""

""Compassion is called for, even when there is disagreement about such a fundamental matter and Liz's many kindnesses shouldn't be used to distort her position,"" the statement concludes.

""I love Mary very much. I love her family very much. This is just an issue in which we disagree,"" Cheney said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

Mary Cheney responded Sunday not long after the interview.

""Liz – this isn't just an issue on which we disagree – you're just wrong – and on the wrong side of history,"" she posted on Facebook.

Cheney says daughter Liz will win Senate bid

Mary Cheney married her longtime partner, Heather Poe, last year in Washington D.C., which legalized same-sex marriage in 2009. The couple have two children together – a son, Samuel, and a daughter, Sarah. Liz Cheney did not attend the wedding.

Mary also shared a post by her wife, who said she was offended by Liz Cheney's latest comments:

Liz Cheney asserts her Wyoming roots in first ad

Mary Cheney's sexual orientation was known during her father's first run in 2000 for vice president, though her family generally declined to discuss her personal life on the campaign trail.

“ The entire medical community is opposed to these phony therapies , ” California state Sen. Ted W. Lieu said after his groundbreaking bill on “ sexual-orientation change efforts ” passed May 30 by a 23-13 vote .
“ Everyone agrees that this quackery needs to stop , ” he said .
The bill bans children younger than 18 from receiving “ change ” therapy , regardless of their or their parents ’ wishes .
Opponents of the bill say it is an unconstitutional suppression of speech and denies the existence of “ ex-gays . ”
“ We can not afford to let the state invade the counseling room or doctor ’ s office to dictate what views on sexuality are acceptable and unacceptable , ” said Matthew McReynolds , a staff attorney at the Pacific Justice Institute .
The bill now goes to the Assembly where Speaker Pro Tem Fiona Ma is co-author of the bill .
Mr. Lieu told The ███ on Friday that he became interested in the issue after seeing a television investigative report about patients who went through “ reparative therapy ” and “ how one of them later committed suicide . ”
“ I did some more research into it , and it was clear that this [ suicide ] was not an isolated incident , ” said Mr. Lieu , a Democrat from Torrance .
“ Unfortunately , a lot of parents send their children into this , in the hopes that their children will somehow get quote-unquote fixed , ” he said . But studies say not only does reparative therapy not work , but it can be harmful , he said , adding that when Equality California asked him this year to take the lead on a bill to outlaw it , “ I jumped at that opportunity . ”
His bill says people who have tried to change their sexual orientation through therapy face risks for “ confusion , depression , guilt , hopelessness , shame , suicide , self-hatred , decreased self-esteem and a host of anger , dysfunction and dehumanized feelings . ”
It also says the state “ has a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors , ” including lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people ( LGBT ) , “ and in protecting its minors against exposure to serious harms caused by sexual orientation change efforts . ”
Therefore , “ [ u ] nder no circumstances ” shall a patient under age 18 receive sexual-orientation change efforts , “ regardless of the willingness of the patient , patient ’ s parent , guardian , conservator , or other person to authorize such efforts , ” the bill says .
Clarissa Filgioun , president of the board of directors of Equality California , said the bill could one day “ make California the first state in the nation to ban licensed mental-health professionals from engaging in sexual-orientation change efforts of any kind for a minor patient . ”
The bill allows the state to “ fulfill its duty to protect consumers - especially youth - from therapeutic misconduct , ” she said .
Same-sex behaviors , attractions and orientations “ are normal and positive experiences ” and therapeutic interventions should be aimed at “ helping clients come to terms with their sexual orientation , ” instead of seeking to change them , said Gaylesta : LGBT Psychotherapy Association , which is also a co-sponsor of the bill with the National Center for Lesbian Rights , Lambda Legal and Mental Health America of Northern California .
Passage of Mr. Lieu ’ s bill would be “ a tragic blow to parental rights , ” said the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality , which represents mental-health professionals who assist people with unwanted same-sex attractions .
A “ truly scientific approach ” would be to have more and better research about change therapies instead of “ a ban that runs roughshod over professional judgment and parental choice , ” said psychologist Christopher Rosik , president of the association .

Gay Rights

He elevated the cause of gay rights to the civil-rights struggles of blacks and women, the first time a president has supported their cause in an inaugural speech. He also argued against the nation’s concentration of wealth.

“We, the people, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it,” the president said in a 15-minute speech that called for a central role for government in addressing the declining earning power of U.S. workers. “We believe that America’s prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class.”

Running Themes

The ideas of collective responsibility, combating inequality and reversing middle-class economic decline have been running themes in Obama’s campaigns stretching back to a 2007 presidential announcement speech that included ending “stagnant wages” as one of his causes.

He invoked the principle that we are our brother’s keepers from the campaign stump and he portrayed his struggle with congressional Republicans as a “make-or-break moment for the middle class” in a December 2011 speech previewing his re-election campaign.

Obama’s call for the nation to rise up against partisan deadlock stood in contrast to his 2009 inaugural, in which he spoke of choosing “hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord” and proclaiming “an end to petty grievances.”

Still, the address fit a tradition of second-term presidents using the moment to put their administration’s work in the language of moral values anchored in U.S. history.

Predecessors Words

Abraham Lincoln in 1865 spoke of the “terrible war” he presided over as divine retribution for American slavery’s “250 years of unrequited toil.” Roosevelt in 1937 invoked the Constitutional Convention to portray the New Deal as “a new chapter in our book of self-government” that subordinated “private autocratic powers” to “the public’s government.”

George W. Bush in 2005 declared “the best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.”

Unlike Roosevelt, Reagan and Clinton, all of whom also arrived in office at moments of economic distress, Obama didn’t emphasize in his address yesterday the atmosphere of crisis when he first took office.

Not ‘Takers’

Instead, he stressed the value of aiding those in need. In a swipe at Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s comment that 47 percent of Americans see themselves as “victims” dependent on government, Obama said programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security “do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.”

Debt Battle

Clouding the economy’s future is the uncertainty over talks on raising the nation’s debt limit, looming automatic spending cuts and a debate over funding the government.

U.S. Treasury bond investors -- who most directly bear the risk of a government default -- haven’t been alarmed by the skirmishing between Obama and Republicans.

Yields on long-term U.S. debt are near record lows, with the benchmark 10-year note at 1.84 percent on Jan. 18. U.S. financial markets were closed yesterday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.

“Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law -- for if we are truly created equal then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well,” he said.

‘Unequivocal Support’

Obama renewed a call for action on climate change in the face of those who deny “the overwhelming judgment of science.”

He repeated the refrain, “We, the people” from the preamble to the U.S. Constitution to convey the idea that he was giving voice to popular sentiment.

“This was a speech of a president who had four years of hard lessons in the roots of partisan division,” said Michael Waldman, a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton and now president of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. “I think what he was trying to do was make a strong argument for his philosophy.”

While foreign policy played a limited role in both of Obama’s inaugural addresses, the emphasis shifted.

In his first address, Obama told Muslim nations he would “seek a new way forward” and told leaders of hostile nations, including Iran, that “we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.”

In the second address, Obama traded those themes for an explanation to Americans of his winding down of the war in Afghanistan and plans to cut defense spending.

“Enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war,” he said. He said the U.S. will support democracy “from Asia to Africa,” seeking peace through opportunity, dignity and justice.

Brands said Obama’s treatment of war was a criticism of the Bush administration and that Obama’s “preference for spreading peace rather than war is the one he might be most likely to put into effect, as foreign policy is something a president can change largely on his own.”",www.bloomberg.com,center,jAh1g2CaNUify4sI

[summary]

Top Democrats who previously opposed same-sex marriage -- and had taken the more moderate position of supporting civil unions -- have in recent months and years shifted course. President Obama announced his support for gay marriage in the months leading up to the presidential election. Hillary Clinton also recently followed suit.

But Republicans have also been crossing to the pro-gay marriage side. Wallace is among dozens of Republicans who filed a brief in the Supreme Court case arguing for Prop 8 to be overturned. One of the lead lawyers arguing against Prop 8, Ted Olson, also is a prominent conservative who was solicitor general under George W. Bush. And Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, publicly reversed his position on the issue after his son came out as gay.

The position shifts, though, do not signal a party-wide change of heart. Many Republicans would still prefer the issue be left up to the states and are encouraging the high court justices to rule narrowly.

""They would be far better off to decide these two cases on the narrowest possible grounds,"" former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Sunday. A sweeping decision against gay marriage, he said, would be a ""huge mistake"" that would ""undermine respect for the judiciary.""

Americans as a whole are likewise divided. A Fox News poll released Thursday showed 49 percent of voters favor legalizing gay marriage, while 46 percent oppose it. That marks a shift since the question was first asked in 2003 -- when 32 percent said gay marriage should be legal, and 58 percent opposed it.

Support for gay marriage has grown the most among Democrats, and self-described moderates and independents. Still, support for gay marriage rose by 10 points among Republicans over the past decade, according to the Fox News polling.

Gay marriage has been approved in nine states -- Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont, Washington -- and the District of Columbia.

But 31 states have amended their constitutions to prohibit same-sex marriage. North Carolina was the most recent example last May.

The case being considered Tuesday concerns the constitutional ban on gay marriage that California voters adopted in 2008. One key question before the court is whether the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection means that the right to marriage cannot be limited to heterosexuals.

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals previously struck down Prop 8, without making any sweeping pronouncements. The larger constitutional issue almost certainly will be presented to the court, but the justices would not necessarily have to rule on it.

The other issue the high court will take on involves the central provision of the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between a man and woman. Four federal district courts and two appeals courts struck down the provision.

Supreme Court rulings are expected in June.

It merely declined an opportunity to rule definitely one way or the other on the question .
But in the not-too-long run , the consequences may well be the same . Because the situation the court created — or acknowledged — will almost surely continue trending in favor of same-sex couples who want to marry .

Technically, the Supreme Court Monday did not establish a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry. It merely declined an opportunity to rule definitely one way or the other on the question.

But in the not-too-long run, the consequences may well be the same. Because the situation the court created — or acknowledged — will almost surely continue trending in favor of same-sex couples who want to marry.

Conversely, the legal ground is eroding for states that want to stop such marriages or deny them legal recognition.

As thousands more same-sex couples marry all over the country, this legal climate change becomes a kind of fait accompli.

For the moment, the court's denial of review means state-enacted bans on same-sex marriage in five states were wiped off the books. The denial meant lower court rulings that spiked those bans will now stand. Let's call them The Five.

So couples in The Five could begin marrying regardless of gender as of today — and some got licenses immediately.

In six other states that had banned the practice, further legal proceedings may be needed to apply the rulings of the relevant federal circuit courts of appeal. But because these six are connected to The Five through the federal circuit system (jurisdictions for the purpose of appealing federal court decisions) the same judgment will apply. Effectuating that judgment in these six states is a short step — and one that is already in motion.

Then they will be just like The Five.

That will bring the number of states where gay marriage has been legalized, either by the state itself or through these federal cases, to 30. And these states are home to the vast majority of the national population.

There are still ways for the Supreme Court to reassert itself in this debate. But the question is, do they want to?

Many legal experts have looked over the landscape and perceived both a trend in the federal system and a signal from the nine justices who sit at its zenith.

And even after the high court rules — most likely by striking down state bans on gay marriage at the end of its term in June — the fight wo n't be over . Another clash looms over the issue of religious freedom .
Same-sex marriage 's transformation from impossible dream decades ago to all but inevitable today has been , by most accounts , unprecedented . First legalized in the Netherlands in 2001 , gay and lesbian marriages have spread to 19 countries and 19 states .
As they stand at the precipice — with the high court delaying any decision Thursday but likely to accept one or more cases later this month — the movement 's founders insist it 's a cause whose time has come .
`` Every day literally matters , '' says Evan Wolfson , who launched the advocacy group Freedom to Marry in 2003 and hopes to put it out of business next year . `` People are literally dying without being able to get married . ''
Before same-sex marriage went on its current winning streak , however , there was a very long losing streak . In 1972 , the Supreme Court tossed out the first gay marriage lawsuit `` for want of a substantial federal question . '' In 1986 , the justices upheld states ' rights to ban homosexual sodomy . The 1990s brought progress , but not victory , from Hawaii to Vermont .
`` The tone of the opinions from the state courts was as though a man was seeking the right to be pregnant , '' recalls Mary Bonauto , the godmother of the gay marriage movement , who won the first victory in Massachusetts in 2003 .
The air of inevitability that pervades the issue today stems from a near-perfect string of court victories since June 2013 , when the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages performed in states where it is legal . The same five justices appear likely to take the final step this term by declaring state bans against gay marriage unconstitutional .
Standing in the breach are the same steadfast opponents who have defended the states ' prohibitions for two decades . They have not given up hope that the justices will come down on the side of states ' rights . But even if they lose , they promise more battles to come between gay rights and religious rites .
`` There 's a ton that will happen on religious liberty . We 're already preemptively moving in this direction , '' says Brian Brown , president of the National Organization for Marriage . `` The other side wants to push religious liberty into the four walls of a church . ''
That movement was born in the wake of Loving v. Virginia , the 1967 Supreme Court decision that outlawed state bans on interracial marriage . Yet the years that followed did not produce immediate victories .
The Supreme Court refused in 1972 to overrule Baker v. Nelson , which upheld a Minnesota law denying marriage rights to gay men and lesbians . `` It was a train wreck , '' says James Esseks , director of the American Civil Liberties Union 's LGBT and AIDS Project . `` It 's a case that has haunted us for decades . ''
The 1980s brought Bowers v. Hardwick , which upheld Georgia 's law banning homosexual sodomy . Other cases were filed -- and lost — on behalf of gay couples .
The effort began to take root in the 1990s , when proponents won their first court victory in Hawaii . The reaction was swift : Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 , denying federal recognition to same-sex marriages that did not yet exist . Hawaii voters passed a constitutional amendment against same-sex marriage in 1998 , making the matter moot .
Another victory came in Vermont in December 1999 , but it , too , was short-lived . The state Supreme Court ruled that gay men and lesbians should have the same rights as heterosexuals , leaving it to the Legislature to decide how . The result , in 2000 , was civil unions — not marriages
Not until 2003 did Massachusetts become the first state to legalize gay marriage in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health , a case won by Bonauto . That same year , Paul Smith won Lawrence v. Texas , which struck down the remaining state laws against sodomy . That was a major victory in the fight against discrimination . But beyond one state , marriage remained elusive .
`` It was considered an impossible dream by some , '' Smith recalls . `` Some gay people thought it was a crazy idea themselves .
After Massachusetts , the deluge did n't come . The legal movement lost cases in New York , Washington , Maryland , Arizona and Indiana . Constitutional amendments banning gay marriage were passed in a dozen states in the fall of 2004 .
So a group of about 15 advocates from groups such as the ACLU , the Human Rights Campaign and Lambda Legal met to plot a path through more states to the Supreme Court .
It took nearly five years before legislatures and courts answered the call . California was first , but a court decision legalizing gay marriage was quickly reversed by voters at the polls . Finally , a series of states from New England to Iowa made same-sex marriage legal . California finally became the 13th state last year .
`` Every five years is a complete generation in gay rights law , '' says David Codell , constitutional litigation director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights .
Since then , federal and state courts have given an almost unbroken winning streak to the gay marriage movement , with only a federal judge in Louisiana upholding that state 's ban . A total of 19 states and the District of Columbia now permit same-sex marriage , and courts have ruled favorably in 14 other states . Wolfson has been to 10 same-sex weddings this year alone .
Along with the court rulings has come a growing acceptance of same-sex marriage by a majority of Americans . The latest Gallup Poll showed 55 % support for gay marriage and 42 % opposed .
`` If there is one silver bullet you have to point to that has moved public opinion dramatically over the years , it 's folks getting to know us , '' says Chad Griffin , president of the Human Rights Campaign , the nation 's largest gay rights organization . `` It 's been nearly five decades in the making . ''
Despite those gains , gay rights advocates are trying to draw attention to the continuing hardships faced by same-sex couples .
Those blocked from matrimony are denied the financial benefits enjoyed by heterosexual couples , such as leaving pension , Social Security and veterans benefits to their spouse and avoiding estate taxes upon one partner 's death . Non-biological parents are denied adoption rights . Even legally married couples face hassles when they travel to or move to states that do n't recognize their marriages .
The differences in local , state and federal benefits translate into real dollars . A study released Tuesday by two liberal think tanks shows that same-sex couples raising children in states that ban gay marriage have nearly $ 9,000 less in annual household income than their married , opposite-sex counterparts .
`` There are so many people who have suffered for decades without ever having health insurance , without ever having pension benefits , '' Codell says . The slow pace of justice `` represents people dying off and never having been a family under the law . ''
Even if the court strikes down the remaining state bans , however , it wo n't end the debate — or the legal battles . Up next : a collision course between gay rights and religious rites , in which churches and religious-affiliated groups seek exemptions from laws that follow the Supreme Court 's decision .
`` What statutory protections and exemptions should religious organizations seek to ensure their independence from state control and guard against retaliation ? '' a brief submitted to the court by Catholic , Baptist , Evangelical , Mormon and Lutheran organizations says . `` What exactly are the rights of organizations and individuals with sincerely-held religious objections to participating in , facilitating , or recognizing same-sex marriage ? ''
To the ACLU 's Esseks , the answers already are clear . `` If we 're talking about churches , churches get to do what they want , '' he says . `` If we 're talking about businesses , businesses have to follow the law . ''
Some on both sides of the debate say a peremptory ruling from the high court could mobilize the opposition in much the same way as the court 's 1973 decision legalizing abortion has fueled state laws restricting that right .
`` Do we want marriage to be the next Roe v . Wade ? '' says Carrie Severino , chief counsel at the conservative Judicial Crisis Network .
Smith predicts clashes over other gay rights issues , from equal access to employment to public accommodations . The question will be similar to this year 's successful effort by employers with religious objections to avoid paying for their female employees ' contraceptives , as well as failed efforts in Arizona , Kansas and elsewhere to exempt businesses from having to comply with civil rights laws for religious reasons ..
`` We have to figure out where to draw these lines , '' Smith says . `` It is the last big battleground on which the whole issue of LGBT equality is going to be fought out . ''
And fight both sides will — potentially leading to still more Supreme Court showdowns .
`` The last thing you can do is get off the field if you win , '' says Bonauto , who began the legal battle for gay marriage a generation ago . `` I do n't discount for a second that there are going to remain powerful voices against us . ''","CLOSE

Note: This story was written last week before the Supreme Court's surprise decision not to take up the cases this term.

WASHINGTON — As the Supreme Court prepares to decide the future of same-sex marriage — an institution described as ""newer than cellphones or the Internet"" by one justice last year — two things are clear.

Despite this year's breathtaking string of lower court victories, the battle for marriage equality hasn't been swift or easy. To the lawyers who devised the legal strategy decades ago, the journey has been arduous, the setbacks plentiful and the battle scars deep.

And even after the high court rules — most likely by striking down state bans on gay marriage at the end of its term in June — the fight won't be over. Another clash looms over the issue of religious freedom.

Same-sex marriage's transformation from impossible dream decades ago to all but inevitable today has been, by most accounts, unprecedented. First legalized in the Netherlands in 2001, gay and lesbian marriages have spread to 19 countries and 19 states.

As they stand at the precipice — with the high court delaying any decision Thursday but likely to accept one or more cases later this month — the movement's founders insist it's a cause whose time has come.

""Every day literally matters,"" says Evan Wolfson, who launched the advocacy group Freedom to Marry in 2003 and hopes to put it out of business next year. ""People are literally dying without being able to get married.""

Before same-sex marriage went on its current winning streak, however, there was a very long losing streak.

The air of inevitability that pervades the issue today stems from a near-perfect string of court victories since June 2013, when the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages performed in states where it is legal.

'IMPOSSIBLE DREAM' TAKES ROOT

That movement was born in the wake of Loving v. Virginia, the 1967 Supreme Court decision that outlawed state bans on interracial marriage. Yet the years that followed did not produce immediate victories.

The Supreme Court refused in 1972 to overrule Baker v. Nelson, which upheld a Minnesota law denying marriage rights to gay men and lesbians.

""Litigation,"" he says, ""changed hearts and minds.""

REAL PEOPLE, REAL BENEFITS

After Massachusetts, the deluge didn't come. The legal movement lost cases in New York, Washington, Maryland, Arizona and Indiana. Constitutional amendments banning gay marriage were passed in a dozen states in the fall of 2004.

So a group of about 15 advocates from groups such as the ACLU, the Human Rights Campaign and Lambda Legal met to plot a path through more states to the Supreme Court.

It took nearly five years before legislatures and courts answered the call. California was first, but a court decision legalizing gay marriage was quickly reversed by voters at the polls. Finally, a series of states from New England to Iowa made same-sex marriage legal. California finally became the 13th state last year.

""Every five years is a complete generation in gay rights law,"" says David Codell, constitutional litigation director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights.

Since then, federal and state courts have given an almost unbroken winning streak to the gay marriage movement, with only a federal judge in Louisiana upholding that state's ban. A total of 19 states and the District of Columbia now permit same-sex marriage, and courts have ruled favorably in 14 other states. Wolfson has been to 10 same-sex weddings this year alone.

Along with the court rulings has come a growing acceptance of same-sex marriage by a majority of Americans. The latest Gallup Poll showed 55% support for gay marriage and 42% opposed.

""If there is one silver bullet you have to point to that has moved public opinion dramatically over the years, it's folks getting to know us,"" says Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay rights organization. ""It's been nearly five decades in the making.""

Despite those gains, gay rights advocates are trying to draw attention to the continuing hardships faced by same-sex couples.

Those blocked from matrimony are denied the financial benefits enjoyed by heterosexual couples, such as leaving pension, Social Security and veterans benefits to their spouse and avoiding estate taxes upon one partner's death. Non-biological parents are denied adoption rights. Even legally married couples face hassles when they travel to or move to states that don't recognize their marriages.

The differences in local, state and federal benefits translate into real dollars. A study released Tuesday by two liberal think tanks shows that same-sex couples raising children in states that ban gay marriage have nearly $9,000 less in annual household income than their married, opposite-sex counterparts.

""There are so many people who have suffered for decades without ever having health insurance, without ever having pension benefits,"" Codell says. The slow pace of justice ""represents people dying off and never having been a family under the law.""

A CLASH WITH RELIGIOUS FREEDOM

Even if the court strikes down the remaining state bans, however, it won't end the debate — or the legal battles. Up next: a collision course between gay rights and religious rites, in which churches and religious-affiliated groups seek exemptions from laws that follow the Supreme Court's decision.

""What statutory protections and exemptions should religious organizations seek to ensure their independence from state control and guard against retaliation?"" a brief submitted to the court by Catholic, Baptist, Evangelical, Mormon and Lutheran organizations says. ""What exactly are the rights of organizations and individuals with sincerely-held religious objections to participating in, facilitating, or recognizing same-sex marriage?""

To the ACLU's Esseks, the answers already are clear. ""If we're talking about churches, churches get to do what they want,"" he says. ""If we're talking about businesses, businesses have to follow the law.""

Some on both sides of the debate say a peremptory ruling from the high court could mobilize the opposition in much the same way as the court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion has fueled state laws restricting that right.

""Do we want marriage to be the next Roe v. Wade?"" says Carrie Severino, chief counsel at the conservative Judicial Crisis Network.

Smith predicts clashes over other gay rights issues, from equal access to employment to public accommodations. The question will be similar to this year's successful effort by employers with religious objections to avoid paying for their female employees' contraceptives, as well as failed efforts in Arizona, Kansas and elsewhere to exempt businesses from having to comply with civil rights laws for religious reasons..

""We have to figure out where to draw these lines,"" Smith says. ""It is the last big battleground on which the whole issue of LGBT equality is going to be fought out.""

And fight both sides will — potentially leading to still more Supreme Court showdowns.

""The last thing you can do is get off the field if you win,"" says Bonauto, who began the legal battle for gay marriage a generation ago. ""I don't discount for a second that there are going to remain powerful voices against us.""

Mr. Conley said he doubted voters would approve same-sex marriage , in part because people resist change . “ From a purely political perspective , a ‘ no ’ is easier than a ‘ yes ’ on any referendum. ” he said .
Some money for the opposition campaign is coming from collection plates passed at churches . But most is expected to come from the National Organization for Marriage , which funneled almost $ 2 million into Maine to help defeat the measure in 2009 .
One complication for the opposition this year is that the Roman Catholic Church plans to be less active than it was in 2009 , when church officials were criticized for being too involved .
Mr. Conley acknowledged that the campaign in support of same-sex marriage appeared highly organized and well financed . Advocates expect to raise about $ 5 million , while opponents expect less than half as much .
Matt McTighe , campaign manager for Mainers United for Marriage , a coalition of groups advocating gay marriage , said his side had more time to make its case this year and was playing offense , not defense .
“ Normally , when marriage comes up on the ballot , it ’ s in response to a court case or legislative action and at most — as in 2009 here and in Maryland and Washington — you have six months to really go out and defend whatever that court or legislature did , ” Mr. McTighe said . “ Maine is the first state to proactively bring this initiative to voters , and that ’ s allowed us to control our own fate . ”
The campaign ’ s centerpiece is a canvassing effort aimed at undecided voters . Mr. McTighe said a personal approach was the most effective way to convey the message . The coalition has conducted 100,000 “ conversations ” in two years , he said , with perhaps one in every five people open to changing his or her views .
Amelia Nugent , 23 , who was canvassing last week on a warm , buggy night in Falmouth , said she usually told people that she wanted to have the same kind of loving and committed marriage that they had . “ It ’ s just humanizing the issue , ” she said as she walked door to door . “ It ’ s about love and family . ”
Sometimes people are rude , she said , asking her if she wants to marry their dog . Others will talk for 45 minutes , and leave her feeling she has made progress .
The other night , a few people turned Ms. Nugent away ; most who talked to her said they already supported gay marriage .
“ It ’ s such a nonissue , ” said Judith Coye , 52 , a banker , who spoke briefly with Ms. Nugent .
George Bloom , 57 , an environmental engineer who was watering his garden , said he saw no problem with it . He said that he had had gay friends over the years and that allowing them to marry “ just seems fair . ”","But the weight of history is against them. The fight has never been won at the ballot box.

One complication for the opposition this year is that the Roman Catholic Church plans to be less active than it was in 2009, when church officials were criticized for being too involved.

Mr. Conley acknowledged that the campaign in support of same-sex marriage appeared highly organized and well financed. Advocates expect to raise about $5 million, while opponents expect less than half as much.

Matt McTighe, campaign manager for Mainers United for Marriage, a coalition of groups advocating gay marriage, said his side had more time to make its case this year and was playing offense, not defense.

“Normally, when marriage comes up on the ballot, it’s in response to a court case or legislative action and at most — as in 2009 here and in Maryland and Washington — you have six months to really go out and defend whatever that court or legislature did,” Mr. McTighe said. “Maine is the first state to proactively bring this initiative to voters, and that’s allowed us to control our own fate.”

The campaign’s centerpiece is a canvassing effort aimed at undecided voters. Mr. McTighe said a personal approach was the most effective way to convey the message. The coalition has conducted 100,000 “conversations” in two years, he said, with perhaps one in every five people open to changing his or her views.

Amelia Nugent, 23, who was canvassing last week on a warm, buggy night in Falmouth, said she usually told people that she wanted to have the same kind of loving and committed marriage that they had. “It’s just humanizing the issue,” she said as she walked door to door. “It’s about love and family.”

Sometimes people are rude, she said, asking her if she wants to marry their dog. Others will talk for 45 minutes, and leave her feeling she has made progress.

The other night, a few people turned Ms. Nugent away; most who talked to her said they already supported gay marriage.

“It’s such a nonissue,” said Judith Coye, 52, a banker, who spoke briefly with Ms. Nugent.

George Bloom, 57, an environmental engineer who was watering his garden, said he saw no problem with it. He said that he had had gay friends over the years and that allowing them to marry “just seems fair.”",www.nytimes.com,left,IEcfwpCtlSrTDS27

The Supreme Court's 5-4 decision Wednesday to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act is a monumental victory for advocates of same-sex marriage.

But what happens now that the 1996 federal law that confines marriage to a man and a woman has been declared unconstitutional?

Will federal benefits flow only to same-sex married couples living in states that recognize their unions?

What about same-sex spouses who are legally married but living in states that ban such unions?

And how will federal agencies, already with myriad rules and regulations regarding spousal eligibility for benefits, deal with the court's edict?

""Striking down DOMA is a great step forward, obviously,"" says Ari Ezra Waldman, legal editor at Towleroad, a widely read LGBT-oriented website, ""but there will be difficult complications to work out.""

The court's decision does not embrace a national constitutional right to same-sex marriage, but would make married gay couples living in states where their unions are legal eligible for federal benefits already enjoyed by married heterosexual Americans.

Place Of Celebration, Or Residence?

The tricky part in the fall of DOMA involves how states and federal agencies currently recognize marriage.

Some federal agencies adhere to what is known as a ""place of celebration"" standard. That means no matter where a couple is legally married anywhere in the world, the union is recognized for the purpose of federal benefits.

But other agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration, hew to a ""place of residence"" standard. Marriage has to be recognized in the place the couple is living for them to be eligible for those federal spousal benefits.

""Every agency of government has, quite literally, a different standard for recognizing marriage,"" Sainz says. ""They did not consult one another — and it has nothing to do with being gay or straight, they just have different standards.""

Here's one example that points to the complexity to come: The Department of Defense has a ""place of celebration"" marriage standard for active-duty military. But the Department of Veterans Affairs has a ""place of residence"" standard.

While some definitions are set by regulation, others — including those used by Social Security and Veterans Affairs — are set by federal law, further complicating the DOMA rollback.

""It's a patchwork that makes no sense,"" Sainz says.

Role Of Obama Administration

So, how will this all be sorted out?

Both Sainz and Waldman say crucial roles can be played by both the Obama administration and Congress.

Same-sex marriage advocates predict, however, that with a Republican-dominated House, congressional action to resolve marriage definition disparities baked into law is unlikely. Congressional Democrats have written legislation that would uniformly apply a place of celebration standard, but it's unlikely to move beyond the Democratic-controlled Senate.

Through open and sometimes awkward conversations at home , these children say their parents ’ views are changing , even if their public stances haven ’ t caught up to their private views .
“ You can ’ t always come out and say how you really feel , especially in a GOP primary as it is today , ” said MSNBC host Abby Huntsman . She suspects her father , former Utah governor and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman , supported gay marriage even before publicly backing it in a 2013 op-ed .
Older Republicans , by and large , continue to oppose gay marriage , only a handful of Republican lawmakers publicly favor it , and none of the party ’ s presidential candidates have said they do . But the majority of young Republicans , like the majority of Americans , now support it .
With the Supreme Court preparing to hear oral arguments on same-sex marriage on Tuesday , the issue has become a hot topic on the presidential campaign trail , putting Republican discomfort with the issue in stark relief . Texas Senator Ted Cruz put out a statement last week affirming his stance against gay marriage , after news reports emerged that he attended a reception for him hosted by two gay hoteliers . He reportedly said at the event that he would not love his daughters any differently if they were gay .
In interviews with ███ , the children of prominent Republican politicians say they ’ ve seen their own parents struggle with and evolve in their views of marriage equality .
In 2013 , as Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake was considering a vote for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act , which would protect gay and transgender people , he posed a question to his son Ryan as the two sat in his Washington office . “ Do you think homosexuality is a choice ? ” Flake asked , according to Ryan .
Ryan , whose best friend and cousin had just come out , sending “ shockwaves ” through their conservative Mormon family , told his dad no , not usually .
“ He just sat there and pondered it for a while , ” Ryan said . “ That got to me . He was really trying to gather opinions . ”
Later that year , Democrat Tammy Baldwin , the nation ’ s first openly gay senator , approached Flake to lobby his support for the bill . She asked Flake to speak with a conservative Republican lawmaker with a transgender child ( that child is still a minor , and Ryan declined to share the lawmaker ’ s name ) . That conversation , Flake ’ s office confirmed , helped seal what the LGBT magazine the Advocate called his “ surprise ” vote in favor of the bill .
Since then , Ryan has become an increasingly avid advocate for gays and lesbians . Earlier this month , he marched in the Phoenix Pride parade . He ’ s joined pro-gay marriage Mormon groups and started volunteering at a shelter for LGBT youth . Ryan told his father that he thinks the young people he works with should be able to get married one day – and he describes his dad as a good listener .
“ I ’ m not saying he supports marriage equality . I can ’ t say that . I just can ’ t comment on that , ” said Ryan . “ I do think his views have evolved . He ’ s in a place in Washington , D.C. , where he ’ s had to deal with different people . ”
He added , “ Just as any other politician has to , there has to be a difference between private belief and what the majority may want . ”
When asked about his current position on gay marriage , Jeff Flake said , through a spokeswoman , “ This issue is now in the hands of the courts . ”
Some of the pleas are more personal . Matt R. Salmon ’ s parents were once among the staunchest opponents of gay marriage . His father , Arizona Rep. Matt Salmon , voted for a ban on gay adoption and for the Defense of Marriage Act . His mother , Nancy , led a failed 2006 campaign to amend Arizona ’ s constitution to ban not only gay marriage , but legal recognition of any kind for same-sex couples .
At the time , Matt was in “ reparative therapy ” to reverse the homosexuality that made him and his parents feel ashamed . In 2008 , he quit the therapy and embraced his sexual identity , coming out to friends and on Facebook as gay .
His parents , he said , have come to embrace it , too . “ If you want to know the truth , my father was the first to come around , ” said Matt . “ He ’ s been exposed to a lot more in his life , especially given his position . He ’ s been exposed to a lot more ideas that are different than his own . ”
But in 2013 , his father — who served in the House from 1995-2001 and returned to the chamber that year — said that despite his son ’ s identity , he continued to oppose gay marriage . But that ’ s not the full story , according to Matt . Later that year , as the two drove to a motorcycle expo in Scottsdale and discussed the media blow-up over the congressman ’ s comments , he confided in his son that he would happily attend his wedding , whenever that may be .
Since then , said Matt , his parents have come around further in accepting his sexual identity . “ They ’ ve all only evolved more , to the point where they want to know about my dating life , where they want to know if anybody ’ s in my life making me happy . ”
His boyfriends have been “ welcomed with open arms ” at family events , and his mother has told him she will not involve herself again in anti-gay marriage campaigns . Matt said that conservative congressmen have approached his dad to thank him – his relationship with his son had helped them change their own views on LGBT issues .
Matt said he ’ d love to go into the details of the conversations he ’ s had with his father on those issues but that he can ’ t . “ There are opinions that my father privately holds that are different from his political positions that make them difficult to share . ''
“ Privately , things have evolved , ” Matt said of his father . “ As far as I know , his political stances haven ’ t changed . ”
“ It ’ s a private matter between him and his son , ” said a spokesman for the congressman .
Attitudes toward gay marriage have shifted rapidly in recent years . In 2004 , as Massachusetts was sanctioning the nation ’ s first legal same-sex marriages , only 42 percent of Americans thought they should be valid , compared to 55 percent who thought they shouldn ’ t be , according to Gallup .
A decade later , those numbers had reversed . The speed with which gay marriage and its acceptance has grown has often left politicians playing catch-up with the public – at least in public . Not long ago , those politicians were Democrats . In his new memoir , David Axelrod writes that , as many suspected , President Obama supported gay marriage back in 2008 even as he said that he opposed it . The president only came out to the nation in favor of gay marriage in 2012 , 16 years after state senate candidate Obama indicated his support for it on a questionnaire and long after his liberal base had embraced it .
As acceptance of gay marriage becomes more mainstream in the Republican Party , its leaders face a similar dilemma . Sixty-one percent of Republicans ages 18-29 favor gay marriage , compared to 22 percent of those age 65 and up . Within prominent Republican families , that divide means children – gay , transgender , and straight — are playing decisive roles in changing their parents ’ views .
In March 2013 , Sen . Rob Portman became the first Republican senator to announce his support for gay marriage , two years after his son Will came out to his parents as gay .
Last summer , a lesbian relative of Scott Walker ’ s wife married another woman , and Walker ’ s son Alex acted as a witness . The Wisconsin governor has said that both of his sons have pushed the view that government should have no hand in regulating marriage . “ That ’ s a solid argument , ” Walker told Buzzfeed in 2013 . “ I personally may not embrace that yet . But that , to me , is a bigger question… I get their concerns . ”
Last month , Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen was one of 300 Republicans to sign on to an amicus brief in support of gay marriage filed with the Supreme Court . She ’ s said her transgender son Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen , who was born as a girl and came out to her parents as lesbian before identifying as a man , has influenced her views on gender and sexuality .
“ One of the biggest ways that my sister and I influenced my mother ’ s views on LGBT issues was by simply speaking about them openly , ” said Heng-Lehtinen . “ Growing up , my sister Patty and I did not hide our LGBT friends nor shy away from discussing LGBT topics in the news . This was the case long before I came out as a transgender man . ”
Earlier this month , Arkansas Gov . Asa Hutchinson refused to sign a “ religious freedom ” bill that critics said would have permitted discrimination against gays , citing the influence of his son Seth , a liberal labor organizer in Texas , who emailed his father about his objections to the bill .
I didn ’ t really come up with any original arguments on it , ” said Seth Hutchinson – a sign that the messenger often matters as much as the message .

Besides Jeff Flake , the other “ surprise ” vote in favor of ENDA in November 2013 was Flake ’ s Arizona colleague John McCain . His daughter Meghan , a pundit and LGBT rights activist who will co-host a country music concert being put on by GLAAD in June , said she ’ s discussed LGBT issues with her father , though he continues to oppose gay marriage both publicly and privately . “ There ’ s tension when I go home on occasion but my father and I get along great , ” said Meghan McCain . “ Obviously , I wish he would come around publicly for LGBT rights and marriage equality , but he ’ s 80 years old. ” [ McCain is 78 ]
Even many of those too set in their ways to embrace gay marriage have grown less and less motivated to oppose it . Over the weekend , Sean Buckley , a Georgetown student and great-nephew of the late William F. Buckley , came out as gay and a supporter of same-sex marriage in a Daily Beast op-ed .
Buckley told ███ that he ’ s been lobbying the older members of his family , who continue to oppose gay marriage . His great-uncle founded National Review as a publication that “ stands athwart history , yelling Stop , ” but the surviving older members of his family don ’ t expect to stop gay marriage , he said . “ They see this as something that ’ s inevitable . ”","Some of the most effective lobbyists on same-sex marriage don’t stalk the halls of Congress or pound the pavement on K Street: They’re the children of Republican politicians.

Through open and sometimes awkward conversations at home, these children say their parents’ views are changing, even if their public stances haven’t caught up to their private views.

“You can’t always come out and say how you really feel, especially in a GOP primary as it is today,” said MSNBC host Abby Huntsman. She suspects her father, former Utah governor and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman, supported gay marriage even before publicly backing it in a 2013 op-ed.

Older Republicans, by and large, continue to oppose gay marriage, only a handful of Republican lawmakers publicly favor it, and none of the party’s presidential candidates have said they do. But the majority of young Republicans, like the majority of Americans, now support it.

With the Supreme Court preparing to hear oral arguments on same-sex marriage on Tuesday, the issue has become a hot topic on the presidential campaign trail, putting Republican discomfort with the issue in stark relief. Texas Senator Ted Cruz put out a statement last week affirming his stance against gay marriage, after news reports emerged that he attended a reception for him hosted by two gay hoteliers. He reportedly said at the event that he would not love his daughters any differently if they were gay.

In interviews with POLITICO, the children of prominent Republican politicians say they’ve seen their own parents struggle with and evolve in their views of marriage equality.

In 2013, as Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake was considering a vote for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would protect gay and transgender people, he posed a question to his son Ryan as the two sat in his Washington office. “Do you think homosexuality is a choice?” Flake asked, according to Ryan.

Ryan, whose best friend and cousin had just come out, sending “shockwaves” through their conservative Mormon family, told his dad no, not usually.

“He just sat there and pondered it for a while,” Ryan said. “That got to me. He was really trying to gather opinions.”

Later that year, Democrat Tammy Baldwin, the nation’s first openly gay senator, approached Flake to lobby his support for the bill. She asked Flake to speak with a conservative Republican lawmaker with a transgender child (that child is still a minor, and Ryan declined to share the lawmaker’s name). That conversation, Flake’s office confirmed, helped seal what the LGBT magazine the Advocate called his “surprise” vote in favor of the bill.

Since then, Ryan has become an increasingly avid advocate for gays and lesbians. Earlier this month, he marched in the Phoenix Pride parade. He’s joined pro-gay marriage Mormon groups and started volunteering at a shelter for LGBT youth. Ryan told his father that he thinks the young people he works with should be able to get married one day – and he describes his dad as a good listener.

“I’m not saying he supports marriage equality. I can’t say that. I just can’t comment on that,” said Ryan. “I do think his views have evolved. He’s in a place in Washington, D.C., where he’s had to deal with different people.”

He added, “Just as any other politician has to, there has to be a difference between private belief and what the majority may want.”

When asked about his current position on gay marriage, Jeff Flake said, through a spokeswoman, “This issue is now in the hands of the courts.”

Some of the pleas are more personal. Matt R. Salmon’s parents were once among the staunchest opponents of gay marriage. His father, Arizona Rep. Matt Salmon, voted for a ban on gay adoption and for the Defense of Marriage Act. His mother, Nancy, led a failed 2006 campaign to amend Arizona’s constitution to ban not only gay marriage, but legal recognition of any kind for same-sex couples.

At the time, Matt was in “reparative therapy” to reverse the homosexuality that made him and his parents feel ashamed. In 2008, he quit the therapy and embraced his sexual identity, coming out to friends and on Facebook as gay.

His parents, he said, have come to embrace it, too. “If you want to know the truth, my father was the first to come around,” said Matt. “He’s been exposed to a lot more in his life, especially given his position. He’s been exposed to a lot more ideas that are different than his own.”

But in 2013, his father — who served in the House from 1995-2001 and returned to the chamber that year — said that despite his son’s identity, he continued to oppose gay marriage. But that’s not the full story, according to Matt. Later that year, as the two drove to a motorcycle expo in Scottsdale and discussed the media blow-up over the congressman’s comments, he confided in his son that he would happily attend his wedding, whenever that may be.

Since then, said Matt, his parents have come around further in accepting his sexual identity. “They’ve all only evolved more, to the point where they want to know about my dating life, where they want to know if anybody’s in my life making me happy.”

His boyfriends have been “welcomed with open arms” at family events, and his mother has told him she will not involve herself again in anti-gay marriage campaigns. Matt said that conservative congressmen have approached his dad to thank him – his relationship with his son had helped them change their own views on LGBT issues.

Matt said he’d love to go into the details of the conversations he’s had with his father on those issues but that he can’t. “There are opinions that my father privately holds that are different from his political positions that make them difficult to share.""

“Privately, things have evolved,” Matt said of his father. “As far as I know, his political stances haven’t changed.”

“It’s a private matter between him and his son,” said a spokesman for the congressman.

Attitudes toward gay marriage have shifted rapidly in recent years. In 2004, as Massachusetts was sanctioning the nation’s first legal same-sex marriages, only 42 percent of Americans thought they should be valid, compared to 55 percent who thought they shouldn’t be, according to Gallup.

A decade later, those numbers had reversed. The speed with which gay marriage and its acceptance has grown has often left politicians playing catch-up with the public – at least in public. Not long ago, those politicians were Democrats. In his new memoir, David Axelrod writes that, as many suspected, President Obama supported gay marriage back in 2008 even as he said that he opposed it. The president only came out to the nation in favor of gay marriage in 2012, 16 years after state senate candidate Obama indicated his support for it on a questionnaire and long after his liberal base had embraced it.

As acceptance of gay marriage becomes more mainstream in the Republican Party, its leaders face a similar dilemma. Sixty-one percent of Republicans ages 18-29 favor gay marriage, compared to 22 percent of those age 65 and up. Within prominent Republican families, that divide means children – gay, transgender, and straight — are playing decisive roles in changing their parents’ views.

In March 2013, Sen. Rob Portman became the first Republican senator to announce his support for gay marriage, two years after his son Will came out to his parents as gay.

Last summer, a lesbian relative of Scott Walker’s wife married another woman, and Walker’s son Alex acted as a witness. The Wisconsin governor has said that both of his sons have pushed the view that government should have no hand in regulating marriage. “That’s a solid argument,” Walker told Buzzfeed in 2013. “I personally may not embrace that yet. But that, to me, is a bigger question… I get their concerns.”

Last month, Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen was one of 300 Republicans to sign on to an amicus brief in support of gay marriage filed with the Supreme Court. She’s said her transgender son Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, who was born as a girl and came out to her parents as lesbian before identifying as a man, has influenced her views on gender and sexuality.

“One of the biggest ways that my sister and I influenced my mother’s views on LGBT issues was by simply speaking about them openly,” said Heng-Lehtinen. “Growing up, my sister Patty and I did not hide our LGBT friends nor shy away from discussing LGBT topics in the news. This was the case long before I came out as a transgender man.”

Earlier this month, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson refused to sign a “religious freedom” bill that critics said would have permitted discrimination against gays, citing the influence of his son Seth, a liberal labor organizer in Texas, who emailed his father about his objections to the bill.

I didn’t really come up with any original arguments on it,” said Seth Hutchinson – a sign that the messenger often matters as much as the message.

Besides Jeff Flake, the other “surprise” vote in favor of ENDA in November 2013 was Flake’s Arizona colleague John McCain. His daughter Meghan, a pundit and LGBT rights activist who will co-host a country music concert being put on by GLAAD in June, said she’s discussed LGBT issues with her father, though he continues to oppose gay marriage both publicly and privately. “There’s tension when I go home on occasion but my father and I get along great,” said Meghan McCain. “Obviously, I wish he would come around publicly for LGBT rights and marriage equality, but he’s 80 years old.” [McCain is 78]

Even many of those too set in their ways to embrace gay marriage have grown less and less motivated to oppose it. Over the weekend, Sean Buckley, a Georgetown student and great-nephew of the late William F. Buckley, came out as gay and a supporter of same-sex marriage in a Daily Beast op-ed.

Buckley told POLITICO that he’s been lobbying the older members of his family, who continue to oppose gay marriage. His great-uncle founded National Review as a publication that “stands athwart history, yelling Stop,” but the surviving older members of his family don’t expect to stop gay marriage, he said. “They see this as something that’s inevitable.”",www.politico.com,left,yXaIQKTslvZLRgFQ

Baby was found abandoned in a New York City subway station

'Papa' and 'Daddy' wed on the anniversary of meeting -- but they were already a family

The family lives a quiet life in Manhattan

The idea for getting married was partly Kevin's idea.

The 11-year-old also thought it would be neat if daddy and papa tied the knot on the same day the couple met 15-years earlier on a softball field.

So Peter Mercurio -- papa -- and Daniel Stewart -- daddy -- started planning.

""I was walking Kevin to school one morning,"" Mercurio said, explaining to his son that he did not know yet who would conduct the ceremony, or where. And he said, 'Don't judges perform ceremonies? Why don't you try to contact the judge who finalized my adoption?' I said that was a great idea.""

It is a personal narrative, though no less important -- than trying to figure out the meaning of the Constitution and the limits of ""equal protection.""

A day old and abandoned

""I found a baby!"" Stewart's voice was frantic, and the echoes from the A/C/E subway station on Eighth Avenue only added to the initial confusion. ""I said I had called 911, but I didn't think they believed me.""

""I told him I didn't believe it either,"" said Mercurio.

But he rushed to the scene and to a remote area behind the turnstiles. There, wrapped in a dark sweatshirt, lying quietly, was a brown-skinned, day-old infant. Abandoned.

They could have walked away, but they stayed.

Authorities soon arrived and took the child, naming him Daniel Ace Doe -- for the man who found him, the subway line, and the sad anonymity.

The story made news.

A few months later, Stewart was called to testify in family court about.

The judge dropped a bombshell: ""Would you be interested in adopting this baby?""

The answer was an immediate yes.

But Stewart privately knew it would not be easy. His partner at first wanted to go slowly, or not at all.

""My first reaction when I heard: 'Are you insane? How could you say yes without consulting me?'"" said Mercurio, laughing at the memory.

The couple had been together three years but their careers as an aspiring playwright and social worker took precedence at the time.

Becoming parents and strengthening their bond was never discussed.

""I saw this opportunity here, this gift to be parents to this child. And how could we not say yes to that opportunity?"" Stewart said told CNN Justice Correspondent Joe Johns. ""It seemed like it was divine intervention -- it was meant to be.""

Mercurio agreed.

""I think a lot of my initial response to Danny -- saying we were not ready to do this -- was all fear-based. And once I got over that, a calm set in. And you know, we went about methodically, preparing our lives for a child.""

Crib and blankets just before Christmas

It was a mad scramble to get ready, parenting classes, crib, diapers, and blankets. Then just days before Christmas, they were told the baby would be transferred to their care.

""Our paternal instincts took over and it became a natural thing of how to take care of him,"" Mercurio said.

They took their son home on a snowy day, riding the same C train where they found him.

As blessed as they felt, the couple knew there would be challenges.

When they first held the boy -- whom they soon renamed Kevin -- at the foster home they found him guarded.

""In fact when we saw him he didn't blink. His eyes were just wide open and his arms were very stiff and tightly crossed across his chest,"" said Mercurio.

""So we got him in this condition and we thought we just need to love this kid immediately,"" added Stewart. ""So we played with him and build up his trust in parents. Build up his trust in adults -- that he could be cared for, nurtured, and loved. So we showered him with love and touch. Didn't take long. He loosened up.""

CNN is not identifying Kevin by his last name or his picture, to protect his privacy. But he knows the story of his discovery.

A quiet family life

Mercurio and Stewart created an illustrated child's storybook, dramatizing the events-- from the subway to meeting his new family.

""One day he asked me: Dad is the story about me?"" said Stewart.

""I was very happy,"" said Kevin.

He likes sports, his school, and his friends.

The family went back to the dark underground station. They were all a little nervous about how Kevin would react.

""I think that was important for him to see and know that because now he has a connection,"" said Stewart. ""I mean it's not just something abstract. He really has seen, and knows, and understands.

Attorney General Eric Holder has for the first time directed Justice Department employees to give same-sex married couples ""full and equal recognition, to the greatest extent under the law,"" a move with far-ranging consequences for how such couples are treated in federal courtrooms and proceedings.

The directive specifies that such couples can decline to give testimony in U.S. cases that might incriminate a spouse, known in the law as marital privilege. The guidance says the Justice Department won't object to that even if the state where the couple lives doesn't formally recognize the marriage.



It also means U.S. trustees will take the position that same-sex married couples should be able to file jointly for bankruptcy ""and that domestic support obligations should include debts, such as alimony, owed to a former same-sex spouse.""



And in federal prisons, same-sex married inmates will have visitation privileges, escorted trips to attend a spouse's funeral and compassionate release policies if their spouse suffers severe illness.



Holder is preparing to make the new policy public Saturday evening at a gala event for the Human Rights Campaign in New York.

(CNN) - For Southern Baptist pastor Tim Reed, it was Scripture versus the Scouts.

“God’s word explicitly says homosexuality is a choice, a sin,” said Reed, pastor of First Baptist Church of Gravel Ridge in Jacksonville, Arkansas.

So when the Boy Scouts of America voted to lift its ban on openly gay youths on May 24, Reed said the church had no choice but to cut its charter with Troop 542.

“It’s not a hate thing here,” Reed told CNN affiliate Fox 16. “It’s a moral stance we must take as a Southern Baptist church.”

Southern Baptist leaders say Reed is not alone.

Baptist churches sponsor nearly 4,000 Scout units representing more than 100,000 youths, according to the Boy Scouts of America.

That number could drop precipitously.

The Southern Baptist Convention, the country’s largest Protestant denomination, will soon urge its 45,000 congregations and 16 million members to cut ties with the Scouts, according to church leaders.

The denomination will vote on nonbinding but influential resolutions during a convention June 11-12 in Houston.

“There’s a 100% chance that there will be a resolution about disaffiliation at the convention,” said Richard Land, the outgoing head of the Southern Baptists’ Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, “and a 100% chance that 99% of people will vote for it.”

“Southern Baptists are going to be leaving the Boy Scouts en masse,” Land continued.

Roger “Sing” Oldham, a spokesman for the Southern Baptist Convention, emphasized that local congregations make their own decision on the Scouts.

But he, too, said he expects Baptist delegates, which the church calls “messengers,” to voice their disagreement with the BSA's decision to allow gay youths.

“With this policy change, the Boy Scouts’ values are contradictory to the basic values of our local churches,” Oldham said.

Several religious groups with strong Scouting ties support the new policy.

“We have heard from both those who support the amended policy and those who would have preferred it would not have changed,” said BSA spokesman Deron Smith.

“There have been some organizations that have decided not to renew their charters with Scouting,"" said Smith, ""but we can’t quantify the impact of the amended policy.""

The National Jewish Committee on Scouting, the United Church of Christ, the Episcopal Church, the Unitarian Universalist Association and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which sponsors more Scout units than any other faith, all endorsed the change.

The National Catholic Committee on Scouting, which is run with oversight from a bishop, said Thursday that allowing gay youths in the Scouts does not conflict with church teaching. Each bishop will decide whether or not to allow churches in his diocese to charter Scout units, the committee added.

“We ask that Catholic Scouters and chartered organization heads not rush to judgment,” said Edward Martin, chairman of the National Catholic Committee on Scouting.

But the Rev. Derek Lappe, pastor of the Our Lady Star of the Sea Catholic Church in Bremerton, Washington, has already made up his mind.

“I do not feel that it is possible for us to live out, and to teach, the authentic truth about human sexuality within the confines of the Boy Scout’s new policy,” said Lappe.

The priest told CNN affiliate FOX16 that his parish will part ways with the Scouts and develop its own programs.

There may soon be an alternative to the Scouts for social conservatives like Lappe.

John Stemberger, founder of On My Honor, a group that opposed the Scouts’ change in policy, plans to convene conservatives in Louisville, Kentucky, in June to consider forming a new Scout-like group, which could be up and running by the end of 2013.

“Churches and Scoutmasters are looking for leadership and direction,” said Stemberg, an attorney in Orlando, Florida.

The `` decisions put two giant cracks in the dark wall of discrimination , '' advocate says
A deeply divided Supreme Court nudged the nation toward broad recognition of same-sex marriage on Wednesday in rulings that advocates hailed as a `` joyous occasion '' -- but still left many questions unanswered .
Voting 5-4 in each of two decisions , justices threw out part of a law that denied hundreds of federal benefits to same-sex couples and cleared the way for gays and lesbians to once again marry in California .
At the same time , the high court declined to make a sweeping statement on the broader issue of same-sex marriage rights nationwide , rejecting California 's same-sex marriage ban but leaving intact laws banning such marriages in 35 other states . New Jersey has civil unions for same-sex couples , while New Mexico 's marriage law is gender neutral and recognizes valid marriages performed in other states .
While the rulings fell short of the goal same-sex marriage advocates have set -- eliminating all laws limiting the rights of gays and lesbians to marry -- celebrations erupted outside the Supreme Court , as well as in San Francisco and around the country .
In Washington , the couples who sued to dismantle the Defense of Marriage Act and its ban on federal benefits for same-sex couples emerged from the Supreme Court to thunderous cheers , simply holding their arms aloft in victory .
In San Francisco , Crispin Hollins , who had already set a date for his wedding in the wake of the decision , said there was too much to celebrate to be disappointed by what the rulings did n't do .
`` I 'm confident that opinion in the United States is shifting towards being in favor of same-sex marriage , so it will simply take more time and allow the nation to come along in a way that will provide more lasting support for equality , '' he said .

Critics are dismayed as unanswered questions extend the debate

A deeply divided Supreme Court nudged the nation toward broad recognition of same-sex marriage on Wednesday in rulings that advocates hailed as a ""joyous occasion"" -- but still left many questions unanswered.

Voting 5-4 in each of two decisions, justices threw out part of a law that denied hundreds of federal benefits to same-sex couples and cleared the way for gays and lesbians to once again marry in California.

""Their refusal to redefine marriage for all states is a major setback for those seeking to redefine natural marriage,"" said Family Research Council President Tony Perkins. ""Time is not on the side of those seeking to create same-sex 'marriage.'""

What the rulings say

In its divided ruling on the federal Defense of Marriage Act, the high court said legally married same-sex couples must receive the same benefits provided to heterosexual couples. The act had defined marriage as only between a man and a woman, but the court said the law violated the rights of same-sex couples by demoting their marriages to second-class status when compared to their heterosexual peers.

The court said law wrongly ""instructs all federal officials, and indeed all persons with whom same-sex couples interact, including their own children, that their marriage is less worthy than the marriages of others.""

Now, the federal government recognizes the marriage of those same-sex couples who are legally married in their states.

A divided high court also handed a victory to same-sex proponents when it cleared the way for gay and lesbian couples to marry in California, dismissing an appeal to the state's voter-approved Proposition 8 that banned such marriages. The 5-4 decision avoids, for now, a sweeping conclusion on whether same-sex marriage is a constitutional ""equal protection"" right that would apply to all states.

Practical impact

In addition to restoring same-sex marriage in California, the decisions will eventually allow same-sex couples in states where they're legally allowed to marry to apply for retirement, survivor and other benefits as married couples.

They'll also be able to benefit from hundreds of other federal programs that have been, until now, reserved for heterosexual married couples under the Defense of Marriage Act's definition of marriage as between a man and a woman.

But exactly when they'll get those benefits is unclear.

After the decisions were announced, President Barack Obama ordered a review of federal statutes to ensure the ruling is ""implemented swiftly and smoothly."" But he didn't give a more precise timeline.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said he would work to get benefits to service members as soon as possible.

""That is now the law, and it is the right thing to do,"" he said.

It's also unclear when same-sex marriages might resume in California.

Gov. Jerry Brown said he wants marriage licenses to begin flowing to gay and lesbian couples the moment the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals confirms that a court order preventing their issuance has been lifted.

Attorney General Kamala Harris said weddings could begin as soon as the order is lifted, which she said she was urging the court to do quickly.

In Los Angeles, the county registrar's office said they're ready.

""Couldn't be more proud'

Same-sex marriage advocates were, in a word, elated.

""I did not count on them moving this far,"" said New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who called it the rulings ""an incredible victory.""

""Today's historic decisions put two giant cracks in the dark wall of discrimination that separates committed gay and lesbian couples from full equality,"" said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, who called the rulings ""a joyous milestone.""

""While we celebrate the victory for Californians today, tomorrow we turn our attention to the millions of LGBT people who don't feel the reach of these decisions,"" he said.

American University student Mollie Wagoner was waiting outside the Supreme Court for the decision with her girlfriend, Sharon Burk, when the word came down.

""I don't even have words. I'm just so happy, and just overwhelmed with emotion,"" she said. ""I couldn't be more proud of my country and of the Supreme Court today. I'm so happy to be here and be a part of it.""

'A devastating thing'

Of course, not everyone was pleased by the ruling. While public opinion has shifted strongly toward support of same-sex marriage in recent years, many conservatives, particularly faith-based conservatives, find the idea of same-sex marriage incomprehensible and dangerous.

The Rev. Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, found the decision on the Defense of Marriage Act, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, immensely troubling.

""Justice Kennedy's opinion takes us to the brink of nationwide same-sex marriage. And I believe that will be a devastating thing for this country,"" he said.

lgbt_rights,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2015/0626/Supreme-Court-declares-same-sex-couples-fundamental-right-to-marry,Supreme Court declares same-sex couples' 'fundamental right' to marry,2015-06-26,Warren Richey,"In a landmark decision , the US Supreme Court on Friday ruled that gay men and lesbians enjoy a fundamental right to marry and that none of the 50 states has the power to defy that constitutional guarantee of freedom and equal protection .
In a 5-to-4 decision , the high court issued the constitutional equivalent of a grand-slam homerun for same-sex couples across the United States .
“ The right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person , and under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment couples of the same-sex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty , ” Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion .
“ The court now holds that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry , ” he declared . “ No longer may this liberty be denied to them . ”
The high court also ruled that in addition to issuing licenses to same-sex couples , all 50 states must recognize the legitimacy of same-sex marriages performed in any other state .
Currently , 37 states recognize same-sex marriages , while 13 states had maintained the traditional definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman .
The high court decision represents a major advance for civil and equal rights for the lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) community . It marks the continued emergence of that community from its closeted , second-class existence for much of human history . And it establishes a firm legal foundation upon which gay rights advocates will push for broader freedoms , equality , and protections .
At the same time , Justice Kennedy ’ s majority opinion marks a significant setback for conservatives seeking to maintain the federalist structure of government . Rather than allowing the contentious social issue of marriage to be decided by the people and their elected representatives on a state-by-state basis , the high court decided instead to constitutionalize the issue of same-sex marriage and answer the question itself .
The dissenting justices predict that that court ’ s actions in cutting off democratic debate over the issue will inflame opposition , rather than lead to national healing and greater tolerance . In addition , the decision sets the stage for more contentious battles ahead between gay rights activists and religious and social conservatives , they warn .
“ When decisions are reached through democratic means , some people will inevitably be disappointed with the results . But those whose views do not prevail at least know that they have had their say , and accordingly are – in the tradition of our political culture – reconciled to the result of a fair and honest debate , ” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in a dissenting opinion .
That democratic dynamic was cut short by the majority decision , the chief justice said .
“ By deciding this question under the Constitution , the court removes it from the realm of democratic decision , ” Roberts said . “ There will be consequences to shutting down the political process on an issue of such profound significance . Closing debate tends to close minds . ”
Kennedy dismissed such concerns . “ Of course , the Constitution contemplates that democracy is the appropriate process for change , ” he said , “ so long as that process does not abridge fundamental rights . ”
When fundamental rights are at stake , he said , the court has a duty to address the issue .
Kennedy said that marriage was a keystone of the social order in America and that it was intolerable to exclude gay men and lesbians from full participation in that order .
“ It demeans gays and lesbians for the state to lock them out of a central institution of the nation ’ s society , ” he said .
“ The limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples may long have seemed natural and just , but its inconsistency with the central meaning of the fundamental right to marry is not manifest , ” Kennedy said . “ With that knowledge must come the recognition that laws excluding same-sex couples from the marriage right impose stigma and injury of the kind prohibited by our basic charter . ”
In his dissent , Chief Justice Roberts called the majority decision “ an act of will , not legal judgment . ”
“ The right it announces has no basis in the Constitution or this court ’ s precedent , ” he said .
“ If you are among the many Americans – of whatever sexual orientation – who favor expanding same-sex marriage , by all means celebrate today ’ s decision , ” the chief justice said .
“ Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal . Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner . Celebrate the availability of new benefits , ” Roberts said .
“ But do not celebrate the Constitution , ” he said . “ It had nothing to with it . ”
The chief justice said the Constitution leaves to the people and their elected representatives the authority to define marriage .
“ The fundamental right to marry does not include a right to make a state change its definition of marriage . And a state ’ s decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history can hardly be called irrational , ” Roberts said .
“ In short , our Constitution does not enact any one theory of marriage . The people of a state are free to expand marriage to include same-sex couples , or to retain the historic definition , ” he said .
Friday ’ s decision stems from lawsuits filed by same-sex couples in four states – Ohio , Michigan , Kentucky , and Tennessee – challenging their exclusion from traditional marriage laws .
Some couples sued to be allowed to marry . Others sued to have same-sex marriages performed in other states recognized in their new state of residence .
Lawyers for the states had argued that marriage is aimed at heading-off the societal problem of unwed mothers and fatherless children . They argued that it has existed through much of human history to encourage a man and woman to remain together as a family to raise their biological offspring .
Lawyers for same-sex couples dismissed that explanation , arguing that allowing same-sex couples to marry would in no way undercut the ability of opposite-sex couples to marry and raise their own children .
Kennedy ’ s majority decision comes less than two months after he commented during oral argument about the difficulty of a judge ordering the nation to change a definition of marriage that had existed throughout most of human history .
“ This definition has been with us for millennia , ” Kennedy said during oral argument in late April . “ And it ’ s very difficult for the court to say , oh , well , we know better . ”
But that is , essentially , what Justice Kennedy did on Friday .
In a dissent , Justice Antonin Scalia said the majority opinion represents a threat to American democracy by a majority of nine lawyers on the Supreme Court who claim the power to create liberties to be protected under the Constitution .
Scalia said when the high court wields power to revise the Constitution it robs the American people of the freedom to govern themselves .
“ Until the courts put a stop to it , public debate over same-sex marriage displayed American democracy at its best , ” Scalia said . He said the court ’ s decision to end the debate and resolve the issue itself was a “ naked judicial claim to legislative – indeed super-legislative – power . ”
“ A system of government that makes the people subordinate to a committee of nine unelected lawyers does not deserve to be called a democracy , ” Scalia said .
In his majority opinion , Kennedy said that if rights were defined only by those who exercised them , new groups would never be able to invoke those rights once they were denied . He said the right to same-sex marriage was part of the liberty promised in the Fourteenth Amendment .
“ The right to marry is fundamental as a matter of history and tradition , but rights come not from ancient sources alone . They rise , too , from a better informed understanding of how constitutional imperatives define a liberty that remains urgent in our own era , ” Kennedy said .
“ Many who deem same-sex marriage to be wrong reach that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or philosophic premises , and neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged here . ”
“ But when that sincere , personal opposition becomes enacted law and public policy , the necessary consequence is to put the imprimatur of the state itself on an exclusion that soon demeans or stigmatizes those whose own liberty is then denied , ” Kennedy said .
“ Under the Constitution , same-sex couples seek in marriage the same legal treatment as opposite-sex couples , and it would disparage their choices and diminish their personhood to deny them this right , ” he said .
Joining Kennedy in the majority were Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Stephen Breyer , Sonia Sotomayor , and Elena Kagan .
Dissenting opinions were filed by Chief Justice Roberts , and Justices Scalia , Clarence Thomas , and Samuel Alito .","In a landmark decision, the US Supreme Court on Friday ruled that gay men and lesbians enjoy a fundamental right to marry and that none of the 50 states has the power to defy that constitutional guarantee of freedom and equal protection.

In a 5-to-4 decision, the high court issued the constitutional equivalent of a grand-slam homerun for same-sex couples across the United States.

“The right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person, and under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment couples of the same-sex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty,” Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion.

“The court now holds that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry,” he declared. “No longer may this liberty be denied to them.”

The high court also ruled that in addition to issuing licenses to same-sex couples, all 50 states must recognize the legitimacy of same-sex marriages performed in any other state.

Currently, 37 states recognize same-sex marriages, while 13 states had maintained the traditional definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman.

The high court decision represents a major advance for civil and equal rights for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community. It marks the continued emergence of that community from its closeted, second-class existence for much of human history. And it establishes a firm legal foundation upon which gay rights advocates will push for broader freedoms, equality, and protections.

At the same time, Justice Kennedy’s majority opinion marks a significant setback for conservatives seeking to maintain the federalist structure of government. Rather than allowing the contentious social issue of marriage to be decided by the people and their elected representatives on a state-by-state basis, the high court decided instead to constitutionalize the issue of same-sex marriage and answer the question itself.

The dissenting justices predict that that court’s actions in cutting off democratic debate over the issue will inflame opposition, rather than lead to national healing and greater tolerance. In addition, the decision sets the stage for more contentious battles ahead between gay rights activists and religious and social conservatives, they warn.

“When decisions are reached through democratic means, some people will inevitably be disappointed with the results. But those whose views do not prevail at least know that they have had their say, and accordingly are – in the tradition of our political culture – reconciled to the result of a fair and honest debate,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in a dissenting opinion.

That democratic dynamic was cut short by the majority decision, the chief justice said.

“By deciding this question under the Constitution, the court removes it from the realm of democratic decision,” Roberts said. “There will be consequences to shutting down the political process on an issue of such profound significance. Closing debate tends to close minds.”

Kennedy dismissed such concerns. “Of course, the Constitution contemplates that democracy is the appropriate process for change,” he said, “so long as that process does not abridge fundamental rights.”

When fundamental rights are at stake, he said, the court has a duty to address the issue.

Kennedy said that marriage was a keystone of the social order in America and that it was intolerable to exclude gay men and lesbians from full participation in that order.

“It demeans gays and lesbians for the state to lock them out of a central institution of the nation’s society,” he said.

“The limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples may long have seemed natural and just, but its inconsistency with the central meaning of the fundamental right to marry is not manifest,” Kennedy said. “With that knowledge must come the recognition that laws excluding same-sex couples from the marriage right impose stigma and injury of the kind prohibited by our basic charter.”

In his dissent, Chief Justice Roberts called the majority decision “an act of will, not legal judgment.”

“The right it announces has no basis in the Constitution or this court’s precedent,” he said.

“If you are among the many Americans – of whatever sexual orientation – who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today’s decision,” the chief justice said.

“Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal. Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits,” Roberts said.

“But do not celebrate the Constitution,” he said. “It had nothing to with it.”

The chief justice said the Constitution leaves to the people and their elected representatives the authority to define marriage.

“The fundamental right to marry does not include a right to make a state change its definition of marriage. And a state’s decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history can hardly be called irrational,” Roberts said.

“In short, our Constitution does not enact any one theory of marriage. The people of a state are free to expand marriage to include same-sex couples, or to retain the historic definition,” he said.

Friday’s decision stems from lawsuits filed by same-sex couples in four states – Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, and Tennessee – challenging their exclusion from traditional marriage laws.

Some couples sued to be allowed to marry. Others sued to have same-sex marriages performed in other states recognized in their new state of residence.

Lawyers for the states had argued that marriage is aimed at heading-off the societal problem of unwed mothers and fatherless children. They argued that it has existed through much of human history to encourage a man and woman to remain together as a family to raise their biological offspring.

Lawyers for same-sex couples dismissed that explanation, arguing that allowing same-sex couples to marry would in no way undercut the ability of opposite-sex couples to marry and raise their own children.

Kennedy’s majority decision comes less than two months after he commented during oral argument about the difficulty of a judge ordering the nation to change a definition of marriage that had existed throughout most of human history.

“This definition has been with us for millennia,” Kennedy said during oral argument in late April. “And it’s very difficult for the court to say, oh, well, we know better.”

But that is, essentially, what Justice Kennedy did on Friday.

In a dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia said the majority opinion represents a threat to American democracy by a majority of nine lawyers on the Supreme Court who claim the power to create liberties to be protected under the Constitution.

Scalia said when the high court wields power to revise the Constitution it robs the American people of the freedom to govern themselves.

“Until the courts put a stop to it, public debate over same-sex marriage displayed American democracy at its best,” Scalia said. He said the court’s decision to end the debate and resolve the issue itself was a “naked judicial claim to legislative – indeed super-legislative – power.”

“A system of government that makes the people subordinate to a committee of nine unelected lawyers does not deserve to be called a democracy,” Scalia said.

In his majority opinion, Kennedy said that if rights were defined only by those who exercised them, new groups would never be able to invoke those rights once they were denied. He said the right to same-sex marriage was part of the liberty promised in the Fourteenth Amendment.

“The right to marry is fundamental as a matter of history and tradition, but rights come not from ancient sources alone. They rise, too, from a better informed understanding of how constitutional imperatives define a liberty that remains urgent in our own era,” Kennedy said.

“Many who deem same-sex marriage to be wrong reach that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or philosophic premises, and neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged here.”

“But when that sincere, personal opposition becomes enacted law and public policy, the necessary consequence is to put the imprimatur of the state itself on an exclusion that soon demeans or stigmatizes those whose own liberty is then denied,” Kennedy said.

“Under the Constitution, same-sex couples seek in marriage the same legal treatment as opposite-sex couples, and it would disparage their choices and diminish their personhood to deny them this right,” he said.

Joining Kennedy in the majority were Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan.

Dissenting opinions were filed by Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito.

DUBLIN — Ireland became the first country Saturday to legalize same-sex marriage by national referendum, a result that highlights the dramatic pace at which this traditionally conservative Catholic nation has changed in recent times.

Just 22 years after decriminalizing homosexuality, 62.1% of voters approved the measure changing the nation's constitution to allow gay marriage, according to official results by Ireland's referendum commission. National turnout in Friday's poll was 60.5% of 3.2 million eligible voters.

""With today's vote we have disclosed who we are: a generous, compassionate, bold and joyful people,"" Prime Minister Enda Kenny said, welcoming the outcome Saturday.

Emily Neenan, a physics student at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, was holding a large rainbow-colored umbrella in the forecourt at Dublin Castle, where ""Yes"" supporters gathered to celebrate outside the Irish government complex.

""I am absolutely thrilled and I didn't think it would pass with such a resounding yes,"" she said. ""Even in more traditional rural areas, it looks like we have done a lot better than we thought we would.""

As Neenan spoke on an unseasonably warm and sunny day in Ireland, an occasional cheer rose up from the crowd as Irish politicians who spearheaded the ""Yes"" campaign passed close by on their way to be interviewed by Ireland's domestic broadcasters.

""You know, it's about time Ireland did this,"" she said. ""It's time Irish society better understands what it looks like, and needs.""

Before official results were released, both sides confirmed the outcome earlier Saturday as votes were tallied.

""We're the first country in the world to enshrine marriage equality in our constitution and do so by popular mandate,"" Leo Varadkar, Ireland's health minister who revealed he was gay during the campaign, told state broadcaster RTE.

David Quinn, the director of the conservative Iona Institute, a leading figure behind the ""No"" campaign, tweeted: ""Congratulations to the 'Yes' side. Well done. #MarRef.""

Quinn said Friday that the movement to secure equal marriage rights for same-sex couples in Ireland appeared to be insurmountable. For months, polls indicated the majority of Irish voters were in favor of the change.

But in the days leading up to the vote, Ireland's government — which supports the measure — warned that attitudes may have been hardening and that victory wasn't certain.

Campaigners on both sides said the high turnout, buoyed by strong engagement from younger members of the electorate as well as the many Irish expatriates who returned home to cast their votes, contributed to the ""Yes"" result.

The referendum is seen as an especially complex one for Ireland, where about 85% of the population still identify as Roman Catholic even though church attendance has been steadily declining for a few decades. The church's moral authority has been questioned in the wake of a series of sexual abuse scandals and coverups involving children.

The country has been slow to follow a path of social liberalization that has taken root across Europe. Except in cases where a mother's life is perceived to be in danger, abortion is still illegal in Ireland. A prohibition on divorce was repealed only in 1996 following a national referendum.

Dublin's storied pubs were fuller than usual Saturday, and reverie spilled out onto streets all across the capital. Many were carrying balloons, flags and other accessories highlighting an issue that for some in that gay and lesbian community seemed almost too good to be true.

Hear and read the arguments in full

Toobin was among those who followed 80 minutes of arguments Tuesday over California's Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage. Voters approved the proposal 52% to 48% in November 2008, less than six months after the state Supreme Court ruled marriage is a fundamental right that must be extended to same-sex couples.

While admitting the law's defenders are ""not just any citizens,"" Kennedy raised concerns about whether just the possibility of same-sex marriage was enough to establish they had suffered harm -- a key jurisdictional hurdle allowing them to appeal in the first place.

Key questions answered

Justice Sonia Sotomayor said it is the state's responsibility -- through its elected leaders -- to defend laws in court, and that private individuals could not establish ""how their injury was separate from everyone else."" California Attorney General Kamala Harris, the state's top lawyer, said Tuesday she ""declined to defend Proposition 8 because it violates the Constitution.""

If the court dismisses the appeal on the grounds its defenders don't have the standing to defend the case in court, it may mean lower federal court rulings declaring the proposition unconstitutional would stand.

But it wouldn't allow for a broader, final rule outlining the power of states to say who can or can't get married.

Announcement of rulings unlikely before June

The justices did probe that broader legal question, including an exchange between pro-Proposition 8 attorney Charles Cooper and Justice Elena Kagan.

The court will listen to arguments on Wednesday on U.S. v. Windsor, a separate challenge to the federal Defense of Marriage Act which, like the California law, defines marriage as between a man and a woman.

That 1996 law prevents legally married same-sex couples from getting federal benefits and privileges, like tax breaks and survivor benefits, that are extended to opposite-sex couples.

Couple at the center of epic high court fight

The court is unlikely to announce its decisions on both matters until June.

Andrew Pugno, general counsel for the Protect Marriage Coalition, the group defending Proposition 8, said its attorney had ""credibly presented the winning case for marriage.""

""We think the hearing went very well,"" he told reporters.

Spirited rallies on both sides of debate

One of the plaintiff couples -- Paul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo of Burbank, California, who want to marry but can't because of Proposition 8 -- contend the state is discriminating against them because of their sexuality.

""This is about our freedom and our liberty,"" Katami said. ""We are not trying to topple marriage. We are not trying to redefine marriage. What we are trying to say is that equality is the backbone of our country.""

This view was echoed by fellow same-sex marriage supporters, who rallied outside the court with the hope that the justices would eventually issue a broad ruling to strike down bans nationwide.

5 turning points in the debate

""We are not asking for anything more than our neighbors, friends and family, but certainly expect no less,"" said Todd Bluntworth, who spoke with his husband and their two children.

But opponents who rallied nearby -- some of them carrying signs reading, ""Kids do best with a mom & dad"" -- urged the court to keep out of the issue and leave the decision to states.

""If you want to get married, go to one of the states that allows gay marriage,"" said Carl Boyd Jr., a conservative Nashville talk-show host. ""Stop trying to force your agenda down our throats. Quit trying to bully the American people with the homosexual agenda.""

Patchwork state laws

The court could historically alter how the law treats marriage, striking down laws across the country banning same-sex marriage and matching an apparent cultural shift toward acceptance of same-sex couples.

Or it could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place, choosing to let state legislatures and state courts sort it all out.

Forty-one states now forbid same-sex marriage, although nine of them allow civil partnerships. Nine other states allow same-sex marriage, and about 120,000 same-sex couples have gotten married, according to estimates.

By the numbers: Same-sex marriage

California's ban seems to run counter to polls that show rising support overall for same-sex marriage.

A CNN/ORC International poll released on Monday found 53% of Americans now support same-sex marriage, up from 40% in 2007. As to how the federal government should handle the issue -- the subject of Wednesday's hearing -- another CNN/ORC International poll out Tuesday found 56% of the public feels the federal government should also legally recognize same-sex marriages.

The Justice Department will argue against the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal law, on Wednesday.

Plaintiff: 'We were like most couples'

This comes as President Barack Obama has changed positions on same-sex marriage over his political career. Now fully supportive, he's said would strike down California's law if he sat on the Supreme Court.

Other prominent politicians have voiced timely opinions in recent weeks, indicating the matter's importance in 21st century American politics.

Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and possible 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, publicly backed same-sex marriage earlier this month.

The Republican party has historically backed efforts to define marriage as only between a man and a woman. But there's been notable movement of late among Republicans, including Sen.

(CNN) - The Supreme Court on Monday temporarily blocked same-sex marriage in Utah, an apparently unanimous order in favor of the state that sends the matter back to an appeals court for expedited consideration.

The case could have sweeping national implications, depending on how the federal appeals panel rules on a challenge to the state's same-sex marriage ban and whether the case returns to the high court.



Utah asked the Supreme Court to intervene last week after 10th Circuit Court of Appeals declined to stay a lower court ruling in December striking down Utah's voter-approved prohibition of legal wedlock for gays and lesbians.

Hundreds of people sought marriage licenses following U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby's ruling that said the restriction, approved in 2004, conflicted with the constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process.

Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor received the Utah petition and then asked her colleagues to weigh in.

The court followed up with a two-sentence order without comment that puts same-sex marriages on hold in Utah only.

Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said the Supreme Court made the ""correct"" decision to stay Shelby's ruling.

""As I have said all along, all Utahns deserve to have this issue resolved through a fair and complete judicial process. I firmly believe this is a state-rights issue and I will work to defend the position of the people of Utah and our State Constitution,"" he said in a statement.

One question arising from the Supreme Court ruling is the status of those who received marriage licenses after Shelby's ruling. The Utah Attorney General's office put the figure at around 950, but it was not clear how many people actually wed.

Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes gave no indication on Monday whether the state would try to challenge the validity of those unions.

""There is not clear legal precedence for this particular situation. This is the uncertainty that we were trying to avoid by asking the district court for a stay immediately after its decision. It is very unfortunate that so many Utah citizens have been put into this legal limbo,"" Reyes said in a statement.

The appeals panel in Denver is expected to consider the case again in coming weeks more thoroughly. A ruling there could affect all states within the court's jurisdiction: Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas.

More recently, same-sex marriage legal battles have become prominent in states where it is prohibited. But the Utah case is a broad challenge that goes to the heart of constitutional law as it applies to the state ban and could wind up back at the Supreme Court. Same-sex couples say laws like Utah's violate their equal protection and due process rights.

""It could be the challenge that a lot of people have been waiting for, which is does the United States Constitution guarantee a right to marriage for everyone,"" said CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""That's the issue in this case and it's now working its way through the courts. It could take quite some time.""

The Supreme Court ruled more narrowly this past summer on separate issues involving same-sex marriage.

It cleared the way for those unions in California to resume and rejected parts of a federal law, concluding same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits.

Most states still ban the practice, but polls show more support for it publicly.

Same-sex advocates look to Shelby's arguments to sway the appeals panel.

""Despite today's decision, we are hopeful that the lower court's well-reasoned decision will be upheld in the end and that courts across the country will continue to recognize that all couples should have the freedom to marry,"" Joshua Block, attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement.

The lawsuit considered by Shelby was brought by one gay and two lesbian couples in Utah who wish to marry but have been unable to do so because of the state ban.

Same-sex marriage is banned by constitutional amendment or state law in: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

It is legal in 17 other U.S states and the District of Columbia: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

Ghitis : 2013 should see impact of support for progressive tax rates , same-sex marriage
Gun control is now considered an urgent issue once again , she says
As the final days of 2012 trickle away , an uncommon emotional intensity hangs in the air in America . Something is happening here .
The laws have not caught up with this dramatic change in attitudes , and entrenched interests will fight what amounts to a quiet but pivotal social revolution . The coming year will see continuing battles in the courts , in the media and in legislatures , as the forces of change -- now representing the majority -- seek to upset the status quo .
No topic has stirred more passion in recent days than the clash between two competing rights : the right to own guns and the right not to get shot . Americans feel the lingering sadness , confusion and anger surrounding a recent massacre of schoolchildren , stirred more by the outrageous , dumbfounding , Christmas Eve murder of firefighters responding to a call for help in New York .
Then there 's that strange , unbecoming political show , the one with the ticking clock , known as the fiscal cliff . The contest over the budget sounds arcane , but it deals with a fundamental social value , the role of government in society , and the way the burden of financing ought to be shared .
Those are just the most immediate of the ongoing dramas adding stress to holiday dinners , energy to television shows and liveliness to coffee house debates .
The United States is reassessing matters that many thought had been settled . It was n't very long ago that the views from the most conservative elements of the political establishment dominated the social agenda .
Since the turn of the century we had seen a steady turn toward lower taxes , a ban on even discussing gun control , a rising wave of anti-gay legislation and all manner of conservative legislation . America seemed left behind , ossified , as other parts of the Western world , which generally share America 's culture and values , revised their views and rules on social issues .

In July , after the movie theater massacre in Colorado , President Obama unhelpfully , unnervingly , mused that `` if there 's anything to take away from this tragedy , it 's the reminder that life is very fragile . '' This time , in the wake of the Newtown massacre , he found a more practical takeaway , launching a push to stop gun violence . Most importantly , the tragedy energized the growing majority of Americans who support stepped-up gun control . It also prompted the powerful NRA to push back , and we can expect an all-out campaign whose outcome is far from certain . But the battle has been joined -- and not just in Washington .
It took far too many killings , but the massacre at Sandy Hook elementary finally pushed the matter of gun rights one awful step too far , and the conversation changed .
People who have spent decades working tirelessly for change will no doubt want to correct the impression that all this change has come suddenly . Surely , gay rights activists , gun control organizations have toiled with only minimal victories as reward . In recent months , however , we have reached a tipping point .
It may have something to do with the media -- social media , television , the Internet -- providing a boost to the message , a message of human dignity and common sense . It certainly has much to do with demographics . Young people , growing up with new ideas , are picking up the torch of social change .

Ghitis: 2013 should see impact of support for progressive tax rates, same-sex marriage

Gun control is now considered an urgent issue once again, she says

Ghitis: Opponents of progressive policies will stand against change

As the final days of 2012 trickle away, an uncommon emotional intensity hangs in the air in America. Something is happening here.

The laws have not caught up with this dramatic change in attitudes, and entrenched interests will fight what amounts to a quiet but pivotal social revolution. The coming year will see continuing battles in the courts, in the media and in legislatures, as the forces of change -- now representing the majority -- seek to upset the status quo.

Frida Ghitis

No topic has stirred more passion in recent days than the clash between two competing rights: the right to own guns and the right not to get shot. Americans feel the lingering sadness, confusion and anger surrounding a recent massacre of schoolchildren, stirred more by the outrageous, dumbfounding, Christmas Eve murder of firefighters responding to a call for help in New York.

Then there's that strange, unbecoming political show, the one with the ticking clock, known as the fiscal cliff. The contest over the budget sounds arcane, but it deals with a fundamental social value, the role of government in society, and the way the burden of financing ought to be shared.

Those are just the most immediate of the ongoing dramas adding stress to holiday dinners, energy to television shows and liveliness to coffee house debates.

The United States is reassessing matters that many thought had been settled. It wasn't very long ago that the views from the most conservative elements of the political establishment dominated the social agenda.

Since the turn of the century we had seen a steady turn toward lower taxes, a ban on even discussing gun control, a rising wave of anti-gay legislation and all manner of conservative legislation. America seemed left behind, ossified, as other parts of the Western world, which generally share America's culture and values, revised their views and rules on social issues.

In July, after the movie theater massacre in Colorado, President Obama unhelpfully, unnervingly, mused that ""if there's anything to take away from this tragedy, it's the reminder that life is very fragile."" This time, in the wake of the Newtown massacre, he found a more practical takeaway, launching a push to stop gun violence. Most importantly, the tragedy energized the growing majority of Americans who support stepped-up gun control. It also prompted the powerful NRA to push back, and we can expect an all-out campaign whose outcome is far from certain. But the battle has been joined -- and not just in Washington.

It took far too many killings, but the massacre at Sandy Hook elementary finally pushed the matter of gun rights one awful step too far, and the conversation changed.

People who have spent decades working tirelessly for change will no doubt want to correct the impression that all this change has come suddenly. Surely, gay rights activists, gun control organizations have toiled with only minimal victories as reward. In recent months, however, we have reached a tipping point.

It may have something to do with the media -- social media, television, the Internet -- providing a boost to the message, a message of human dignity and common sense. It certainly has much to do with demographics. Young people, growing up with new ideas, are picking up the torch of social change.

Today, a majority of Americans -- 57% -- favor stricter gun control , jumping sharply from 39% just a few months ago. That's bad news for the most conservative elements in society, who think the government should stand back from almost every aspect of our lives.

But the truly radical transformation has come in the area of gay rights. For the first time, Gallup Polls show a majority of Americans support full marriage equality for gay couples. That's an astonishing change. But it's not as astonishing as the wholesale acceptance of gay people that has suffused American society in the last few years.

Perhaps it was ""Will and Grace"" or ""Glee"" or President Obama's long-delayed approval of same-sex marriage. Probably all of the above and much more, but a switch has been flipped. The cause has gained an unstoppable momentum, so unstoppable that even if full equality is denied by the conservative-tilted Supreme Court, scheduled to rule on the issue by this summer, it will only amount to a delay of the inevitable.

Once again, the people are leading their leaders. Public views, especially among the young, hold that discrimination is not only wrong, it's silly.

Attitudes are changing in other ways that seemed unthinkable not long ago. Who would have thought Americans would favor legalizing drugs? Two-thirds of voters under age 30 support legalizing pot , bringing the overall total to 51%, and giving a boost to referendum campaigns on the issue.

Handout
When Julie Berman came up to the open mic at the trans day of remembrance event on Nov. 20 , 2017 , she delivered a speech about transphobia in Toronto . She talked about a trans friend of hers that was murdered .
On Sunday , a little over two years later , the trans woman and activist was assaulted and murdered .
“ It ’ s really heartbreaking ... the same thing that she was trying to be vocal about happened to her , ” said Davina Hader , a friend of the victim and a member of The 519 , an organization that advocates for the inclusion of LGBTQ communities ’ members and provides services for them .
Ms. Berman had asked her friend , who was filming the vigil in 2017 , not to release the clip online . “ I have that still , and I was thinking about releasing [ the video ] , ” Ms. Hader said .
Toronto police said they found Ms. Berman on Sunday suffering from head injuries in a residence in Toronto ’ s Brunswick Avenue and Harbord Street area . She was transported to hospital and pronounced dead . Police have charged Colin Harnack , 29 , of Toronto , with second-degree murder .
The suspect is not a known member of the LGBTQ community , according to Ms. Hader .
Through her activism , Ms. Berman was asking her community members to be more vigilant , Ms. Hader said . In the 2017 event , “ She was talking about another close friend who had been murdered ... It ’ s very emotional . ”
Ms. Berman used to be a hairdresser and was involved for almost three decades with community events at The 519 . “ She was struggling to survive as we all do , ” Ms. Hader said . “ It ’ s very unfortunate , very sad . ”
According to a study published in 2015 by Trans PULSE project that is led by professors in different universities in Ontario , trans people are targets of specifically directed violence . The study states that 20 per cent of Ontario ’ s trans people had been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans and another 34 per cent had been verbally threatened or harassed but not assaulted .
The study noted that many trans people did not report these assaults to the police , but didn ’ t explain why . However , the same study said 24-per-cent reported having been harassed by police .
“ I don ’ t know that [ trans women ] ever felt safe , ” said Olivia Nuamah , the executive director of Pride Toronto , “ For many in the trans community , sadly , violence is a part of life . ”
In the past couple of years , there have been three violent deaths in Toronto ’ s trans community , Ms. Nuamah said . “ Never mind what ’ s going on in North America more broadly . ”
Among those fatalities in Toronto was the death of Alloura Wells , who died in June , 2017 , but she was not reported missing until Nov. 6 , 2017 , and her body was not identified until Nov. 23 of that year .
Both Toronto Police Service and The 519 community centre in the Church-Wellesley Village were criticized for the way they handled communication in the case of Ms. Wells – a homeless , biracial transgender woman and , by extension , one of the city ’ s most vulnerable people .
Since then , Toronto Pride and The 519 have organized multiple events and workshops to provide education and support for the trans community members . Many other non-profit organizations are running support programs , anti-violence programs and counselling programs , Ms. Nuamah said .
“ For sure they ’ re nowhere near enough and the result often is many within the trans community are left vulnerable , ” Ms. Nuamah said .
The trans march that is organized during Toronto Pride celebrations in June is one of the largest in the world . “ This city , and country , try to be welcoming to all members of LGBTQ2+ community , ” Ms. Nuamah said . “ Our people participate in our events precisely to show that they are a strong community and also to raise awareness . ”
Ms. Nuamah considers the Sunday murder to be an alarming incident that should remind everyone about the high rates of violence the trans community experiences .

Ever since this summer ’ s Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges , which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide , Davis has been refusing to issue marriage licenses – to any couple , gay or straight – citing her religious beliefs . She was ordered by the governor to do her job , but she refused . She was ordered by a federal judge to do her job , but she refused . This week , the Supreme Court rejected her appeal of the federal judge ’ s decision , which should have been the final word on the matter , but she ’ s still refusing to the job she was elected by the people of Kentucky to do . And so now she ’ s being hauled before a judge to determine whether she ’ s in contempt of court .
There is no debate on that question : Davis is flagrantly in contempt and should be punished for what she ’ s done . After the Supreme Court rejected her appeal , a gay couple confronted Davis and asked her to explain what authority she had to continue denying them their rights . “ God ’ s authority , ” she shot back , which is the absolute wrong answer for a government employee to provide . The Constitution is the governing power in Kim Davis ’ office , and she is bound by oath to adhere to the law . She is breaking that oath , defying the Constitution , abusing her authority , and insisting that she suffer no consequences for her behavior .
Davis ’ illegal and morally dubious stand against gay marriage does appeal , however , to the slice of the conservative movement that is hell bent on restoring the good old days of godly virtue when you had the state ’ s blessing to discriminate against gay people . It just so happens that there are a number of Republican presidential candidates who are trying to motivate that highly politically active segment of the population to get behind their campaigns , and that ’ s led us to a situation in which people running for the nation ’ s highest elected office are cheering on a rogue government employee ’ s defiance of the Constitution .
If you were forced to guess which 2016 Republican candidate would line up behind Davis , you would of course choose Mike Huckabee , because Mike Huckabee is a crazy person who says things like “ the Supreme Court is not the supreme being , and they can not overturn the laws of nature or of nature ’ s god . ”
And you would be 100 percent correct . Here ’ s Huckabee in South Carolina calling Kim Davis a hero for defying the tyrants of the Supreme Court :
“ I salute her today , and I stand with her , ” Huckabee said , explaining that he called her up to thank her for standing up to “ judicial tyranny. ” Huckabee added : “ I thank God for Kim Davis , and I hope more Americans will stand with her . ”
Davis also got an attagirl from her home state senator and increasingly hopeless presidential contender , Rand Paul . Rand wasn ’ t quite so effusive in his praise of Davis as Huckabee , but he did say : “ I think people who do stand up and are making a stand to say that they believe in something is an important part of the American way. ” He is correct that American history is full of people who left their mark by controversially standing up for their beliefs in defiance of the law – people like Orval Faubus , and George Wallace . Rand explained that his preferred policy would be to get states out of the marriage business altogether , which would potentially resolve the issue but doesn ’ t really speak to the immediacy of the problem at hand .
Davis also got a hearty endorsement from Bobby Jindal , who is somehow still running for president despite polling in the mid to low zeroes . “ I do n't think anyone should have to choose between following their conscience and religious beliefs and giving up their job and facing financial sanctions , ” Jindal said in a statement to the Huffington Post .
Not every Republican candidate is behind Davis – Carly Fiorina , for example , has urged Davis to either give up or resign .

It ’ s possible that Davis could land in jail for contempt , and as ThinkProgress ’ Ian Millhiser notes , as a prisoner she “ could inspire others to defy the Constitution if she is perceived as a martyr. ” Were that to happen , we could see more would-be Republican presidents championing brazen illegality in the service of anti-gay discrimination .","Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis will appear in federal court today to explain why she believes that God and her personal convictions empower her to break the law and deny gay people their constitutionally protected rights.

lgbt_rights,USA TODAY,1,http://www.usatoday.com/longform/news/nation/2014/12/28/edie-windsor-gay-marriage/20967397/,Heroine of gay marriage movement feels pride in progress,2014-12-28,Richard Wolf,"As the year ends , ███ recognizes people in the news who embody these qualities . Today we highlight the work of same-sex marriage pioneer Edie Windsor . Upset at facing a $ 363,000 federal tax bill following the death of her spouse , Windsor , now 85 , filed a lawsuit seeking recognition of her marriage to Thea Spyer . In a 2013 decision , the Supreme Court ruled `` the principal purpose and the necessary effect of this law are to demean those persons who are in a lawful same-sex marriage , '' swinging the tide in favor of legal same-sex marriage . Today gay marriage is legal in 35 states , nearly double the total of states allowing the unions at the end of 2013 .
NEW YORK — The subject is same-sex marriage , but the vivacious blonde who has come to personify the issue stops her interrogator with a scolding .
`` Could I suggest that you do n't say same-sex marriage anymore ? '' Edie Windsor asks politely . `` Because it 's not . It 's marriage . ''
As in her own marriage to the late psychologist Thea Spyer , which followed a 40-year engagement . As in the wedding ceremonies she attends or is forced to skip because she ca n't keep up with all the invitations . As in the marriages sanctioned by judges in 27 states this year , all of which mention Windsor by name .
While 2013 brought the landmark ruling in United States v. Windsor that forced the federal government to recognize legally married gay men and lesbians , 2014 was the year that the case spurred a judicial juggernaut . From Oklahoma in January to Mississippi in December , federal judges in the nation 's most conservative states declared that what this 85-year-old widow started ca n't be stopped .
From the comfort of her apartment at the foot of Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village , Windsor recalls the `` mind-blowing days '' when state laws and constitutional amendments banning gay marriage were falling like so many dominoes .
`` The statistics were changing every night , '' she says . Even now , Windsor has trouble with the math – 35 states where marriage is legal for two men or two women , and 10 others where lower court judges have said it should be .

Smarter. Faster. More colorful.



As the year ends, USA TODAY recognizes people in the news who embody these qualities. Today we highlight the work of same-sex marriage pioneer Edie Windsor. Upset at facing a $363,000 federal tax bill following the death of her spouse, Windsor, now 85, filed a lawsuit seeking recognition of her marriage to Thea Spyer. In a 2013 decision, the Supreme Court ruled ""the principal purpose and the necessary effect of this law are to demean those persons who are in a lawful same-sex marriage,"" swinging the tide in favor of legal same-sex marriage. Today gay marriage is legal in 35 states, nearly double the total of states allowing the unions at the end of 2013.

NEW YORK — The subject is same-sex marriage, but the vivacious blonde who has come to personify the issue stops her interrogator with a scolding.

""Could I suggest that you don't say same-sex marriage anymore?"" Edie Windsor asks politely. ""Because it's not. It's marriage.""

As in her own marriage to the late psychologist Thea Spyer, which followed a 40-year engagement. As in the wedding ceremonies she attends or is forced to skip because she can't keep up with all the invitations. As in the marriages sanctioned by judges in 27 states this year, all of which mention Windsor by name.

While 2013 brought the landmark ruling in United States v. Windsor that forced the federal government to recognize legally married gay men and lesbians, 2014 was the year that the case spurred a judicial juggernaut. From Oklahoma in January to Mississippi in December, federal judges in the nation's most conservative states declared that what this 85-year-old widow started can't be stopped.

From the comfort of her apartment at the foot of Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village, Windsor recalls the ""mind-blowing days"" when state laws and constitutional amendments banning gay marriage were falling like so many dominoes.

""The statistics were changing every night,"" she says. Even now, Windsor has trouble with the math – 35 states where marriage is legal for two men or two women, and 10 others where lower court judges have said it should be.

""I didn't expect any of it,"" she says, ""and certainly not in the time frame.""

To be sure, several recent decisions upholding gay marriage bans in Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana and Puerto Rico have slowed progress and put the ultimate resolution in doubt. The Supreme Court that brought Windsor instant fame on June 26, 2013, will have to make the final call – perhaps next year.

But the court may have tipped its hand in October when it refused to hear appeals from Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Indiana and Wisconsin challenging lower court rulings that struck down gay marriage bans. Now most Americans live in states where such marriages are legal.

Windsor, a former IBM computer systems programmer, isn't discouraged by the setbacks. She never expected the fight she began in 2009 to be easy.

At least one part of the progress made to date cannot be taken away, she insists. ""They can't reverse the marriages,"" she says. ""People who are married are married.""

AFTER WINDSOR, THE DELUGE

When Windsor and her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, filed the lawsuit that would change the arc of history, only a handful of states allowed gays and lesbians to marry. By the time they won their case, there were a dozen. After Windsor came the deluge.

All that happened because Windsor balked at a $363,000 federal tax bill on Spyer's estate in 2009 – a tax that would not have been levied on the surviving spouse in a heterosexual marriage.

""The principal purpose and the necessary effect of this law are to demean those persons who are in a lawful same-sex marriage,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the 5-4 decision – one that Windsor says she's read ""20 times.""

In the 18 months since, as gay marriage moved from seeming incredible to inevitable, Windsor has been feted by the likes of President Obama and former president Bill Clinton. Plaques and trophies adorn her harpsichord. A 2014 photo album rests atop her coffee table. So many letters pour in from around the country and the world that she now responds with a pre-printed card.

Most fulfilling, however, has been the rapid pace of court decisions that have enabled tens of thousands of couples to marry or have their marriages recognized in their home states.

""The decisions are multiplying,"" Windsor says. ""The speed and the quantity of cases, it hasn't stopped.""

Neither has the steady progress in public opinion polls, which show that about 55% of Americans say gay marriage should be legal.

""For ages before my case, that was not true,"" Windsor says. She hopes those sentiments will turn the tide against what she calls ""terrible and ugly"" state proposals aimed at shielding merchants with religious objections from participating in same-sex marriages.

While Windsor is floored by her paparazzi-like fame, she takes greatest pride in the advances made by her gay and lesbian community.

For young people in particular, she says, ""hopefully it's the beginning of the end of suicides ... the beginning of the end of stigma ... the beginning of the end of internalized homophobia.""

STEPPING INTO THE SUBWAY

Five years removed from the heartache of Spyer's death, Edie Windsor is a whirlwind. She recalls the days when she begged her cardiologist to keep her alive long enough for the Supreme Court's ruling in her case. Now she's walking 10,000 brisk steps a day, and her heart function is improving.

Her schedule is filled out for the first six months of 2015 already, public appearances wedged between her sign language classes (she is hard of hearing) and chorus practice (Spyer encouraged her to sing). Riding the Broadway-7th Avenue Local subway, she revels in a brief dose of anonymity.

""What I am is a draw,"" Windsor says. ""Every organization that is having something wants me there because they double the number of people there.""

How long will she be able to keep up the pace? Windsor says it doesn't matter – the final victories in the gay marriage movement will happen, with her or without her.

""I've had a lot of the celebration and a lot of the joy,"" she says. ""It's OK if I'm not there for the rest of it.""

This Is Evil, Insane Child Abuse.",,,"Anthropologists in the future will spend a lot of time discussing and debating the question of when , exactly , the once-great American civilization went insane , why it happened , and how . I can only imagine what conclusions they will draw . As an American citizen in the present day , actually bearing witness to the collapse of sanity and reason in real time , I ’ m not sure that I can even answer those questions . Perhaps hindsight will lend some clarity to the issue .
What I do know is that this case will be viewed as a seminal moment in our collective plunge into madness . It will be seen as , at least from a legal standpoint , the point of no return . The crossing of some kind of terrible Rubicon . I refer to the story of 7-year-old James Younger , whose father , Jeff Younger , has been trying to save him from a forced gender “ transition . ”
Jeff has been locked in a bitter court battle with his ex-wife , Anne Georgulas . Despite being a medical professional — a pediatrician , God help us — who presumably understands basic facts about human biology and child psychology , Georgulas got it into her apparently deranged head that her son James is really a girl .
As The Texan previously reported , the factors that convinced Georgulas that her son is really her daughter include his affinity for the movie “ Frozen ” and his request to get a “ girl toy ” from McDonald ’ s . She also says he started expressing a wish to dress in girl ’ s clothing . But Jeff Younger recently explained in an interview that if James ever had any desire to wear dresses , it ’ s only because his mother started putting him in dresses and painting his nails when he was just 3-years-old . He claims that she used several other methods of manipulation , including locking the boy in his room and telling him that “ the monsters only eat boys. ” Jeff speculates that Georgulas would withhold affection from James if he did not act like a girl .
The court case revolved around Jeff ’ s efforts to rescue his sons ( James and his twin brother ) from the abuse of this sick and twisted woman . However , the decision was passed down yesterday , and the court ruled against the father . Virtually all control over James and his brother have now been handed to Georgulas . She is free to continue his “ social transition ” into a girl — a process already well under way , as he goes by “ Luna ” and poses as a girl at his mother ’ s house and at school . Eventually she can , and presumably will , start James on drugs to chemically castrate him . There is nothing his father can do to stop it , short of “ kidnapping ” the boy and fleeing the country ( a move that would be not only morally justified , but heroic ) .
It should be noted that , according to Jeff , James “ violently refuses ” to wear girl clothes when he is at his father ’ s house . Free from the clutches of his mother , Jeff says , James is relieved to act like a boy , dress like a boy , and play like a boy . The mother claims the opposite , insisting that James is excited to return to his mother and his identity as “ Luna. ” I think both claims are probably true , in a sense . The poor boy realizes that it pleases his mother for him to be Luna , and so he “ wants ” to play that role for her sake .
But , in any case , the question of how he really identifies is irrelevant . The point is that James is a boy , plain and simple . Whatever confusion he is suffering from — confusion painstakingly planted in his head by a mother who , in my opinion , should be locked in prison for the rest of her life — could be alleviated through counseling and therapy . There is precisely zero chance that James is “ really ” a girl trapped in a boy ’ s body , because that concept is nonsensical . James is who he is . And he is a boy .
In a morbid coincidence , there are reports today about the mother of a supposedly terminally ill Make-a-Wish kid who is now accused of murdering the 7-year-old daughter she claimed was sick . Investigators believe that the mother has Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy , a mental disorder in which parents invent or create illnesses in their children . I bring this case up because I believe that James Younger is the victim of a new , and increasingly common , kind of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy . His disturbed mother has , in effect , created gender confusion in her child . This case hopefully will not end in murder , but it may well end with the child ’ s physical mutilation at the behest of his mother . And considering the very high rate of suicide in the transgender community , it could certainly be argued that she is putting her son ’ s life at risk . She is certainly ruining it , at the very least .
We would make a huge mistake to treat James Younger ’ s plight as some kind of tragic anomaly . We live in a time when many children are having left-wing gender theories shoved down their throats . If most of these situations don ’ t result in heated legal disputes , it ’ s only because both parents are guilty of the abuse so there is no one around to bring the case . And the situation will only get worse if we don ’ t start paying attention . Children are being exploited and manipulated in the most insidious ways imaginable . We can ’ t sit by and watch it happen anymore .","Anthropologists in the future will spend a lot of time discussing and debating the question of when, exactly, the once-great American civilization went insane, why it happened, and how.

He was right . Today , news broke that Holder will leave the Department of Justice as soon as President Obama finds a replacement .
Toobin has described Holder as having `` two tenures '' as attorney general . In a phone conversation today , he described them to me .
Ezra Klein : What 's the single most important thing Eric Holder did as attorney general ?
Jeffrey Toobin : I think throwing the weight of the Justice Department behind the cause of gay rights will be seen as enormously important . Announcing support for the lawsuit against the Defense of Marriage Act [ DOMA ] was the biggest specific item in that regard , but in every possible way , the Justice Department has committed itself to the idea that discrimination against gay people is unlawful . That 's had enormous implications , and it will continue to reverberate as same sex marriage works its way through the courts .
He tried to close Guantanamo and it was a fiasco
JT : I see a real bifurcation in his tenure . I think during the first term Holder ran an inbox operation . He did what crossed his desk . He tried to close Guantanamo and it was a fiasco . He did a criminal investigation of the financial collapse which went nowhere . He struggled with Fast and Furious which occupied a lot of time if not importance . There were not a lot of accomplishments that first term .
But once President Obama was reelected and Holder saw the tremendous backlash against civil rights in the states that elected Republicans in 2010 , he said , the hell with it . I want to be known for something important even if it gets criticism .
EK : Earlier this year , when you profiled Holder 's struggle on civil rights , it seemed to be an open question whether he would be successful . Is that still true ?
JT : The Shelby County decision , striking down Sections Four and Five of the Voting Rights Act , was a transformational event in the history of voting rights . It opened the door to really major efforts to limit the franchise . Now because they Voting Rights Act itself is effectively gone it 's not clear that the Justice Department can do much about this . The Texas and North Carolina lawsuits are legally on questionable ground .
But I do think Holder deserves a lot of credit for saying if voting rights are going to die , we 're going to do whatever we can to try to keep it alive . I think that 's a very consequential attempt . Where it succeeds or not is far from clear .
EK : I want to go back for a second to Guantanamo and the banks . Part of the reason Holder is attorney general today is he impressed Barack Obama with a speech predicting a `` reckoning '' for the Bush administration 's war on terror policies . Obama certainly took office amid widespread fury with the banks . But the Obama administration has been resistant to aggressive prosecution on the major issues that propelled them to office . And particularly on the war on terror , it seems to me that the Obama administration has taken a much more expansive view of the president 's authority there than many supporters would have predicted .
In every single speech Barack Obama gave when running for president he said he would close Guantanamo
JT : In every single speech Barack Obama gave when running for president he said he would close Guantanamo . Every single one . His failure to do so is one of the great failures of his administration . How and why that 's failed is a complicated subject . But I think Holder bears a lot of responsibility for it . His announcement that he would try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in a federal criminal trial in New York led to the political backlash in Congress that , through legislation , tied Obama 's hands on closing Guantanamo . It was really a wall-to-wall disaster . Not all of it is Holder and Obama 's fault . They had very important adversaries in this issue of closing Guantanamo . But he is the president , it was a major campaign promise , and he utterly failed .
EK : What about the war on terror issues that have emerged on Obama 's watch , like Edward Snowden , or the prosecution of journalists like James Risen , or the decision to use drone strikes against American citizens living abroad ?
JT : It is true that the Obama administration has not departed from Bush administration war on terror policies nearly as much as his supporters hoped . But I am inclined to view these issues one by one and I think some positions are more defensible than others . I 'm not an Edwards Snowden fan and I think that they 're perfectly justified in prosecuting him . The subpoenas to journalists are a different matter .
things look different when you are the people who are responsible for protecting the US in a very dangerous world
I think part of this is the Justice Department as an institution is devoted to aggressive enforcement of criminal laws . That continues from administration to administration . I think the occupants of the top offices get captured by that approach regardless of what attitudes they brought in . I think also that things look different when you are the people who are responsible for protecting the US in a very dangerous world . If you sit there in the briefings and you hear what the dangers are that it is a major challenge to the civil libertarian instincts you brought into office .
EK : What about the banks ? There 's been reporting that in 2012 , the Obama administration 's political team was pressuring Holder to prosecute some top bankers . But it went nowhere .
JT : The major unanswered question I have is every other major financial collapse in American history has led to major criminal prosecutions . The S & L Crisis of the 1980s , insider trading in the 1990s . And here we have the biggest collapse since the Depression and not one person of consequence is even prosecuted , much less goes to prison . Now , the people in charge say this is because , as Mike Kinsley used to say , `` the scandal is what 's legal . '' What went on at Lehman Brothers and AIG and all these places was n't criminal . It had been vetted by lawyers . I think that is a very debatable proposition . I do n't pretend to have the answer but it is a very strange thing that no one went to prison as a result of the 2008 collapse .
as Mike Kinsley used to say , `` the scandal is what 's legal . ''
EK : This seems like the sort of thing where an attorney general who wanted to prosecute could have found ways to try to make the case .
JT : The challenge with white-collar prosecutions is always the issue of criminal intent . Did these actors know and believe they were violating the law in what they did ? Otherwise it 's not criminal . What Holder and his subordinates have always said is that the CEOs did not believe what they were doing was criminal . They were making bets that failed spectacularly but that 's not a crime .
I am enough of a former prosecutor myself to know these cases are very hard to make against prominent people surrounded by lawyers who can say , `` I consulted my lawyers before making any of these deals . '' But that does n't explain why they did n't make a single one .
EK : Let 's go back to Holder 's work on LGBT rights . Back when Holder decided not to defend DOMA in court , I remember a number of folks who believed DOMA should be overturned , but also believed the DOJ has a responsibility to defend the laws of the federal government .
Holder did n't just say that DOMA was unconstitutional . He said that no reasonable argument could be made that DOMA is constitutional .
JT : Holder did n't just say that DOMA was unconstitutional . He said that no reasonable argument could be made that DOMA is constitutional . That is a very different thing . It is the job of the Justice Department to defend the laws of the United States . That 's what the Justice Department does in virtually all circumstances in virtually all administrations . In a very small handful of cases the Justice Department says one of the laws is indefensible . But remember , this was a law passed in the 1990s with an overwhelming congressional majority and signed by Bill Clinton , a Democratic president . It was institutionally risky for Holder and Obama to say that this law was not just unconstitutional but beyond the pale .
I think history will vindicate them in a dramatic way . We appear to be approaching a moment where any law that draws a distinction between gay and straight people looks like a water fountain that says `` colored only '' . I think Holder saw that and he got the Justice Department on the right side of history faster than others might have .","Earlier this year, Jeffrey Toobin, the legal correspondent for The New Yorker, profiled Attorney General Eric Holder — and reported that Holder would step down this year. He was right. Today, news broke that Holder will leave the Department of Justice as soon as President Obama finds a replacement.

Toobin has described Holder as having ""two tenures"" as attorney general. In a phone conversation today, he described them to me.

His announcement that he would try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in a federal criminal trial in New York led to the political backlash in Congress that, through legislation, tied Obama's hands on closing Guantanamo. It was really a wall-to-wall disaster. Not all of it is Holder and Obama's fault. They had very important adversaries in this issue of closing Guantanamo. But he is the president, it was a major campaign promise, and he utterly failed.

EK: What about the war on terror issues that have emerged on Obama's watch, like Edward Snowden, or the prosecution of journalists like James Risen, or the decision to use drone strikes against American citizens living abroad?

JT: It is true that the Obama administration has not departed from Bush administration war on terror policies nearly as much as his supporters hoped. But I am inclined to view these issues one by one and I think some positions are more defensible than others. I'm not an Edwards Snowden fan and I think that they're perfectly justified in prosecuting him. The subpoenas to journalists are a different matter.

things look different when you are the people who are responsible for protecting the US in a very dangerous world

I think part of this is the Justice Department as an institution is devoted to aggressive enforcement of criminal laws. That continues from administration to administration. I think the occupants of the top offices get captured by that approach regardless of what attitudes they brought in. I think also that things look different when you are the people who are responsible for protecting the US in a very dangerous world. If you sit there in the briefings and you hear what the dangers are that it is a major challenge to the civil libertarian instincts you brought into office.

EK: What about the banks? There's been reporting that in 2012, the Obama administration's political team was pressuring Holder to prosecute some top bankers. But it went nowhere.

JT: The major unanswered question I have is every other major financial collapse in American history has led to major criminal prosecutions. The S&L Crisis of the 1980s, insider trading in the 1990s. And here we have the biggest collapse since the Depression and not one person of consequence is even prosecuted, much less goes to prison. Now, the people in charge say this is because, as Mike Kinsley used to say, ""the scandal is what's legal."" What went on at Lehman Brothers and AIG and all these places wasn't criminal. It had been vetted by lawyers. I think that is a very debatable proposition. I don't pretend to have the answer but it is a very strange thing that no one went to prison as a result of the 2008 collapse.

as Mike Kinsley used to say, ""the scandal is what's legal.""

EK: This seems like the sort of thing where an attorney general who wanted to prosecute could have found ways to try to make the case.

JT: The challenge with white-collar prosecutions is always the issue of criminal intent. Did these actors know and believe they were violating the law in what they did? Otherwise it's not criminal. What Holder and his subordinates have always said is that the CEOs did not believe what they were doing was criminal. They were making bets that failed spectacularly but that's not a crime.

I am enough of a former prosecutor myself to know these cases are very hard to make against prominent people surrounded by lawyers who can say, ""I consulted my lawyers before making any of these deals."" But that doesn't explain why they didn't make a single one.

EK: Let's go back to Holder's work on LGBT rights. Back when Holder decided not to defend DOMA in court, I remember a number of folks who believed DOMA should be overturned, but also believed the DOJ has a responsibility to defend the laws of the federal government.

Holder didn't just say that DOMA was unconstitutional. He said that no reasonable argument could be made that DOMA is constitutional.

JT: Holder didn't just say that DOMA was unconstitutional. He said that no reasonable argument could be made that DOMA is constitutional. That is a very different thing. It is the job of the Justice Department to defend the laws of the United States. That's what the Justice Department does in virtually all circumstances in virtually all administrations. In a very small handful of cases the Justice Department says one of the laws is indefensible. But remember, this was a law passed in the 1990s with an overwhelming congressional majority and signed by Bill Clinton, a Democratic president. It was institutionally risky for Holder and Obama to say that this law was not just unconstitutional but beyond the pale.

I think history will vindicate them in a dramatic way. We appear to be approaching a moment where any law that draws a distinction between gay and straight people looks like a water fountain that says ""colored only"". I think Holder saw that and he got the Justice Department on the right side of history faster than others might have.",www.vox.com,left,y5cC9iGYxMx0Uvus

The measure would provide the same protections for LGBT workers as are already guaranteed on the basis of race, gender and religion. It would no longer be lawful for employers to discriminate based on a person's ""actual or perceived"" sexual orientation.

Republican support

The measure is coming up for a vote because of a recent wave of momentum in support. After the bill gained the support of all 53 Democrats, two independents and two Republican co-sponsors: Sens. Mark Kirk of Illinois and Susan Collins of Maine.

Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, announced his support Monday morning. His decision lead supporters within the Senate to believe that they have the votes to pass the bill.

The outcome of the vote received the support of more Republicans than anticipated. Senators Orrin Hatch of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who voted for the measure at the committee level, voted in favor of the key procedural measure. In the end, so did Senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio.

Family Research Council President Tony Perkins also slammed ENDA.

Supporters say new policy leaves gay Scouts in 'limbo land'

New policy takes effect on Jan. 1

WILMINGTON, Del. -- The Boy Scouts of America's decision Thursday to open its ranks to gay youths but not gay leaders has all the markings of a fiercely contested compromise: It disappointed almost everyone.

Sandy Rakowski of Elsmere, Del., whose son is a Scout, wanted the ban lifted completely.

""It's a step. That's what counts. Sometimes you have to take small concessions,"" Rakowski said.

But Terry Murphy of Newark, Del., who was an Eagle Scout and longtime adult leader, wanted the ban left in place.

lgbt_rights,GLAAD,0,https://www.glaad.org/blog/glaad-media-award-nominated-lgbtq-kenyan-film-rafiki-loses-freedom-expression-ruling,Kenyan courts uphold ban on GLAAD Media Award-nominated LGBTQ film ‘Rafiki’,2020-04-29,,"The LGBTQ film RAFIKI lost its long-awaited Freedom of Expression ruling in Kenya ’ s high courts , according to a statement issued on Wednesday by the film ’ s director , Wanuri Kahiu .
“ It is with a heavy heart that I share news about the court ruling for Freedom of Expression and the unconstitutionality of banning RAFIKI , ” wrote Kahiu . “ We lost this time . RAFIKI remains banned in Kenya and Freedom of Expression of any LGBT themed work remains silenced . We will appeal and continue our fight for Freedom of Expression . ”
“ Thank you for supporting us thus far . Stay safe . A luta continua ! ” her statement concluded .
“ It is a sad day for freedom of expression and freedom of speech in Kenya , '' Kahiu told ███ exclusively on Wednesday . `` The ruling upholding the ban on RAFIKI denies the right of all narratives including that of LGBTQ people . We will continue to fight for the rights of all . ”
Despite the ruling preventing the film from being shown in Kenya , RAFIKI is still available to the public . Fans of the film and supporters of global LGBTQ equality can watch RAFIKI online on Amazon Prime . Watch ( or watch again ) and share with friends and supporters , to share this important story . Watching and sharing are two small ways LGBTQ people and allies can support LGBTQ storytelling in Kenya from their own homes .
Bursting with the colorful street style and music of Nairobi ’ s vibrant youth culture , RAFIKI is a tender love story between two young women in a country that still criminalizes homosexuality . Kena and Ziki have long been told that “ good Kenyan girls become good Kenyan wives ” - but they yearn for something more . Despite the political rivalry between their families , the girls encourage each other to pursue their dreams in a conservative society . When love blossoms between them , Kena and Ziki must choose between happiness and safety .
`` RAFIKI is a beautiful story about love that deserves to be celebrated , not censored , '' said ███ President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis . `` Wanuri Kahiu is a gifted filmmaker and we applaud and join her continued efforts to fight back against the injustices facing LGBTQ media images in Kenya and other parts of the world . LGBTQ people will never be silenced . I hope our community and allies around the world watch RAFIKI and loudly share its message . ''
RAFIKI first premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2018 and was eventually released in the U.S. in April 2019 . It features remarkable performances by newcomers Samantha Mugatsia and Sheila Munyiva , and has been called a hip tale of first love “ reminiscent of the early work of Spike Lee ” ( Screen Daily ) that ’ s “ impossible not to celebrate ” ( Variety ) ! RAFIKI , which is Swahili for “ friend , ” is adapted from Ugandan writer Monica Arac de Nyeko ’ s 2007 Caine Prize-winning short story “ Jambula Tree . ”
RAFIKI is currently nominated for a ███ Media Award for Outstanding Film - Limited Release , for the 31st Annual ( 2020 ) ███ Media Awards .
Initially banned prior to its premiere in Kenya for its positive portrayal of queer romance , Rafiki then won a landmark supreme court case ( in the fall of 2018 ) beginning to chip away at Kenyan anti-LGBTQ legislation , lifting the ban for one week and allowing it to potentially qualify as Kenya ’ s entry for the 2019 Academy Awards . ( however , another film was eventually chosen )
Kahiu decided to continue challenging the ban in the Kenyan courts . She believed that the government ’ s ruling had broader freedom of expression implications for her country and that her film should not continue to be banned in its home country . However , in April 2020 , the courts did not agree .
Kahiu has been very outspoken about the film ’ s potential to change the Freedom of Expression laws in Kenya . She previously had been told that the film could play in Kenya if she changed the ending to make it “ more remorseful. ” She refused . In fact , she worked with a lawyer throughout the film ’ s production to be prepared ahead of time to fight any potential ban .
“ It ’ s not about the representation of LGBT issues from around the world , ” Kahiu says of the ban . “ The concern is us seeing ourselves in a particular way . ”
Earlier this year , Kahiu spoke about LGBTQ images on panels during the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos , including one panel hosted by the Female Quotient alongside ███ President & CEO Sarah Kate Ellis , and the Ariadne Getty Foundation .
One year ago , Kahiu stopped by ███ ’ s offices to chat about her film , its legacy , and her work to accelerate Freedom of Expression and LGBTQ rights in Kenya .","The LGBTQ film RAFIKI lost its long-awaited Freedom of Expression ruling in Kenya’s high courts, according to a statement issued on Wednesday by the film’s director, Wanuri Kahiu.



“It is with a heavy heart that I share news about the court ruling for Freedom of Expression and the unconstitutionality of banning RAFIKI,” wrote Kahiu. “We lost this time. RAFIKI remains banned in Kenya and Freedom of Expression of any LGBT themed work remains silenced. We will appeal and continue our fight for Freedom of Expression.”



“Thank you for supporting us thus far. Stay safe. A luta continua!” her statement concluded.

“It is a sad day for freedom of expression and freedom of speech in Kenya,"" Kahiu told GLAAD exclusively on Wednesday. ""The ruling upholding the ban on RAFIKI denies the right of all narratives including that of LGBTQ people. We will continue to fight for the rights of all.”





Despite the ruling preventing the film from being shown in Kenya, RAFIKI is still available to the public. Fans of the film and supporters of global LGBTQ equality can watch RAFIKI online on Amazon Prime. Watch (or watch again) and share with friends and supporters, to share this important story. Watching and sharing are two small ways LGBTQ people and allies can support LGBTQ storytelling in Kenya from their own homes.

Bursting with the colorful street style and music of Nairobi’s vibrant youth culture, RAFIKI is a tender love story between two young women in a country that still criminalizes homosexuality. Kena and Ziki have long been told that “good Kenyan girls become good Kenyan wives” - but they yearn for something more. Despite the political rivalry between their families, the girls encourage each other to pursue their dreams in a conservative society. When love blossoms between them, Kena and Ziki must choose between happiness and safety.

""RAFIKI is a beautiful story about love that deserves to be celebrated, not censored,"" said GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. ""Wanuri Kahiu is a gifted filmmaker and we applaud and join her continued efforts to fight back against the injustices facing LGBTQ media images in Kenya and other parts of the world. LGBTQ people will never be silenced. I hope our community and allies around the world watch RAFIKI and loudly share its message.""



RAFIKI first premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2018 and was eventually released in the U.S. in April 2019. It features remarkable performances by newcomers Samantha Mugatsia and Sheila Munyiva, and has been called a hip tale of first love “reminiscent of the early work of Spike Lee” (Screen Daily) that’s “impossible not to celebrate” (Variety)! RAFIKI, which is Swahili for “friend,” is adapted from Ugandan writer Monica Arac de Nyeko’s 2007 Caine Prize-winning short story “Jambula Tree.”



RAFIKI is currently nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film - Limited Release, for the 31st Annual (2020) GLAAD Media Awards.



Initially banned prior to its premiere in Kenya for its positive portrayal of queer romance, Rafiki then won a landmark supreme court case (in the fall of 2018) beginning to chip away at Kenyan anti-LGBTQ legislation, lifting the ban for one week and allowing it to potentially qualify as Kenya’s entry for the 2019 Academy Awards. (however, another film was eventually chosen)



Kahiu decided to continue challenging the ban in the Kenyan courts. She believed that the government’s ruling had broader freedom of expression implications for her country and that her film should not continue to be banned in its home country. However, in April 2020, the courts did not agree.



Kahiu has been very outspoken about the film’s potential to change the Freedom of Expression laws in Kenya. She previously had been told that the film could play in Kenya if she changed the ending to make it “more remorseful.” She refused. In fact, she worked with a lawyer throughout the film’s production to be prepared ahead of time to fight any potential ban.



“It’s not about the representation of LGBT issues from around the world,” Kahiu says of the ban. “The concern is us seeing ourselves in a particular way.”



Earlier this year, Kahiu spoke about LGBTQ images on panels during the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, including one panel hosted by the Female Quotient alongside GLAAD President & CEO Sarah Kate Ellis, and the Ariadne Getty Foundation.



One year ago, Kahiu stopped by GLAAD’s offices to chat about her film, its legacy, and her work to accelerate Freedom of Expression and LGBTQ rights in Kenya.",www.glaad.org,left,teedVRJcnCawedPP

More physicians and analysts of the transgender movement , however , are publicly asserting the claim that drug treatments such as puberty blockers or suppressors are a “ reversible treatment ” is blatantly false . One of the primary reasons all agree the claim is false is that no long-term studies have been conducted on children who have had their normal puberty suppressed with drugs .
Idaho-based endocrinologist Dr. William Malone told ███ in November puberty suppression is “ frequently called reversible , but it ’ s not . ”
Normal bone density development is interfered with and probably brain development too . Almost all children placed on puberty blockers go on to cross-sex hormones—meaning puberty blockers solidify and sometimes intensify dysphoria . It ’ s hard to call these impacts reversible . There have been no long-term studies done on children who have had normal puberty blocked . In no other area of medicine would a medical society be so cavalier about treatments with unknown consequences . Caution is the rule in such situations , and always has been . This departure from the typical standard of care deserves more scrutiny .
“ It is also not clear why the Pediatric Endocrine Society has abandoned the previous standard of care for gender dysphoria – which was supportive , exploratory counseling , ” Malone added :
There are approximately ten studies in the literature showing that , on average , 85 % of children and adolescents with gender dysphoria have resolution or significant lessening of their dysphoria by early adulthood , without hormonal or surgical interventions . There is no scientific justification for departing from that established standard to the current affirmation-based approach .
Dr. Michelle Cretella , executive director of the American College of Pediatricians , said emphatically the Pediatric Endocrine Society ’ s claim that puberty suppressors are a “ reversible treatment ” is “ a bald-faced lie . ”
“ There are no long-term studies of puberty blocker use for gender incongruence in children , ” Cretella explained to ███ . “ Ergo , no one can say blockers are completely reversible and without harm . ”
Cretella pointed to documentation , however , by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) that links “ harm , ” i.e. , thousands of deaths , to Lupron , a drug prescribed with FDA approval for several conditions , including prostate cancer and endometriosis .
Nevertheless , Lupron is also being used , without FDA approval , as a puberty blocker on children and adolescents with gender dysphoria .
Puberty blockers , like Lupron , effectively “ castrate ” children of both sexes at the level of the pituitary gland in the brain , chemically turning boys into eunuchs and sending girls into a pre-teen menopause . This is why many girls treated for FDA-approved conditions with Lupron have developed osteoporosis in their twenties . Puberty blocking prevents the normal maturation of all organs – including the brain – that depend upon the child ’ s natural sex hormones to develop . Adults treated with Lupron for FDA-approved conditions experience memory deficits . What are we doing to the brains of gender incongruent but physically healthy children ?
The pediatrician emphasized the “ harm ” caused by professionals urging transition affirmation .
“ They are absolutely harming kids with blockers because they rob them of the very developmental period during which the vast majority come to embrace their biologic sex , ” Cretella stressed . “ Even if a child comes off blockers , we can never give back the period of normal physical/psychosocial development that was stolen from them . ”
California-based endocrinologist Dr. Michael Laidlaw testified in support of the South Dakota bill , HB1057 , a measure that is seeking to protect children who are confused about their identity from harmful drugs , such as puberty blockers , surgeries and treatments .
Instead of affirming the premise , as WaPo appeared to do , that gender confused children need puberty blockers to “ lower their risk for developing mental health conditions , ” Laidlaw asserted a high proportion of adolescents with gender confusion already had other psychological problems prior to the appearance of gender issues .
A study from Finland , he noted , showed 75 percent of gender confused children “ had been or were currently undergoing psychiatric treatment for reasons other than gender confusion . ”
Laidlaw observed another study that found “ 26 percent had autistic spectrum disorder ” and 68 percent had an initial contact with mental health services because of reasons other than gender confusion .
In 2018 , Dr. Lisa Littman set out to understand why the number of young girls identifying as transgender at Britain ’ s Gender Identity Development Service had increased from 41 percent in 2009 to 69 percent in 2017 .
Littman found 62.5 percent of the girls whose parents participated in the study had been diagnosed with at least one mental health disorder prior to the onset of their gender confusion . For example , nearly half of the children had already attempted to harm themselves or had experienced a trauma .
Parental responses showed 87 percent of the teens announced they were transgender after increased time on social media and/or after “ cluster outbreaks ” of gender dysphoria in their groups of friends . Responses indicated most children who “ came out ” as transgender became increasingly popular as a result of their announcement .
“ Peer contagion has been associated with depressive symptoms , disordered eating , aggression , bullying , and drug use , ” Littman observed .
Attorney and researcher Jane Robbins recently examined at Townhall the relationship between the transgender industry and medical associations , such as the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) and the Endocrine Society .
Robbins noted AAP has partnered with the radical Human Rights Campaign ( HRC ) — known for its bullying and coercive attacks in order to force acceptance of the LGBTQ lifestyle in public places , including schools .
“ But do the views of HRC and AAP leadership align with those of AAP ’ s over 65,000 physician members ? ” Robbins asked . “ We don ’ t know , because the pro-experimentation policies were passed without input from those members . ”
She explained that AAP ’ s positions statements are drafted by a small committee and then voted on by a board of directors consisting of about a dozen members .
“ The broader membership has no direct input into the statement and would generally learn of it only after it ’ s issued , ” Robbins said . “ So , the only thing the AAP policy tells us is that less than 0.05 percent of the pediatricians who are still members of AAP believe in experimenting medically on gender-confused children . ”
In September 2018 , Dr. Susan Bradley , a child psychiatrist who founded the Toronto Gender Identity Clinic , told National Review she is “ deeply concerned that AAP ’ s guidance has gotten so far ahead of the current knowledge base about gender dysphoric children . ”
We know from multiple studies that around 80 percent of gender dysphoric children will desist from their cross-sex identification in childhood to identify with their natal sex . Most of these will grow up to be gay or lesbian ; a substantial minority have also been diagnosed with autism . Yet the AAP guidance incorrectly dismisses these studies as flawed and outdated . There is no professional consensus on medical treatment of gender-dysphoric children and young adolescents .
Similarly , Robbins noted the Endocrine Society , which approves of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for gender-confused children , admits that 68 percent of its transgender guidelines are of “ very low ” or “ low ” quality .
“ In fact , none are supported by high-quality evidence , ” she observed . “ The Society thus admits the scientific evidence for its recommendations is weak at best . Yet physicians across the country are using these guidelines to justify horrendous interventions that can not be undone . ”

In November , Laidlaw told ███ organizations such as the Pediatric Endocrine Society “ have created an institutionalized childhood pathway towards sterility . ”
“ Why would organizations , that are ostensibly out to help children , actually harm them in a most profound way ? ” he asked , and then explained that medical societies have been infiltrated by radical transgender activists with “ one of the most insidious child sterilization programs ever devised ” :
It ’ s really critical to understand that our medical organizations beginning with the Endocrine Society and moving on to the Pediatric Endocrine Society and American Academy of Pediatricians , that with respect to this topic they have been taken over by the most radical elements .

These are low to no quality evidence guidelines , and anyone can read for themselves the poor evidence they have for these treatments for children and adolescents .
Laidlaw cited a study in which the majority of children prescribed puberty blockers went on to cross- or wrong-sex hormones , and the majority of these went on to sex reassignment surgery .
“ All of those who started on puberty blockers and went to cross-sex hormones are infertile , ” he said . “ Those who had gonads removed are sterilized . ”
He said this path begins at the earliest phase of social transition , when the child is “ affirmed ” in dressing as the opposite sex and changing his or her name .
“ Social transition has the psychological effect of convincing the child that they are in the wrong body , ” he explained . “ The puberty blockers are a drug-induced model of not only blocking essential aspects of development , but also solidifying the belief that they must take wrong-sex hormones to escape from their situation . ”

VERDICT: FALSE.

South Dakota could become the first state in the nation to criminalize treating transgender youths under 16 years old with medical treatment or surgery.

A WaPo piece published on January 28 stated:

Hormone treatment, which can be used to delay puberty, is reversible and medical evidence suggests allowing transgender children to delay puberty until they are 16 can lower their risk for developing mental health conditions, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Children under 18 very rarely undergo sex-reassignment surgery.

“Gender identity can be different from the gender that is presumed based on the sex assigned at birth and interventions intended to change one’s gender identity are not only ineffective, but harmful,” the Society states.

The group adds that “gender-affirming care” includes allowing a child or adolescent “to explore their gender identity freely, and in some circumstances allow for a social transition (change of name, pronouns, attire).”

The Society clearly states “gender-affirming care” may include:

lgbt_rights,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/19/duck-dynasty-star-sparks-culture-war-with-opinions/,Huge backlash mounts over suspension of Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson,2013-12-19,Cheryl Wetzstein,"For a few hours , it looked like Americans would quietly accept the suspension of popular “ Duck Dynasty ” star Phil Robertson for his unfiltered opinions about sin , sex , gays and blacks in a magazine interview .
But then , as if on cue , hundreds of thousands of fans of the openly Christian , duck-hunting businessman took to social networks and started their backlash .
As of Thursday night , more than 1.1 million people “ liked ” the “ Stand With Phil Robertson ” Facebook page , while about the same number had clicked their support for another Facebook page called “ Boycott A & E Until Phil Robertson Is Put Back On Duck Dynasty. ” There was even flak on the Web page of the gay advocacy group that demanded his firing .
The family itself is backing Mr. Robertson and implied Thursday evening that the show may be canceled , or at a minimum moved off the A & E Network unless he can return .
“ We are disappointed that Phil has been placed on hiatus for expressing his faith , which is his constitutionally protected right . We have had a successful working relationship with A & E but , as a family , we can not imagine the show going forward without our patriarch at the helm , ” the Robertsons wrote on their website , duckcommander.com .
“ We are in discussions with A & E to see what that means for the future of ‘ Duck Dynasty. ’ Again , thank you for your continued support of our family , ” they concluded .
SEE ALSO : ‘ Duck Dynasty ’ star Phil Robertson ’ s pre-A & E same as post-A & E : Homosexuality is a sin
Some Republican politicians , Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin and Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal , spoke in defense of Mr. Robertson , and traditional values groups added their voices to the cultural moment .
“ Don ’ t apologize for what the Bible calls a sin . HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY to stand with Phil , ” said one Facebook poster , using one of Mr. Robertson ’ s pet phrases .
Sadly , being “ happy ” was not how Mr. Robertson answered a GQ magazine reporter ’ s question about “ what , in your mind , is sinful ? ”
“ Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there . Bestiality , sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men , ” Mr. Robertson replied in the GQ article , released Wednesday .
Then , paraphrasing Paul ’ s First Letter to the Corinthians on sin , Mr. Robertson said , “ Don ’ t be deceived . Neither the adulterers , the idolaters , the male prostitutes , the homosexual offenders , the greedy , the drunkards , the slanderers , the swindlers — they won ’ t inherit the kingdom of God . Don ’ t deceive yourself . It ’ s not right . ”
These and other comments about being “ white trash ” hoeing cotton with black farmhands and not recalling black people “ singing the blues ” until after major welfare programs were established in the 1960s , earned Mr. Robertson an indefinite suspension from the reality TV show that stars him and his family — and attracts nearly 12 million viewers .
“ We are extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson ’ s comments in GQ , which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty , ” A & E executives said in a statement Wednesday . “ His personal views in no way reflect those of A & E Networks , who have always been strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community . The network has placed Phil under hiatus from filming indefinitely . ”
Mr. Robertson also issued a statement , referencing his sinful past and how his “ mission today is to go forth and tell people about why I follow Christ and also what the Bible teaches , and part of that teaching is that women and men are meant to be together . ”
“ However , I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me . We are all created by the Almighty and like Him , I love all of humanity . We would all be better off if we loved God and loved each other , ” Mr. Robertson said .
The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation thanked A & E Network for suspending the 67-year-old , gray-bearded patriarch .
It ’ s “ clear that such hateful anti-gay comments are unacceptable to fans , viewers and networks alike , ” said GLAAD spokesman Wilson Cruz . Putting Mr. Robertson on hiatus “ sent a strong message that discrimination is neither a Christian nor an American value . ”
In their letter to A & E President and CEO Nancy Dubuc , leaders of the Human Rights Campaign and NAACP asked her to denounce and repudiate Mr. Robertson ’ s “ racist and homophobic remarks . ”
Gay-rights supporters took their outrage about Mr. Robertson ’ s “ vile ” remarks to social media . Many shared a 2010 “ gay-bashing ” video of Mr. Robertson , posted by TMZ , in which he lamented “ women with women , men with men . ”
But on Thursday , Robertson supporters were answering back in droves .

But then, as if on cue, hundreds of thousands of fans of the openly Christian, duck-hunting businessman took to social networks and started their backlash.

As of Thursday night, more than 1.1 million people “liked” the “Stand With Phil Robertson” Facebook page, while about the same number had clicked their support for another Facebook page called “Boycott A&E Until Phil Robertson Is Put Back On Duck Dynasty.” There was even flak on the Web page of the gay advocacy group that demanded his firing.

The family itself is backing Mr. Robertson and implied Thursday evening that the show may be canceled, or at a minimum moved off the A&E Network unless he can return.

“We are disappointed that Phil has been placed on hiatus for expressing his faith, which is his constitutionally protected right. We have had a successful working relationship with A&E but, as a family, we cannot imagine the show going forward without our patriarch at the helm,” the Robertsons wrote on their website, duckcommander.com.

“We are in discussions with A&E to see what that means for the future of ‘Duck Dynasty.’ Again, thank you for your continued support of our family,” they concluded.

Some Republican politicians, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, spoke in defense of Mr. Robertson, and traditional values groups added their voices to the cultural moment.

“Don’t apologize for what the Bible calls a sin. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY to stand with Phil,” said one Facebook poster, using one of Mr. Robertson’s pet phrases.

Sadly, being “happy” was not how Mr. Robertson answered a GQ magazine reporter’s question about “what, in your mind, is sinful?”

“Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men,” Mr. Robertson replied in the GQ article, released Wednesday.

Then, paraphrasing Paul’s First Letter to the Corinthians on sin, Mr. Robertson said, “Don’t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers — they won’t inherit the kingdom of God. Don’t deceive yourself. It’s not right.”

These and other comments about being “white trash” hoeing cotton with black farmhands and not recalling black people “singing the blues” until after major welfare programs were established in the 1960s, earned Mr. Robertson an indefinite suspension from the reality TV show that stars him and his family — and attracts nearly 12 million viewers.

“We are extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson’s comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty,” A&E executives said in a statement Wednesday. “His personal views in no way reflect those of A&E Networks, who have always been strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community. The network has placed Phil under hiatus from filming indefinitely.”

Mr. Robertson also issued a statement, referencing his sinful past and how his “mission today is to go forth and tell people about why I follow Christ and also what the Bible teaches, and part of that teaching is that women and men are meant to be together.”

“However, I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me. We are all created by the Almighty and like Him, I love all of humanity. We would all be better off if we loved God and loved each other,” Mr. Robertson said.

The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation thanked A&E Network for suspending the 67-year-old, gray-bearded patriarch.

It’s “clear that such hateful anti-gay comments are unacceptable to fans, viewers and networks alike,” said GLAAD spokesman Wilson Cruz. Putting Mr. Robertson on hiatus “sent a strong message that discrimination is neither a Christian nor an American value.”

In their letter to A&E President and CEO Nancy Dubuc, leaders of the Human Rights Campaign and NAACP asked her to denounce and repudiate Mr. Robertson’s “racist and homophobic remarks.”

“Americans won’t stand for Phil Robertson’s comments,” they said.

Gay-rights supporters took their outrage about Mr. Robertson’s “vile” remarks to social media. Many shared a 2010 “gay-bashing” video of Mr. Robertson, posted by TMZ, in which he lamented “women with women, men with men.”

But on Thursday, Robertson supporters were answering back in droves.

“If you believe in free speech or religious liberty, you should be deeply dismayed over the treatment of Phil Robertson. Phil expressed his personal views and his own religious faith; for that, he was suspended from his job,” Mr. Cruz, Texas Republican, wrote on his Facebook page.

The “mainstream media should not behave as the thought police censoring the views with which they disagree,” the senator said. “The reason that so many Americans love Duck Dynasty is because it represents the America usually ignored or mocked by liberal elites: a family that loves and cares for each other, believes in God, and speaks openly about their faith.”

Mr. Jindal, who praised Mr. Robertson and his family as “great citizens of the State of Louisiana,” noted that “the politically correct crowd is tolerant of all viewpoints, except those they disagree with.”

He noted the cultural double standards surrounding public misbehavior, saying “it is a messed up situation when Miley Cyrus gets a laugh, and Phil Robertson gets suspended.”

Mrs. Palin also weighed in on her Facebook page: “Free speech is an endangered species. Those ‘intolerants’ hatin’ and taking on the Duck Dynasty patriarch for voicing his personal opinion are taking on all of us.”

Even GLAAD’s Facebook page was filled with comments supporting Phil Robertson. “I have never said a negative word about your community, but, that changes today!” wrote one man. “GLAAD I thought you guys stood against Bullying. Wow talk about practice what your preach,” wrote a woman.

As of Thursday night, some 311,000 people had signed a National Organization for Marriage petition asking A&E to reinstate Mr. Robertson and “right this wrong.”

“Duck Dynasty” is set to begin its fifth season Jan. 15. Mr. Robertson is expected to appear in a few episodes that were taped before his suspension, according to media reports.

Obama ’ s term has already seen the enactment of a federal law protecting gays and lesbians against hate crimes , an end to the ban on openly gay members of the U.S military and the issuance of a Supreme Court ruling striking down the law banning federal recognition of same-sex marriage . Such unions have now spread to 36 states across the country . A new Supreme Court ruling declaring same-sex marriage rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution could serve as the capstone on a record of change unparalleled on any other issue in the public eye during his tenure .
But precisely how much credit Obama deserves for the tectonic shift on the issue during his presidency is less clear-cut .
Many gay rights activists and historians see Obama as having been reluctant to put much muscle into gay rights causes early in his White House stay , but then warming to the topic as a result of outside pressure and a realization that rapidly changing public opinion made such moves politically advantageous . Some advocates say he ’ s added crucial momentum to the drive for “ marriage equality ” in recent years , while others say he ’ s still cautious on the subject and more inclined to be swept along by the public debate than to lead it .
That gay rights , and in particular same-sex marriage , could wind up as a hulking component of Obama ’ s legacy is a surprising development for a president who publicly snubbed same-sex marriage until nearly 3 1/2 years into his presidency and faced repeated complaints that he was shortchanging gay issues .
“ He was late to the party , but he certainly made up for it , ” said Richard Socarides , a New York lawyer and longtime gay rights advocate . “ This is shaping up to be [ Obama ’ s ] most significant policy achievement of his entire presidency . He has certainly participated and , in some large measure I think , pushed forward the most significant gains in gay rights that we ’ ve seen in the history of the country .
“ He ’ s done so sometimes begrudgingly , but I think that is the nature of the presidency , ” the activist and former Clinton White House adviser said , noting the competing demands on a president ’ s attention .
Obama and his aides “ were against it until they were for it , and then they really owned the issue and championed it in a way that was jaw-droppingly historic , and that ’ s what they ’ ll be remembered for , ” said the Human Rights Campaign ’ s Fred Sainz .
Some historians , however , give Obama less credit and question how much the issue deserves to be seen as part of his legacy . They conclude that Obama has eased the country ’ s moves toward greater recognition of gay rights but hasn ’ t been at the forefront of them .
“ The question is : Is he a leader or a follower ? ” asked Andrea Friedman , a history professor at Washington University in St. Louis .
“ Obama has been carried along by public opinion and shifts in public opinion that have just accelerated so rapidly , ” she said in answer to her own question . “ I don ’ t see him necessarily as a leader or this as part of his legacy . ”
When Obama marked gay pride month last year , he boasted about his record but was careful to temper the remark with an acknowledgement that the White House had often been nudged along on the issue .
“ Because of your help , we ’ ve gone further in protecting the rights of lesbian and gay and bisexual and transgender Americans than any administration in history , ” the president said .
The Supreme Court potentially extended that trend Friday when it announced that it has agreed to take up a set of cases that raise the issue of whether the U.S. Constitution guarantees all Americans the right to enter into same-sex marriages and whether states are obliged to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states .
The outcome of the case is far from guaranteed , but many legal analysts believe the court ’ s liberal justices are likely to join with Republican appointee Justice Anthony Kennedy in a ruling that makes same-sex marriage available nationwide .
Early on , the president showed more timidity in his approach on gay rights . The administration ’ s strategy on the military ’ s “ don ’ t ask , don ’ t tell ” policy , for instance , involved prolonged consultations with the Pentagon . As a result , the project lingered until Democrats lost seats in the Senate and Obama ’ s overall policy agenda bogged down .
Legislation to repeal the “ don ’ t ask , don ’ t tell ” policy passed during Congress ’ s lame-duck session at the end of 2010 , and the president claimed the bill as a triumph , but many activists quietly said the administration ’ s strategy was flawed and the measure only nosed over the finish line due to a last-minute push by the likes of departing Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I-Conn. ) .
Once the law passed , however , advocates generally gave Obama high marks for its implementation , as well as for his appointment of a historic number of gay and lesbian officials to senior posts and judgeships .
Gay rights activists also credit the administration for taking a bold move in 2011 to dismantle the Defense of Marriage Act , the federal law President Bill Clinton signed in 1996 barring federal recognition of same-sex marriages . Attorney General Eric Holder , acting with Obama ’ s concurrence , announced the administration would no longer defend the law in court because there was no plausible argument to support its constitutionality .
“ That was as game-changing as anything , ” said former Rep. Barney Frank ( D-Mass . ) , the first openly gay member of Congress . “ Presidents always have to defend the constitutionality of legislation they dislike . For the president to take the position that DOMA was so blatantly unconstitutional and undesirable that he would take that unusual step [ to abandon the law ] , that was the biggest deal of anything he did , and he deserved an enormous amount of credit for it . ”
That decision drew howls of outrage from Republicans , but in a 5-4 ruling two years later , the Supreme Court struck the law down .
Gay rights activists welcomed Obama ’ s reversal on same-sex marriage in 2012 , but he continued until last year to hold a nuanced stance on the legalities of the issue — arguably undercutting some advocates ’ efforts to have the courts sanction same-sex marriage throughout the country .
In part to fend off Republican calls for a federal constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage , Obama for years declared that marriage has traditionally been a state issue . Even when Obama ’ s evolution on gay marriage reached its apogee in 2012 , he spoke of state-by-state experimentation on the issue as welcome .
“ What you ’ re seeing is , I think , states working through this issue — in fits and starts , all across the country , ” Obama told ABC ’ s Robin Roberts in an interview designed to showcase his change of heart on the subject . “ Different communities are arriving at different conclusions , at different times . And I think that ’ s a healthy process and a healthy debate . And I continue to believe that this is an issue that is going to be worked out at the local level , because historically , this has not been a federal issue , what ’ s recognized as a marriage . ”
In that interview , Obama also declined to quibble with North Carolina voters who had just agreed to insert a new ban on gay marriage in their state ’ s constitution .
Obama ’ s stance has long struck some advocates as misguided , since federal court cases striking down state bans on interracial marriage are at the core of civil rights jurisprudence and Obama once taught that subject at the University of Chicago . The approach also seemed to evoke a thread of the history of “ states ’ rights ” resistance to federal anti-discrimination laws — an odd resonance for America ’ s first African-American president .
When litigation challenging California ’ s voter-approved same-sex marriage ban reached the Supreme Court in 2013 , the Justice Department did not announce unequivocal support for a federal constitutional right to what advocates call marriage equality . Instead , Obama administration lawyers took the highly nuanced position that California could not deny same-sex couples the right to marry because the state already accorded such couples all the other privileges that go along with marriage .
Some analysts said the brief reflected a lack of courage on the administration ’ s part . Others said it was a strategic move aimed at making sure the court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act — a decision most easily reached by deferring to states .
“ As a Republican looking at a Democratic president , President Obama ’ s equivocation on gay equality issues has always been really puzzling , ” said Gregory Angelo of the Log Cabin Republicans , a gay GOP group that backs same-sex marriage rights .
When the Supreme Court announced Friday that it plans to wade into the issue of a federal right to same-sex marriage , the White House remained silent . In fact , on the eve of the announcement , White House press secretary Josh Earnest declined to state the president ’ s views on the legal issues , though the spokesman said the president would welcome wider availability of same-sex marriage .
Holder was more direct , announcing that the administration will urge the court to make same-sex marriage rights the law of the land .
“ We expect to file a ‘ friend of the court ’ brief in these cases that will urge the Supreme Court to make marriage equality a reality for all Americans , ” the attorney general said in a statement Friday . “ It is time for our nation to take another critical step forward to ensure the fundamental equality of all Americans — no matter who they are , where they come from , or whom they love . ”
Gay rights advocates say politics explain much of Obama ’ s reorientation from diffidence to active embrace of their positions . As public sentiment shifted on the issue , the administration saw opportunities to appeal to important constituencies by pushing an issue that differentiated Obama from most Republican candidates .
Prominent blogger and former Obama critic John Aravosis said Friday that he believes the administration ’ s change of approach on the subject became evident during the Democratic National Convention in 2012 . Pushing gay rights there wasn ’ t just the right thing to do , or a move to satisfy gay activists , but projected tolerance in a way that appealed politically to female voters , young people and others .
“ Since 2012 , they ’ ve been embracing it , ” Aravosis said , even describing the administration as “ grandstanding ” on the issue . “ On the left , people talk about ours as one of the only progressive issues where [ Obama ] has had great success . ”
“ Once they understood that this was an issue that could work for them , they got fully behind it . That happened when he got reelected : They realized they could run on this , rather than run away from it , ” added Socarides .
“ Part of being president means you get to take credit for things that happen on your watch , and [ Obama ] came around and he was there when we needed him , ” Socarides said , getting to the issue of whether Obama could claim the sweeping change on the issue as part of his legacy . “ He definitely played a big part . ”
Angelo said Obama deserves credit for embracing same-sex marriage rights even if that move came “ later than it should have. ” However , the gay GOP leader argued that the issue has been one where most politicians lagged , not led , the public .
“ I don ’ t think any factor has been more important in influencing public opinion — and , I dare say , the opinions of the Supreme Court — than Joe and Jane American who happen to be gay and live down the street and are living their lives openly and honestly with their friends , neighbors and family members , ” Angelo said . “ It ’ s trickled up more than it ’ s trickled down . ”
The advances on gay rights under Obama are so dramatic that The New Republic declared last October that he had become , in essence , America ’ s first gay president — a label that echoes author Toni Morrison ’ s branding of President Bill Clinton in 1998 as America ’ s first black president .
However , it ’ s also clear that Obama ’ s rejections of same-sex marriage continued to sting his own supporters and even close staffers all the way until his election to the White House . And even in 2004 — as he ran for the U.S. Senate at the age of 43 — he was unaware of the Stonewall Riots , a watershed 1969 event in the history of the fight for gay rights , according to “ Winning Marriage , ” a book by Marc Solomon of Freedom to Marry .

lgbt_rights,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46321543,Trump asks US court for review of transgender military ban,,,"President Trump 's administration is asking the US Supreme Court to consider its proposed restrictions on transgender military members .
It is requesting that the top court review lower court rulings blocking a military ban on transgender people .
Federal courts have prevented the military from implementing a policy barring some transgender Americans from service .
The administration wants the court to hear the dispute this term .

President Trump's administration is asking the US Supreme Court to consider its proposed restrictions on transgender military members.

It is requesting that the top court review lower court rulings blocking a military ban on transgender people.

Federal courts have prevented the military from implementing a policy barring some transgender Americans from service.

The administration wants the court to hear the dispute this term.

The president announced on Twitter in 2017 that the country would no longer ""accept or allow"" transgender Americans to serve in the military, citing ""tremendous medical costs and disruption"".

The administration has since limited the policy to transgender individuals with a history of gender dysphoria.

Following legal challenges, judges in federal courts in three jurisdictions - Washington state, California, and Washington, DC - have refused to lift injunctions issued against the president's original ban to allow the updated policy to be enforced.

The US government is appealing those decisions.

On Friday, the Trump administration filed petitions to the Supreme Court asking for its ""immediate review"" of the constitutional challenges to the ban.

""And absent this Court's prompt intervention, it is unlikely that the military will be able to implement its new policy any time soon,"" it said.

The petitions ask for the top court to consolidate the cases for decision and consider the dispute during its current term, which ends in June or July 2019.

Gay activists are preparing to quickly use the momentum from this year’s election to try to legalize marriage in at least seven new states and force Congress and the president to make major changes in discrimination laws.

Advocates have identified Oregon, Rhode Island, Delaware, Minnesota, Colorado, Hawaii and New Jersey as states where they believe that as early as 2014 they’ll see gay marriage legalized through ballot measures, court decisions or state legislative action.

Story Continued Below

And the U.S. Supreme Court is set to decide next week whether to consider legalizing gay marriage.

The Court will decide which cases they’ll hear in what’s expected to be a landmark decision. There are several options: five separate Defense of Marriage Act challenges that could be rolled together, the constitutional challenge to California’s Proposition 8 and the case challenging Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer’s attempt to stop gay couples from receiving domestic partnership benefits.

Meanwhile, activists are aiming to quickly use the momentum from this year’s election to boost marriage legalization efforts in at least seven new states and force Congress and the president to make major changes in discrimination laws.

They sense a major change from this year’s election victories — which included successful gay marriage referendums in Maine, Maryland and Washington state, the defeat of a Minnesota ban, the first successful retention of an Iowa Supreme Court judge who favors gay marriage, the election of Tammy Baldwin as the first openly gay senator, the election of two new gay House members and the reelection of the president widely praised by advocates as the most pro-gay rights ever.

Together, there’s clear proof that opponents to gay marriage and gay rights have lost support, said Human Rights Campaign president Chad Griffin.

“Now that they’re on the defensive on all fronts and we’re on the offensive on all fronts, we’ve got to take this momentum and turn it into our next victories,” said Griffin, whose organization has already prepared a four-page “post-election agenda” memo detailing an administrative, legislative and personnel agenda. “At times like this, you can’t slow down. You’ve got to double down.”

Rubio and Paul and Jindal et al. won’t have to squirm over whether to endorse SSM, back a federalist approach to the issue, or oppose it on the merits. They can just shrug and say “The Court was wrong but whaddaya gonna do?” and move on to other business. Take it from Huckabee: That won’t happen. Abortion’s technically been “off the table” for 40 years and yet it’s still an absolute litmus test for any potential GOP nominee (and any potential Democratic nominee too). To keep social conservatives onboard, candidates will be asked to promise (a) that they’ll appoint Supreme Court justices who are committed to overturning any gay-marriage rulings and (b) that they’ll endorse some sort of constitutional amendment that would either ban SSM outright or, at a minimum, return the issue to the states.

That’s why Huck’s framing this in apocalyptic “stick with us or we walk” terms. It’s their party, at least on social issues.

With respect to what’s best for other GOP pols, the simple explanation is the correct one: They’re better off if the Court surprises everyone and upholds Prop 8. Then the 2016 field can take the position that they’re personally opposed to SSM in order to placate social cons while insisting that, as good federalists, they want local voters to decide this issue for themselves. That sort of squishy middle-way stance won’t dazzle anyone on either side but it might hold the Republican coalition together by reassuring Huck and his supporters that red states will still get to chart their own course. It might also be acceptable to young voters in the sense that the potential GOP nominee won’t be standing in the way of gay marriage in states when the votes are there. But note: The squishy position won’t work if the Court does end up legalizing gay marriage this summer. In that case, taking the federalist position via a constitutional amendment will be seen as an attempt to roll back marriage rights that gays have already won. Young voters likely will find that alienating, and social cons may reason that an amendment to return power to the states on the subject simply doesn’t go far enough as a rebuke to a judiciary that’s out of control. What politicians cherish is room to maneuver, and a pro-SSM ruling leaves the GOP with less of that than an anti-SSM ruling would.

Anyway. Across the aisle, Mark Begich magically decided last night that he too is now pro-gay marriage, which makes three Democratic senators who have “evolved” in just the past 24 hours. I’m starting a pool as of right now: At what time today will the next Democratic holdout formally declare his support for SSM? I’ll take 2 p.m. ET.

“Republicans’ intolerance to marriage equality has been detrimental to winning,” said Aaron McLear, a California Republican strategist. “Big donors understand that they don’t want to invest in campaigns focused on a losing issue, and I think certainly the fiscal issues for Republicans are much more marketable.”

Republican fundraiser Jim McCray agreed. “I think it will open up donors across the board, because it demonstrates Republicans are trying to recreate the big tent they were known for,” McCray said.

It’s not clear how much money could come from donors supportive of the party’s move toward new thoughts on gay marriage. Pro gay-rights donors have long been an important source of campaign cash for Democrats, including after President Barack Obama pushed through a repeal of the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, which barred openly gay people from serving in the military.

And operatives believe the money is there for Republicans, too.

Several lawmakers told POLITICO the issue has come up in meetings with potential big donors, who take a different view than the party base.

Portman himself has taken heat from New York donors who believe the party’s emphasis on social issues is one of the major reasons for losses this fall. Their views were taken so seriously that Portman, vice chairman of finance for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, held a dozen meetings with big New York donors recently in an attempt to assuage their fears about the direction of the party.

The bill bans workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity

It exempts religious organizations and the military

The GOP-controlled House is not scheduled to vote on it

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Thursday approved a historic gay rights bill to ban workplace discrimination based on sexual preference or gender identity.

""It is time for Congress to pass a federal law that ensures all our citizens, regardless of where they live, can go to work unafraid to be who they are,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.

The final vote was 64-32, with 54 Democrats and 10 Republicans supporting the legislation.

Religious organizations and the U.S. military are exempt under the Employer Non-Discrimination Act, a stipulation that helped win GOP support. The bill applies to work sites with more than 15 people.

ENDA has been introduced in nearly every Congress since 1994. It came one vote shy of passage in 1996, but had not been given a full Senate vote since.

Existing federal laws ban employer discrimination based on race, color, sex, nationality, religion, age and disability.

The legislation is hitting a wall in the GOP-controlled House, where Speaker John Boehner's office said he does not plan to allow a vote. Boehner opposes the legislation because he says it will cost small-business jobs and increasing ""frivolous"" litigation. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's office also said Thursday there is no vote scheduled.

In a statement, President Obama urged House leaders to bring it up for a vote. ""One party in one house of Congress should not stand in the way of millions of Americans who want to go to work each day and simply be judged by the job they do,"" he said.

Opponents contend that the legislation is unnecessary because most private businesses, including the vast majority of Fortune 500 companies, have self-adopted policies that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation.

Twenty-two states and Washington, D.C., have already enacted laws prohibiting such discrimination.

A June 2013 Pew Research survey of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender adults reported 21% who said they have been treated unfairly at work because of their sexual orientation.

It is remarkable how fast the issue of same-sex marriage has moved the American public . Of course , some long-time proponents will argue the opposite , that it has taken far too long for it to gain acceptance . And they say that there is no shortage of efforts around the country to block or overturn the practice .
But there is no question that since Vice President Biden first announced his support for the issue last May — jumping the gun on President Obama , whose position on the issue was said to still be `` evolving '' — things have changed rapidly . Almost immediately , and far more significant , was Obama 's declaration he felt the same . After that came dramatic shifting in public opinion , where for the first time ever , polls show that more people support gay marriage than oppose it . It became a cause to be celebrated at the Democratic National Convention last summer . Voters in three states , after an unbroken string of defeats , chose to legalize gay marriage in November . And it got considerable attention at Obama 's inauguration in January , where he said , `` Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law , for if we are truly created equal , then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well . ''
Now , not even a year since Obama 's switch , it has become a Democratic Party policy given , akin to abortion rights or increasing the minimum wage .
And there may be some shifting on the Republican side as well . Sen . Rob Portman of Ohio , a leading GOP voice and thought to be on Mitt Romney 's short list for VP last year , announced Friday that he was ending his opposition to same-sex marriage . His reasoning is personal ; he has a 21-year old gay son and said he does not want him treated any differently because of his sexuality . But he is the highest ranking Republican ( and the only sitting GOP senator ) to take that position . If Obama 's 2012 reversal put him in better stead with members of his own party , Portman 's shift has probably resulted in the opposite . Still , in an op-ed in the Columbus Dispatch , Portman tried to frame it as a conservative staple :
`` We conservatives believe in personal liberty and minimal government interference in people 's lives . We also consider the family unit to be the fundamental building block of society . We should encourage people to make long-term commitments to each other and build families , so as to foster strong , stable communities and promote personal responsibility . ... I 've thought a great deal about this issue , and like millions of Americans in recent years , I 've changed my mind on the question of marriage for same-sex couples . As we strive as a nation to form a more perfect union , I believe all of our sons and daughters ought to have the same opportunity to experience the joy and stability of marriage . ''
The New York Times ' Jeremy Peters noted that religious conservatives `` reacted strongly '' to Portman 's switch , `` with some saying that he had turned his back on Christianity '' :
`` 'Senator Portman speaks like so many who call themselves Christians but actually do n't spend much time dwelling on the Word of God , ' wrote Erick Erickson , the conservative commentator , on Twitter . Others were harsher . The Traditional Values Coalition , a religious group that is often vocal on gay issues , issued a statement that equated homosexuality with drunken driving and mocked Mr. Portman , writing , 'My child is a drunk driver and I love him . ' ''
But if we 're talking about politicians who have had a change of heart , add former President Bill Clinton to the list . The issue here is the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act ( known by its acronym DOMA ) , which defines marriage as being between a man and a woman and which would deny federal rights to same-sex spouses . ( Portman , then a House member , was a sponsor of the Act . ) Recently Clinton penned an op-ed in the Washington Post saying it should be overturned . Clinton , of course , was president when he signed DOMA into law on Sept. 21 , 1996 . The issue of overturning it comes before the U.S. Supreme Court on March 27 , when the constitutionality of California 's Proposition 8 — a 2008 anti-gay marriage initiative passed by the voters — will be decided .
Though there are certainly notable exceptions — and we saw it last month , when dozens of prominent Republicans signed on to urge the Court to overturn Prop 8 — gay marriage is one of those issues that often separates Ds from Rs . But that leads to an e-mail that arrived a few weeks ago from Teri Donaldson of Wichita , Kansas , which asked :
`` If the Democrats were in control in 1996 , would Congress have passed the Defense of Marriage Act ? Did many Democrats vote for it ? ''
A better question might be would the Democrats have allowed the bill to reach the floor at all , had they controlled Congress back in '96 . We 'll never know the answer to that . But we do know how they voted .
The Act was introduced in Congress on May 7 , 1996 by Rep. Bob Barr , a Georgia Republican . ( That Barr , who opposed same-sex marriage , anti-drug laws and the Patriot Act , could wind up as the Libertarian Party 's presidential nominee in 2008 always fascinated me , but that 's for another time . )
But Clinton , who in 1992 was clearly more aggressive in seeking votes from the gay community than any other major presidential candidate in history , nonetheless continued to state during his re-election campaign four years later that he believed marriage was between a man and a woman . So while White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry called the Defense of Marriage Act `` gay baiting , pure and simple , '' and while Clinton himself said that DOMA was `` unnecessary '' and `` divisive , '' the president reiterated that he would sign it .
( A very interesting read by Richard Socarides in the March 8 issue of The New Yorker : `` Why Bill Clinton Signed the Defense of Marriage Act '' . )
The House passed the measure on June 12 , 1996 by a vote of 342-67 . Republicans supported it by a margin of 224 to one ( Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin ) . Democrats , though , also overwhelmingly backed it , by 118 to 65 . Among those Democrats who voted `` yes '' were many leaders , progressives and up-and-comers , such as Rosa DeLauro ( CT ) , Dick Durbin ( IL ) , Ben Cardin ( MD ) , Steny Hoyer ( MD ) , Dick Gephardt ( MO ) , Bob Torricelli ( NJ ) , Bob Menendez ( NJ ) , Bill Richardson ( NM ) , Chuck Schumer ( NY ) , Nita Lowey ( NY ) , Marcy Kaptur ( OH ) , Jack Reed ( RI ) , Jim Clyburn ( SC ) and Tim Johnson ( SD ) .
It was a similar landslide in the Senate on Sept. 10 , where the vote in favor was 85-14 . All 53 Republicans voted yes ; Democrats favored this `` gay baiting '' and `` divisive '' bill by a 32-14 margin . Among the Dem `` yes '' votes : Chris Dodd ( CT ) , Joe Lieberman ( CT ) , Joe Biden ( DE ) , Tom Harkin ( IA ) , Barbara Mikulski ( MD ) , Carl Levin ( MI ) , Paul Wellstone ( MN ) , Bill Bradley ( NJ ) , Frank Lautenberg ( NJ ) , Harry Reid ( NV ) , John Glenn ( OH ) , Patrick Leahy ( VT ) and Patty Murray ( WA ) .
So , it 's difficult to answer your question . We assume many Democrats would welcome the dismantling of DOMA in the present day . But we do know that an overwhelming majority of them voted for it back then .

The New York Times' Jeremy Peters noted that religious conservatives ""reacted strongly"" to Portman's switch, ""with some saying that he had turned his back on Christianity"":

""'Senator Portman speaks like so many who call themselves Christians but actually don't spend much time dwelling on the Word of God,' wrote Erick Erickson, the conservative commentator, on Twitter. Others were harsher. The Traditional Values Coalition, a religious group that is often vocal on gay issues, issued a statement that equated homosexuality with drunken driving and mocked Mr. Portman, writing, 'My child is a drunk driver and I love him.'""

But if we're talking about politicians who have had a change of heart, add former President Bill Clinton to the list. The issue here is the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (known by its acronym DOMA), which defines marriage as being between a man and a woman and which would deny federal rights to same-sex spouses. (Portman, then a House member, was a sponsor of the Act.) Recently Clinton penned an op-ed in the Washington Post saying it should be overturned. Clinton, of course, was president when he signed DOMA into law on Sept. 21, 1996. The issue of overturning it comes before the U.S. Supreme Court on March 27, when the constitutionality of California's Proposition 8 — a 2008 anti-gay marriage initiative passed by the voters — will be decided.

Though there are certainly notable exceptions — and we saw it last month, when dozens of prominent Republicans signed on to urge the Court to overturn Prop 8 — gay marriage is one of those issues that often separates Ds from Rs. But that leads to an e-mail that arrived a few weeks ago from Teri Donaldson of Wichita, Kansas, which asked:

""If the Democrats were in control in 1996, would Congress have passed the Defense of Marriage Act? Did many Democrats vote for it?""

A better question might be would the Democrats have allowed the bill to reach the floor at all, had they controlled Congress back in '96. We'll never know the answer to that. But we do know how they voted.

The Act was introduced in Congress on May 7, 1996 by Rep. Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican. (That Barr, who opposed same-sex marriage, anti-drug laws and the Patriot Act, could wind up as the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee in 2008 always fascinated me, but that's for another time.)

But Clinton, who in 1992 was clearly more aggressive in seeking votes from the gay community than any other major presidential candidate in history, nonetheless continued to state during his re-election campaign four years later that he believed marriage was between a man and a woman. So while White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry called the Defense of Marriage Act ""gay baiting, pure and simple,"" and while Clinton himself said that DOMA was ""unnecessary"" and ""divisive,"" the president reiterated that he would sign it.

(A very interesting read by Richard Socarides in the March 8 issue of The New Yorker: ""Why Bill Clinton Signed the Defense of Marriage Act"".)

The House passed the measure on June 12, 1996 by a vote of 342-67. Republicans supported it by a margin of 224 to one (Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin). Democrats, though, also overwhelmingly backed it, by 118 to 65. Among those Democrats who voted ""yes"" were many leaders, progressives and up-and-comers, such as Rosa DeLauro (CT), Dick Durbin (IL), Ben Cardin (MD), Steny Hoyer (MD), Dick Gephardt (MO), Bob Torricelli (NJ), Bob Menendez (NJ), Bill Richardson (NM), Chuck Schumer (NY), Nita Lowey (NY), Marcy Kaptur (OH), Jack Reed (RI), Jim Clyburn (SC) and Tim Johnson (SD).

It was a similar landslide in the Senate on Sept. 10, where the vote in favor was 85-14. All 53 Republicans voted yes; Democrats favored this ""gay baiting"" and ""divisive"" bill by a 32-14 margin. Among the Dem ""yes"" votes: Chris Dodd (CT), Joe Lieberman (CT), Joe Biden (DE), Tom Harkin (IA), Barbara Mikulski (MD), Carl Levin (MI), Paul Wellstone (MN), Bill Bradley (NJ), Frank Lautenberg (NJ), Harry Reid (NV), John Glenn (OH), Patrick Leahy (VT) and Patty Murray (WA).

So, it's difficult to answer your question. We assume many Democrats would welcome the dismantling of DOMA in the present day. But we do know that an overwhelming majority of them voted for it back then.

Judge: ""These laws deny Plaintiffs their rights to due process and equal protection""

Virginia's new Democratic leadership previously said it wouldn't defend the ban

A federal judge in Virginia has struck down the commonwealth's ban on same-sex marriage as unconstitutional, according to court documents.

""These laws deny Plaintiffs their rights to due process and equal protection guaranteed under the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution,"" U.S. District Judge Arenda Wright Allen wrote in her opinion.

The decision comes just weeks after Virginia's new Democratic leadership said it wouldn't defend the ban in federal lawsuits.

""It's time for the commonwealth to be on the right side of history and the right side of the law,"" state Attorney General Mark Herring said at a news conference last month.

Virginia passed the ban in 2006.

The judge's decision is the latest in a recent series of such federal court rulings in mostly conservative states that began last June with a historic U.S. Supreme Court ruling recognizing gay marriages.

On Wednesday, a federal judge ruled that Kentucky's refusal to recognize same-sex marriages also violates the 14th Amendment.

Federal judges took the same stance in Oklahoma and Utah in recent months.

A similar development may be underway in Nevada, where the state's ban will no longer be defended in light of federal judges' rulings in other states in support of same-sex marriage.

Some states are taking up measures to counter the growing legal recognition of same-sex marriage. Lawmakers in Kansas are considering a bill that would make it legal to deny goods and services to same-sex couples for religious reasons.

lgbt_rights,Time Magazine,0,https://time.com/5684822/mattel-gender-neutral-doll/,'A Doll For Everyone': Meet Mattel's Gender-Neutral Doll,,,"A child opens a box . He starts jumping and screaming with joy—not an unusual sound in the halls of Mattel ’ s headquarters where researchers test new toys . But this particular toy is a doll , and it ’ s rare for parents to bring boys into these research groups to play with dolls . It ’ s rarer still for a boy to immediately attach himself to one the way Shi ’ a just did .
An 8-year-old who considers himself gender fluid and whose favorite color is black one week , pink the next , Shi ’ a sometimes plays with his younger sister ’ s dolls at home , but they ’ re “ girly , princess stuff , ” he says dismissively . This doll , with its prepubescent body and childish features , looks more like him , right down to the wave of bleached blond bangs . “ The hair is just like mine , ” Shi ’ a says , swinging his head in tandem with the doll ’ s . Then he turns to the playmate in the toy-testing room , a 7-year-old girl named Jhase , and asks , “ Should I put on the girl hair ? ” Shi ’ a fits a long , blond wig on the doll ’ s head , and suddenly it is no longer an avatar for him but for his sister .
The doll can be a boy , a girl , neither or both , and Mattel , which calls this the world ’ s first gender-neutral doll , is hoping its launch on Sept. 25 redefines who gets to play with a toy traditionally deemed taboo for half the world ’ s kids . Carefully manicured features betray no obvious gender : the lips are not too full , the eyelashes not too long and fluttery , the jaw not too wide . There are no Barbie-like breasts or broad , Ken-like shoulders . Each doll in the Creatable World series looks like a slender 7-year-old with short hair , but each comes with a wig of long , lustrous locks and a wardrobe befitting any fashion-conscious kid : hoodies , sneakers , graphic T-shirts in soothing greens and yellows , along with tutus and camo pants .
Mattel ’ s first promotional spot for the $ 29.99 product features a series of kids who go by various pronouns—him , her , them , xem—and the slogan “ A doll line designed to keep labels out and invite everyone in. ” With this overt nod to trans and nonbinary identities , the company is betting on where it thinks the country is going , even if it means alienating a substantial portion of the population . A Pew Research survey conducted in 2017 showed that while 76 % of the public supports parents ’ steering girls to toys and activities traditionally associated with boys , only 64 % endorse steering boys toward toys and activities associated with girls .
For years , millennial parents have pushed back against “ pink aisles ” and “ blue aisles ” in toy stores in favor of gender-neutral sections , often in the name of exposing girls to the building blocks and chemistry kits that foster interest in science and math but are usually categorized as boys ’ toys . Major toy sellers have listened , thanks to the millennial generation ’ s unrivaled size , trend-setting ability and buying power . Target eliminated gender-specific sections in 2015 . The same year , Disney banished “ boys ” and “ girls ” labels from its children ’ s costumes , inviting girls to dress as Captain America and boys as Belle . Last year , Mattel did away with “ boys ” and “ girls ” toy divisions in favor of nongendered sections : dolls or cars , for instance .
But the Creatable World doll is something else entirely . Unlike model airplanes or volcano kits , dolls have faces like ours , upon which we can project our own self-image and anxieties . Mattel tested the doll with 250 families across seven states , including 15 children who identify as trans , gender-nonbinary or gender-fluid and rarely see themselves reflected in the media , let alone their playthings . “ There were a couple of gender-creative kids who told us that they dreaded Christmas Day because they knew whatever they got under the Christmas tree , it wasn ’ t made for them , ” says Monica Dreger , head of consumer insights at Mattel . “ This is the first doll that you can find under the tree and see is for them because it can be for anyone . ”
The population of young people who identify as gender-nonbinary is growing . Though no large surveys have been done of kids younger than 10 , a recent study by the Williams Institute at the University of California , Los Angeles , found that 27 % of California teens identify as gender-nonconforming . And a 2018 Pew study found 35 % of Gen Z-ers ( born 1995 to 2015 ) say they personally know someone who uses gender-neutral pronouns like they and them , compared with just 16 % of Gen X-ers ( born 1965 to 1980 ) . The patterns are projected to continue with Generation Alpha , born in 2010 and later . Those kids , along with boys who want to play with dolls and girls who identify as “ tomboys ” and don ’ t gravitate toward fashion doll play , are an untapped demographic . Mattel currently has 19 % market share in the $ 8 billion doll industry ; gaining just 1 more point could translate into $ 80 million in revenue for the company .
Mattel sees an even broader potential for Creatable World beyond gender-creative kids . In testing , the company found that Generation Alpha children chafed at labels and mandates no matter their gender identity : They didn ’ t want to be told whom a toy was designed for or how to play with it . They were delighted with a doll that had no name and could transform and adapt according to their whims .
Shi ’ a , left , and Jhase play with Mattel ’ s gender-neutral doll Photograph by Angie Smith for TIME .
But it ’ s parents who are making the purchasing decisions , and no adult is going to have a neutral reaction to this doll . In testing groups , several parents felt the “ gender-neutral ” branding of the toy pushed a political agenda , and some adults objected to the notion of their sons ever playing with dolls . Mattel ’ s President Richard Dickson insists the doll isn ’ t intended as a statement . “ We ’ re not in the business of politics , ” he says , “ and we respect the decision any parent makes around how they raise their kids . Our job is to stimulate imaginations . Our toys are ultimately canvases for cultural conversation , but it ’ s your conversation , not ours ; your opinion , not ours . ”
Yet even offering customers that blank canvas will be seen as political in a country where gender-neutral bathrooms still stir protests . Mattel joins a cohort of other companies that have chosen a side in a divisive political climate . Just in the past two years , Nike launched a campaign starring Colin Kaepernick after the NFL dropped him from the league for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism . Airbnb offered free housing to people displaced in the face of President Trump ’ s travel ban . Dick ’ s Sporting Goods stopped selling assault-style weapons after the Parkland shooting . All these companies have reported eventual sales bumps after staking their claim in the culture wars .
When pressed with these examples , Dickson admits that staying neutral is not an option if you want to be perceived as an innovator . “ I think being a company today , you have to have a combination of social justice along with commerce , and that balance can be tricky , ” Dickson says . “ Not everyone will appreciate you or agree with you . ”
In fact , dissent among boomers , Gen X-ers and even millennials may be a positive sign , according to Mattel ’ s own researchers . “ If all the parents who saw the dolls said , ‘ This is what we ’ ve been waiting for , ’ we wouldn ’ t be doing our jobs , ” says Dreger . “ That would mean this should have already been in the market . So we ’ re maybe a little behind where kids are , ahead of where parents are , and that ’ s exactly where we need to be . ”
Walking into Mattel ’ s headquarters , it ’ s difficult to imagine a gender-neutral world of play . A huge mural depicts some of the company ’ s most recognizable toys . A classic bouffanted version of Barbie in a black-and-white bathing suit and heels squints down at visitors . In another picture close by , a little boy puffs out his chest and rips open his shirt , Superman style , to reveal a red Mattel logo that reads “ Strength and Excellence. ” Even a toddler would be able to discern the messaging on how a woman and a man are expected to look from these images .
But the evolution within Mattel is obvious once visitors make their way past the entryway and into the designers ’ cubicles . Inspiration boards are covered with pictures of boys in skirts and girls in athletic gear . The most striking images are mashups of popular teen stars : the features of Camila Mendes and Cole Sprouse , who play Veronica and Jughead on Riverdale , combine to create one androgynous face , and Millie Bobby Brown and Finn Wolfhard , who play the main characters on Stranger Things , blend into a single floppy-haired , genderless person with sharp cheekbones .
In the past decade , toy companies have begun to tear down gender barriers . Smaller businesses like GoldieBlox , which launched in 2012 and builds engineering toys targeting girls , and large companies like Lego , which created the female-focused Lego Friends line the same year , have made STEM toys for girls more mainstream . Small independent toymakers have pushed things further with dollhouses painted green and yellow instead of purple and pink , or cooking kits that are entirely white instead of decorated with flowers or butterflies .
Perhaps it ’ s surprising , then , that nobody has beaten Mattel to creating a gender-neutral doll . A deep Google search for such a toy turns up baby dolls or strange-looking plush creatures that don ’ t resemble any human who ever walked this earth . Nothing comes close to the Creatable World doll that Mattel has conjured up over the past two years .
Scientists have debunked the idea that boys are simply born wanting to play with trucks and girls wanting to nurture dolls . A study by psychologists Lisa Dinella and Erica Weisgram , co-editors of Gender Typing of Children ’ s Toys : How Early Play Experiences Impact Development , found that when wheeled toys were painted white — and thus deprived of all color signaling whether they were “ boys ’ toys ” or “ girls ’ toys ” — girls and boys chose to play with the wheeled toys equally often . Dinella points out that removing gendered cues from toys facilitates play between boys and girls , crucial practice for when men and women must interact in the workplace and home as adults . She adds that millennials ( born 1981 to 1996 ) have pushed to share child-care responsibilities , and that battle ought to begin in the playroom . “ If boys , like girls , are encouraged to learn parental skills with doll play at a young age , you wind up with more nurturing and empathetic fathers , ” she says .
And yet creating a doll to appeal to all kids , regardless of gender , remains risky . “ There are children who are willing to cross those gender boundaries that society places on toys , but there ’ s often a cost that comes with crossing those boundaries , ” Dinella says . “ That cost seems to be bigger for boys than it is for girls. ” Some of those social repercussions no doubt can be traced to parental attitudes . In Los Angeles , the majority of the seven parents in an early testing group for Creatable World complained the doll “ feels political , ” as one mom put it .
“ I don ’ t think my son should be playing with dolls , ” she continued . “ There ’ s a difference between a girl with a truck and a boy with a Barbie , and a boy with a Barbie is a no-no . ”
The only dad in the group shrugged . “ I don ’ t know , ” he said . “ My daughter is friends with a boy who wears dresses . I used to be against that type of thing , but now I ’ m O.K . with it . ”
In videos of those testing groups , many parents fumbled with the language to describe the dolls , confusing gender ( how a person identifies ) with sexuality ( whom a person is attracted to ) , mixing up gender-neutral ( without gender ) and trans ( a person who has transitioned from one gender to another ) and fretting about the mere idea of a boy playing with a doll . A second mom in Los Angeles asked before seeing the doll , “ Is it transgender ? How am I supposed to have a conversation with my kid about that ? ” After examining the toy and discussing gender-fluidity with the other parents , she declared , “ It ’ s just too much . Can ’ t we go back to 1970 ? ”
After the session , Dreger analyzed the parental response . “ Adults get so tied up in the descriptions and definitions , ” she said . “ They jump to this idea of sexuality . They make themselves more anxious about it . For kids it ’ s much more intuitive . ”
Why , exactly , a new generation is rejecting categorizations that society has been using for millennia is up for debate . Eighty-one percent of Gen Z-ers believe that a person shouldn ’ t be defined by gender , according to a poll by the J. Walter Thompson marketing group . But it ’ s not just about gender — it ’ s about authenticity , whether real or perceived . Macho male actors and glam , ultra-feminine actresses have less cultural cachet than they used to . Gen Z , with its well-honed radar for anything overly polished or fake-seeming , prefers YouTube confessionals about battling everything from zits to depression . When the New York Times recently asked Generation Z to pick a name for itself , the most-liked response was “ Don ’ t call us anything . ”
Perhaps their ideas of gender have expanded under the influence of parents who are beginning to reject practices like gender-reveal parties that box kids in even before they are born . Jenna Karvunidis , who popularized the gender-reveal party , recently revealed on Facebook that her now 10-year-old child is gender-nonconforming and that she regrets holding the party . “ She ’ s telling me , ‘ Mom , there are many genders . Mom , there ’ s many different sexualities and all different types , ’ and I take her lead on that , ” Karvunidis said in an interview with NPR .
Perhaps it ’ s that a generation of kids raised on video games where they could create their own avatars , with whatever styling and gender they please , has helped open up the way kids think about identity . Perhaps the simple fact that more celebrities like Amandla Stenberg and Sam Smith are coming out as gender-nonbinary has made it easier for other young people to do the same . Generation Alpha , the most diverse generation in America in all senses of the term , is likely to grow up with even more liberal views on gender .
“ This is a rallying cry of this generation , ” says Jess Weiner , a cultural consultant for large companies looking to tap into modern-day markets and navigate issues of gender . “ Companies in this day and age have to evolve or else they die , they go away … And part of that evolving is trying to understand things they didn ’ t prior . ”

Mattel isn ’ t the first company to notice the trend of young shoppers moving away from gender-specific products . Rob Smith—the founder of the Phluid Project , a gender-free clothing store that caters to the LGBTQ+ community in New York City—says several large corporations , including Mattel , have approached him for advice on how to market to the young masses . “ I work with a lot of companies who are figuring out that the separation between male and female is less important to young consumers who don ’ t want to be boxed into anything , ” he says . “ There ’ s men ’ s shampoo and women ’ s shampoo , but it ’ s just all shampoo . Companies are starting to investigate that in-between space in order to win over Gen Z . ”
Still , Mattel enters a politically charged debate at a precarious moment for corporations in America , where companies that want to gain customer loyalty are being pushed to one aisle or the other . A study from the PR agency Weber Shandwick found 47 % of millennials think CEOs should take stances on social issues . Some 51 % of millennials surveyed said they are more likely to buy products from companies run by activist CEOs . Now , if you walk into a Patagonia store , you ’ ll see a sign that reads , “ The President stole your land . Take action now . ”
Such activism is often born of self-interest : companies want to appeal to liberal customers and retain young employees and their allies . They face little risk by speaking up but major consequences by sitting on the sidelines . In August , customers boycotted Equinox and SoulCycle—two companies that have aggressively courted the LGBTQ+ community—when reports emerged that their key investor was holding a fundraiser for Trump with ticket prices as high as $ 250,000 . According to data analyses by Second Measure , in August , customer purchases were down almost 13 % compared to a month earlier .
Weiner says SoulCycle ’ s experience should serve as a cautionary tale . “ I think businesses of any size now recognize that their consumer base values transparency over any other attribute . They want to know that your board is reflective of your choices , and that ’ s caught a lot of businesses off-guard , ” Weiner says . “ You can ’ t talk about gender equity in your commercial and then have no women on your board . They have to be savvy . ”
Now , a toy company has chosen to make a product specifically to appeal to the progressive part of the country . Lisa McKnight , the senior vice president of the global doll portfolio at Mattel , says major retailers have been enthusiastic about Creatable World . “ They ’ re excited about the message of inclusivity , ” she says . “ The world is becoming a more diverse and inclusive place , and some people want to do more to support that. ” When pressed on the risks , she lays out the alternative . “ Candidly , we ask ourselves if another company were to launch a product line like this , how would we feel ? And after that gut check , we are proceeding . ”

Mattel will launch Creatable World exclusively online first , in part to better control the message . That includes giving sneak previews to select influencers and leaders in the LGBTQ+ community . Selling the doll in retail stores will be more complicated . For one thing , there ’ s the question of where to place it in stores to attract the attention of shoppers who might not venture into a doll section . Store clerks will have to be trained in what pronouns to use when talking about the doll and how to handle anxious parents ’ questions about it . And then there are practical concerns . Dickson admits the company is ready for the possibility that protests against Creatable World dolls could hurt other Mattel brands , namely Barbie .
Mattel has taken risks before . Most recently , in 2016 , it added three new body types to the Barbie doll : tall , petite and , most radically , curvy . It was the first time the company had made a major change to one of the most recognizable brands—and bodies—in the world in the doll ’ s almost-60-year history . The change helped propel Barbie from a retrograde doll lambasted by feminists for her impossible shape to a modern toy . She is now on the rise . Her sales have been up for the past eight quarters , and she saw a 14 % sales bump in the past year alone , according to Mattel .
But Mattel felt late to the game when it changed Barbie ’ s body : For years the Mindy Kalings and Ashley Grahams of the world had been championing fuller body types . Parents had been demanding change with boycotts and letter campaigns . By contrast , Creatable World feels like uncharted territory . Consider children ’ s media : Disney hasn ’ t introduced a major gay character in any of its movies , let alone a gender-nonconforming one . There are no trans superheroes on the big screen . Even characters whose creators say they are queer—like Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series—haven ’ t actually come out on the page or the screen . In that pop-culture space , a gender-neutral doll seems radical .
Even though there is no scientific evidence to prove that this is the case , there will be customers who say that even exposing their children to a gender-nonbinary doll through commercials or in a play group would threaten to change their child ’ s identity . This debate will spin out into sociopolitical questions about whether the types of toys children play with affect their sense of identity and gender .
That conversation , if it comes , is worth it , according to Dickson . “ I think if we could have a hand in creating the idea that a boy can play with a perceived girl toy and a girl can play with a perceived boy toy , we would have contributed to a better , more sensitive place of perception in the world today , ” he says . “ And even more so for the kids that find themselves in that challenging place , if we can make that moment in their life a bit more comfortable , and knowing we created something that makes them feel recognized , that ’ s a beautiful thing . ”
The original version of this story misstated the SoulCycle metric tracked by Second Measure . It is customer purchases , not attendance .","A child opens a box. He starts jumping and screaming with joy—not an unusual sound in the halls of Mattel’s headquarters where researchers test new toys. But this particular toy is a doll, and it’s rare for parents to bring boys into these research groups to play with dolls. It’s rarer still for a boy to immediately attach himself to one the way Shi’a just did.

An 8-year-old who considers himself gender fluid and whose favorite color is black one week, pink the next, Shi’a sometimes plays with his younger sister’s dolls at home, but they’re “girly, princess stuff,” he says dismissively. This doll, with its prepubescent body and childish features, looks more like him, right down to the wave of bleached blond bangs. “The hair is just like mine,” Shi’a says, swinging his head in tandem with the doll’s. Then he turns to the playmate in the toy-testing room, a 7-year-old girl named Jhase, and asks, “Should I put on the girl hair?” Shi’a fits a long, blond wig on the doll’s head, and suddenly it is no longer an avatar for him but for his sister.

The doll can be a boy, a girl, neither or both, and Mattel, which calls this the world’s first gender-neutral doll, is hoping its launch on Sept. 25 redefines who gets to play with a toy traditionally deemed taboo for half the world’s kids. Carefully manicured features betray no obvious gender: the lips are not too full, the eyelashes not too long and fluttery, the jaw not too wide. There are no Barbie-like breasts or broad, Ken-like shoulders. Each doll in the Creatable World series looks like a slender 7-year-old with short hair, but each comes with a wig of long, lustrous locks and a wardrobe befitting any fashion-conscious kid: hoodies, sneakers, graphic T-shirts in soothing greens and yellows, along with tutus and camo pants.

Mattel’s first promotional spot for the $29.99 product features a series of kids who go by various pronouns—him, her, them, xem—and the slogan “A doll line designed to keep labels out and invite everyone in.” With this overt nod to trans and nonbinary identities, the company is betting on where it thinks the country is going, even if it means alienating a substantial portion of the population. A Pew Research survey conducted in 2017 showed that while 76% of the public supports parents’ steering girls to toys and activities traditionally associated with boys, only 64% endorse steering boys toward toys and activities associated with girls.

For years, millennial parents have pushed back against “pink aisles” and “blue aisles” in toy stores in favor of gender-neutral sections, often in the name of exposing girls to the building blocks and chemistry kits that foster interest in science and math but are usually categorized as boys’ toys. Major toy sellers have listened, thanks to the millennial generation’s unrivaled size, trend-setting ability and buying power. Target eliminated gender-specific sections in 2015. The same year, Disney banished “boys” and “girls” labels from its children’s costumes, inviting girls to dress as Captain America and boys as Belle. Last year, Mattel did away with “boys” and “girls” toy divisions in favor of nongendered sections: dolls or cars, for instance.

But the Creatable World doll is something else entirely. Unlike model airplanes or volcano kits, dolls have faces like ours, upon which we can project our own self-image and anxieties. Mattel tested the doll with 250 families across seven states, including 15 children who identify as trans, gender-nonbinary or gender-fluid and rarely see themselves reflected in the media, let alone their playthings. “There were a couple of gender-creative kids who told us that they dreaded Christmas Day because they knew whatever they got under the Christmas tree, it wasn’t made for them,” says Monica Dreger, head of consumer insights at Mattel. “This is the first doll that you can find under the tree and see is for them because it can be for anyone.”

The population of young people who identify as gender-nonbinary is growing. Though no large surveys have been done of kids younger than 10, a recent study by the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, found that 27% of California teens identify as gender-nonconforming. And a 2018 Pew study found 35% of Gen Z-ers (born 1995 to 2015) say they personally know someone who uses gender-neutral pronouns like they and them, compared with just 16% of Gen X-ers (born 1965 to 1980). The patterns are projected to continue with Generation Alpha, born in 2010 and later. Those kids, along with boys who want to play with dolls and girls who identify as “tomboys” and don’t gravitate toward fashion doll play, are an untapped demographic. Mattel currently has 19% market share in the $8 billion doll industry; gaining just 1 more point could translate into $80 million in revenue for the company.

Mattel sees an even broader potential for Creatable World beyond gender-creative kids. In testing, the company found that Generation Alpha children chafed at labels and mandates no matter their gender identity: They didn’t want to be told whom a toy was designed for or how to play with it. They were delighted with a doll that had no name and could transform and adapt according to their whims.

But it’s parents who are making the purchasing decisions, and no adult is going to have a neutral reaction to this doll. In testing groups, several parents felt the “gender-neutral” branding of the toy pushed a political agenda, and some adults objected to the notion of their sons ever playing with dolls. Mattel’s President Richard Dickson insists the doll isn’t intended as a statement. “We’re not in the business of politics,” he says, “and we respect the decision any parent makes around how they raise their kids. Our job is to stimulate imaginations. Our toys are ultimately canvases for cultural conversation, but it’s your conversation, not ours; your opinion, not ours.”

Yet even offering customers that blank canvas will be seen as political in a country where gender-neutral bathrooms still stir protests. Mattel joins a cohort of other companies that have chosen a side in a divisive political climate. Just in the past two years, Nike launched a campaign starring Colin Kaepernick after the NFL dropped him from the league for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism. Airbnb offered free housing to people displaced in the face of President Trump’s travel ban. Dick’s Sporting Goods stopped selling assault-style weapons after the Parkland shooting. All these companies have reported eventual sales bumps after staking their claim in the culture wars.

When pressed with these examples, Dickson admits that staying neutral is not an option if you want to be perceived as an innovator. “I think being a company today, you have to have a combination of social justice along with commerce, and that balance can be tricky,” Dickson says. “Not everyone will appreciate you or agree with you.”

In fact, dissent among boomers, Gen X-ers and even millennials may be a positive sign, according to Mattel’s own researchers. “If all the parents who saw the dolls said, ‘This is what we’ve been waiting for,’ we wouldn’t be doing our jobs,” says Dreger. “That would mean this should have already been in the market. So we’re maybe a little behind where kids are, ahead of where parents are, and that’s exactly where we need to be.”

Walking into Mattel’s headquarters, it’s difficult to imagine a gender-neutral world of play. A huge mural depicts some of the company’s most recognizable toys. A classic bouffanted version of Barbie in a black-and-white bathing suit and heels squints down at visitors. In another picture close by, a little boy puffs out his chest and rips open his shirt, Superman style, to reveal a red Mattel logo that reads “Strength and Excellence.” Even a toddler would be able to discern the messaging on how a woman and a man are expected to look from these images.

But the evolution within Mattel is obvious once visitors make their way past the entryway and into the designers’ cubicles. Inspiration boards are covered with pictures of boys in skirts and girls in athletic gear. The most striking images are mashups of popular teen stars: the features of Camila Mendes and Cole Sprouse, who play Veronica and Jughead on Riverdale, combine to create one androgynous face, and Millie Bobby Brown and Finn Wolfhard, who play the main characters on Stranger Things, blend into a single floppy-haired, genderless person with sharp cheekbones.

In the past decade, toy companies have begun to tear down gender barriers. Smaller businesses like GoldieBlox, which launched in 2012 and builds engineering toys targeting girls, and large companies like Lego, which created the female-focused Lego Friends line the same year, have made STEM toys for girls more mainstream. Small independent toymakers have pushed things further with dollhouses painted green and yellow instead of purple and pink, or cooking kits that are entirely white instead of decorated with flowers or butterflies.

Perhaps it’s surprising, then, that nobody has beaten Mattel to creating a gender-neutral doll. A deep Google search for such a toy turns up baby dolls or strange-looking plush creatures that don’t resemble any human who ever walked this earth. Nothing comes close to the Creatable World doll that Mattel has conjured up over the past two years.

Scientists have debunked the idea that boys are simply born wanting to play with trucks and girls wanting to nurture dolls. A study by psychologists Lisa Dinella and Erica Weisgram, co-editors of Gender Typing of Children’s Toys: How Early Play Experiences Impact Development, found that when wheeled toys were painted white — and thus deprived of all color signaling whether they were “boys’ toys” or “girls’ toys” — girls and boys chose to play with the wheeled toys equally often. Dinella points out that removing gendered cues from toys facilitates play between boys and girls, crucial practice for when men and women must interact in the workplace and home as adults. She adds that millennials (born 1981 to 1996) have pushed to share child-care responsibilities, and that battle ought to begin in the playroom. “If boys, like girls, are encouraged to learn parental skills with doll play at a young age, you wind up with more nurturing and empathetic fathers,” she says.

And yet creating a doll to appeal to all kids, regardless of gender, remains risky. “There are children who are willing to cross those gender boundaries that society places on toys, but there’s often a cost that comes with crossing those boundaries,” Dinella says. “That cost seems to be bigger for boys than it is for girls.” Some of those social repercussions no doubt can be traced to parental attitudes. In Los Angeles, the majority of the seven parents in an early testing group for Creatable World complained the doll “feels political,” as one mom put it.

“I don’t think my son should be playing with dolls,” she continued. “There’s a difference between a girl with a truck and a boy with a Barbie, and a boy with a Barbie is a no-no.”

The only dad in the group shrugged. “I don’t know,” he said. “My daughter is friends with a boy who wears dresses. I used to be against that type of thing, but now I’m O.K. with it.”

In videos of those testing groups, many parents fumbled with the language to describe the dolls, confusing gender (how a person identifies) with sexuality (whom a person is attracted to), mixing up gender-neutral (without gender) and trans (a person who has transitioned from one gender to another) and fretting about the mere idea of a boy playing with a doll. A second mom in Los Angeles asked before seeing the doll, “Is it transgender? How am I supposed to have a conversation with my kid about that?” After examining the toy and discussing gender-fluidity with the other parents, she declared, “It’s just too much. Can’t we go back to 1970?”

After the session, Dreger analyzed the parental response. “Adults get so tied up in the descriptions and definitions,” she said. “They jump to this idea of sexuality. They make themselves more anxious about it. For kids it’s much more intuitive.”

Why, exactly, a new generation is rejecting categorizations that society has been using for millennia is up for debate. Eighty-one percent of Gen Z-ers believe that a person shouldn’t be defined by gender, according to a poll by the J. Walter Thompson marketing group. But it’s not just about gender — it’s about authenticity, whether real or perceived. Macho male actors and glam, ultra-feminine actresses have less cultural cachet than they used to. Gen Z, with its well-honed radar for anything overly polished or fake-seeming, prefers YouTube confessionals about battling everything from zits to depression. When the New York Times recently asked Generation Z to pick a name for itself, the most-liked response was “Don’t call us anything.”

Perhaps their ideas of gender have expanded under the influence of parents who are beginning to reject practices like gender-reveal parties that box kids in even before they are born. Jenna Karvunidis, who popularized the gender-reveal party, recently revealed on Facebook that her now 10-year-old child is gender-nonconforming and that she regrets holding the party. “She’s telling me, ‘Mom, there are many genders. Mom, there’s many different sexualities and all different types,’ and I take her lead on that,” Karvunidis said in an interview with NPR.

The new rule defines “ sex ” to mean biological sex for the purposes of Obamacare ’ s nondiscrimination policy .
The Department of Health and Human Services has just announced a rule undoing an Obama-administration policy that had redefined “ sex ” to include “ gender identity ” and “ termination of pregnancy ” for purposes of nondiscrimination under the Affordable Care Act .
Section 1557 of Obamacare prohibits discrimination on the basis of race , color , national origin , sex , age , or disability in health-related programs or activities . Near the end of President Obama ’ s second term , his HHS Department released a regulation redefining “ sex ” for the purposes of Section 1557 to include “ gender identity ” and “ termination of pregnancy . ”
As a result of the rule that HHS released today , that regulation has been reversed and “ sex ” once again refers only to biological sex , as was intended in the statute .
In December 2016 , the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas enjoined Section 1557 ’ s prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of gender identity and termination of pregnancy . Last fall , the same federal judge vacated the rule , saying that it violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act .
As a result of these rulings , HHS no longer could enforce the Obama-era provision , and today ’ s new rule brings federal policy into compliance with court rulings .
“ What this regulatory reform does is update the books to reflect the reality that ‘ gender identity ’ and ‘ termination of pregnancy ’ have been deemed unlawful interpretations of civil-rights law , ” Roger Severino , director of the HHS Office for Civil Rights , told ███ . “ This final rule is merely conforming to that legal reality . ”
Severino noted , too , that the new HHS rule “ carries forward the Obama administration ’ s decision not to include ‘ sexual orientation ’ as a protected category under the definition of sex discrimination. ” Some progressive advocates had urged the Obama-era HHS to add “ sexual orientation ” to its regulation , but it failed to do so .
Opponents of the Obama administration ’ s regulation had both health-care and religious-freedom concerns about its implications . Because the policy applied to any health programs or activities funded or administered by HHS , as well as any plans offered in Obamacare ’ s health-insurance marketplaces , it affected a huge number of health-care providers in the U.S .
By redefining “ sex , ” the policy required medical professionals to treat biological males who identify as women , and biological women who identify as men , according to their gender identity rather than their biological sex — a practice that can lead to improper health-care decisions .
There was , for instance , a documented case in which a biological female who identified as a male visited a hospital complaining of abdominal pain . Because the doctors were required to treat this person according to gender identity , this biological woman , who was unknowingly pregnant , ended up delivering a stillborn child .
“ We agree with the court ’ s rationale that the plain original meaning of ‘ sex ’ under our sex-discrimination laws referred to the biological realities of sex , and this is particularly important for programs administered or funded by HHS , because we so often deal with the scientific reality of sex in our health and research programs , ” Severino explained .
As the federal judge determined , the Obama policy also had negative implications for religious-liberty and conscience rights , particularly for health-care workers .
“ There were religious-freedom concerns at play , as well as to the ability of doctors to be able to act according to their best medical judgment , as well as their conscience and religious beliefs , ” Severino said .
The decision to reverse the Obama-administration regulation will almost certainly be met with fury by progressive activists and their allies in the media . When it first became public that the Trump administration was considering undoing the Section 1557 rule , the New York Times falsely asserted that “ ‘ Transgender ’ Could Be Defined Out of Existence Under Trump Administration . ”
Nevertheless , the move fulfills a key promise that Trump made both on the campaign trail and throughout his time in office , voicing support for undoing Obama-era policies that redefined “ sex ” to include “ sexual orientation ” and “ gender identity. ” This move , though it comes near the end of his first term , is another step in showing his supporters , especially social conservatives , that he is willing to follow through .","A worker arrives at the Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, D.C.

Near the end of President Obama’s second term, his HHS Department released a regulation redefining “sex” for the purposes of Section 1557 to include “gender identity” and “termination of pregnancy.”

As a result of the rule that HHS released today, that regulation has been reversed and “sex” once again refers only to biological sex, as was intended in the statute.

In December 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas enjoined Section 1557’s prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of gender identity and termination of pregnancy. Last fall, the same federal judge vacated the rule, saying that it violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

As a result of these rulings, HHS no longer could enforce the Obama-era provision, and today’s new rule brings federal policy into compliance with court rulings.

“What this regulatory reform does is update the books to reflect the reality that ‘gender identity’ and ‘termination of pregnancy’ have been deemed unlawful interpretations of civil-rights law,” Roger Severino, director of the HHS Office for Civil Rights, told National Review. “This final rule is merely conforming to that legal reality.”

Severino noted, too, that the new HHS rule “carries forward the Obama administration’s decision not to include ‘sexual orientation’ as a protected category under the definition of sex discrimination.” Some progressive advocates had urged the Obama-era HHS to add “sexual orientation” to its regulation, but it failed to do so.

Opponents of the Obama administration’s regulation had both health-care and religious-freedom concerns about its implications. Because the policy applied to any health programs or activities funded or administered by HHS, as well as any plans offered in Obamacare’s health-insurance marketplaces, it affected a huge number of health-care providers in the U.S.

By redefining “sex,” the policy required medical professionals to treat biological males who identify as women, and biological women who identify as men, according to their gender identity rather than their biological sex — a practice that can lead to improper health-care decisions.

There was, for instance, a documented case in which a biological female who identified as a male visited a hospital complaining of abdominal pain. Because the doctors were required to treat this person according to gender identity, this biological woman, who was unknowingly pregnant, ended up delivering a stillborn child.

“We agree with the court’s rationale that the plain original meaning of ‘sex’ under our sex-discrimination laws referred to the biological realities of sex, and this is particularly important for programs administered or funded by HHS, because we so often deal with the scientific reality of sex in our health and research programs,” Severino explained.

As the federal judge determined, the Obama policy also had negative implications for religious-liberty and conscience rights, particularly for health-care workers.

“There were religious-freedom concerns at play, as well as to the ability of doctors to be able to act according to their best medical judgment, as well as their conscience and religious beliefs,” Severino said.

The decision to reverse the Obama-administration regulation will almost certainly be met with fury by progressive activists and their allies in the media. When it first became public that the Trump administration was considering undoing the Section 1557 rule, the New York Times falsely asserted that “‘Transgender’ Could Be Defined Out of Existence Under Trump Administration.”

Nevertheless, the move fulfills a key promise that Trump made both on the campaign trail and throughout his time in office, voicing support for undoing Obama-era policies that redefined “sex” to include “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.” This move, though it comes near the end of his first term, is another step in showing his supporters, especially social conservatives, that he is willing to follow through.",www.nationalreview.com,right,KfVqnGFOj2tMScEY

Garretson , NYU Press , 352 pages , $ 35
`` The single most important thing you can do politically for gay rights is to come out , '' declared Barney Frank , who in 1987 was the first member of Congress to exit the closet voluntarily . `` Not to write a letter to your congressman , but to come out . ''
How did public support for the legality of same-sex relations double from the 1980s to today ? How did support for both gay marriage and gay adoption grow by more than 20 percent in just two decades ? Jeremiah Garretson tackles these questions in The Path to Gay Rights , a scholarly analysis of the LGBT movement 's success . The book 's narrative is hopeful—it 's a story of how countless personal interactions and individual changes of heart , not elite opinion or legal mandates , drove one of the most remarkable attitudinal shifts in modern history .
Garretson traces the history of the gay liberation movement from the aftermath of World War II until the present . His book covers the struggles of the Mattachine Society , one of the first modern `` homophile '' organizations , in opposing the `` lavender scare '' of the early Cold War years—a moral panic that culminated in the government barring homosexuals from federal employment on the grounds that they posed a special security risk due to blackmail concerns . It shows how gay and lesbian enclaves stabilized in certain urban centers , such as San Francisco , Los Angeles , and New York , in the wake of the Stonewall riots . It looks at the social conservative backlash led by the singer Anita Bryant and other evangelical activists , and it documents how the LGBT community forged a sense of common identity in opposition to the persecution . ( In the 1970s , for instance , gay bars boycotted Florida oranges and took the orange juice–based screwdriver off their menus because Bryant was a brand ambassador for the state 's Citrus Commission . )
Building a community helped gays and lesbians win support from the politicians who represented their enclaves , albeit at a still mostly local level . An important early victory came in 1978 , with the defeat of Proposition 6 , the `` Briggs Initiative , '' which would have barred gays and lesbians from teaching in California public schools . Meanwhile , nonpolitical gay- and lesbian-themed organizations—from swim clubs to dental referral services—helped integrate more people into the community .
All this was the starting point for the LGBT movement . But Garretson argues that the tipping point was , paradoxically , the community 's darkest period : the AIDS crisis , which pushed people out of the closet and into activism in unprecedented numbers .
Garretson arrives at this conclusion by way of a theory of `` affective liberalization . '' A person 's view of a social group , he argues , is influenced far more by his or her emotional reaction , or affect , than by facts and logic . As the AIDS crisis propelled more gays and lesbians to live openly , the proportion of Americans who were aware that they knew a member of that group ballooned . A personal connection with a homosexual colleague , friend , or family member—or even just seeing a recurring LGBT character on mainstream TV—helped build sympathy over time .
One prevailing misconception among political scientists is that politicians voicing more tolerant views on LGBT issues drove changing attitudes among the general public . Garretson uses decades of survey data and dozens of regression analyses to show that , in fact , greater exposure to gays and lesbians led to more positive attitudes regardless of how much attention a person paid to so-called elite opinion makers .
Garretson also makes a strong case that younger generations are more supportive of gay rights not because of their youth per se but because there were more `` out '' people around them during their formative years . While older Americans have grown increasingly sympathetic to this population as they 've come to know gays and lesbians , that new affect still clashes with pre-existing notions forged during the decades when most LGBT people stayed in the closet . Younger Americans are less likely to have such hangups .
That does n't mean politics did n't matter . Garretson argues that activism was another important piece of the puzzle . Groups like the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power ( ACT UP ) shifted the media narrative and put pressure on government , forcing a national debate around LGBT issues that would not have otherwise materialized .
ACT UP and similar groups pressured The New York Times to print more information on the AIDS crisis and staged `` die-ins '' at the Food and Drug Administration to protest the over-regulation that lengthened approval times for anti-AIDS drugs . Groups such as Gay Men 's Health Crisis in New York coupled these external demands with efforts to spread information that would help prevent HIV transmission . For the first time , the general public saw the gay movement not just as victims of persecution but as a community of real people demanding their rights and working to take care of their friends and loved ones during difficult times .
In 1992 , presidential candidate Bill Clinton addressed a crowd of LGBT supporters at a campaign rally in Hollywood and promised to support a variety of causes important to them . He dared to attend that event , and broke new ground in doing so , because gays and lesbians had built a group consciousness through their AIDS activism . They had organized enough to become a serious political bloc with something to offer a national coalition . Turning out in large numbers meant politicians had a ███ to compete for LGBT support in primaries . Debates over the military 's `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy and the Defense of Marriage Act continued the conversation , prompting more people to come out in a positive feedback loop of increasing public support .
The Path to Gay Rights thus lends credence to bottom-up models of social change , showing that the spontaneous order of thousands of individual interactions created the conditions for elites to finally support gay rights , not the other way around . Consciously or not , the book also echoes public choice theory , which argues that political leaders do n't alter their stances simply because a large number of their constituents favor something . Lawmakers did n't automatically change their tune as baseline support for the gay and lesbian community rose in many parts of the country . It took incessant pressure by LGBT interest groups to pressure politicians to take the risk of supporting the protections they sought . For gays and lesbians , as for any other group , nothing moves in politics that is n't pushed .
The Path to Gay Rights does n't limit its scope to the United States . Garretson finds that the gap in support for gay rights is far greater between liberal and illiberal countries ( broadly speaking ) than between the left and right in the West . And liberalization is linked to a country 's wealth . People who were born in 1920 have similarly negative views on homosexuality regardless of where they live—but citizens of countries with higher per capita GDPs express significantly more positive views the closer they were born to the present . Similar results appear in countries with greater numbers of influential political parties , and these effects are even stronger in countries with freer presses and more TVs per capita .
Building person-to-person empathy was central to LGBT progress . Perhaps that 's how freedom will advance elsewhere as well .","The Path to Gay Rights: How Activism and Coming Out Changed Public Opinion, by Jeremiah J. Garretson, NYU Press, 352 pages, $35

It shows how gay and lesbian enclaves stabilized in certain urban centers, such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York, in the wake of the Stonewall riots. It looks at the social conservative backlash led by the singer Anita Bryant and other evangelical activists, and it documents how the LGBT community forged a sense of common identity in opposition to the persecution. (In the 1970s, for instance, gay bars boycotted Florida oranges and took the orange juice–based screwdriver off their menus because Bryant was a brand ambassador for the state's Citrus Commission.)

Building a community helped gays and lesbians win support from the politicians who represented their enclaves, albeit at a still mostly local level. An important early victory came in 1978, with the defeat of Proposition 6, the ""Briggs Initiative,"" which would have barred gays and lesbians from teaching in California public schools. Meanwhile, nonpolitical gay- and lesbian-themed organizations—from swim clubs to dental referral services—helped integrate more people into the community.

All this was the starting point for the LGBT movement. But Garretson argues that the tipping point was, paradoxically, the community's darkest period: the AIDS crisis, which pushed people out of the closet and into activism in unprecedented numbers.

Garretson arrives at this conclusion by way of a theory of ""affective liberalization."" A person's view of a social group, he argues, is influenced far more by his or her emotional reaction, or affect, than by facts and logic. As the AIDS crisis propelled more gays and lesbians to live openly, the proportion of Americans who were aware that they knew a member of that group ballooned. A personal connection with a homosexual colleague, friend, or family member—or even just seeing a recurring LGBT character on mainstream TV—helped build sympathy over time.

One prevailing misconception among political scientists is that politicians voicing more tolerant views on LGBT issues drove changing attitudes among the general public. Garretson uses decades of survey data and dozens of regression analyses to show that, in fact, greater exposure to gays and lesbians led to more positive attitudes regardless of how much attention a person paid to so-called elite opinion makers.

Garretson also makes a strong case that younger generations are more supportive of gay rights not because of their youth per se but because there were more ""out"" people around them during their formative years. While older Americans have grown increasingly sympathetic to this population as they've come to know gays and lesbians, that new affect still clashes with pre-existing notions forged during the decades when most LGBT people stayed in the closet. Younger Americans are less likely to have such hangups.

That doesn't mean politics didn't matter. Garretson argues that activism was another important piece of the puzzle. Groups like the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) shifted the media narrative and put pressure on government, forcing a national debate around LGBT issues that would not have otherwise materialized.

ACT UP and similar groups pressured The New York Times to print more information on the AIDS crisis and staged ""die-ins"" at the Food and Drug Administration to protest the over-regulation that lengthened approval times for anti-AIDS drugs. Groups such as Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York coupled these external demands with efforts to spread information that would help prevent HIV transmission. For the first time, the general public saw the gay movement not just as victims of persecution but as a community of real people demanding their rights and working to take care of their friends and loved ones during difficult times.

In 1992, presidential candidate Bill Clinton addressed a crowd of LGBT supporters at a campaign rally in Hollywood and promised to support a variety of causes important to them. He dared to attend that event, and broke new ground in doing so, because gays and lesbians had built a group consciousness through their AIDS activism. They had organized enough to become a serious political bloc with something to offer a national coalition. Turning out in large numbers meant politicians had a reason to compete for LGBT support in primaries. Debates over the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy and the Defense of Marriage Act continued the conversation, prompting more people to come out in a positive feedback loop of increasing public support.

The Path to Gay Rights thus lends credence to bottom-up models of social change, showing that the spontaneous order of thousands of individual interactions created the conditions for elites to finally support gay rights, not the other way around. Consciously or not, the book also echoes public choice theory, which argues that political leaders don't alter their stances simply because a large number of their constituents favor something. Lawmakers didn't automatically change their tune as baseline support for the gay and lesbian community rose in many parts of the country. It took incessant pressure by LGBT interest groups to pressure politicians to take the risk of supporting the protections they sought. For gays and lesbians, as for any other group, nothing moves in politics that isn't pushed.

The Path to Gay Rights doesn't limit its scope to the United States. Garretson finds that the gap in support for gay rights is far greater between liberal and illiberal countries (broadly speaking) than between the left and right in the West. And liberalization is linked to a country's wealth. People who were born in 1920 have similarly negative views on homosexuality regardless of where they live—but citizens of countries with higher per capita GDPs express significantly more positive views the closer they were born to the present. Similar results appear in countries with greater numbers of influential political parties, and these effects are even stronger in countries with freer presses and more TVs per capita.

Building person-to-person empathy was central to LGBT progress. Perhaps that's how freedom will advance elsewhere as well.",www.reason.com,right,wEHml4XpvtOlZwdM

BOISE, Idaho — A federal magistrate judge ruled Tuesday that Idaho’s ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional.

U.S. District Magistrate Judge Candy Dale wrote in the decision that Idaho’s laws banning same-sex marriage unconstitutionally deny gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry.

Story Continued Below

Dale said marriage works a fundamental change on the lives of all who experience it, and it holds immense personal and spiritual significance.

Idaho’s laws wrongly stigmatize gay and lesbian couples and relegate their families to second-class status without sufficient reason, she said.

Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter already has said he intends to appeal the case.

“In 2006, the people of Idaho exercised their fundamental right, reaffirming that marriage is the union of a man and a woman,” Otter said in a statement. “Today’s decision, while disappointing, is a small setback in a long-term battle that will end at the U.S. Supreme Court. I am firmly committed to upholding the will of the people and defending our Constitution.”

Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden said he would consult with the governor on the state’s appeal.

Four Idaho couples filed the lawsuit challenging the marriage ban in November, against the governor and Ada County Clerk Chris Rich. The couples are Sue Latta and Traci Ehlers; Lori and Sharene Watsen; Shelia Robertson and Andrea Altmayer; and Amber Beierle and Rachael Robertson.

Latta and Ehlers married in 2008 in California, and the Watsens married in 2011 in New York. Both couples have children and say Idaho wrongly treats Ehlers as a legal stranger to her grandchildren and requires Lori Watsen to obtain a new power of attorney every six months so she can have legal authority to consent to medical treatment for her son.

Facing widespread pressure , including from big businesses such as Apple and Wal-Mart , lawmakers in Indiana and Arkansas rolled back their states ' new religious objections laws , which critics said could be used to discriminate against gays . Amid the uproar , the Republican governors of Michigan and South Dakota urged their own legislatures to extend anti-discrimination protections to gays .
Twenty-nine states currently do n't include protections for gays and lesbians in their non-discrimination laws , according to the American Civil Liberties Union . But the Indiana and Arkansas laws , along with court rulings or legislatures legalizing same-sex marriage in 37 states and an expected U.S. Supreme Court decision on gay marriage this year , are fueling efforts to change that as the 2016 elections approach .
`` We 're not going to let any of these people off the hot seat , '' said Kathy Sarris , co-founder of the gay-rights group Indiana Equality Action . `` This ultimately is going to happen in Indiana . ''
Most of the states without sexual orientation protections are in the South or the Plains , which tend to be more conservative . As public opinion has become more supportive of same-sex marriage and other gay rights in recent years , many businesses say such protections factor into their decisions about expansions and help them attract top employees .
Arkansas state Rep. Warwick Sabin , a Democrat from Little Rock , said the issue is n't going away .
`` Other states are moving ahead of us and Arkansas is being left in the dust . We need to make an affirmative statement about our values as a state , and I know that the vast majority of Arkansans believe in fairness and opportunity for all of its citizens , '' he said .
Indiana 's Republican-controlled Legislature took a first step by adding language to its new religious objections law stating that service providers ca n't use the law as a legal defense for refusing to provide goods , services , facilities or accommodations based on sexual orientation , gender identity and other factors . It is now the first Indiana state law that explicitly mentions sexual orientation and gender identity .
Arkansas ' amended law only addresses actions by the government , not by businesses or individuals . The law 's supporters say the changes would prevent businesses from using it to deny services to individuals , even though it does n't include specific anti-discrimination language similar to Indiana 's law .
Gay rights proponents want Arkansas to go further , though , and are trying to build support for adding sexual orientation to the protected statuses covered by the state 's civil rights laws . The state 's attorney general , Leslie Rutledge , last week approved the wording of a proposed ballot measure that would add such protections , clearing the way for supporters to begin gathering the signatures needed to get it on the November 2016 ballot .
`` Today , LGBT Arkansans are still unequal , and today 's battle points toward a broader struggle ahead — a fight where full and complete equality for all Arkansans that can not be undermined is the only acceptable outcome , '' Chad Griffin , president of the Human Rights Campaign , the nation 's largest LGBT rights group , said in a statement after Republican Gov . Asa Hutchinson signed that state 's law .
Hutchinson , meanwhile , has left open the possibility of issuing an executive order that would prohibit workplace discrimination against lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people at state agencies .
Similar debates are going on elsewhere . In North Dakota on Thursday the Republican-controlled Legislature voted down a measure that would have prohibited discrimination based on a person 's sexual orientation in the areas of housing and employment . Gov . Jack Dalrymple rebuked lawmakers , saying such discrimination was n't acceptable .
In Michigan , meanwhile , GOP Gov . Rick Snyder warned legislators that he would veto a religious objections bill unless they also sent him a measure that would extend anti-discrimination protections to gays . He cited the Indiana outcry in making his warning .

Eric Miller , the executive director of an Indiana group , Advance America , called the national outcry over the state 's law an `` orchestrated effort of misinformation '' led by those pushing for `` government recognition , government approval , adding to our civil-rights laws protections for sexual orientation and gender identity . ''","Gay rights advocates are hoping to parlay the momentum from their legislative victories in Indiana and Arkansas this week into further expanding legal protections for gays and lesbians in those states and others.

Facing widespread pressure, including from big businesses such as Apple and Wal-Mart, lawmakers in Indiana and Arkansas rolled back their states' new religious objections laws, which critics said could be used to discriminate against gays. Amid the uproar, the Republican governors of Michigan and South Dakota urged their own legislatures to extend anti-discrimination protections to gays.

Twenty-nine states currently don't include protections for gays and lesbians in their non-discrimination laws, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. But the Indiana and Arkansas laws, along with court rulings or legislatures legalizing same-sex marriage in 37 states and an expected U.S. Supreme Court decision on gay marriage this year, are fueling efforts to change that as the 2016 elections approach.

""We're not going to let any of these people off the hot seat,"" said Kathy Sarris, co-founder of the gay-rights group Indiana Equality Action. ""This ultimately is going to happen in Indiana.""

Most of the states without sexual orientation protections are in the South or the Plains, which tend to be more conservative. As public opinion has become more supportive of same-sex marriage and other gay rights in recent years, many businesses say such protections factor into their decisions about expansions and help them attract top employees.

Arkansas state Rep. Warwick Sabin, a Democrat from Little Rock, said the issue isn't going away.

""Other states are moving ahead of us and Arkansas is being left in the dust. We need to make an affirmative statement about our values as a state, and I know that the vast majority of Arkansans believe in fairness and opportunity for all of its citizens,"" he said.

Indiana's Republican-controlled Legislature took a first step by adding language to its new religious objections law stating that service providers can't use the law as a legal defense for refusing to provide goods, services, facilities or accommodations based on sexual orientation, gender identity and other factors. It is now the first Indiana state law that explicitly mentions sexual orientation and gender identity.

Arkansas' amended law only addresses actions by the government, not by businesses or individuals. The law's supporters say the changes would prevent businesses from using it to deny services to individuals, even though it doesn't include specific anti-discrimination language similar to Indiana's law.

Gay rights proponents want Arkansas to go further, though, and are trying to build support for adding sexual orientation to the protected statuses covered by the state's civil rights laws. The state's attorney general, Leslie Rutledge, last week approved the wording of a proposed ballot measure that would add such protections, clearing the way for supporters to begin gathering the signatures needed to get it on the November 2016 ballot.

""Today, LGBT Arkansans are still unequal, and today's battle points toward a broader struggle ahead — a fight where full and complete equality for all Arkansans that cannot be undermined is the only acceptable outcome,"" Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBT rights group, said in a statement after Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed that state's law.

Hutchinson, meanwhile, has left open the possibility of issuing an executive order that would prohibit workplace discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people at state agencies.

Similar debates are going on elsewhere. In North Dakota on Thursday the Republican-controlled Legislature voted down a measure that would have prohibited discrimination based on a person's sexual orientation in the areas of housing and employment. Gov. Jack Dalrymple rebuked lawmakers, saying such discrimination wasn't acceptable.

In Michigan, meanwhile, GOP Gov. Rick Snyder warned legislators that he would veto a religious objections bill unless they also sent him a measure that would extend anti-discrimination protections to gays. He cited the Indiana outcry in making his warning.

Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and fellow Republicans maintained that the state's religious objections law never sanctioned discrimination against anyone. They said considering changes to the state's civil rights law was too major of a policy change to take up with less than a month left in the legislative session.

State Senate President David Long acknowledged ""it's probably likely"" that extending anti-discrimination laws to cover sexual orientation will be on next year's agenda.

""You can see that this discussion has been elevated in Indiana and it's an important one,"" Long said.

Some gay-rights supporters say the push for religious freedom laws proposed in about a dozen states this year amounts to a consolation prize for conservatives dismayed over the legalization of same-sex marriages across much of the country.

Some conservative activists have a different take.

The Proposition 8 ballot initiative was approved by California voters in 2008 and overturned a state Supreme Court decision allowing gay marriage . Twenty-nine other states have constitutional amendments banning gay marriage , while nine states and Washington , D.C. , recognize same-sex marriage .

But administration officials said Obama -- a former constitutional law professor -- was not foreshadowing any legal action in his remarks and was simply restating his personal belief in the right of gays and lesbians to marry .
Seeking to capitalize on growing public support for gay marriage , advocates are calling on the administration to file a broad brief not only asking the court to declare California 's ban unconstitutional but also urging the Justices to make all state bans illegal .
`` If they do make that argument and the court accepts it , the ramifications could be very sweeping , '' said Richard Socarides , an attorney and advocate .
The administration could also file a narrower brief that would ask the court to issue a decision applying only to California . Or it could decide not to weigh in on the case at all .
The Supreme Court , which will take up the case on March 26 , has several options for its eventual ruling . Among them :
-- The justices could uphold the state ban on gay marriage and say citizens of a state have the right to make that call .
-- The court could endorse an appeals court ruling that would make same-sex marriage legal in California but apply only to that state .
-- The court could issue a broader ruling that would apply to California and seven other states : Delaware , Hawaii , Illinois , Nevada , New Jersey , Oregon and Rhode Island . In those states , gay couples can join in civil unions that have all the benefits of marriage but can not be married .
-- The broadest ruling would be one that says the Constitution forbids states from banning same-sex unions .
For weeks , supporters and opponents of Proposition 8 have been lobbying the administration to side with them .
Last month , Theodore Olson and David Boies , lawyers arguing for gay marriage , met with Verrilli and other government lawyers to urge the administration to file a brief in the case . A few days later , Charles Cooper , the lawyer defending Proposition 8 , met with the solicitor general to ask the government to stay out of the case . Those kinds of meetings are typical in a high court case when the government is not a party and is not asked by the court to make its views known .
Boies and Chad Griffin , president of the advocacy group Human Rights Campaign , also had a meeting at the White House on the case .
Ahead of next week 's deadline , nearly two dozen states have filed briefs with the Supreme Court asking the Justices to uphold the California measure .
`` There 's a critical mass of states that have spoken out and believe states should continue to have the right to define marriage as between one man and one woman , '' said Jim Campbell , legal counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom , which represents supporters of Proposition 8 .
Public opinion has shifted in support of gay marriage in recent years . In May 2008 , Gallup found that 56 percent of Americans felt same-sex marriages should not be recognized by the law as valid . By November 2012 , some 53 percent felt they should be legally recognized .
Obama has overwhelming political support among those who support same-sex marriage . Exit polls from the November election showed that 49 percent of voters believed their states should legally recognize gay marriage . More than 70 percent of those voters backed Obama over Republican nominee Mitt Romney .
One day after the court hears the California case , the justices will hear arguments on another gay marriage case , this one involving provisions of the federal Defense of Marriage Act , known as DOMA . The act defines marriage as between a man and a woman for the purpose of deciding who can receive a range of federal benefits .
The Obama administration abandoned its defense of the law in 2011 but continues to enforce it . Because DOMA is a federal law and the government is a party to the case , the administration does not have to state its opposition through a friend of the court brief .","The Obama administration is considering urging the Supreme Court to overturn California's ban on gay marriage -- a move that could have a far-reaching impact on same-sex couples across the country.

For weeks, supporters and opponents of Proposition 8 have been lobbying the administration to side with them.

Last month, Theodore Olson and David Boies, lawyers arguing for gay marriage, met with Verrilli and other government lawyers to urge the administration to file a brief in the case. A few days later, Charles Cooper, the lawyer defending Proposition 8, met with the solicitor general to ask the government to stay out of the case. Those kinds of meetings are typical in a high court case when the government is not a party and is not asked by the court to make its views known.

Boies and Chad Griffin, president of the advocacy group Human Rights Campaign, also had a meeting at the White House on the case.

Ahead of next week's deadline, nearly two dozen states have filed briefs with the Supreme Court asking the Justices to uphold the California measure.

""There's a critical mass of states that have spoken out and believe states should continue to have the right to define marriage as between one man and one woman,"" said Jim Campbell, legal counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents supporters of Proposition 8.

Public opinion has shifted in support of gay marriage in recent years. In May 2008, Gallup found that 56 percent of Americans felt same-sex marriages should not be recognized by the law as valid. By November 2012, some 53 percent felt they should be legally recognized.

Obama has overwhelming political support among those who support same-sex marriage. Exit polls from the November election showed that 49 percent of voters believed their states should legally recognize gay marriage. More than 70 percent of those voters backed Obama over Republican nominee Mitt Romney.

One day after the court hears the California case, the justices will hear arguments on another gay marriage case, this one involving provisions of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA. The act defines marriage as between a man and a woman for the purpose of deciding who can receive a range of federal benefits.

The Obama administration abandoned its defense of the law in 2011 but continues to enforce it. Because DOMA is a federal law and the government is a party to the case, the administration does not have to state its opposition through a friend of the court brief.",www.foxnews.com,right,bd4Pyelpx0PMeePM

Now it 's become the unlikely center of protest against a new set of harsh laws enacted by the Islamic country of Brunei .
The opulent hotel is part of the Dorchester Collection , a luxury chain owned by the Sultan of Brunei . This week , the tiny , oil-rich southeast Asian country set off a storm of celebrity protests and boycotts by introducing Islamic laws that include death by stoning for gays and adulterers .
Since last month , 20 events have been canceled at the Beverly Hills property—a loss of about $ 2 million in revenue for the hotel , according to Dorchester . Local politicians and celebrities are also boycotting the nearby Hotel Bel Air in Los Angeles , the hotel 's more subdued sister property .
Big names like Jay Leno and Ellen DeGeneres are urging boycotts , and the Beverly Hills mayor and council are calling for Dorchester to sell the hotel .
Dorchester , which runs 10 hotels world-wide , is looking to expand globally and has said it is seeking to acquire a luxury property in New York .

Dorchester 's London-based chief executive , Christopher Cowdray —who was in Los Angeles this week to speak to hotel employees and customers and to try to quell the political backlash—said that Dorchester 's hotels are a big employer , pay taxes and abide by `` the laws of the countries in which we operate .

More than 100 hotel employees—from housekeepers to Mr. Cowdray , the Dorchester CEO—packed the raucous city council meeting .

One hotel employee said she has been able to pay for her grandmother 's care in Vietnam . She said she has noticed `` a steep drop '' in visitors . `` It 's not just breaking our hearts…it strangles our livelihood , '' she said .

Well, that didn’t take long. Doll, Brynn and Kitten Young, a lesbian trio, have declared themselves the world’s first “throuple.” The Massachusetts women claim to be “married” and await their first child. Massachusetts doesn’t recognize “throuple marriage” yet, but the year is young. When the Supreme Court eviscerated authentic marriage last year, this was foretold. There’s already an organized movement, led by college professors, for what might be called “grouple” marriage.

The British tabloids report that Doll, 30, and Brynn, 34, were dating for 2 years when they met Kitten, 27, through a website for couples who think two is at least one too few. The trio tied the “knot” last year. “In our eyes, we’re married,” Brynn told The London Sun. “We had specialist lawyers draw up paperwork so our assets are equally divided.”

Kitten is now pregnant with the first of the three children they’re hoping to raise together. No word yet on who the father might be.

Unusual series of oral arguments in a federal appeals courtroom in Ohio

Gay rights supporters in the midst of legal winning streak

A prominent conservative judge expressed concerns Tuesday about whether Michigan's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage was constitutional, saying that given ""modern conceptions of marriage,"" the state's law seems ""harder to justify.""

The remarks came during an unusual series of oral arguments played out over one afternoon at the federal appeals court in Cincinnati.

A three-judge panel 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals heard lawyers from four states defend their same-sex marriage bans, in a dramatic series of consecutive cases from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee.

In the first petition from Michigan, Judge Jeffrey Sutton had tough questions for the state's solicitor general.

""What do we do about a reality that marriage -- it changes with social mores?"" asked Sutton from the bench.

""And maybe, originally, marriage was about encouraging procreation ... but modern conceptions of marriage are more about love, affection, and commitment. And when you think of that way, it does seem a little harder to justify, even on rational basis grounds,"" he said.

A winning streak

Sutton, who was named to the court by President George W. Bush, added: ""If you think about marriage just through that at lens — love, affection, commitment-- it does start to get gets a little difficult to see the difference between the one group eligible (to marry) and the other group not.""

The appeals panel could extend a remarkable winning streak for gay rights supporters, after state and federal judges in about two dozen cases have struck down same-sex marriage bans in the past year.

This after the Supreme Court in June 2013 tossed out a key part of a federal law defining marriage as only between one man and one woman.

Four separate rulings

The current intermediate review stage will produce four separate written rulings in coming weeks. Appeals of one or all of those state bans will likely end up at the Supreme Court.

There the justices could finally answer whether same-sex couples have a constitutional equal protection right that must be applied in every state, including the 31 with current bans.

Federal appeals courts have already struck down similar bans in Utah, Oklahoma, and Virginia in recent weeks.

Two of the three judges on the panel this week were appointed by Republican presidents, leading to predictions they would uphold state bans.

The judicial panel was tough on both sides, particularly Sutton, who ask probing questions of lawyers representing various gay and lesbian couples seeking the right to wed, or to have their home states recognize valid out-of-state marriages.

""If respect and dignity (for gay couples) are critical elements here, I would have thought the best way to get respect and dignity is through the democratic process,"" said Sutton, citing those states that have chosen to change the law in the past decade.

Conservative argument

He suggested taking the challenge in the courts was not the best strategy.

""Don't you think you're more likely to change hearts and minds through the democratic process, than you are with the decision of five justices on the Supreme Court? Assuming you can win on this, why do you want that route?"" he asked.

That has been the argument many conservative activists have made in preserving the marriage status quo.

Michigan's Solicitor General Aaron Lindstrom defended the current ban, saying ""It's rational for the state to have an interest in promoting marriage, so it will be more likely a child will have both a mother and father, and will have the benefits of having both a mother and a father.

But Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey, named to the bench by President Clinton, jumped in.

""But what is the rational basis of excluding everybody else? It doesn't interfere with the procreation of children just because you've got two people of the same sex marrying in and in some of those marriages, one of the partners is able to procreate.""

Complete discretion

And when Lindstrom said the state had an interest ensuring ""procreation occurs in long-term committed relationships between opposite sex couples,"" the judge seemed unconvinced.

""Isn't that a little hypocritical,"" said Daughtrey, ""to allow people to marry who can't procreate, but prevent same sex partners from marrying, and in some of those marriages, one of the partners is able to procreate?""

The nine members of the high court have complete discretion to accept or deny any case presented to them.

Their recent precedents however, give unbridled optimism to many in the gay rights and civil rights communities they will at least get their day in court. A sweeping judicial victory may be tantalizingly close.

""You never know how any Supreme Court case is going to be resolved, especially when the stakes are this high, but the challengers definitely have the upper hand,"" said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a prominent Washington attorney.

Also argued Tuesday was Kentucky's ban. The commonwealth's Democratic Gov. Steven Beshear hired outside lawyers to defend the ban on recognizing out-of-state same-sex marriages, after his attorney general tearfully refused in March to take part in any further legal challenges.

More than 70 lawsuits

By CNN's count, there are more than 70 same-sex marriage lawsuits pending in every state with a current ban. North Dakota this spring becoming the latest, and last, to have one filed in court, on behalf of seven homosexual couples.

The Supreme Court could historically alter how marriage is treated under a legal framework, potentially striking down every current same-sex marriage ban. Or the justices could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place, allowing state legislatures and state courts to sort it all out, for now.

Instead, They Were Sent To Guatemala.",,Hamed Aleaziz,"Guatemalan men walk from a deportation flight after being sent back from the United States on May 30 , 2019 , in Guatemala City .
Pablo , who requested to use a pseudonym for fear of threats , was quickly thrust into the Trump administration ’ s new “ safe third country ” program . Border officials selected him , gave him a form that said he was eligible for a policy sending asylum-seekers to Guatemala , and afforded him a short phone call with an asylum officer who reviewed his case .
The immigrants were told they could no longer gain protection in the US . They would have to settle in Guatemala , a country also racked by poverty , violence , and instability , whose own citizens made up a sizable portion of those arrested at the southern border last year .
Pablo , 23 , had hoped to find safety and start a new life in the US . What he did not know when he was arrested after crossing the border into Texas in December was that he had placed himself on the front lines of an unprecedented effort by the Trump administration to dissuade immigrants from El Salvador and Honduras from seeking asylum in the US .
Sitting in a jet streaming toward Guatemala , watching the landscape shift below , Pablo replayed the scenes that had led to this moment . He recalled the day he fled his home in El Salvador rather than face the danger he felt being a gay man . He considered the sacrifices he had made over the yearlong journey to the United States–Mexico border .
He said he tried to explain to the officer that he had not only already traveled through Guatemala on his way to the US but had faced harassment there . He told the officer he didn ’ t want to go back .
Pablo was still hopeful , he said , as he waited in government custody in mid-December . He had heard of others , including his cousin , who had crossed into the US earlier in the year and were eventually released and given the chance to make their asylum case in front of an immigration judge . But that hope evaporated the moment he was led to a government plane , accompanied by other asylum-seekers from El Salvador and Honduras .
“ It ’ s all a big farce , ” he said in an interview . “ Why ? I was feeling really deceived — all of my sacrifice had been in vain . Now I ’ m being thrown to Guatemala [ where I won ’ t be protected ] . I was feeling broken about the situation . ”
Pablo spoke to ███ from a home in Jalisco , Mexico , where he is waiting after fleeing Guatemala . Now he hopes to get back to the US through a different route : as the lead plaintiff in a high-stakes lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigrant Justice Center that seeks to block the implementation of the Guatemala policy and allow those already sent there to return to the US .
The experience of Pablo and others who spoke to ███ is a window into one of the most unusual and severe immigration programs implemented by a president who has said he wants Congress to “ get rid of the whole asylum system . ”
Confusion and panic surrounding key aspects of the policy — like how asylum-seekers can bypass being sent to Guatemala — has spread to not only those in custody but also attorneys along the border and elsewhere . Asylum officers who spoke with ███ said it ’ s nearly impossible for people to avoid the program by proving they will face danger in Guatemala .
Pablo has spent his entire young adulthood in search of safety , peace , and a place where he can be open about his sexual orientation . He left El Salvador because his life was in danger , and he knew Guatemala and Mexico were similarly dangerous for him as a gay man , said Keren Zwick , litigation director at the NIJC .
“ Like so many people who have been shut out from safety by this administration , Pablo believed the United States would provide him safety , ” she said .
The Trump administration has so far deported more than 300 people , including families , from El Salvador and Honduras to Guatemala since the safe third country program was launched in late November . The administration has hailed the effort , one of many to restrict asylum , as part of the reason why numbers of those arrested at the border continue to dip .
Senior administration officials have also framed the policy as an opportunity for asylum-seekers to seek protection closer to their home countries .
“ We are building protections that will be available to the region ’ s vulnerable populations closer to home — eliminating the need to make the dangerous journey north and lining the pockets of transnational criminal organizations , ” acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said in December .
DHS officials say the asylum-seekers are fine with going to Guatemala : “ All asylum-seekers who are sent to Guatemala have chosen to go , ” an agency spokesperson said .
But attorneys representing those sent there say the choice is a false one : Asylum applicants are told they can either be deported to the country they fled or go to Guatemala .
“ This is not a true ‘ choice. ’ The plaintiffs in the case , as well as others we interviewed , made it plain that the option of remaining in the United States to seek asylum was never presented as a viable option , ” Zwick said .
And privately , US Citizenship and Immigration Services asylum officers have raised concerns with not only being involved with the program — something several have called a violation of human rights — but whether Guatemala has the infrastructure to adequately screen asylum cases and protect those who arrive . For other officers , the idea that asylum-seekers are being sent to a country where more than 200,000 of its own citizens fled to the US–Mexico border last year is shocking .
“ This program generally does not allow applicants to access attorneys , does not provide information on how to access legal support , does not provide extensive information on their rights in the process , it does not provide extra care or consideration to people who speak Spanish as a second language , ” said one asylum officer , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren ’ t authorized to speak publicly on the matter . “ The US government needs to seriously consider if perpetrating human rights violations [ of asylum seekers ] is worth reducing the number of people who are paroled into the US . ”
Even the US government 's own training materials for officers detail the perils people face in Guatemala , including gangs , violence , and killings with “ high levels of impunity. ” The guide , which was obtained by ███ , relies primarily on public sources : academic publications , news reports , and research from Human Rights Watch and other organizations .
One section of the resource guide links to a 2012 report by the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission , which states that LGBTQ people in Guatemala suffer “ cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment , including a constant threat of violence that amounts to torture , forced disappearances , sexual violence in detention centres and non-consensual medical testing . ”
Pablo saw the nascent asylum infrastructure in Guatemala firsthand when he was sent there one morning in mid-December .

Pablo, who requested to use a pseudonym for fear of threats, was quickly thrust into the Trump administration’s new “safe third country” program. Border officials selected him, gave him a form that said he was eligible for a policy sending asylum-seekers to Guatemala, and afforded him a short phone call with an asylum officer who reviewed his case.

The immigrants were told they could no longer gain protection in the US. They would have to settle in Guatemala, a country also racked by poverty, violence, and instability, whose own citizens made up a sizable portion of those arrested at the southern border last year.

Pablo, 23, had hoped to find safety and start a new life in the US. What he did not know when he was arrested after crossing the border into Texas in December was that he had placed himself on the front lines of an unprecedented effort by the Trump administration to dissuade immigrants from El Salvador and Honduras from seeking asylum in the US.

Sitting in a jet streaming toward Guatemala, watching the landscape shift below, Pablo replayed the scenes that had led to this moment. He recalled the day he fled his home in El Salvador rather than face the danger he felt being a gay man. He considered the sacrifices he had made over the yearlong journey to the United States–Mexico border.

He said he tried to explain to the officer that he had not only already traveled through Guatemala on his way to the US but had faced harassment there. He told the officer he didn’t want to go back.

Pablo was still hopeful, he said, as he waited in government custody in mid-December. He had heard of others, including his cousin, who had crossed into the US earlier in the year and were eventually released and given the chance to make their asylum case in front of an immigration judge. But that hope evaporated the moment he was led to a government plane, accompanied by other asylum-seekers from El Salvador and Honduras.

“It’s all a big farce,” he said in an interview. “Why? I was feeling really deceived — all of my sacrifice had been in vain. Now I’m being thrown to Guatemala [where I won’t be protected]. I was feeling broken about the situation.”

Pablo spoke to BuzzFeed News from a home in Jalisco, Mexico, where he is waiting after fleeing Guatemala. Now he hopes to get back to the US through a different route: as the lead plaintiff in a high-stakes lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigrant Justice Center that seeks to block the implementation of the Guatemala policy and allow those already sent there to return to the US.

The experience of Pablo and others who spoke to BuzzFeed News is a window into one of the most unusual and severe immigration programs implemented by a president who has said he wants Congress to “get rid of the whole asylum system.”

Confusion and panic surrounding key aspects of the policy — like how asylum-seekers can bypass being sent to Guatemala — has spread to not only those in custody but also attorneys along the border and elsewhere. Asylum officers who spoke with BuzzFeed News said it’s nearly impossible for people to avoid the program by proving they will face danger in Guatemala.

Pablo has spent his entire young adulthood in search of safety, peace, and a place where he can be open about his sexual orientation. He left El Salvador because his life was in danger, and he knew Guatemala and Mexico were similarly dangerous for him as a gay man, said Keren Zwick, litigation director at the NIJC.

“Like so many people who have been shut out from safety by this administration, Pablo believed the United States would provide him safety,” she said.

The Trump administration has so far deported more than 300 people, including families, from El Salvador and Honduras to Guatemala since the safe third country program was launched in late November. The administration has hailed the effort, one of many to restrict asylum, as part of the reason why numbers of those arrested at the border continue to dip.

Senior administration officials have also framed the policy as an opportunity for asylum-seekers to seek protection closer to their home countries.

“We are building protections that will be available to the region’s vulnerable populations closer to home — eliminating the need to make the dangerous journey north and lining the pockets of transnational criminal organizations,” acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said in December.

DHS officials say the asylum-seekers are fine with going to Guatemala: “All asylum-seekers who are sent to Guatemala have chosen to go,” an agency spokesperson said.

But attorneys representing those sent there say the choice is a false one: Asylum applicants are told they can either be deported to the country they fled or go to Guatemala.

“This is not a true ‘choice.’ The plaintiffs in the case, as well as others we interviewed, made it plain that the option of remaining in the United States to seek asylum was never presented as a viable option,” Zwick said.

And privately, US Citizenship and Immigration Services asylum officers have raised concerns with not only being involved with the program — something several have called a violation of human rights — but whether Guatemala has the infrastructure to adequately screen asylum cases and protect those who arrive. For other officers, the idea that asylum-seekers are being sent to a country where more than 200,000 of its own citizens fled to the US–Mexico border last year is shocking.

“This program generally does not allow applicants to access attorneys, does not provide information on how to access legal support, does not provide extensive information on their rights in the process, it does not provide extra care or consideration to people who speak Spanish as a second language,” said one asylum officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter. “The US government needs to seriously consider if perpetrating human rights violations [of asylum seekers] is worth reducing the number of people who are paroled into the US.”

Even the US government's own training materials for officers detail the perils people face in Guatemala, including gangs, violence, and killings with “high levels of impunity.” The guide, which was obtained by BuzzFeed News, relies primarily on public sources: academic publications, news reports, and research from Human Rights Watch and other organizations.

One section of the resource guide links to a 2012 report by the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, which states that LGBTQ people in Guatemala suffer “cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, including a constant threat of violence that amounts to torture, forced disappearances, sexual violence in detention centres and non-consensual medical testing.”

Pablo saw the nascent asylum infrastructure in Guatemala firsthand when he was sent there one morning in mid-December. Local officials provided him and others on his flight an ultimatum: They could either seek asylum in the country or be given transportation to their home countries of Honduras or El Salvador. They had 72 hours to decide.

The last time he had come to Guatemala in 2018 on his way to the southern border, he and his cousin were harassed as they waited for a bus.

“They called us gay and a number of other words. They told us we ruined the ambience just for being there,” Pablo recalled.

After being processed by Guatemalan officials this time, he was taken to a local shelter where he was given food and the opportunity to stay.

Even then, the housing would not be permanent. The organization that ran the shelter, whose members told him to be careful outside their facility, could help him for a month or two — but afterward he would need to find his own housing, Pablo said.

At one point, Pablo asked a local immigration official if he could leave for Mexico to visit his partner.

“You should seek protection there,” he said the immigration official told him. “Guatemala has nothing to offer you.”

Before he left, Pablo connected with NIJC attorneys who asked if he wanted to join others like him in a lawsuit challenging the Trump program.

“The government denied plaintiffs and others like them the opportunity to speak to counsel or even family in the United States before deporting them to a country that is not their own, and most were in the United States for just a period of days,” Zwick said. “This strategy is an intentional, strategic choice that makes challenging these procedures difficult. NIJC was only able to meet [Pablo] and other plaintiffs by sending staff to Guatemala to catch them in the brief period before they were abruptly returned to their home countries.”

On the ground in El Paso, immigration attorneys are looking to help those forced into the program. Asylum-seekers do not have the right to have an attorney during the screening process to determine whether they can avoid being sent to Guatemala due to established fears of torture or persecution there.

Nevertheless, Linda Corchado, an immigration attorney in El Paso, located and represented Josué, a 20-year-old man from Honduras who was initially taken into US custody around Jan. 14.

Known as DOMA , the law bars federal benefits for legally married same-sex couples , even though those same benefits are automatically given to heterosexual married couples .
The second same-sex marriage case to be argued in as many days , the DOMA challenge was brought by Edith Windsor , whose marriage to Thea Spyer was legal in New York . But when Spyer died , Windsor had to pay $ 363,000 in federal estate taxes that she would not have had to pay if she had been married to a man . Windsor challenged the federal law and won in the lower courts .
The case , however , came to the Supreme Court with a procedural twist .
The Obama administration , in a rare move , declined to defend the federal law and sided with Windsor on the question of constitutionality . But the administration continued to enforce the law and appealed to the Supreme Court to rule on the issue .
At the same time , the House Republican leadership intervened in the case to defend the law . All of this produced a dilemma for the Supreme Court . In the first hour of arguments Wednesday , the question was whether the House had any right to defend the law , and if not , was there an actual disagreement between two parties that the court could resolve .
Chief Justice John Roberts harrumphed at President Obama 's decision to enforce the law while at the same time refusing to defend it in court .
`` I do n't see why he does n't have the courage of his convictions and execute not only the statute , but do it consistent with his view of the Constitution , rather than saying , 'Oh , we 'll wait till the Supreme Court tells us we have no choice , ' `` remarked Roberts .
But Justice Elena Kagan suggested that having to pay $ 363,000 in taxes is `` a classic injury . ''
Several justices asked what authority there was for the House to take over the function of defending the law .
Justice Anthony Kennedy wondered whether the Senate would have the right `` to take the other side of this case , so we have the House on one side and the Senate on the other ? ''
Justice Samuel Alito asked why it 's OK for only one house to defend the law when it takes both houses to pass a law .
The procedural back and forth finally prompted Kennedy to observe that the procedural case `` does give you intellectual whiplash . ''
But when the court moved on to the question of DOMA 's constitutionality , Kennedy repeatedly expressed the view that the law , by not deferring to the state definition of marriage , inappropriately steps on the states ' toes .
When the federal government `` has 1,100 laws , which in our society means that the federal government is intertwined with the citizens ' day-to-day life , you are at real risk of running into conflict '' with the states ' traditional power to regulate marriage , said Kennedy .
Not so , contended Paul Clement , the lawyer hired by House leadership to defend the law . He argued that Congress ' only purpose in enacting DOMA was uniformity , and that Congress rationally concluded that `` we want to treat the same-sex couple in New York the same way as the committed same-sex couple in Oklahoma and treat them the same . ''
When Congress enacted DOMA in 1996 , it was reacting to the possibility that Hawaii would become the first state to legalize same-sex marriage , he noted .
In short , Clement said , Congress was saying , `` Wait a minute . Let 's take a timeout here . This is a redefinition of an age-old institution . Let 's take a more cautious approach where every sovereign gets to do this for themselves . ''
Justice Sonia Sotomayor did n't seem to buy that argument . `` So they can create a class they do n't like — here , homosexuals , '' and treat them differently under federal law when it is state law that deals with marriage , she asked .
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg reiterated Kennedy 's observation that with 1,100 federal laws dealing with married couples , the effect of DOMA is `` pervasive . ''
By refusing to acknowledge the state definition of marriage for homosexual couples , she said , the federal law creates `` two kinds of marriage ; the full marriage , and then this sort of skim-milk marriage . ''
If the federal government can do that for marriage , she wondered , could it also do it for divorce ?
Kagan noted that historically , the federal government has always deferred to states in their definition of marriage . DOMA , she said , does something that 's really `` never been done before . ''
`` Do we really think that Congress was doing this for uniformity reasons , or do we think that Congress ' judgment was infected by dislike , by fear , by animus and so forth ? '' she asked .
Clement maintained that the federal government has gotten involved in defining marriage — for example , insisting on the prohibition of polygamy in the states .
Kagan shot back , `` Well , is [ that ] what happened in 1996 ? '' Quoting from the House report issued at the time DOMA was enacted , Kagan read out loud , `` Congress decided to reflect and honor a collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality ? ''
The quotation drew audible groans and whispers throughout the courtroom .
After lawyer Clement sat down , Solicitor General Donald Verrilli told the justices that DOMA is quite simply discrimination .
What it does is withhold an array of federal benefits from lawfully married same-sex couples , he said . `` That means that the spouse of a soldier killed in the line of duty can not receive the dignity and solace of an official notification of next of kin . ''
Kennedy , however , seemed relatively uninterested in the discrimination argument and more interested in the question of whether the federal government can interfere with states ' rights to regulate marriage .
`` You think Congress can use its powers to supersede the traditional authority and prerogative of the states to regulate marriage in all respects ? '' asked Kennedy .
Verrilli said no , it ca n't , but the government 's position in this case is that DOMA is an unconstitutional denial of the equal protection of the law .
`` It 's time for the court to recognize that this discrimination , excluding lawfully married gay and lesbian couples from federal benefits , can not be reconciled with our fundamental commitment to equal treatment under law , '' said Verrilli .
But the solicitor general dodged the question of whether similar laws in most states would be unconstitutional .
Following Verrilli to the lectern was lawyer Roberta Kaplan , representing Windsor , the New York widow who brought the lawsuit . Justice Stephen Breyer questioned Kaplan about the argument that Congress enacted DOMA to have a uniform rule .
`` There has been this uniform , one man , one woman rule for several hundred years , and there 's a revolution going on in the states , '' he said . `` We either adopt the revolution or push it along a little , or we stay out of it . '' Breyer noted that those defending DOMA contend that in passing the law in 1996 , Congress simply decided to stay out of the controversy .
`` Congress did not stay out of it , '' Kaplan replied . She argued that DOMA is not neutral when it stops federal recognition of couples who are legally married solely because of their sexual orientation . `` It 's undermining the policy decisions made by those states that have permitted gay couples to marry , '' she said .
Roberts repeatedly questioned the notion that Congress was acting with a hostile , discriminatory motive .
`` Eighty-four senators based their vote on moral disapproval of gay people ? '' he asked Kaplan .
Some did , she said , most probably did n't , but `` times can blind , '' she declared , and back in 1996 , `` people did not have the understanding that they have today , that there is no distinction '' between homosexual and heterosexual couples .

In the wake of the Supreme Court arguments Wednesday on the Defense of Marriage Act, same-sex marriage supporters have reason to be optimistic. Known as DOMA, the law bars federal benefits for legally married same-sex couples, even though those same benefits are automatically given to heterosexual married couples.

The second same-sex marriage case to be argued in as many days, the DOMA challenge was brought by Edith Windsor, whose marriage to Thea Spyer was legal in New York. But when Spyer died, Windsor had to pay $363,000 in federal estate taxes that she would not have had to pay if she had been married to a man. Windsor challenged the federal law and won in the lower courts.

The case, however, came to the Supreme Court with a procedural twist.

The Obama administration, in a rare move, declined to defend the federal law and sided with Windsor on the question of constitutionality. But the administration continued to enforce the law and appealed to the Supreme Court to rule on the issue.

At the same time, the House Republican leadership intervened in the case to defend the law. All of this produced a dilemma for the Supreme Court. In the first hour of arguments Wednesday, the question was whether the House had any right to defend the law, and if not, was there an actual disagreement between two parties that the court could resolve.

'Intellectual Whiplash'

Chief Justice John Roberts harrumphed at President Obama's decision to enforce the law while at the same time refusing to defend it in court.

""I don't see why he doesn't have the courage of his convictions and execute not only the statute, but do it consistent with his view of the Constitution, rather than saying, 'Oh, we'll wait till the Supreme Court tells us we have no choice,' "" remarked Roberts.

But Justice Elena Kagan suggested that having to pay $363,000 in taxes is ""a classic injury.""

Several justices asked what authority there was for the House to take over the function of defending the law.

Justice Anthony Kennedy wondered whether the Senate would have the right ""to take the other side of this case, so we have the House on one side and the Senate on the other?""

Justice Samuel Alito asked why it's OK for only one house to defend the law when it takes both houses to pass a law.

The procedural back and forth finally prompted Kennedy to observe that the procedural case ""does give you intellectual whiplash.""

State Or Federal Issue?

But when the court moved on to the question of DOMA's constitutionality, Kennedy repeatedly expressed the view that the law, by not deferring to the state definition of marriage, inappropriately steps on the states' toes.

When the federal government ""has 1,100 laws, which in our society means that the federal government is intertwined with the citizens' day-to-day life, you are at real risk of running into conflict"" with the states' traditional power to regulate marriage, said Kennedy.

Not so, contended Paul Clement, the lawyer hired by House leadership to defend the law. He argued that Congress' only purpose in enacting DOMA was uniformity, and that Congress rationally concluded that ""we want to treat the same-sex couple in New York the same way as the committed same-sex couple in Oklahoma and treat them the same.""

When Congress enacted DOMA in 1996, it was reacting to the possibility that Hawaii would become the first state to legalize same-sex marriage, he noted.

In short, Clement said, Congress was saying, ""Wait a minute. Let's take a timeout here. This is a redefinition of an age-old institution. Let's take a more cautious approach where every sovereign gets to do this for themselves.""

Justice Sonia Sotomayor didn't seem to buy that argument. ""So they can create a class they don't like — here, homosexuals,"" and treat them differently under federal law when it is state law that deals with marriage, she asked.

By refusing to acknowledge the state definition of marriage for homosexual couples, she said, the federal law creates ""two kinds of marriage; the full marriage, and then this sort of skim-milk marriage.""

'Never Been Done Before'

If the federal government can do that for marriage, she wondered, could it also do it for divorce?

Kagan noted that historically, the federal government has always deferred to states in their definition of marriage. DOMA, she said, does something that's really ""never been done before.""

""Do we really think that Congress was doing this for uniformity reasons, or do we think that Congress' judgment was infected by dislike, by fear, by animus and so forth?"" she asked.

Prominent Republicans calculated that if the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage was constitutionally protected , the issue would become settled law and disappear politically . This would be welcome , they reasoned , as the party was on the wrong side of the politics and history .
Then Indiana enacted a Religious Freedom Restoration Act last month that critics said would allow private enterprises to discriminate against gays and lesbians . Arkansas followed with a similar measure .
After vehement opposition from businesses in both states , Republican governors forced modifications that make it more difficult to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation .
But a leading indicator was the reaction of Republican presidential candidates : They leapt to defend the initial Indiana law . Jeb Bush expressed all-out support in an interview on a conservative radio talk show and then modified his position at a Silicon Valley fundraiser .
Social conservatives are determined to keep this issue alive , reasoning that the environment that produced changes in the laws last week will become more favorable after they have had time to stir up the grassroots . That will pose problems for Republicans in a general election ; the politics have changed dramatically compared with a decade ago , when Republican political guru Karl Rove used the issue against Democrats .
Crucial elements of the Republican base have n't changed . Most , not all , evangelical/born-again white Christians are troubled by gay rights .

The Republican base won’t let it.

Prominent Republicans calculated that if the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage was constitutionally protected, the issue would become settled law and disappear politically. This would be welcome, they reasoned, as the party was on the wrong side of the politics and history.

Then Indiana enacted a Religious Freedom Restoration Act last month that critics said would allow private enterprises to discriminate against gays and lesbians. Arkansas followed with a similar measure.

After vehement opposition from businesses in both states, Republican governors forced modifications that make it more difficult to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.

But a leading indicator was the reaction of Republican presidential candidates: They leapt to defend the initial Indiana law. Jeb Bush expressed all-out support in an interview on a conservative radio talk show and then modified his position at a Silicon Valley fundraiser.

Social conservatives are determined to keep this issue alive, reasoning that the environment that produced changes in the laws last week will become more favorable after they have had time to stir up the grassroots. That will pose problems for Republicans in a general election; the politics have changed dramatically compared with a decade ago, when Republican political guru Karl Rove used the issue against Democrats.

Crucial elements of the Republican base haven't changed. Most, not all, evangelical/born-again white Christians are troubled by gay rights. This group accounts for more than 40 percent of the Republicans nationally and for more than 50 percent of the vote in the important early Iowa and South Carolina Republican presidential tests. That guarantees Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee will make these issues uncomfortable for Jeb Bush and Scott Walker.

At the recent Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland, the topic was mentioned far less frequently than it was in the past. But same-sex marriage supporters acknowledge it remains a difficult issue with a number of the party’s base voters, although they’ve argued for focusing on inclusion to broaden the GOP’s appeal after getting battered in the 2012 elections.

Bauer, the president of American Values, faulted a “misinformation campaign waged by media elites” and insisted that “public policy-makers are doing a great disservice to themselves and future generations by continuing to misread the convictions of the American people.” The survey “should remind political and cultural leaders that this debate is far from over.

The same-sex-marriage cases come in the face of a shift in public opinion that even opponents of same-sex marriage admit is unprecedented . Polls show that support for gay marriage has jumped from percentages in the low 40s just four years ago to majorities now as high as 58 percent . And 13 other countries , from Canada to Argentina , have legalized same-sex marriage .
California 's Proposition 8 , known simply as Prop 8 , was enacted by voter initiative in 2008 to ban same-sex marriage . Challenging the constitutionality of the ban are Kristin Perry and Sandy Stier . They have been together 13 years and raised four boys — Perry 's twins , and Stier 's two sons from a heterosexual marriage many years ago .
Perry , a children 's advocate , and Stier , a technical systems expert , got married in 2004 , when same-sex marriage was briefly legalized in San Francisco , but the marriage was later voided by the state courts .
They contend that California 's ban on same-sex marriage amounts to a badge of inferiority , a stigmatizing mark on all gay couples . `` There is no more important decision as an adult than who you choose to love and build a family with , '' Perry says . `` And I 'm not allowed to enter into that institution simply because of the gender of who I love — not because I 've done anything illegal , not because I 'm not contributing , not because I 've done anything other than end up this way . ''
Perry says that Proposition 8 not only hurts her ; it hurts her parents , her kids and her community .
The sponsors of the proposition declined to be interviewed for this piece , as did their lead lawyer , Charles Cooper . But in briefs filed in the case , Cooper defends the constitutionality of Proposition 8 this way : `` Marriage owes its existence to the undeniable biological reality that opposite-sex unions — and only such unions — can produce children . ''
Society , he says , has no interest in regulating other relationships , no matter how close . Cooper told a federal appeals court during oral arguments that `` the name of marriage is effectively the institution , and the issue here is whether it will be redefined , essentially to be genderless in that it bears little or no ... relationship to the traditional historic purpose of marriage . ''
Rebutting that argument in the Supreme Court Tuesday , lawyer Ted Olson will tell the justices that `` the ability or willingness to procreate or the interest in having children sexually has never , ever been a condition for entry into marriage anywhere in this country . ''
Olson , who represents Perry and the other challengers to Proposition 8 , notes that people too old to have children , or who do n't want to have children , have a constitutional right to marry . Even people in prison have a right to marry . And yet , as he puts it , `` The state of California is saying you can marry whoever you want , provided it must be a person of the opposite sex . ''
He argues that just as the U.S. Supreme Court struck down state laws banning marriage between people of different races , it should strike down laws banning marriage between people of the same gender .
Those defending Proposition 8 point out that the citizens of California have twice , since 2000 , voted to ban same-sex marriage . `` We are claiming that the Supreme Court should not try to remove the decision on the future of marriage from the hands of the people , that the people are sovereign , that they do have a right to maintain marriage as one man and one woman , '' says Austin Nimocks , counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom , one of the groups involved in defending Proposition 8 .
Olson replies that the 14th Amendment of the Constitution stands in the way of that argument because it guarantees all citizens equal protection of the law . It was `` specifically enacted as a check on the power of the states , '' Olson observes , `` whether exercised by the people directly , as in Proposition 8 , or by a state legislature . ''
Nimocks sees no denial of equal protection because same-sex couples have all the same legal rights as married couples under California 's domestic partnership law . But Olson dismisses that argument , asserting that it is analogous to telling African-Americans they should use separate drinking fountains or go to separate schools . Marriage , he says , `` occupies a special place in American society . '' Couples do n't `` invite their friends and throw rice and flowers and scream with joy '' when they are joined in domestic partnership .
For Proposition 8 proponents , the real heart of the argument is the notion of marriage as a mechanism to ensure that those who create children are responsible for them . As Nimocks puts it , `` The government does n't care if you love your spouse , '' but , `` It 's in society 's best interest to provide a vehicle to attach those children to the mother and father that are responsible for their creation . ''
`` Same-sex relationships historically , as compared to opposite-sex relationships , are not as stable , '' he adds . `` It 's one thing for a kid to not have a dad or not have a mom through the circumstances of life , '' but it 's quite another `` to intentionally deprive a child of a mom and a dad , and that 's the debate that 's going on , whether that 's a good and healthy thing that we as a society should embrace . ''
Olson disputes every aspect of that argument , contending that the Supreme Court has never ruled that procreation is the fundamental basis for marriage . He also points to the testimony of the principal expert witness for Proposition 8 , who `` conceded at trial '' that children in gay and lesbian families `` would be better off if their parents were allowed to get married . ''
There are 37,000 children living in same-sex households in California , and Olson contends that at trial , `` the evidence was that there is no significant distinction in the well-being of children in same-sex households as in opposite-sex households . '' What matters , he adds , `` is not the gender of the parents . It is what is in the heart of the parent . ''
The legal case to be argued Tuesday , however , is focused on what justifications , if any , the state of California has for banning same-sex marriage .
Olson argues that even under the most lenient standard — what is known as the rational basis test — the state can not justify the ban .
Under the rational basis test , a law is upheld if there is a rational reason for it . Proposition 8 lawyer Cooper told the lower court that under the rational basis test , the ban on same-sex marriage should be upheld unless `` this court concludes that there is nothing to say in favor of the definition of marriage that has prevailed in this country and in all places '' essentially since `` time immemorial . ''
Olson replies that none of the offered justifications for Proposition 8 hold water — not family , not kids , not the institution of marriage . No one , he says , has come up with any reason why same-sex marriage `` damages heterosexual marriages in any way . ''
Ultimately , he says , it is no justification to say the country has been doing something for hundreds of years , if it flies in the face of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law .
Olson will also argue that the court should use a tougher , more skeptical standard in evaluating laws that treat homosexuals and heterosexuals differently , a standard like the one used to evaluate laws that treat men and women differently .
The threshold question for the justices , however , is whether there should be any case at all , whether there is any dispute between the state and those challenging the law .

And if the Supreme Court were to agree , the lower court decision would stand , and Proposition 8 would exist no longer .
The court has many other options to choose from in deciding this case . Among the choices : It could uphold Proposition 8 as a valid exercise of the democratic process .

Outside the Supreme Court, lines began forming nearly a week ago. By Monday, the line had snaked down the court steps and to the corner, with people braving freezing temperatures and snow in anticipation of the historic arguments on same-sex marriage on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The justices are first hearing a constitutional challenge to California's ban on same-sex marriage. A second day is devoted to the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal benefits to same-sex couples married in the nine states where such unions are legal.

The two cases fall into the category of the truly momentous. So much so that Supreme Court advocate Tom Goldstein literally pounded the table when speaking to law students last month. ""This is special,"" he declared, observing that there were no cases like it when he was in law school."" This will be a ""foundational decision"" that ""is going to be decided for centuries.""

On one side of the argument in these cases is the idea of equality. On the other, traditional notions of how society has ordered itself.

The same-sex-marriage cases come in the face of a shift in public opinion that even opponents of same-sex marriage admit is unprecedented. Polls show that support for gay marriage has jumped from percentages in the low 40s just four years ago to majorities now as high as 58 percent. And 13 other countries, from Canada to Argentina, have legalized same-sex marriage.

The Voter Initiative

California's Proposition 8, known simply as Prop 8, was enacted by voter initiative in 2008 to ban same-sex marriage. Challenging the constitutionality of the ban are Kristin Perry and Sandy Stier. They have been together 13 years and raised four boys — Perry's twins, and Stier's two sons from a heterosexual marriage many years ago.

""And I'm not allowed to enter into that institution simply because of the gender of who I love — not because I've done anything illegal, not because I'm not contributing, not because I've done anything other than end up this way.""

Perry says that Proposition 8 not only hurts her; it hurts her parents, her kids and her community.

He argues that just as the U.S. Supreme Court struck down state laws banning marriage between people of different races, it should strike down laws banning marriage between people of the same gender.

State Power And Equal Protection

Those defending Proposition 8 point out that the citizens of California have twice, since 2000, voted to ban same-sex marriage. ""We are claiming that the Supreme Court should not try to remove the decision on the future of marriage from the hands of the people, that the people are sovereign, that they do have a right to maintain marriage as one man and one woman,"" says Austin Nimocks, counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, one of the groups involved in defending Proposition 8.

The Legal Standard

The legal case to be argued Tuesday, however, is focused on what justifications, if any, the state of California has for banning same-sex marriage.

Olson argues that even under the most lenient standard — what is known as the rational basis test — the state cannot justify the ban.

Under the rational basis test, a law is upheld if there is a rational reason for it. Proposition 8 lawyer Cooper told the lower court that under the rational basis test, the ban on same-sex marriage should be upheld unless ""this court concludes that there is nothing to say in favor of the definition of marriage that has prevailed in this country and in all places"" essentially since ""time immemorial.""

Olson replies that none of the offered justifications for Proposition 8 hold water — not family, not kids, not the institution of marriage. No one, he says, has come up with any reason why same-sex marriage ""damages heterosexual marriages in any way.""

Ultimately, he says, it is no justification to say the country has been doing something for hundreds of years, if it flies in the face of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law.

Olson will also argue that the court should use a tougher, more skeptical standard in evaluating laws that treat homosexuals and heterosexuals differently, a standard like the one used to evaluate laws that treat men and women differently.

The threshold question for the justices, however, is whether there should be any case at all, whether there is any dispute between the state and those challenging the law. California not only refuses to defend Proposition 8 in court but has filed a brief contending that the sponsors of the law have no legal standing to appeal the lower court decisions that invalidated the law. And if the Supreme Court were to agree, the lower court decision would stand, and Proposition 8 would exist no longer.

The court has many other options to choose from in deciding this case. Among the choices: It could uphold Proposition 8 as a valid exercise of the democratic process. It could strike down Proposition 8 in a way that could invalidate similar bans in 31 other states. Or it could rule in a manner that invalidates only California's law.

That was the shrill storyline on liberal blogs yesterday , touched off by a legal petition filed by Cuccinelli 's office over a court ruling on the state 's anti-sodomy laws . Unsurprisingly , the `` anti-gay '' frame is a total red herring . Cuccinelli 's narrow interest in the case lies in upholding a conviction of a 47-year-old man who solicited a sexual act from a 17-year-old girl . The Washington Post reports :
Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli has challenged a recent court ruling finding Virginia ’ s anti-sodomy law unconstitutional . The appeal has gotten national attention as Cuccinelli ’ s gubernatorial bid ramps up . A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled on March 12 that Virginia ’ s “ Crimes Against Nature ” statute , which banned oral and anal sex , violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . One judge dissented , agreeing with a lower court that the Supreme Court ’ s ruling in Lawrence v. Texas on sodomy laws applied only to consenting adults . The case in question involved a teenage girl and a 47-year-old man , William Scott MacDonald , who was convicted of soliciting a minor to commit a felony . A petition was filed on Cuccinelli ’ s behalf asking for the full 15-judge court to reconsider the panel ’ s decision . LGBT advocates have expressed disappointment , saying the law is unconstitutional and anti-gay . “ This case is not about sexual orientation , but using current law to protect a 17 year-old girl from a 47 year-old sexual predator , ” Cuccinelli spokeswoman Caroline Gibson said in a statement . “ We agree with the dissenting opinion that the petitioner was not entitled to federal habeas corpus relief and the full court should have the opportunity to decide this matter . The attorney general is committed to protecting Virginia ’ s children from predators who attempt to exploit them and rob them of their childhood. ” Cuccinelli agrees with the dissenting judge , Albert Diaz , who was appointed to the 4th Circuit by President Obama in 2009 , who argued for deference to the Virginia Court of Appeals .
Whatever you think of Lawrence v. Texas and sodomy laws in general , it 's clear that Cuccinelli 's position here has absolutely nothing to do with consenting adults or gay rights . It 's about a case involving a man pushing 50 and a high school-aged girl . Oh , and the Attorney General 's office is siding with an Obama appointee 's ruling on the matter . Those facts aside , the McAuliffe campaign ripped Cuccinelli for playing `` divisive '' politics :
Cuccinelli is running for governor this year against former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe , whose campaign picked up on the case . “ This is just another example of Ken Cuccinelli ignoring the economy and instead focusing on his divisive ideological agenda , ” McAuliffe spokesman Josh Schwerin said in a statement .
Yes , let 's talk about the economy . Virginia 's unemployment rate is 5.6 percent and the state enjoys a substantial budget surplus thanks to the stewardship of Virginia 's current governor , Bob McDonnell . The Republican inherited a 7.2 percent unemployment rate and budget deficits from his Democratic predecessor , and has transformed the state into one of the nation 's most business-friendly climates ( the impending transportation boondoggle notwithstanding ) . McAuliffe and Virginia Democrats hope voters will ignore McDonnell 's successful record of governance , which is why they 're eager to harp on the culture wars , even when there 's no basis for doing so . And the notion that Cuccinelli is `` focused '' on things like sodomy laws is absurd . Unlike McAuliffe , Cuccinelli has a day job other than full-time candidate . He was elected ( overwhelmingly ) by Virginia 's voters to be the chief law enforcement officer in the state . That job entails duties . One of those duties , in Cuccinelli 's estimation , is doing what it takes to protect high school girls from much older sexual suitors . The Cuccinelli campaign slapped back at McAuliffe 's distortions with a curt statement :
`` It is sad and unfortunate the day has come that Democrats attack someone for protecting children from sexual predators . This case is about prosecuting a 47 year-old man who solicited sexual acts from a 17 year-old girl . It 's appalling Terry McAuliffe and his cronies would stoop this low . ”
Fine . But the Cuccinelli camp needs to understand that they 're in the big leagues now , and unforced errors are going to be exploited . I 'm not talking about the merits of this particular case ; I 'm talking about the optics of fighting to uphold a sodomy law in the midst of an intense national debate over gay rights . Democrats ' demagogic leap was entirely predictable here . How many low information voters will hear the nuanced details of Cuccinelli 's position ? And how many will just see headlines like this ? If he 's going to make a decision that will inflame public passions and present Democrats with an irresistible opportunity to push the `` divisive '' or `` extreme '' narrative , Cuccinelli and his campaign need to get out in front of it .

That was the shrill storyline on liberal blogs yesterday, touched off by a legal petition filed by Cuccinelli's office over a court ruling on the state's anti-sodomy laws. Unsurprisingly, the ""anti-gay"" frame is a total red herring. Cuccinelli's narrow interest in the case lies in upholding a conviction of a 47-year-old man who solicited a sexual act from a 17-year-old girl. The Washington Post reports:



Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli has challenged a recent court ruling finding Virginia’s anti-sodomy law unconstitutional. The appeal has gotten national attention as Cuccinelli’s gubernatorial bid ramps up. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled on March 12 that Virginia’s “Crimes Against Nature” statute, which banned oral and anal sex, violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. One judge dissented, agreeing with a lower court that the Supreme Court’s ruling in Lawrence v. Texas on sodomy laws applied only to consenting adults. The case in question involved a teenage girl and a 47-year-old man, William Scott MacDonald, who was convicted of soliciting a minor to commit a felony. A petition was filed on Cuccinelli’s behalf asking for the full 15-judge court to reconsider the panel’s decision. LGBT advocates have expressed disappointment, saying the law is unconstitutional and anti-gay. “This case is not about sexual orientation, but using current law to protect a 17 year-old girl from a 47 year-old sexual predator,” Cuccinelli spokeswoman Caroline Gibson said in a statement. “We agree with the dissenting opinion that the petitioner was not entitled to federal habeas corpus relief and the full court should have the opportunity to decide this matter. The attorney general is committed to protecting Virginia’s children from predators who attempt to exploit them and rob them of their childhood.” Cuccinelli agrees with the dissenting judge, Albert Diaz, who was appointed to the 4th Circuit by President Obama in 2009, who argued for deference to the Virginia Court of Appeals.



Whatever you think of Lawrence v. Texas and sodomy laws in general, it's clear that Cuccinelli's position here has absolutely nothing to do with consenting adults or gay rights. It's about a case involving a man pushing 50 and a high school-aged girl. Oh, and the Attorney General's office is siding with an Obama appointee's ruling on the matter. Those facts aside, the McAuliffe campaign ripped Cuccinelli for playing ""divisive"" politics:



Cuccinelli is running for governor this year against former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe, whose campaign picked up on the case. “This is just another example of Ken Cuccinelli ignoring the economy and instead focusing on his divisive ideological agenda,” McAuliffe spokesman Josh Schwerin said in a statement.



Yes, let's talk about the economy. Virginia's unemployment rate is 5.6 percent and the state enjoys a substantial budget surplus thanks to the stewardship of Virginia's current governor, Bob McDonnell. The Republican inherited a 7.2 percent unemployment rate and budget deficits from his Democratic predecessor, and has transformed the state into one of the nation's most business-friendly climates (the impending transportation boondoggle notwithstanding). McAuliffe and Virginia Democrats hope voters will ignore McDonnell's successful record of governance, which is why they're eager to harp on the culture wars, even when there's no basis for doing so. And the notion that Cuccinelli is ""focused"" on things like sodomy laws is absurd. Unlike McAuliffe, Cuccinelli has a day job other than full-time candidate. He was elected (overwhelmingly) by Virginia's voters to be the chief law enforcement officer in the state. That job entails duties. One of those duties, in Cuccinelli's estimation, is doing what it takes to protect high school girls from much older sexual suitors. The Cuccinelli campaign slapped back at McAuliffe's distortions with a curt statement:



""It is sad and unfortunate the day has come that Democrats attack someone for protecting children from sexual predators. This case is about prosecuting a 47 year-old man who solicited sexual acts from a 17 year-old girl. It's appalling Terry McAuliffe and his cronies would stoop this low.”



Fine. But the Cuccinelli camp needs to understand that they're in the big leagues now, and unforced errors are going to be exploited. I'm not talking about the merits of this particular case; I'm talking about the optics of fighting to uphold a sodomy law in the midst of an intense national debate over gay rights. Democrats' demagogic leap was entirely predictable here. How many low information voters will hear the nuanced details of Cuccinelli's position? And how many will just see headlines like this? If he's going to make a decision that will inflame public passions and present Democrats with an irresistible opportunity to push the ""divisive"" or ""extreme"" narrative, Cuccinelli and his campaign need to get out in front of it. Don't let the Left dart in for an easy ""Republicans hate gays"" layup. Cuccinelli dominated in blueish/purple Northern Virginia in 2009; he'll need to turn in a respectable performance there to win state-wide in November. Letting Democrats define the social issues is a ticket to real problems in NoVa if Team Cuccinelli isn't more careful moving forward.

Proponents say the measures protect minors from medical changes they may regret as adults , while opponents say the bills prevent doctors from following health care guidelines approved by organizations such as the American Medical Association .
The South Dakota House passed its version of the bill last week , which would impose a one-year jail sentence and a maximum fine of $ 2,000 on doctors who provide hormone replacement therapy , puberty blockers and gender confirmation surgery to children younger than 16 years old .
Chase Strangio , ACLU Deputy Director for Transgender Justice , said transgender rights advocates are geared up for a fight against HB 1057 and similar measures in Colorado , Oklahoma , Missouri , Illinois , Kentucky , West Virginia , South Carolina and Florida .
`` There have been policy meetings among groups like the Alliance Defending Freedom and The Heritage Foundation , who have long had a mission of pushing anti-LGBTQ policies , to push two types of bills this year , '' Strangio said . `` One being the medical care bans and the other being bans on trans athletes participating in sports . So it 's a coordinated effort that 's coming from national groups . ''
Lock them up ? : A Kentucky lawmaker wants doctors arrested for treating transgender youth
Rep. Fred Deutsch , sponsor of the South Dakota 's HB 1057 , said he introduced the bill Jan. 14 to prevent doctors from pushing children to change their bodies .
“ Every child in South Dakota should be protected from dangerous drugs and procedures , ” Deutsch said in an emailed statement . “ The solution for children ’ s identification with the opposite sex isn ’ t to poison their bodies with mega-doses of the wrong hormones , to chemically or surgically castrate and sterilize them , or to remove healthy breasts and reproductive organs . ''
Guidelines from the Endocrine Society currently recommend transgender youth wait until age 18 to get genital surgery . The society also suggests starting gender-affirming hormones at about 16 , and beginning puberty blockers after girls and boys show physical changes , typically around 10 or 11 .
The same Tuesday Deutsch introduced his bill , lawmakers in South Carolina and Florida read their own versions on the floor . Colorado legislators heard a similar one the next day and an Oklahoma lawmaker introduced another the day after . Kentucky and West Virginia followed suit over the next two weeks .
'We will still exist ' : Hundreds gather for protest of South Dakota transgender bills
Missouri was the first this year to introduce the bill on Jan. 8 , but an Illinois lawmaker made a similar proposal last year , before a court case brought attention to transition-related care for children .
A high-profile custody battle over a transgender child in Texas may have spurred the proposals , said Currey Cook , Lambda Legal 's Director of the Youth in Out-of-Home Care Project . Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov . Greg Abbott helped elevate the case in October , with Cruz calling the child a `` pawn in the left-wing political agenda . ''
The parents in the case , Jeffrey Younger and Anne Georgulas , disagreed on whether their child is transgender and whether to support the child 's identity . Misinformation about medical treatment for the 7-year-old circulated the internet , prompting state legislators in Texas and Georgia to propose banning transition-related care for minors , Cook said .
`` I think some of the politicians are just kind of trying to capitalize on fear , misinformation , prejudice around a particular population , '' Cook said . `` It 's really fundamentally troubling that you 're going to decide to take on kids and families that are doing their best to support their young people who already face so much stigma in the world . ''
The nine bills would ban transition-related treatment for transgender minors . Many reference gender dysphoria , discomfort or distress caused by a discrepancy between a person ’ s gender identity and sex assigned at birth .
Medical treatment for dysphoria can include puberty blockers , which a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found reduces risks for mental health problems and suicide , which 35 % of transgender youth attempt . Prepubescent minors may decide to socially transition before requesting treatment , experts said , by seeing how changing their style and name makes them feel .
Lawmakers in Kentucky and Florida have proposed making providing such care a felony . If passed , bills in Illinois , Oklahoma and South Carolina would require doctors who treat transgender youth face professional discipline , such as the suspension or revocation of their medical license . Colorado 's version of the bill proposes classifying the medical treatments as both a felony and malpractice .
Hormones , surgery , regret : I was a transgender woman for 8 years — time I ca n't get back
Rep. Anthony Sabatini , who sponsored one of the bills in Florida , said he introduced the Vulnerable Children Protection Act in response to an `` explosion of interest '' in gender reassignment surgery across the nation .
“ It ’ s the wild west ... there are no real guidelines , laws , no valid , serious diagnoses given to a child before they go down the path of changing their gender and their sexual identity , ” Sabatini said during a subcommittee meeting Monday . “ It 's important that we make sure that everyone who is going forward with this process is informed and knows how to give consent for such a procedure . This bill makes sure that a young person waits until they are 18 years old before they make an irrevocable decision to change into the opposite sex . ”
If passed , the West Virginia measure would also require residents be at least age 18 to be eligible for hormone replacement therapy or the surgeries . Under the Missouri proposal , doctors or parents who help minors get gender-affirming care would be charged with child abuse or neglect , despite studies showing how parents supporting their child 's gender identity improves their mental health .
Similar language appears in the state bills , Cook said , including bans on treatments `` affirming the minor ’ s perception of the minor ’ s sex . ''
`` The government is basically telling you , 'Nope , you 're wrong about your own identity , and we 're telling you how you 're going to be , ' '' Cook said . `` Some of the proponents of these bills are the very people who decry government intrusion into people 's private lives , so it 's just a complete 180 from their usual proposition . ''
The health care bills rely on misinformation and fear , Cook said , following a similar strategy to the bathroom bills . In 2017 , the year North Carolina rolled back HB2 , 16 states considered restricting people to restrooms that matched their sex assigned at birth , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures .
Stand your ground and bathroom bills:5 model bills that spark controversy
Proponents claimed the laws would protect women from being assaulted by transgender people in public restrooms , despite studies showing transgender people are more likely to be attacked , Cook said .
Likewise , these sponsors argue the bills will protect children from being forced to medically transition by doctors , despite how transgender minors undergo many consultations with therapists , family and doctors before getting any prescriptions . Doctors also assess whether youth want to continue treatment throughout the process and explain risks and side effects , according to the Transgender Care Navigation Program at the University of California , San Francisco .
In the past year , the Trump administration has implemented rules restricting the service of transgender troops , proposed allowing homeless shelters to discriminate on the basis of gender identity , told the Supreme Court employers can fire transgender workers because of who they are and announced plans to rollback protections for transgender patients included in the Affordable Care Act .
'Messes up your life ' : Some Americans are denied 'lifesaving ' health care because they are transgender
But state laws on treatments for transgender youth go a step further , said Strangio .
`` There 's definitely a lot of anti-trans policies coming out of the White House , but there 's nothing that would go so far as to criminalize the provision of medical care , '' Strangio said . `` The federal government is trying to make it easier to discriminate and has pushed forward proposed interpretations of federal law that would limit nondiscrimination protections . These state bills are sort of criminal bans on health care or mandatory discrimination . ''","A polarizing debate is happening around the nation as lawmakers in eight states have introduced bills in recent weeks seeking to restrict transition-related treatment for transgender youth.

Guidelines from the Endocrine Society currently recommend transgender youth wait until age 18 to get genital surgery. The society also suggests starting gender-affirming hormones at about 16, and beginning puberty blockers after girls and boys show physical changes, typically around 10 or 11.

The same Tuesday Deutsch introduced his bill, lawmakers in South Carolina and Florida read their own versions on the floor. Colorado legislators heard a similar one the next day and an Oklahoma lawmaker introduced another the day after. Kentucky and West Virginia followed suit over the next two weeks.

'We will still exist':Hundreds gather for protest of South Dakota transgender bills

Missouri was the first this year to introduce the bill on Jan. 8, but an Illinois lawmaker made a similar proposal last year, before a court case brought attention to transition-related care for children.

A high-profile custody battle over a transgender child in Texas may have spurred the proposals, said Currey Cook, Lambda Legal's Director of the Youth in Out-of-Home Care Project. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Greg Abbott helped elevate the case in October, with Cruz calling the child a ""pawn in the left-wing political agenda.""

The parents in the case, Jeffrey Younger and Anne Georgulas, disagreed on whether their child is transgender and whether to support the child's identity. Misinformation about medical treatment for the 7-year-old circulated the internet, prompting state legislators in Texas and Georgia to propose banning transition-related care for minors, Cook said.

""I think some of the politicians are just kind of trying to capitalize on fear, misinformation, prejudice around a particular population,"" Cook said. ""It's really fundamentally troubling that you're going to decide to take on kids and families that are doing their best to support their young people who already face so much stigma in the world.""

How would the bills affect transgender youth?

The nine bills would ban transition-related treatment for transgender minors. Many reference gender dysphoria, discomfort or distress caused by a discrepancy between a person’s gender identity and sex assigned at birth.

Medical treatment for dysphoria can include puberty blockers, which a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found reduces risks for mental health problems and suicide, which 35% of transgender youth attempt. Prepubescent minors may decide to socially transition before requesting treatment, experts said, by seeing how changing their style and name makes them feel.

Lawmakers in Kentucky and Florida have proposed making providing such care a felony. If passed, bills in Illinois, Oklahoma and South Carolina would require doctors who treat transgender youth face professional discipline, such as the suspension or revocation of their medical license. Colorado's version of the bill proposes classifying the medical treatments as both a felony and malpractice.

Hormones, surgery, regret:I was a transgender woman for 8 years — time I can't get back

Rep. Anthony Sabatini, who sponsored one of the bills in Florida, said he introduced the Vulnerable Children Protection Act in response to an ""explosion of interest"" in gender reassignment surgery across the nation.

“It’s the wild west ... there are no real guidelines, laws, no valid, serious diagnoses given to a child before they go down the path of changing their gender and their sexual identity,” Sabatini said during a subcommittee meeting Monday. “It's important that we make sure that everyone who is going forward with this process is informed and knows how to give consent for such a procedure. This bill makes sure that a young person waits until they are 18 years old before they make an irrevocable decision to change into the opposite sex.”

If passed, the West Virginia measure would also require residents be at least age 18 to be eligible for hormone replacement therapy or the surgeries. Under the Missouri proposal, doctors or parents who help minors get gender-affirming care would be charged with child abuse or neglect, despite studies showing how parents supporting their child's gender identity improves their mental health.

Similar language appears in the state bills, Cook said, including bans on treatments ""affirming the minor’s perception of the minor’s sex.""

""The government is basically telling you, 'Nope, you're wrong about your own identity, and we're telling you how you're going to be,'"" Cook said. ""Some of the proponents of these bills are the very people who decry government intrusion into people's private lives, so it's just a complete 180 from their usual proposition.""

How are they similar to the bathroom bills?

The health care bills rely on misinformation and fear, Cook said, following a similar strategy to the bathroom bills. In 2017, the year North Carolina rolled back HB2, 16 states considered restricting people to restrooms that matched their sex assigned at birth, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Proponents claimed the laws would protect women from being assaulted by transgender people in public restrooms, despite studies showing transgender people are more likely to be attacked, Cook said.

Likewise, these sponsors argue the bills will protect children from being forced to medically transition by doctors, despite how transgender minors undergo many consultations with therapists, family and doctors before getting any prescriptions. Doctors also assess whether youth want to continue treatment throughout the process and explain risks and side effects, according to the Transgender Care Navigation Program at the University of California, San Francisco.

How do they compare to federal policies?

In the past year, the Trump administration has implemented rules restricting the service of transgender troops, proposed allowing homeless shelters to discriminate on the basis of gender identity, told the Supreme Court employers can fire transgender workers because of who they are and announced plans to rollback protections for transgender patients included in the Affordable Care Act.

'Messes up your life':Some Americans are denied 'lifesaving' health care because they are transgender

But state laws on treatments for transgender youth go a step further, said Strangio.

""There's definitely a lot of anti-trans policies coming out of the White House, but there's nothing that would go so far as to criminalize the provision of medical care,"" Strangio said. ""The federal government is trying to make it easier to discriminate and has pushed forward proposed interpretations of federal law that would limit nondiscrimination protections. These state bills are sort of criminal bans on health care or mandatory discrimination.""",www.usatoday.com,center,yZD80riFfTQztDAu
lgbt_rights,New York Post,2,https://nypost.com/2019/03/30/inside-the-suspicious-rise-of-gay-hate-crimes-in-portland/,Inside the suspicious rise of gay hate crimes in Portland,2019-03-30,,"Last month , Sophia Gabrielle Stanford was at the center of a fundraising campaign . The GoFundMe page described the trans activist as a victim of a “ brutal and aggressively blatant hate crime ” in which assailants had beaten her unconscious with a bat in southeast Portland .
The campaign and shocking story went viral . However , the police reports raise questions about what happened that night .
In the early hours of Sunday , Feb. 10 , emergency services received a call about a woman , identified as Stanford , found on a sidewalk with scrapes on her face and knuckles , claiming that she may have been assaulted . The responding officer , Edgar Mitchell , noted that Stanford smelled of alcohol .
“ I asked [ Officer Zachary Roe ] what happened , ” the report states . “ Roe said the individual admitted to being intoxicated , and Roe believed the person fell and hit her head . ”
Stanford either could not or would not state her name to the police . The responding officer was unable to discover Stanford ’ s name and claims that she made a threat : “ If you don ’ t treat me right , my people will get you , ” she said , according to the report .
The report also states that Stanford lost a pistol and bag she was carrying at the time of the alleged attack . A local resident found both items and flagged down another officer , Cuong Nguyen . When Nguyen attempted to return the gun to Stanford at nearby Emanuel Hospital , where she had been transported , she was already discharged .
The GoFundMe page stated that Stanford had suffered a “ serious concussion ” and would need intensive physical therapy , CT scans and counseling .
The case was investigated by the bias-crimes unit but was suspended due to the lack of tangible leads . Although it is impossible to know what exactly happened , nothing in the police reports indicate that Stanford told police she was attacked with a bat by multiple assailants in a hate crime .
The next day , however , the sensational and detailed story emerged in the fundraising appeal . Over $ 10,000 was raised .
Sophia Stanford blocked me across several social media accounts after I sent a request for comment .
In progressive Portland where the “ # Resistance ” is mainstream , stories like Stanford ’ s feed into a whisper campaign of violent homophobes , transphobes and racists lurking on every corner . A moral panic had now been ignited .
Within days , the number of alleged hate attacks ballooned through uncorroborated and vague online rumors . These stories were then amplified by progressive media , nonprofit groups , businesses and politicians . Activists , driven by their own personal grievances , then launched a crusade to find the phantom suspects , doxing and targeting innocent people in the process .
On Feb. 17 , Jenny Bruso , a self-described fat-queer activist , posted a claim on Facebook and Twitter that echoed Stanford ’ s harrowing story . She said that her partner , Brie Jones , was attacked by “ two young white men ” in a maroon SUV who pulled up beside her at a busy intersection , called her a homophobic slur and threw a full can of beer at her face . She was allegedly knocked to the ground from the impact . Bruso posted a photo of Jones with an abrasion on her cheek .
I spoke with staff at businesses along that intersection , but nobody I talked to had witnessed an attack . When Bruso ’ s post went viral on Facebook and commenters raised questions about the incident , she deleted the post .
“ I , WE , owe you NOTHING , ” Bruso wrote on Facebook . “ The intention was to warn our communities and that ’ s precisely what I did . ”
Bruso originally said the attack was “ reported , ” but Portland police stated in a report that there was no case number associated with the incident as of Feb. 27 , 2019 . I contacted Bruso several times by email asking where she reported the incident . She didn ’ t respond .
When I sent her a text seeking comment , she responded : “ Don ’ t contact me . Don ’ t text me . ”
Even with Bruso ’ s story deleted from Facebook , screenshots and copy-and-pasted posts went viral , stoking a tense atmosphere already generated from Stanford ’ s earlier allegation . The larger narrative of bigoted white men patrolling Portland to attack LGBT people then began to take on a life of its own . Activists sent out “ attack alerts ” warning the queer public to carry Mace and to travel in groups . Other activists circulated photos and addresses of the alleged attackers in flyers around town and on social media posts .
The city was in a panic , and it focused its energy on one main antagonist : the Proud Boys , a right-wing , pro-Trump fraternity and drinking club . They were blamed for the indiscriminate violence .
The group has infamously been involved in bloody street brawls against Antifa . Members of the group are currently facing charges for a 2018 fight in the Portland area .
“ These are the faces of the attackers that have been terrorizing the queer/trans community lately . If you see any of these faces in public , hit them with a brick , because the police don ’ t do anything to stop it , ” read one widely shared post on Instagram . It included a group photo of the men and names .
As the number of shares and retweets increased on this post and similar posts , so too did the number of alleged attacks . What started off as two stories of hate crimes grew to 15 . The claims grew wilder . The Proud Boys were accused of now using hammers and wooden planks as weapons . Also alleged : an attempted kidnapping .
“ Red pickup with a black cover and 3 white guys hollering at a woman I know outside a gay bar and while she walked home one got out and pulled her in by her collar , ” wrote user “ Siggitrue ” on the Portland subreddit .
The user told me the alleged robbery and kidnapping was reported to cops , but Portland police said it did not receive any report matching this description . When I followed up with “ Siggitrue , ” the user said that they were unwilling to reveal the woman ’ s identity out of fear for her safety and wrote : “ I ’ m also not obligated to provide you with any information , so the trail ends here . ”
Most social media users who shared stories refused to comment . Others admitted to repeating uncorroborated rumors . Andrew Lucht , a Portland resident who wrote a viral Facebook post releasing names and photos of accused attackers , told me he was not a witness to any attacks and did not know any of the victims . His post had accused the Proud Boys of being involved in murders .
“ I ’ m surprised the post took off the way it did , ” Lucht told me . “ I heard all of this initially from a friend who was very upset. ” That friend is neither a witness or victim , he said . “ I believe I heard [ about a ] murder in one of their messages , but in hindsight , I could be wrong. ” Lucht took down his viral post after one of the accused men threatened legal action for libel .
Rumors of attacks did not circulate only among radical-activist networks . Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler amplified the rumors on Twitter . So too did the Portland chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America , which blamed “ right-wing agitators ” for the attacks . Car-ride company Lyft shared an advertisement aimed at Portland ’ s LGBT community . It repeated the rumors and offered a ride credit to encourage business . Activists organized a “ safety day ” training event featuring a workshop called “ Local Fash 101 ” where attendees were taught how to spot fascists .
The Portland Mercury published multiple stories and printed a claim from a woman who alleged via email that she was the victim of a brutal gay bashing in downtown Portland . ( The article does not cite any records and I could find no corroborating evidence that this happened as described . )
When I asked reporter Blair Stenvick what steps she took to independently verify that allegation , she said : “ I ’ m not interested in discussing this with you. ” Portland Mercury ’ s news editor , Alex Zielinski , also declined to comment on my inquiry . The paper ’ s reports were widely shared and used to legitimize the panic .
Those who spread the rumors were cheered for bringing “ awareness ” to LGBT issues . Lost in all this was any concern for the people victimized in the process .
One of the men who says he was falsely accused in the panic is Robert Zerfing , a 35-year-old Battle Ground , Wash. , resident . He used to attend conservative rallies in the Portland area but has since renounced the Proud Boys for their involvement in brawls .
Jenny Bruso claimed that her partner ’ s attackers drove a maroon Bronco or Suburban . Doxers identified that Zerfing owned a maroon SUV and used that as evidence he was involved in the attack even though that car was repossessed three months ago . He showed me one of the many death threats he now receives .
“ I guess we will find out when we pay that address a visit , ” the text reads . “ 4 hate crimes in the last week you were involved in . Paybacks a bitch mother f–ker . ”
All the men I contacted who were blamed for the attacks categorically deny having any involvement . Some are current Proud Boys members in various chapters across the West Coast , some are ex-members and others were random rally attendees who were photographed at events between 2017 and 2018 .
“ The Proud Boys is the most welcoming organization that I have ever been a part of , ” Fred Swink , an openly gay Proud Boys member in Vancouver , Wash. , told me . Swink has spent years being involved in the queer scene , where he was once the publisher of Stonewall News , an LGBT newspaper in Spokane . Swink is also familiar with gay bashing . In 2008 , there was a series of alleged assaults on gay men in Spokane who were lured and mugged through hookup sites . Some of them were closeted or married to women and did not go to the police .
“ Many victims never report for a variety of reasons , ” Swink says . “ But if they start making allegations that provide no details , that just creates hysteria . The men I knew who didn ’ t report their attacks to police also didn ’ t bring attention to themselves through viral social media posts on Twitter or Facebook . ”
Indeed it is known that some victims don ’ t report crimes against their perpetrator . Many fear that they will not be believed . What is less understood is why anyone might expect people to believe they ’ re the victim of a crime in the absence of evidence .
As in the case of Jussie Smollett , who is suspected of orchestrating a racist homophobic attack on himself , making wild allegations of bias-motivated assault creates hysteria , mistrust and a breakdown of law and order .
Which is a fair description of what happened on Feb. 24 at an emergency “ town hall ” organized by the Q Center , an LGBT organization in Portland . Executive director Cameron Whitten explained that the severity of what the community was experiencing called for extrajudicial measures .
“ We have not reached out to the Portland Police Bureau , ” he told the crowd of 500 people who whooped and clapped . Alleged victims were encouraged to report anonymously online to activist organizations , according to fliers handed out at the door . Portland United Against Hate is one such organization . The group did not respond when I asked what mechanisms it has in place to vet and verify anonymous online reports .
Whitten said at the town hall that there had been 10 attacks but in an interview with me admitted that he had only spoken directly with one alleged victim . That individual told him of a negative experience with police rather than experiencing a hate crime . The other person he spoke to was an “ advocate ” of Sophia Stanford whom he declined to name .
Outside of the initial allegation by Stanford , none of the purported incidents of beatings , killings or kidnapping were — I confirmed with Portland police — reported to authorities .
Did these crimes really happen ? Wilfred Reilly , a political scientist at Kentucky State and author of the book “ Hate Crime Hoax , ” says the nonreporting and cinematic narrative are indications they might not have .
“ If you were actually beaten by a group of homophobes , you ’ d go down to the precinct house before you ’ d go on Twitter and Facebook , ” he says . Through his research , Reilly has collected more than 500 cases of American hate hoaxes concentrated mostly between 2013 and 2018 .
Patterns he identifies among them are the lack of evidence , reluctance to cooperate with police , sensational claims , the presence of fundraising and the involvement of radical activists — all of which appear to be happening in Portland .
Fear and hatred of police may sound irrational in progressive Portland , where the sympathetic mayor doubles as the police commissioner , but it ’ s also convenient — until it ’ s not . Filing a false police report , as Smollett was suspected of doing , is a crime . And while Chicago prosecutors last week dropped their charges against Smollett in a strange twist that ’ s now being probed by the FBI , most people who waste police time don ’ t get off lightly .
It ’ s clear that Sophia Stanford and Brie Jones were injured . What ’ s less clear is how those injuries actually occurred . Only the people actually involved know , and nobody is apparently willing to speak .

On International Human Rights Day last December, Clinton gave a speech in Geneva declaring that for the United States, ""gay rights are human rights,"" and led the effort to get the first ever UN resolution on human rights for LGBT community passed.

""When I gave that speech in Geneva and said that we were going to make this a priority of American foreign policy, I didn't see it as something special, something that was added on to everything else we do, but something that was integral to who we are and what we stand for.""

Clinton asked the crowd, a mixture of veteran and young gay State department employees, to stop and reflect on how much progress America has made in advancing gay rights, and how far behind much of the rest of the world still is. ""Remind yourself, as I do every day, what it must be like for a young boy or a young girl in some other part of the world who could literally be killed, and often has been and still will be, who will be shunned, who will be put in danger every day of his or her life,"" she said. ""I want you to leave this celebration thinking about what more each and every one of you can do…to make not only the agencies of our government, but our world more just and free for all people.""",www.abcnews.go.com,left,5s1zrefw7JzaIU2N

While the move was no surprise -- Trump first proposed removing the protections last spring -- the timing feels like a poison arrow through the heart. It is particularly painful during Pride Month (and amid a global pandemic), during which millions of Americans have taken to the streets to speak out against systems of power that continue to suppress our freedoms, to our peril.

Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, passed under former President Barack Obama in 2010, prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded health programs and activities; a 2016 rule interpreted this as including discrimination on the basis of gender identity and termination of pregnancy. The Trump administration is now rolling back that interpretation. Doing so will embolden some health care providers to turn away or deny care or coverage to patients simply because of who they are, or because they are seeking an abortion. It is a gargantuan step backwards on the moral arc of justice and a blight on the egregious record of Donald Trump.

Transgender people, who will be affected by this change, already face rampant discrimination in health care and indeed across all facets of civic life, including housing and employment . The new rule means transgender people can be turned away when seeking routine or basic care -- not just transition-related treatment. A doctor or hospital could cite religious beliefs, for example, in denying care to someone whose identity doesn't comport with their personal world view, and health insurance companies could deny coverage for certain procedures, leaving already vulnerable individuals needing medical care with no legal pathway to seek justice.

Discrimination and abuse at the hands of those in power is nothing new to LGBTQ people, unfortunately. What's most deflating is that we had a decade with some relief, including this health care policy that provided some air cover for us to seek medical care with a bit less anxiety in our hearts.

The attorney general of Virginia surprised the state's political circles by deciding not to defend Virginia's ban on same-sex marriage. It goes before a federal judge next week.

That interpretation in Alabama largely took hold after U.S. District Judge Callie Granade , of the southern district of Alabama , overturned the state 's ban on same-sex marriage in January .
The Association of County Commissions of Alabama in Montgomery said that up to 12 counties are not issuing any marriage licenses .

''","CBS will air a controversial episode of the once family staple ""The Price is Right"" in primetime next week, featuring drag queen RuPaul who will be playing to raise money for the nation's largest abortion provider – Planned Parenthood.

Broadway World reported the show will air on May 11 with host Drew Carey. The special was taped before California's COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.

CBS previously aired two ""The Price Is Right at Night"" specials last December which proved to be ratings winners for the network, according to Deadline.

The popular game show has been aired by CBS since Sept. 4, 1972. It's the longest-running series in network television history. Bob Barker hosted the show for 35 years. Carey stepped in to host when Barker retired in 2007.

LifeNews.com reported RuPaul has been an abortion activist for years.

In 2017, he told Marie Claire magazine that his mother used to work at Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion group in America. He organized a fundraiser for the abortion chain that year, too.

As Nina Strochlic reported in these pages Sunday , the two men , Abdullah Ghavami Chahzanjiru and Salman Ghanbari Chahzanjiri , were hanged in southern Iran on August 6 , possibly for consensual sodomy .

We do not know for certain that they were executed for being gay—one Iranian source says they were , another is vague about their “ crimes ” but calls them “ immoral villains. ” If these men were hanged for consensual homosexuality , however , this could be another LGBT headache for the Obama administration , which has been trying to walk a tightrope between LGBT human rights on one end and international politics on the other .
Despite Iran ’ s state anti-Semitism , the recent arrest of U.S. journalists , and the continued oppression of women , the Obama administration has been attempting a rapprochement with the Iranian regime . Fending off Iran hawks in Congress and the D.C. punditocracy , the administration has argued for a policy of constructive engagement , pursuing diplomacy over military action to halt Iran ’ s nuclear program . The execution of two gay men , while it may not be surprising , certainly doesn ’ t make that “ engagement ” any easier .
Iran ’ s cooperation also is seen as essential to managing the chaos in Iraq and the Islamic State . With U.S. airstrikes against the Sunni militants , on-off ( now definitely off ) support of Iraq ’ s Shiite ( ex- ) Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki , and the possible disintegration of Iraq , this cooperation—or at least not overt opposition—is surely of more strategic importance than the latest human rights abuse .
Conservatives who favor a hawkish foreign policy will claim otherwise , of course . In the topsy-turvy world that is international LGBT politics , Iran ’ s record on homosexuality is more a conservative cause than a liberal one . Just a few weeks ago , the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing on human rights in Iran at which progressives such as Hossein Alizadeh of the International Gay & Lesbian Human Rights Commission testified about Iran ’ s hideous record of criminalization and persecution .
But at that same hearing , some of the most vocal defenses of human rights came from Robert George—the intellectual father of the right-wing “ religious liberty ” movement and , domestically at least , a zealous opponent of LGBT equality—and Republican Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen , Chris Smith , and Ed Royce , who used Iran ’ s human rights record as evidence against the Obama administration ’ s policy of engagement .

Obama follows on gay rights -- again
Activists for same-sex marriage could use a master grass-roots campaigner as they take their fight from the Supreme Court out into the states – but they ’ re not going to hold their breath for Barack Obama to lead the charge .
Obama ’ s style on gay rights has never been splashy , but more low-key as he pushed through changes like a repeal of the military ’ s ‘ Don ’ t Ask , Don ’ t Tell ’ policy .
Even Obama ’ s greatest contribution to the gay-rights cause was a passive one : He chose not to have his Justice Department defend the constitutionality of DOMA in court . And his first public statement after the law was struck down was out of the smartphone of a DOMA challenger – not the pomp of a Rose Garden ceremony .
So while gay-rights activists might like the president to grab his presidential megaphone and mobilize his voter army to march into 30 states that have anti-gay marriage language etched into their constitutions , advocates aren ’ t counting on it .

Obama follows on gay rights -- again

Activists for same-sex marriage could use a master grass-roots campaigner as they take their fight from the Supreme Court out into the states – but they’re not going to hold their breath for Barack Obama to lead the charge.

Obama’s style on gay rights has never been splashy, but more low-key as he pushed through changes like a repeal of the military’s ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ policy.

Story Continued Below

Even Obama’s greatest contribution to the gay-rights cause was a passive one: He chose not to have his Justice Department defend the constitutionality of DOMA in court. And his first public statement after the law was struck down was out of the smartphone of a DOMA challenger – not the pomp of a Rose Garden ceremony.

So while gay-rights activists might like the president to grab his presidential megaphone and mobilize his voter army to march into 30 states that have anti-gay marriage language etched into their constitutions, advocates aren’t counting on it.

“The president got on a wave that was already rolling. He’s certainly not leading the wave but he’s not coming up at the back of the train,” said Heather Cronk a co-founder of the gay-rights advocacy group GetEQUAL. “He’s played this politically safe.”

Still, Obama’s outside group, Organizing For Action, told supporters Wednesday that it planned to work on behalf of marriage equality groups in the 37 states that don’t have laws providing for same-sex matrimony.

“Everyone’s still trying to figure out what the next step is,” an official at OFA told POLITICO. In general, the official said, OFA will work with other groups and provide information to supporters on how they can get involved in the issue.

Human Rights Campaign executive director Chad Griffin outlined the group’s next plans Wednesday: lobby legislatures and file suits to get states to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states.

(CNN) – Former first lady Laura Bush, who is one of three prominent Republicans featured in a new ad supporting same-sex marriage, has asked the spot's creator to remove a clip of her espousing support for equal marriage rights.

The justices could also affirm a California-only rationale relied on by the appeals court .

The law , which defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman , denies federal benefits to same-sex couples in the nine states where same-sex couples can now legally wed .
`` On March 27 , DOMA will come before the Supreme Court and the justices must decide whether it is consistent with the principles of a nation that honors freedom , equality and justice above all , and is therefore constitutional , '' Clinton wrote in an op-ed published online Thursday night by The Washington Post .

(CNN) – Former President Bill Clinton, who signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law in 1996, is now calling on the Supreme Court to rule the same law unconstitutional.

The law, which defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman, denies federal benefits to same-sex couples in the nine states where same-sex couples can now legally wed.

""On March 27, DOMA will come before the Supreme Court and the justices must decide whether it is consistent with the principles of a nation that honors freedom, equality and justice above all, and is therefore constitutional,"" Clinton wrote in an op-ed published online Thursday night by The Washington Post.

He continued: ""As the president who signed the act into law, I have come to believe that DOMA is contrary to those principles and, in fact, incompatible with our Constitution.""

When it first became law, Clinton wrote ""it was a very different time."" He added that many supporters of the bill believed its passage would ""defuse a movement to enact a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, which would have ended the debate for a generation or more.""

After the ceremony, they went back to Mississippi, where they lived together. Then a year later, they decided to split up. The state of Mississippi doesn't recognize same-sex marriage, however, so they couldn't get a divorce there.

Hearn and Silva have seen quite a few same-sex divorce cases. When gay marriage became legal in D.C. on March 3, 2010, Silva says there was a lot of excitement. Couples who had been together for years went to the courthouse and got married, and so did couples who had only been together for a few months.

""You're already going through a tough time separating from your spouse, and to add this on top of it is another layer of complexity.""

But the hype wore off quickly, Silva says. He's had a lot of divorce cases in which the marriage took place on or near March 3, 2010.

In Washington, D.C., and a handful of other states, divorce laws are slightly looser. The district allows people who were married in D.C. to travel back to the city and file. Once a couple can file, a divorce is a divorce.

Having to move to a different state isn't ideal, which is why advocates for marriage equality want the U.S. Supreme Court to take up a marriage equality case — not just for the sake of marriage, but for the sake of divorce too.

GOP on Ariz. bill: Make it go away

As Republican Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer weighs whether to sign a bill that would allow businesses to deny services to gay customers, top national Republicans just want the issue to go away.

Proponents of the legislation — which Brewer has until Saturday to sign or veto and is reportedly leaning against — say the bill is designed to protect religious liberty. But many Washington Republicans see it as a political loser, giving the left another cudgel to attack conservatives as intolerant while motivating liberals and younger voters ahead of the midterm elections. It also threatens to widen the chasm between social conservatives and GOP operatives, who have become increasingly public in their support for gay marriage.

“There are lots of economic and fiscal issues that people care pretty deeply about. I think those are good issues for us to focus on,” Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said Tuesday when asked about the bill, SB 1062. “We’ll stay focused on Obamacare. Those are the issues we want to talk about.”

The state’s Republican senators, Jeff Flake and John McCain, are prodding the governor to veto the bill on financial grounds, warning that boycotts of Arizona could do untold economic damage to the state. They even worried about losing next year’s Super Bowl.

“I know that the entire business community is galvanized, in a way that I’ve never seen, against this legislation,” said McCain.

“I hope she moves quickly,” Flake said. “I just don’t see any reason to wait.”

Still, the legislation puts other elected Republicans in a touchy spot, not wanting to antagonize social conservatives who oppose same-sex marriage or force business owners to go against their conscience.

Three points need to be made about Monday’s decision by the Supreme Court not to decide whether the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution grants people of the same sex the right to marry.

Point 1: While the court’s liberal wing probably wanted to accept cases banning same-sex marriage in five states that have been overturned by three different federal appeals courts in recent months, the conservative majority, along with swing Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, apparently wished to see states resolve the issue. Perhaps they sought to avoid another Roe v.

Even so, Justice Kennedy waded into the deep again on Wednesday, blocking an appeals court ruling declaring homosexual marriage legal in Idaho and Nevada, but it’s likely only a temporary delay.

Point 2: For strict constructionists, the nonruling allows the culture to sort out the arguments consistent with what clearly are changing social mores. Whether this is good or bad is not up to courts to decide, conservatives might argue, but it beats top-down judicial activism of the type conservatives hate when liberal judges do it.

Point 3: The main arguments against permitting same-sex couples to marry are moral and biblical. The problem, especially for conservative Christians who oppose the legalization of homosexual marriage, is that they are speaking to people who don’t accept their moral code, or biblical instruction. They cite Genesis 2:24: “That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.” That verse is also quoted by Jesus in the New Testament.

Mclaughlin,"( CNN ) Tori Sisson and Shanté Wolfe of Tuskegee , Alabama , camped outside the Montgomery County Courthouse overnight , hoping that when the sun rose Monday , they 'd be the first same-sex couple to be legally married in the county .
They arrived at 2 p.m. Sunday and set up their tent . Expecting a crowd -- of mostly media and friends , or their `` chosen family , '' as many of their kin do n't approve of their relationship -- they awoke at 5 a.m. Monday to get dressed `` so that when we got out of the tent we 'd look like a million bucks , '' Sisson said .
Sisson , 24 , and Wolfe , 21 , have known each other for seven years . They 've been dating for two . Last year , the pair got `` spiritually married '' in Tuskegee , but it was n't a state-recognized union -- where all the rights and benefits of matrimony are conferred on both partners .
They previously considered going to a state that allowed same-sex marriage , but Wolfe balked at the idea .
`` We work here and we pay taxes here , and we did n't feel it was right that we 'd have to do that because nobody else does , '' she said .
Though there were some minor computer problems in issuing their license , their wish soon came true .
With one of their godmothers performing the ceremony , they exchanged vows outside the courthouse and kissed as a phalanx of media cameras captured the moment . ( One of those cameras belonged to the Human Rights Campaign , a watchdog group involved in marriage equality advocacy ; Sisson works for the organization . )

Sisson 's tears were n't borne solely of the bliss that comes with being joined in union with your beloved . Sure , those sentiments were there , Sisson said , but she cried also because she had been thinking all night about the myriad couples who were denied the opportunity she and Wolfe were able to seize Monday .
`` We have the honor to be the first couple in Montgomery County to do this . It 's amazing , '' Sisson said , explaining the `` overwhelming and overflowing love I have for Shanté but also for people and the hope I have in my heart that this really means progress here . ''
Though the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama cleared the way for same-sex marriages to begin Monday in Alabama , the famously conservative chief justice of the state Supreme Court on Sunday mounted a last-ditch effort to stop the weddings , instructing probate judges not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples .
That did n't stop several couples from converging on county courthouses across the state . Probate Judge Alan King in Jefferson County , the state 's most populous , said there appeared to be a larger-than-usual crowd outside the courthouse when he arrived at work Monday .
State Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore , who was ousted from his first chief justice post in 2003 after refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the Alabama Judicial Building in Montgomery , wrote that his Sunday order on same-sex marriages is necessary to ensure justice in the state .
`` Effective immediately , no Probate Judge of the State of Alabama nor any agent or employee of any Alabama Probate Judge shall issue or recognize a marriage license that is inconsistent '' with the state code or constitution , Moore wrote in the order .
The state code says `` marriage is inherently a unique relationship between a man and a woman . ''
The American Civil Liberties Union called Moore 's order spurious and reminded Alabama 's probate judges they are sworn to uphold the U.S. Constitution , which outweighs state law on this issue .
`` Judge Roy Moore has no authority to trump a federal court 's decision , '' said Susan Watson , executive director of the ACLU of Alabama . `` By issuing his 'order , ' he has done nothing but create confusion among the different probate offices across the state . Whereas some counties are issuing licenses to same-sex couples , there are many who are n't . Unfortunately , we have received a number of complaints to that effect . ''
The Human Rights Campaign has already denounced the order as a `` clear violation of all codes of legal ethics , '' and several counties -- including Jefferson , Montgomery and Madison -- have told CNN they intend to issue same-sex marriage licenses Monday .
But in Tuscaloosa County , where five same-sex couple were awaiting licenses when the court opened Monday , chief probate clerk Lisa Whitehead said the court would follow Moore 's guidance .
`` We will be issuing traditional marriage licenses , '' she told CNN .
Shelby , Marshall and Houston counties also are declining to issue the licenses , and in Lee County , where two same-sex couples attempted to tie the knot Monday , Judge Bill English said he , too , was `` complying with an order from the chief justice late last night . ''
Other probate judges were n't sure Moore had the law behind him .
`` I was shocked , '' King said of his reaction to Moore 's order . `` I 'm old enough to remember the George Wallace stand in the schoolhouse door . I was a kid at the time . ''
King was referencing the 1963 attempt by then-Gov . Wallace to stop the federally ordered desegregation of schools by blocking black students from entering the University of Alabama 's Foster Auditorium .
Contacted before his court opened for the day , King said he does n't want to be on that side of history . After consulting with attorneys who helped him analyze Moore 's order , `` I 'm convinced it 's my duty to follow the U.S. Constitution and the federal court order . At 8 a.m. , we will be issuing marriage licenses to all in Jefferson County . ... I do n't think ( Moore 's order ) is grounded in legal theory , just like Gov . Wallace in the 1960s was not grounded in law , '' he said .
Gov . Robert Bentley said he would not punish probate judges who issue the licenses .
In a statement that included a link to the U.S. Supreme Court 's dissenting opinion but not the majority opinion that cleared the way for the marriages , the governor said he was disappointed `` a single Federal court judge disregarded the vote of the Alabama people to define marriage as between a man and woman . ''
He added that he had `` great respect '' for the legal process and said , `` We will follow the rule of law in Alabama , and allow the issue of same sex marriage to be worked out through the proper legal channels . ''

Anyone monitoring the situation in Alabama likely expected Moore to try and block it . Four days after a U.S. District Court judge struck down the state 's ban on same-sex marriages on January 23 , Moore hand-delivered a letter to Bentley calling for him `` to stop judicial tyranny and any unlawful opinions issued without constitutional authority . ''
The federal court that struck down the ban permitted a stay until Monday to allow probate courts to prepare . Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block the marriages until the high court rules on a case on its docket that will decide the fate of same-sex marriages in four states .
making Alabama the 37th state ( plus Washington , D.C. ) to permit same-sex marriages . The U.S. Supreme Court said Monday it would not intervene for now making Alabama the 37th state ( plus Washington , D.C. ) to permit same-sex marriages .
`` In this case , the Court refuses even to grant a temporary stay when it will resolve the issue at hand in several months , '' Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a dissent . `` I would have shown the people of Alabama the respect they deserve and preserved the status quo while the Court resolves this important Constitutional question . ''
Strange responded in a statement : `` In the absence of a stay , there will likely be more confusion in the coming months leading up to the Supreme Court 's anticipated ruling on the legality of same-sex marriage . '' Strange further advised probate judges to consult with their attorneys `` about how to respond to the ruling .

Whereas some counties are issuing licenses to same-sex couples, there are many who aren't. Unfortunately, we have received a number of complaints to that effect.""

'I was shocked'

The Human Rights Campaign has already denounced the order as a ""clear violation of all codes of legal ethics,"" and several counties -- including Jefferson, Montgomery and Madison -- have told CNN they intend to issue same-sex marriage licenses Monday.

But in Tuscaloosa County, where five same-sex couple were awaiting licenses when the court opened Monday, chief probate clerk Lisa Whitehead said the court would follow Moore's guidance.

""We will be issuing traditional marriage licenses,"" she told CNN.

Shelby, Marshall and Houston counties also are declining to issue the licenses, and in Lee County, where two same-sex couples attempted to tie the knot Monday, Judge Bill English said he, too, was ""complying with an order from the chief justice late last night.""

Other probate judges weren't sure Moore had the law behind him.

""I was shocked,"" King said of his reaction to Moore's order. ""I'm old enough to remember the George Wallace stand in the schoolhouse door. I was a kid at the time.""

King was referencing the 1963 attempt by then-Gov. Wallace to stop the federally ordered desegregation of schools by blocking black students from entering the University of Alabama's Foster Auditorium.

Contacted before his court opened for the day, King said he doesn't want to be on that side of history. After consulting with attorneys who helped him analyze Moore's order, ""I'm convinced it's my duty to follow the U.S. Constitution and the federal court order. At 8 a.m., we will be issuing marriage licenses to all in Jefferson County. ... I don't think (Moore's order) is grounded in legal theory, just like Gov. Wallace in the 1960s was not grounded in law,"" he said.

Writing on wall

Gov. Robert Bentley said he would not punish probate judges who issue the licenses.

In a statement that included a link to the U.S. Supreme Court's dissenting opinion but not the majority opinion that cleared the way for the marriages, the governor said he was disappointed ""a single Federal court judge disregarded the vote of the Alabama people to define marriage as between a man and woman.""

He added that he had ""great respect"" for the legal process and said, ""We will follow the rule of law in Alabama, and allow the issue of same sex marriage to be worked out through the proper legal channels.""

Anyone monitoring the situation in Alabama likely expected Moore to try and block it. Four days after a U.S. District Court judge struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriages on January 23, Moore hand-delivered a letter to Bentley calling for him ""to stop judicial tyranny and any unlawful opinions issued without constitutional authority.""

Another ruling coming

The federal court that struck down the ban permitted a stay until Monday to allow probate courts to prepare. Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block the marriages until the high court rules on a case on its docket that will decide the fate of same-sex marriages in four states.

making Alabama the 37th state (plus Washington, D.C.) to permit same-sex marriages. The U.S. Supreme Court said Monday it would not intervene for now making Alabama the 37th state (plus Washington, D.C.) to permit same-sex marriages.

""In this case, the Court refuses even to grant a temporary stay when it will resolve the issue at hand in several months,"" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a dissent. ""I would have shown the people of Alabama the respect they deserve and preserved the status quo while the Court resolves this important Constitutional question.""

Strange responded in a statement: ""In the absence of a stay, there will likely be more confusion in the coming months leading up to the Supreme Court's anticipated ruling on the legality of same-sex marriage."" Strange further advised probate judges to consult with their attorneys ""about how to respond to the ruling.""",www.cnn.com,left,ifnU4ODLPTiXX5iN

LITTLE ROCK — As local and state leaders and organizations pressured Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto House Bill 1228 — the Religious Freedom Restoration Act — the governor said Wednesday he won't sign the bill in its current form.

During nearly two hours of argument , the justices appeared to divide along traditional liberal-conservative lines , with Justice Anthony Kennedy residing – once again – at the center of the nine-member court .
If Justice Kennedy ’ s comments and questions during the session are an accurate indication , the federal statute may well be struck down .
Kennedy repeatedly raised concerns that the federal statute was in conflict with the traditional power of the states to regulate marriage .
The justice took exception to a comment by a lawyer defending the statute that all the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) did was define marriage for purposes of federal law .
Kennedy said the definition applied in 1,100 different contexts , which meant that federal influence was “ intertwined with the citizens ’ day-to-day life . ”
That , he said , put the federal government at a “ real risk of running in conflict ” with core powers retained by the states , including the power to regulate marriage , divorce , and child custody .
The lawyer , former Solicitor General Paul Clement , said Congress was simply seeking uniformity in the provision of federal benefits , not to regulate marriage at the state level .
Kennedy was unconvinced . “ The question is whether or not the federal government , under our federalism scheme , has the authority to regulate marriage , ” he said .
At various points during the argument , Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan , both members of the court ’ s liberal wing , offered comments in support of Kennedy ’ s concerns .
Chief Justice John Roberts also appeared to be trying to frame an argument about federal power to draw Kennedy in a more conservative direction .
It is still too early to know with certainty which way Kennedy will ultimately go , and whether his expected swing vote will align with the high court ’ s liberals or conservatives .
But it is clear from his comments that he is deeply concerned about the impact of the federal statute .
DOMA restricts the receipt of federal marriage benefits to opposite-sex couples by defining marriage as a union between one man and one woman .
By using that traditional definition of marriage , same-sex spouses who are legally married in states permitting gay marriage are blocked from receiving the same 1,100 benefits available to opposite-sex spouses .
Unlike every heterosexual married couple in the United States , married homosexuals can not file joint tax returns , receive spousal Social Security benefits , or qualify for family health insurance for married federal employees .
“ DOMA was not enacted for any purpose of uniformity , administration , caution , pausing , any of that , ” US Solicitor General Donald Verrilli told the court .
“ It was enacted to exclude same-sex , lawfully married couples from federal benefit regimes based on a conclusion that was driven by moral disapproval , ” he said .
The solicitor general added : “ I think it ’ s time for this court to recognize that this discrimination , excluding lawfully married gay and lesbian couples from federal benefits , can not be reconciled with our fundamental commitment to equal treatment under law . ”
Coming on the heels of Tuesday ’ s oral argument on California ’ s Proposition 8 ban on same-sex marriage , the high court ’ s sessions over the past two days mark a historic reexamination of gay rights in America .
With recent polls showing that between 53 and 58 percent of Americans now approve of same-sex marriage , gay-rights advocates say full recognition and equal rights for gay and lesbian married couples is inevitable . They stress that the high court should act now to strike down Proposition 8 and DOMA and stake out a position on the right side of history .
Supporters of the traditional definition of marriage are urging the high court to take a go-slow approach and permit the controversy over same-sex marriage to continue to percolate through the democratic process .
Nine states and the District of Columbia authorize same-sex marriages . Eight other states provide domestic partnerships for same-sex couples .
On the other side , 31 states have passed constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriages , and a handful of other states have enacted statutes to achieve the same result .
The question in the DOMA case is whether the statute violates the Constitution ’ s guarantee of equal protection .
“ Because of DOMA , many thousands of people who are legally married … are being treated as unmarried by the federal government solely because they are gay , ” said Roberta Kaplan , a New York lawyer for the plaintiff in the case , Edith Windsor .
The high court case stems from a lawsuit filed by Ms. Windsor following the passing of her lifelong companion , partner , and spouse , Thea Spyer . They spent 44 years together in New York with a dream that someday they would be able to marry .
The couple were married in Canada in 2007 . Ms. Spyer passed away two years later and left her estate to her wife . Federal law allows a spousal exemption from the estate tax . But DOMA ’ s definition of marriage meant that only opposite-sex couples could claim the exemption .
The IRS treated Windsor as if she and Spyer were complete strangers . Windsor was forced to pay $ 363,000 in estate taxes that would not have been owed if her spouse had been a man .
Windsor filed suit in federal court charging that the law violated her right to equal treatment . A federal judge and a federal appeals court agreed , declaring DOMA unconstitutional .
During her argument to the court , Ms. Kaplan was asked whether she believed that the lawmakers who passed DOMA in 1996 were motivated by moral disapproval of gay people .
DOMA passed with overwhelming bipartisan support . The vote was 85 to 15 in the Senate and 342 to 67 in the House of Representatives . Then-President Bill Clinton signed it into law .
“ Times can blind , ” Kaplan told the justices . “ Back in 1996 people did not have the understanding that they have today. ” She said many Americans in 1996 thought that gay couples were fundamentally different from straight couples . That misconception has been largely erased , she said .
“ I suppose the sea change has a lot to do with the political force and effectiveness of people supporting your side of the case , ” Chief Justice Roberts asked .
Kaplan disagreed . She said gay-rights activists have less political power today than women had in the early 1970s .
“ As far as I can tell , political figures are falling over themselves to endorse your side of the case , ” Roberts said .
In his final appeal to the high court , Mr. Clement , the lawyer defending DOMA , told the justices that the political process is helping to resolve the gay marriage issue state by state and at the national level .
He said it comes down to a combination of political power and persuasion . “ That ’ s what the democratic process requires . You have to persuade somebody you ’ re right , ” he said .
“ You don ’ t label them a bigot . You don ’ t label them as motivated by animus , ” he said . “ You persuade them you are right . ”
Clement added : “ That is going on across the country. ” He noted that even Congress was not immune , that they had repealed the ‘ don ’ t ask , don ’ t tell ’ restrictions on gays in the military .

What DOMA does

DOMA restricts the receipt of federal marriage benefits to opposite-sex couples by defining marriage as a union between one man and one woman.

By using that traditional definition of marriage, same-sex spouses who are legally married in states permitting gay marriage are blocked from receiving the same 1,100 benefits available to opposite-sex spouses.

Unlike every heterosexual married couple in the United States, married homosexuals cannot file joint tax returns, receive spousal Social Security benefits, or qualify for family health insurance for married federal employees.

The solicitor general added: “I think it’s time for this court to recognize that this discrimination, excluding lawfully married gay and lesbian couples from federal benefits, cannot be reconciled with our fundamental commitment to equal treatment under law.”

Historic two days

Coming on the heels of Tuesday’s oral argument on California’s Proposition 8 ban on same-sex marriage, the high court’s sessions over the past two days mark a historic reexamination of gay rights in America.

With recent polls showing that between 53 and 58 percent of Americans now approve of same-sex marriage, gay-rights advocates say full recognition and equal rights for gay and lesbian married couples is inevitable. They stress that the high court should act now to strike down Proposition 8 and DOMA and stake out a position on the right side of history.

Supporters of the traditional definition of marriage are urging the high court to take a go-slow approach and permit the controversy over same-sex marriage to continue to percolate through the democratic process.

Nine states and the District of Columbia authorize same-sex marriages. Eight other states provide domestic partnerships for same-sex couples.

On the other side, 31 states have passed constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriages, and a handful of other states have enacted statutes to achieve the same result.

A question of equal protection

The question in the DOMA case is whether the statute violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection.

“Because of DOMA, many thousands of people who are legally married … are being treated as unmarried by the federal government solely because they are gay,” said Roberta Kaplan, a New York lawyer for the plaintiff in the case, Edith Windsor.

The high court case stems from a lawsuit filed by Ms. Windsor following the passing of her lifelong companion, partner, and spouse, Thea Spyer. They spent 44 years together in New York with a dream that someday they would be able to marry.

The couple were married in Canada in 2007. Ms. Spyer passed away two years later and left her estate to her wife. Federal law allows a spousal exemption from the estate tax. But DOMA’s definition of marriage meant that only opposite-sex couples could claim the exemption.

The IRS treated Windsor as if she and Spyer were complete strangers. Windsor was forced to pay $363,000 in estate taxes that would not have been owed if her spouse had been a man.

Windsor filed suit in federal court charging that the law violated her right to equal treatment. A federal judge and a federal appeals court agreed, declaring DOMA unconstitutional.

Changing times

During her argument to the court, Ms. Kaplan was asked whether she believed that the lawmakers who passed DOMA in 1996 were motivated by moral disapproval of gay people.

DOMA passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. The vote was 85 to 15 in the Senate and 342 to 67 in the House of Representatives. Then-President Bill Clinton signed it into law.

“Times can blind,” Kaplan told the justices. “Back in 1996 people did not have the understanding that they have today.” She said many Americans in 1996 thought that gay couples were fundamentally different from straight couples. That misconception has been largely erased, she said.

“I suppose the sea change has a lot to do with the political force and effectiveness of people supporting your side of the case,” Chief Justice Roberts asked.

Kaplan disagreed. She said gay-rights activists have less political power today than women had in the early 1970s.

“As far as I can tell, political figures are falling over themselves to endorse your side of the case,” Roberts said.

Let the political process run its course?

In his final appeal to the high court, Mr. Clement, the lawyer defending DOMA, told the justices that the political process is helping to resolve the gay marriage issue state by state and at the national level.

He said it comes down to a combination of political power and persuasion. “That’s what the democratic process requires. You have to persuade somebody you’re right,” he said.

“You don’t label them a bigot. You don’t label them as motivated by animus,” he said. “You persuade them you are right.”

Clement added: “That is going on across the country.” He noted that even Congress was not immune, that they had repealed the ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ restrictions on gays in the military.

He urged the justices to allow the democratic process to continue.

Our original post — ""Tears Of Joy As Same-Sex Marriages Begin In New Jersey"":

Minutes after midnight, as Sunday turned into Monday, gay couples in towns and cities across New Jersey said their ""I do's"" as the state became the 14th to allow same-sex marriages.

The legal path was cleared for them Friday, as we reported, when the state's Supreme Court rejected a request to halt such ceremonies.

In Newark early Monday, Mayor Cory Booker (a Democrat who last week won a special election for the U.S. Senate) declared ""it is officially past midnight, [and] marriage is equal in New Jersey,"" as he began a series of ceremonies in city hall.

According to The Star-Ledger:

""At one point, the event took a particularly emotional turn. As Booker married Gabriela Celeiro and Liz Salerno, the two held each other and got teary. "" 'There's some law about making a mayor cry, ' he joked. 'It's illegal.' ""He later said he had to collect himself before marrying the next couple.""

There was at least one demonstrator at Newark's city hall. The Associated Press says ""there was a brief disruption from a protester who cried out, 'This is unlawful in the eyes of God and Jesus Christ.' ""

According to the Star-Ledger, police removed the man. Then there was applause when Booker resumed the ceremony by saying: ""not hearing any substantive and worthy objections ...""

The brief marked the first time that the Obama administration has come out in court against Prop 8 and the first time it has argued against state gay marriage ban before the Supreme Court .
The administration 's argument also could reverberate beyond California . If the Supreme Court accepts the arguments in the brief , it could lay the groundwork toward undermining laws against gay marriage in several other states .
`` The exclusion of gay and lesbian couples from marriage does not substantially further any important governmental interest . Proposition 8 thus violates equal protection , '' wrote Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. in a `` friend of the court '' brief filed in favor of gay and lesbian couples challenging Prop 8 .
Now that it has filed a Supreme Court amicus brief , the Obama administration most likely will be granted time to actually argue its position in front of the justices . When the government files an amicus brief in an important case , it is normally granted time to argue .
A statement on behalf of ProtectMarriage.com , the proponent of Prop 8 , described the Obama administration 's decision to weigh in both `` unprecedented '' and `` hardly surprising , but nevertheless disturbing . ''
`` In his first term as president , Obama clearly stated that Americans can choose a special designation of marriage between man and woman , and that supporters of traditional marriage can hold that position without animus , '' said the statement by Andy Pugno , general counsel for ProtectMarriage.com . `` He later remarked that it would be a 'mistake ' to make the debate over redefining marriage into a federal issue .
`` Yet today , '' the statement added , `` by stating that the traditional definition of marriage is rooted only in irrational prejudice , the president has impugned the motives and actions of millions of Californians and turned his back on society 's long-standing interest in both mothers and fathers raising the next generation . ''
Thomas Peters , communications director for the National Organization for Marriage , another gay marriage opponent , invoked California 's voters in saying the group expected the court to uphold the law .
`` NOM expects the Supreme Court to exonerate the votes of over 7 million Californians to protect marriage , '' said Peters . `` The president is clearly fulfilling a campaign promise to wealthy gay marriage donors . There is no right to redefine marriage in our Constitution . ''
However , referring to proponents of the voter-approved measure who are defending it in court , Verrilli wrote , `` Petitioners contend that Proposition 8 serves an interest in returning the issue of marriage to the democratic process , but use of a voter initiative to promote democratic self-governance can not save a law like Proposition 8 that would otherwise violate equal protection . ''
The Obama administration brief noted that California extends all of the rights and responsibilities of marriage to gay and lesbians , but forbids them the designation of `` marriage . ''
That circumstance `` particularly undermines the justifications for Proposition 8 , '' Verrilli wrote .
While the brief fell short of calling for a fundamental right to marriage under the Constitution , it suggested that if the court were to agree with the administration 's position , gay marriage laws in seven other states could be in jeopardy . Those states are Delaware , Hawaii , Illinois , Nevada , New Jersey , Oregon and Rhode Island .
`` The brief pays closest attention to California and the other seven states that grant same-sex couples all the rights and responsibilities of marriage but insist on denying them the favored name , '' said Jane S. Schacter , a professor at Stanford Law School . `` But it advocates that the court adopt a much tougher , more skeptical approach to any state law that denies same-sex couples the right to marry .
`` That approach is what lawyers call 'heightened scrutiny , ' '' she added , `` and if it were faithfully applied to all state laws banning same-sex marriage , it would result in the invalidation of those laws . The administration 's brief provides a blueprint for a national right-to-marriage equality , even though it does not advocate that in express terms . ''
Stephen I. Vladeck , a professor of law at American University of Law , called it the `` tip of a much larger anti-discrimination iceberg . ''
According the brief , Vladeck said , `` states ca n't discriminate against gays without a really strong reason -- not just with respect to marriage , but adoption , employment , benefits and so on . ''
Today , 39 states have laws restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples . This number includes voter-approved constitutional amendments in 30 states barring same sex marriage . Nine states allow gay marriage .
`` The brief filed by the solicitor general is a powerful statement that Proposition 8 can not be squared with the principles of equality upon which this nation was founded , '' said Adam Umhoefer executive director of the American Foundation for Equal Rights ( AFER ) , the group behind the challenge of Prop 8 .

Members of the committee voted unanimously to reaffirm the language in the GOP platform defining marriage `` as the union of one man and one woman . '' The resolution went further , asking the U.S. Supreme Court to `` uphold the sanctity of marriage in its rulings on Proposition 8 and the Federal Defense of Marriage Act . ''
An ███-Washington Post poll conducted in March found that 58 percent of Americans said it should be legal for gay and lesbian couples to marry .

After the Republican National Committee hinted at new outreach to gay voters , and possibly changing its stance or at least its tone on gay-rights issues , 11 influential social-conservative groups aired their grievances in a letter addressed to Priebus timed to coincide with the start of the RNC 's meeting .
Led by Family Research Council President Tony Perkins , who told donors not to give national Republican leaders `` a dime of your hard-earned money '' until the party clarified its positions on social issues .
`` We respectfully warn GOP leadership that an abandonment of its principles will necessarily result in the abandonment of our constituents to their support , '' the groups warned Priebus . `` We could not change that even if we wished to . ''
The group of signers included a who 's who of prominent social conservative organizations : American Values President Gary Bauer ; Family-PAC Federal Director Paul Caprio and VP of Government Affairs Sandy Rios ; Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser ; Family Talk Action President and founder James Dobson ; Traditional Values Coalition President Andrea Lafferty and founder Louis P. Sheldon ; CitizenLink President Tom Minnery ; Religious Freedom Coaliion William J. Murray ; Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute President Austin Ruse ; Eagle Forum President Phyllis Schlafly ; and American Family Association President Tim Wildmon .
Perkins trumpeted the letter on his blog on the Family Research Council website , writing that the coalition had `` made it quite clear what the RNC stood to lose by running left-of-center on issues like life and marriage , adding that `` until the RNC and the other national Republican organizations grow a backbone and start defending core principles , do n't give them a dime of your hard-earned money . ''
The letter hinted that Republicans may be softening on gay rights issues .
In seeking to reboot the party after its 2012 election losses , Priebus and the RNC released a `` Growth and Opportunity Project '' report that suggested multiple changes to make the party more appealing to a broader swath of voters , including gays and lesbians .
`` Already , there is a generational difference within the conservative movement about issues involving the treatment and the rights of gays — and for many younger voters , these issues are a gateway into whether the party is a place they want to be , '' the report 's authors wrote .
While Perkins said that passing the anti-gay marriage resolution would be `` a gesture of good faith '' other Republicans balked . Two former RNC employees wrote an op-ed in the National Review on Thursday urging the committee members gathered in Los Angles to reject it .
`` As former RNC operatives , we firmly believe that passage of the resolution would be a significant setback in terms of party unity and branding , and would move the RNC further into a function that is outside its primary purpose : winning elections , '' wrote former staffers Liz Mair and Marco Nuñez .
The resolution , passed on Friday , was proposed by Dave Agema , an RNC committeeman from Michigan who recently posted an article on his Facebook page that refers to gays and lesbians as `` filthy . ''
A prominent segment of the Republican base , social conservatives helped elect George W. Bush in 2004 , and social-conservative activists have exerted a powerful influence over the Iowa GOP caucuses , a key hurdle for Republican presidential contenders , which surprised many by handing victories to Mike Huckabee in 2008 and Rick Santorum in 2012 .
One signature that was noticeably missing from the letter was that of leading social conservative Bob Vander Plaats . Vander Plaats led socially conservative initiatives in Iowa through his Family Leader organization and gives his full support to the views expressed in the letter .
`` If I was asked to sign the letter , I definitely would have , '' Vander Plaats told ███ .
`` A lot of people in the party are concerned that the party will sell out our values in order to win , and if you do that what do you really win ? '' he continued .
Vander Plaats also agreed with the prediction that the GOP would lose support if it follows the recommendations of the `` Growth and Oppotunity Project '' to the letter .

It 's possible that Republicans ' big electoral victories in November blinded them to just how controversial this would be . Gov . Asa Hutchison , R-Ark. , and Gov . Mike Pence , R-Ind. , seemed genuinely taken aback by the demand for boycotts and the backlash from big corporations like Eli Lilly , WalMart and Apple , as well as the NCAA .
It 's as if Republicans — particularly in the deep-red states of Arkansas and Indiana — operate according to a different political calculus , insulated from the divide between their own conservative constituents and changing national opinion . Because of redistricting and the phenomenon of a midterm electorate that leans a lot more Republican than a presidential-year electorate , there are now many more GOP governors and many more conservative majorities in state legislatures . And those majorities are moving forward with an agenda that satisfies their base of social conservatives but is seen as intolerant and divisive by the business community and a growing majority of voters in the country . This week , those two opposing dynamics reignited the culture war , with Republican politicians as the first casualties .
Yes ! It 's about a much bigger , much more fundamental problem for the GOP . A new Pew poll showed that 61 percent of young Republicans favor gay marriage . Hutchinson said his own son signed a petition asking him to veto the bill that he instead sent back to the Legislature for revision .
The Republicans ca n't appeal to young voters if they 're on the wrong side of gay marriage , because gay rights is a symbol of tolerance for so many young voters — not to mention suburban women . The same is true for one of the fastest-growing parts of the electorate — Hispanics . How do Republicans show Hispanics that they are welcoming and inclusive if they oppose a path to legalization for hard-working immigrants here illegally ?
The views of the GOP 's white , older , conservative primary electorate are farther away from the center of American public opinion than the Democratic base is right now . That 's the challenge for the GOP — it needs to project an image of tolerance in order to win the White House while at the same time satisfying its conservative base , which , in this case , wants Christian florists , bakers and photographers to have the right to refuse services to gay weddings . It will take a very talented candidate to square that circle .
3 ) OK , so how will Republican candidates resolve this larger tension ?
Good question ! The debates during the primaries will , presumably , reveal the answer .
Of all the GOP presidential hopefuls , Jeb Bush has given this the most thought . He seems determined not to fall into the trap that Mitt Romney did in 2012 — moving so far to the right during the GOP primaries ( remember `` self deportation '' ? ) that he could n't make it back to the center to win the general election .
Bush has said his strategy is to run as if he 's willing `` to lose the primary in order to win the general . ''
4 ) How 's that working out for Jeb Bush so far ?
Politics Conservatives Heckle Jeb Bush On Education , Immigration Conservatives Heckle Jeb Bush On Education , Immigration Listen · 3:34 3:34
Not so great . All the leading Republican presidential hopefuls , including Bush , came out in favor of the Arkansas and Indiana bills . By Wednesday , though , Bush was backtracking , insisting that religious freedom is a core value but that we also should n't discriminate based on sexual orientation .
Bush did n't explain how he would balance those two values , only that he was sure Indiana would `` get to that place . ''
So , for Bush , the `` lose the primary '' strategy sometimes means sticking to his principles in opposition to the GOP base ( as he has on immigration reform and Common Core education standards ) but sometimes , on issues like religious freedom , he seems to fuzz it up .
Meanwhile , Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas , has no doubts about what side he 's on . In Iowa on Wednesday , Cruz blasted the `` big business '' wing of the GOP , saying they are `` running shamelessly to endorse the radical , gay marriage agenda over religious liberty. ``","Fights Over 'Religious Freedom' And Gay Rights Are Costing Republicans

Following a firestorm of criticism, Republican governors in Indiana and Arkansas signed revised versions of their states' Religious Freedom Restoration bills Thursday night. In Indiana the language was adjusted, and in Arkansas it was significantly scaled back to more closely align with the federal law.

National Republicans, especially the ones running for president, have to hope it's enough to get them out of the hole they dug themselves on religious freedom and gay rights. It's worth taking a look at what the whole brouhaha has cost the GOP.

In the spirit of Passover, here are four questions about what this issue means for the GOP:

1) Why didn't Republicans anticipate this firestorm?

Politics Republicans Face Backlash Over Indiana, Arkansas 'Religious Freedom' Laws Republicans Face Backlash Over Indiana, Arkansas 'Religious Freedom' Laws Listen · 3:54 3:54

It's possible that Republicans' big electoral victories in November blinded them to just how controversial this would be. Gov. Asa Hutchison, R-Ark., and Gov. Mike Pence, R-Ind., seemed genuinely taken aback by the demand for boycotts and the backlash from big corporations like Eli Lilly, WalMart and Apple, as well as the NCAA.

It's as if Republicans — particularly in the deep-red states of Arkansas and Indiana — operate according to a different political calculus, insulated from the divide between their own conservative constituents and changing national opinion. Because of redistricting and the phenomenon of a midterm electorate that leans a lot more Republican than a presidential-year electorate, there are now many more GOP governors and many more conservative majorities in state legislatures. And those majorities are moving forward with an agenda that satisfies their base of social conservatives but is seen as intolerant and divisive by the business community and a growing majority of voters in the country. This week, those two opposing dynamics reignited the culture war, with Republican politicians as the first casualties.

2) Is this about more than just religious freedom?

Yes! It's about a much bigger, much more fundamental problem for the GOP. A new Pew poll showed that 61 percent of young Republicans favor gay marriage. Hutchinson said his own son signed a petition asking him to veto the bill that he instead sent back to the Legislature for revision.

The Republicans can't appeal to young voters if they're on the wrong side of gay marriage, because gay rights is a symbol of tolerance for so many young voters — not to mention suburban women. The same is true for one of the fastest-growing parts of the electorate — Hispanics. How do Republicans show Hispanics that they are welcoming and inclusive if they oppose a path to legalization for hard-working immigrants here illegally?

The views of the GOP's white, older, conservative primary electorate are farther away from the center of American public opinion than the Democratic base is right now. That's the challenge for the GOP — it needs to project an image of tolerance in order to win the White House while at the same time satisfying its conservative base, which, in this case, wants Christian florists, bakers and photographers to have the right to refuse services to gay weddings. It will take a very talented candidate to square that circle.

3) OK, so how will Republican candidates resolve this larger tension?

Good question! The debates during the primaries will, presumably, reveal the answer.

Of all the GOP presidential hopefuls, Jeb Bush has given this the most thought. He seems determined not to fall into the trap that Mitt Romney did in 2012 — moving so far to the right during the GOP primaries (remember ""self deportation""?) that he couldn't make it back to the center to win the general election.

Bush has said his strategy is to run as if he's willing ""to lose the primary in order to win the general.""

4) How's that working out for Jeb Bush so far?

Not so great. All the leading Republican presidential hopefuls, including Bush, came out in favor of the Arkansas and Indiana bills. By Wednesday, though, Bush was backtracking, insisting that religious freedom is a core value but that we also shouldn't discriminate based on sexual orientation.

Bush didn't explain how he would balance those two values, only that he was sure Indiana would ""get to that place.""

So, for Bush, the ""lose the primary"" strategy sometimes means sticking to his principles in opposition to the GOP base (as he has on immigration reform and Common Core education standards) but sometimes, on issues like religious freedom, he seems to fuzz it up.

Meanwhile, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has no doubts about what side he's on. In Iowa on Wednesday, Cruz blasted the ""big business"" wing of the GOP, saying they are ""running shamelessly to endorse the radical, gay marriage agenda over religious liberty. """,www.npr.org,center,cXGBbZiZZT1ugnFW

Evangelical leaders are taking a step back from their decades-long fight against gay marriage , softening their tone and recalibrating their goals .
In recent interviews with about a half-dozen prominent evangelicals , no one listed opposition to gay marriage as their top priority . The leaders said they 're more focused on protecting religious liberties as same-sex marriage becomes legal in a growing number of states .
`` Is it time to differentiate between religious ceremony and civil ceremony ? '' Jim Daly , the president of Focus on the Family , said in an interview with CNN . `` Civil ceremony to the Christian community is no different than getting your car registered . ''
The shifting attitude comes as the Supreme Court could take up gay marriage as early as next year . Meanwhile , Republicans , who will take full control of Congress in January , are largely ignoring the issue -- just like most of the leading potential GOP contenders for the 2016 presidential nomination .
`` There is a recognition that while the fight should not be given up on upholding the several thousand-year-old definition of marriage , the courts are probably very quickly going to undo that , '' said Erick Erickson , a conservative pundit and editor of RedState.com . `` Behind the scenes , a lot of evangelical leaders inside and outside of politics are laying the groundwork for religious liberty and conscience protections . ''
The new stance could have big implications for Republicans heading into the 2016 presidential election . Evangelicals are an influential bloc of the party and if the community eases its opposition to same-sex marriage , that could make it easier for candidates to do the same . The party is under pressure to expand its appeal to young people and minorities and an openness to gay marriage could help that effort .

Of course , there 's still plenty of opposition to same-sex marriage among Republicans . And the issue is a big fundraising motivator for the party and its allies .
Vincent Harris , a 26-year-old digital strategist who 's worked for evangelical favorites like Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee said social issues including gay marriage `` remain very potent to the Republican electorate . ''
Brian Brown , president of the National Organization for Marriage , dismissed talk of an evangelical shift as a `` joke notion . ''
`` People are still charged up about this , '' Brown said . `` There 's not been enough standing up for marriage especially in the wake of what is essentially a constitutional crisis . ''
Daly , whose daily Focus on the Family radio broadcast reach more than 2.9 million listeners weekly , is nowhere close to endorsing same-sex unions and insists that the legalization of gay marriage in the U.S. is n't a `` fait accompli . '' But his vision for the evangelical movement is focused on reaching out to , rather than attacking or rejecting , other segments of society—what he calls taking a `` gracious attitude . ''
He frequently mentioned his `` friends in the gay rights community . ''
One of those friends is Ted Trimpa , a prominent gay activist and Democratic strategist . The two struck up an unlikely friendship after Daly reached out to Trimpa 's office about two years ago to team up and fight child trafficking in their home state of Colorado .
They see their bond as an example of where the dialogue is heading , through Trimpa said `` people faint when they see us together . ''

`` With Jim , it 's a new day , '' Trimpa said . `` The reality of it is gays are n't going away and evangelicals are n't going away so we 're figuring out common ground . ''
Russell Moore , the president of the Southern Baptist Convention 's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission , is also advocating for a more open approach and has called for Christians to `` love your gay and lesbian neighbors . ''
`` If we do n't recognize ( the culture shift ) , we 're clueless as to what is happening , '' Moore said in an interview .
Matthew Vines , meanwhile , is an openly gay evangelical who recently published a book attempting to debunk Biblical interpretations that define homosexuality as a sin . He went to a conference sponsored by Moore 's group in October and was surprised that even his staunchest critics constructively interacted with him . He said he would have been `` completely ignored '' at the convention five years ago .
`` There 's definitely a coming divide between evangelicals , but it 's not public yet , '' Vines said . `` Over the next year in particular , people will start to show their true colors . ''
About 43 % of white evangelical millennials support same-sex marriage , according to a 2014 Public Religion Research Institute poll , while 7 in 10 white evangelicals overall oppose same-sex marriage . The generational split is even more pronounced among the GOP : nearly two-thirds of Republicans under 30 favor same sex marriage compared to 39 % of all Republicans , according to the Pew Research Center survey .
GOP leaders are eyeing those polls closely and in the last two years , four Republican senators have announced their support for same-sex marriage . This year , the GOP fielded two openly gay Republican candidates for Congress -- though neither won .
Some , like Republican strategist and LGBT activist Margaret Hoover , say the party is changing too slowly and needs to put its opposition to gay marriage to rest .
`` I think the fact that the majority of Republicans do n't support same sex marriage or LGBT freedom is detrimental to reaching out and connecting to a new generation of voters , '' said Hoover , who is also a CNN political commentator .
Hoover runs the American Unity PAC , which spent more than $ 4 million in the 2014 cycle to support pro-gay marriage and LGBT rights Republican candidates , according to the group 's pre-election Federal Elections Commission filing .
The GOP could see at least one pro-gay marriage presidential candidate in the 2016 elections if Sen . Rob Portman -- who has a gay son and endorsed same-sex marriage in 2013 -- decides to seek the party 's nomination .
`` When Mitt Romney was the nominee of the party , could you have imagined that there could be a Republican nominee the next time around who is in favor of same-sex marriage ? Even I could n't have imagined that , '' Hoover said .","Story highlights Evangelical leaders aren't listing opposition to gay marriage as their top priority

Of course, there's still plenty of opposition to same-sex marriage among Republicans. And the issue is a big fundraising motivator for the party and its allies.

Vincent Harris, a 26-year-old digital strategist who's worked for evangelical favorites like Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee said social issues including gay marriage ""remain very potent to the Republican electorate.""

'Joke notion'

Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, dismissed talk of an evangelical shift as a ""joke notion.""

""People are still charged up about this,"" Brown said. ""There's not been enough standing up for marriage especially in the wake of what is essentially a constitutional crisis.""

Daly, whose daily Focus on the Family radio broadcast reach more than 2.9 million listeners weekly, is nowhere close to endorsing same-sex unions and insists that the legalization of gay marriage in the U.S. isn't a ""fait accompli."" But his vision for the evangelical movement is focused on reaching out to, rather than attacking or rejecting, other segments of society—what he calls taking a ""gracious attitude.""

He frequently mentioned his ""friends in the gay rights community.""

One of those friends is Ted Trimpa, a prominent gay activist and Democratic strategist. The two struck up an unlikely friendship after Daly reached out to Trimpa's office about two years ago to team up and fight child trafficking in their home state of Colorado.

They see their bond as an example of where the dialogue is heading, through Trimpa said ""people faint when they see us together.""

'Common ground'

""With Jim, it's a new day,"" Trimpa said. ""The reality of it is gays aren't going away and evangelicals aren't going away so we're figuring out common ground.""

Russell Moore, the president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, is also advocating for a more open approach and has called for Christians to ""love your gay and lesbian neighbors.""

""If we don't recognize (the culture shift), we're clueless as to what is happening,"" Moore said in an interview.

Matthew Vines, meanwhile, is an openly gay evangelical who recently published a book attempting to debunk Biblical interpretations that define homosexuality as a sin. He went to a conference sponsored by Moore's group in October and was surprised that even his staunchest critics constructively interacted with him. He said he would have been ""completely ignored"" at the convention five years ago.

""There's definitely a coming divide between evangelicals, but it's not public yet,"" Vines said. ""Over the next year in particular, people will start to show their true colors.""

Generational divide

About 43% of white evangelical millennials support same-sex marriage, according to a 2014 Public Religion Research Institute poll, while 7 in 10 white evangelicals overall oppose same-sex marriage. The generational split is even more pronounced among the GOP: nearly two-thirds of Republicans under 30 favor same sex marriage compared to 39% of all Republicans, according to the Pew Research Center survey.

GOP leaders are eyeing those polls closely and in the last two years, four Republican senators have announced their support for same-sex marriage. This year, the GOP fielded two openly gay Republican candidates for Congress -- though neither won.

Some, like Republican strategist and LGBT activist Margaret Hoover, say the party is changing too slowly and needs to put its opposition to gay marriage to rest.

""I think the fact that the majority of Republicans don't support same sex marriage or LGBT freedom is detrimental to reaching out and connecting to a new generation of voters,"" said Hoover, who is also a CNN political commentator.

Hoover runs the American Unity PAC, which spent more than $4 million in the 2014 cycle to support pro-gay marriage and LGBT rights Republican candidates, according to the group's pre-election Federal Elections Commission filing.

The GOP could see at least one pro-gay marriage presidential candidate in the 2016 elections if Sen. Rob Portman -- who has a gay son and endorsed same-sex marriage in 2013 -- decides to seek the party's nomination.

""When Mitt Romney was the nominee of the party, could you have imagined that there could be a Republican nominee the next time around who is in favor of same-sex marriage? Even I couldn't have imagined that,"" Hoover said.",www.cnn.com,left,rXB9OACjy0Q5GwVB

Amendments like this have already passed in 31 states , including North Carolina in May .

“ Every day that goes by without a marriage amendment in our state constitution is a day that Minnesota ’ s definition of marriage is in jeopardy of being redefined by an activist judge , ” Chuck Darrell of Minnesota for Marriage said recently when 25 gay couples filed lawsuits seeking to marry in Illinois .

So far , all personhood amendments have been defeated by voters : A 2011 measure in Mississippi that was widely expected to pass was soundly rejected instead . Voters later said they feared it would prohibit infertile couples from using reproductive technologies to have children or outlaw all abortions , including cases where the mother ’ s life was in danger .
Petition drives to put personhood measures on the ballot are currently under way in three states , with a June 22 deadline for the Montana Pro-Life Coalition , July 4 for Personhood Ohio , and Aug. 6 for Personhood Colorado .
A personhood petition drive in Nevada is over , as insufficient signatures were collected for the June 19 deadline , Anna Maria Serra-Radford , president of Personhood Nevada , said last week . “ We ’ ll definitely be regrouping . We ’ ll definitely be doing this again , ” she said .

Ruben Navarrette : Liz Cheney should recognize that same-sex marriage is about freedom
He says his brother , who is gay , persuaded him to change his view on marriage
Republicans portray themselves as the party of family values . Yet , in Wyoming , one prominent group of right wing kinfolk will spend the holidays embroiled in a family feud .
You do n't get to choose your family . Still , family members might choose a destructive lifestyle that puts them at odds with loved ones . They make others uncomfortable , and hurt those who love them . These people are often thinking only of themselves , and they have n't considered the consequences of their behavior .
Liz Cheney is one of these people . And the destructive lifestyle she has chosen is that of a politician .
The Republican Senate candidate from Wyoming is running to the right of Republican incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi . And because that might not be so easy to do , whenever the challenger offers an opinion on a topic , it 's difficult to know if she 's speaking from the heart -- or pandering to the lowest common denominator .
An independent political group calling itself the American Principles Fund , which is defending Enzi , recently launched an ad attacking Cheney for opposing a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage and supporting the decision of the State Department to give benefits to same-sex partners of employees .
This week , while calling on Enzi to denounce the ad and labeling it `` gutter politics , '' Cheney stood by those earlier positions . During an interview on `` Fox News Sunday , '' she said :
`` I do n't believe we ought to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation . If people are in a same-sex relationship and they want their partner to be able to have health benefits or be designated as a beneficiary on their life insurance , there 's no reason we should n't do that . ''
Nonetheless , that ad puts Cheney in a tight spot , and given that Wyoming is a very conservative state and given that she 's trying to position herself on the far right of the spectrum , she ca n't be seen as soft on same-sex marriage .
Thus , in the same interview , she made clear that she does n't favor allowing same-sex couples to wed and that she supports `` the traditional definition of marriage . ''
It 's a position that Cheney has long held . That is part of the problem . In a country where , as public opinion polls make clear , the opinion of so many Americans on same-sex marriage is rapidly evolving due in large part to the fact that young Americans consider this a nonissue , it would have been good to see some personal growth from Cheney .
Besides , she should tread lightly on this subject . Why ? Because blood is thicker than votes . And because Michael Corleone was right , and -- even in the rough and tumble of politics -- you `` do n't ever take sides with anyone against the family . ''
And , for the Cheney family , this issue is personal . Liz 's sister , Mary , is in a same-sex marriage and has two children with her wife and longtime companion , Heather Poe .
`` I love Mary very much . I love her family very much . This is just an issue in which we disagree , '' Cheney said on `` Fox News Sunday . ''
Mary Cheney was n't having any of it . Not long after the interview , she posted this rebuttal on Facebook :
`` Liz -- this is n't just an issue on which we disagree -- you 're just wrong -- and on the wrong side of history . ''
Mary also shared a post by Poe , who was likewise bothered by Liz 's comments . It read :
`` I was watching my sister-in-law on Fox News Sunday ( yes Liz , in fifteen states and the District of Columbia you are my sister-in-law ) and was very disappointed to hear her say ' I do believe in the traditional definition of marriage ....
`` Liz has been a guest in our home , has spent time and shared holidays with our children , and when Mary and I got married in 2012 -- she did n't hesitate to tell us how happy she was for us .
`` To have her now say she does n't support our right to marry is offensive to say the least . ''
Here is what Liz Cheney missed : To many proponents of marriage equality , the very idea of `` traditional marriage '' is offensive . You see , tradition is the antithesis of progress . It was once tradition that women did n't have the right to vote , and African-Americans used separate restrooms , and U.S.-born Mexican-Americans were swept up in immigration sweeps . Those things had to change , and they did . In those instances , Americans decided that tradition should take a back seat to things like fairness , justice and equality .
This year , Christmas dinner at the Cheney house is bound to be awkward . The kids are fighting , and that sort of thing always hurts the parents most of all .
`` This is an issue we have dealt with privately for many years , and we are pained to see it become public , '' Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife , Lynne , said Monday in a statement .

Cheney's sister, who is in a same-sex marriage, says Liz is on the wrong side of history

Ruben Navarrette: Liz Cheney should recognize that same-sex marriage is about freedom

He says his brother, who is gay, persuaded him to change his view on marriage

Republicans portray themselves as the party of family values. Yet, in Wyoming, one prominent group of right wing kinfolk will spend the holidays embroiled in a family feud.

You don't get to choose your family. Still, family members might choose a destructive lifestyle that puts them at odds with loved ones. They make others uncomfortable, and hurt those who love them. These people are often thinking only of themselves, and they haven't considered the consequences of their behavior.

Liz Cheney is one of these people. And the destructive lifestyle she has chosen is that of a politician.

The Republican Senate candidate from Wyoming is running to the right of Republican incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi. And because that might not be so easy to do, whenever the challenger offers an opinion on a topic, it's difficult to know if she's speaking from the heart -- or pandering to the lowest common denominator.

An independent political group calling itself the American Principles Fund, which is defending Enzi, recently launched an ad attacking Cheney for opposing a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage and supporting the decision of the State Department to give benefits to same-sex partners of employees.

Ruben Navarrette Jr.

This week, while calling on Enzi to denounce the ad and labeling it ""gutter politics,"" Cheney stood by those earlier positions. During an interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" she said:

""I don't believe we ought to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation. If people are in a same-sex relationship and they want their partner to be able to have health benefits or be designated as a beneficiary on their life insurance, there's no reason we shouldn't do that.""

Nonetheless, that ad puts Cheney in a tight spot, and given that Wyoming is a very conservative state and given that she's trying to position herself on the far right of the spectrum, she can't be seen as soft on same-sex marriage.

Thus, in the same interview, she made clear that she doesn't favor allowing same-sex couples to wed and that she supports ""the traditional definition of marriage.""

It's a position that Cheney has long held. That is part of the problem. In a country where, as public opinion polls make clear, the opinion of so many Americans on same-sex marriage is rapidly evolving due in large part to the fact that young Americans consider this a nonissue, it would have been good to see some personal growth from Cheney.

Besides, she should tread lightly on this subject. Why? Because blood is thicker than votes. And because Michael Corleone was right, and -- even in the rough and tumble of politics -- you ""don't ever take sides with anyone against the family.""

And, for the Cheney family, this issue is personal. Liz's sister, Mary, is in a same-sex marriage and has two children with her wife and longtime companion, Heather Poe.

""I love Mary very much. I love her family very much. This is just an issue in which we disagree,"" Cheney said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

Mary Cheney wasn't having any of it. Not long after the interview, she posted this rebuttal on Facebook:

""Liz -- this isn't just an issue on which we disagree -- you're just wrong -- and on the wrong side of history.""

Mary also shared a post by Poe, who was likewise bothered by Liz's comments. It read:

""I was watching my sister-in-law on Fox News Sunday (yes Liz, in fifteen states and the District of Columbia you are my sister-in-law) and was very disappointed to hear her say 'I do believe in the traditional definition of marriage....

This year, Christmas dinner at the Cheney house is bound to be awkward. The kids are fighting, and that sort of thing always hurts the parents most of all.

[ Updated at 12:12 p.m . ET ] It 's the end of a busy morning of momentous rulings from the Supreme Court . We 're still working on getting analysis on and reaction to the two landmark decisions that will impact marriage between same-sex couples in the United States and we 'll bring that to you on CNN.com , CNN 's mobile apps and CNN TV .
We 'll sign off this live blog now , thanks for reading . Here are links to more of the coverage we already have :
Our main story : Supreme Court rulings on same-sex marriage hailed as historic victory
Details on the DOMA case : Supreme Court strikes down federal provision on same-sex marriage benefits
Details on the Proposition 8 case : Supreme Court dismisses California 's Proposition 8 appeal
From CNN Money : The financial impact of the same-sex marriage ruling
[ Updated at 11:49 a.m . ET ] Religion and marriage are intricately tied together for many and our Belief blog co-editor Daniel Burke has got a range of reaction from believers and non-believers .
Former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee is one of those looking at the decisions through a religion lens :
5 people in robes said they are bigger than the voters of CA and Congress combined.And bigger than God.May He forgive us all . —
[ Updated at 11:43 a.m . ET ] Both the decisions affecting same-sex marriage were 5-4 splits . And the dissenting justices put out some strong opinions of their own .
Few public controversies touch an institution so central to the lives of so many , and few inspire such attendant passion by good people on both sides . Few public controversies will ever demonstrate so vividly the beauty of what our Framers gave us , a gift the Court pawns today to buy its stolen moment in the spotlight : a system of government that permits us to rule ourselves . Some will rejoice in today 's decision , and some will despair at it ; that is the nature of a controversy that matters to much to so many . But the Court has cheated both sides , robbing the winners of an honest victory , and the losers of the peace that comes from a fair defeat . We owed both of them better . I dissent .
What the Court fails to grasp or accept is the basic premise of the initiative process . And it is this . The essence of democracy is that the right to make law rests in the people and flows to the government , not the other way around . Freedom resides first in the people without need of a grant from government . The California initiative process embodies these principles and has done so for over a century ... In California and the 26 other States that permit initiatives and popular referendums , the people have exercised their own inherent sovereign right to govern themselves . The Court today frustrates that choice .
[ Updated at 11:35 a.m . ET ] Kris Perry , one of the key figures in the Proposition 8 case , said it was a victory not just for couples wanting to wed but also children . `` No matter where you live , no matter who your parents are , no matter what kind of family you 're in , you are equal , you are as good as your friends ' parents and your friends . ''
She added : `` We can go back to California and say to our own children - all four of our boys - your family is just as good as everybody else 's family . ''
[ Updated at 11:20 a.m . ET ] There are a lot of rainbow flags flying today . Including on Google if you search `` gay . ''
[ Updated at 11:11 a.m . ET ] Family Research Council president Tony Perkins released a statement saying his group was `` disappointed '' in the DOMA ruling and `` disturbed '' by the detail of the Proposition 8 decision but that it also took some heart from the Supreme Court 's actions .
“ Their refusal to redefine marriage for all states is a major setback for those seeking to redefine natural marriage , '' he said . `` Time is not on the side of those seeking to create same-sex ‘ marriage. ’ As the American people are given time to experience the actual consequences of redefining marriage , the public debate and opposition to the redefinition of natural marriage will undoubtedly intensify . ''
He concluded : “ What is inevitable is that the male and female relationship will continue to be uniquely important to the future of society . The reality is that society needs children , and children need a mom and a dad . We will continue to work to restore and promote a healthy marriage culture , which will maximize the chances of a child being raised by a married mother and father . ”
[ Updated at 11:08 a.m . ET ] The Human Rights Campaign , which has pushed for LGBT equality , is declaring two `` monumental victories . '' Here 's the top of their statement :
In recent years , California ’ s Proposition 8 and the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act became symbols of anti-LGBT discrimination around the country and around the world . Today , both crumbled .
In a watershed moment in the fight for equality , the United States Supreme Court today ruled to return marriage equality to California and to strike down DOMA . The court ruled in the Prop 8 case on procedural grounds , not reaching a decision on the merits of Prop 8 or the broader question of whether the Constitution guarantees the fundamental right to marry the person you love .
Marriages in California are expected to begin again soon . While a joyous milestone , these victories nonetheless throw into sharp relief the uneven progress for LGBT people around the country—a landscape where states like California are rapidly advancing toward equality , but progress in many other places remains stagnant .
[ Updated at 11:05 a.m . ET ] A little more detail on exactly what the Proposition 8 decision by the Supreme Court means : By dismissing the case , the decision will allow for the lower court decision in California that allows for same-sex marriage to be reinstated . The appeals court stay on the decision will be lifted .
[ Updated at 10:59 a.m . ET ] Here 's what Hollywood is saying - some reactions from celebrities , many of whom have campaigned for gay rights .
Remember the old days when # DOMA was around and gay people could n't get married in California ? Crazy right ! ? —
# DOMA IS DEAD ! ! ! # SCOTUS has done the right thing , and now the love of my life and I can get our constitutionally guarunteed rights ! Wahooo ! —
Today marks a watershed moment in history and a tremendous victory for the principle of equality . The 5-4 decision by our Supreme Court striking down DOMA affirms the universality of love–the desire of all people not only to find , but to value and affirm , a lifelong commitment to another person . I have lived nearly four score years , and have borne witness to both the heartbreak and promise of true justice and equality in America . Today my heart soars , and my faith in the promise of our great nation is renewed . Now , if there 's anything we gays know how to do well , it is to celebrate ! Let the joy of this day ring out with PRIDE .
[ Updated at 10:47 a.m . ET ] The key couples in the California case just held their arms aloft in celebration on the steps of the Supreme Court building . `` This is a great day for America , '' said one of their lawyers , David Boies .
[ Updated at 10:46 a.m . ET ] So what 's your reaction to the rulings today ?
[ Updated at 10:38 a.m . ET ] It sounds like we 'll be looking into these rulings for a while – Jeffrey Toobin just said the Proposition 8 case was `` a puzzling decision '' and a `` puzzling '' line-up of justices who backed the decision .
The opinion about Proposition 8 was written by Chief Justice Roberts who was joined by Justice Scalia , a conservative , and three liberals – Justices Breyer , Ginsburg and Kagan .
[ Updated at 10:35 a.m . ET ] Same-sex marriage can resume in California - that 's the result of the Supreme Court ruling just in that dismisses an appeal regarding California 's Proposition 8 .
The Supreme Court has dismissed a closely-watched appeal over same-sex marriage on jurisdictional grounds , ruling Wednesday private parties do not have `` standing '' to defend California 's voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbians couples from state-sanctioned wedlock . The ruling permits same-sex couples in California to legally marry . The 5-4 decision avoids for now a sweeping conclusion on whether same-sex marriage is a constitutionally-protected `` equal protection '' right that would apply to all states . The case is Hollingsworth v. Perry ( 12-144 ) .
[ Updated at 10:30 a.m . ET ] New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman told CNN the ruling was a `` great win . '' `` “ A great win not just for the gay community , it ’ s a great win for the American tradition of equal justice under the law , ” he said .
[ Updated at 10:29 a.m . ET ] House Speaker John Boehner was just asked about the DOMA case , but he declined comment until he 's read the ruling .
[ Updated at 10:26 a.m . ET ] The ruling on Proposition 8 - California 's ban on same-sex marriage - is in .
[ Updated at 10:23 a.m . ET ] And yes , the president was watching . His Twitter account is calling the DOMA ruling `` a historic step forward , '' though it 's not signed with the `` bo '' that shows he wrote it .
Today 's DOMA ruling is a historic step forward for # MarriageEquality . # LoveIsLove —
[ Updated at 10:22 a.m . ET ] President Obama was going to be monitoring the rulings on Air Force One as he heads to Senegal , CNN 's Jessica Yellin reports .
[ Updated at 10:17 a.m . ET ] Supporters of same-sex marriage waiting outside the Supreme Court cheered the DOMA decision . Reaction is also coming in from Twitter .
DNC chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said that `` finally '' all married couples would get benefits .
Finally , married couples will enjoy the federal benefits and protections they 've been denied for years . # DOMA # SCOTUS —
[ Updated at 10:15 a.m . ET ] Of course we ca n't draw any conclusions from the DOMA ruling about which way the justices will decide on California 's Proposition 8 .
[ Updated at 10:12 a.m . ET ] The justices were split 5-4 . The majority ruling was written by Justice Anthony Kennedy . Dissents were written by Chief Justice John Roberts , Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Samuel Alito .
[ Updated at 10:09 a.m . ET ] Legal expert Jeffrey Toobin puts the ruling in context : `` DOMA is gone . ''
[ Updated at 10:08 a.m . ET ] From our team in Washington :
The Supreme Court has struck down a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act , ruling that same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits .
[ Updated at 10:06 a.m . ET ] This is the case where Edie Windsor said she had to pay more in inheritance tax than warranted because her spouse was a woman not a man .
[ Updated at 10:02 a.m . ET ] We 're reading the decision to see how the justices ruled regarding the rights of legally married same-sex couples to receive federal benefits provided to heterosexual spouses .
[ Updated at 10:01 a.m . ET ] There is a ruling in the DOMA case .
[ Updated at 10:00 a.m . ET ] So it 's 10 a.m. in the nation 's capital and the Supreme Court should be sitting . No cameras inside the court of course , so we can only assume they are good timekeepers .
[ Updated at 9:54 a.m . ET ] Two days ago Lady Gaga called on the Supreme Court to `` make history & stand for MARRIAGE EQUALITY . '' That 's now been retweeted nearly 14,000 times . But will it have had any impact on the nine justices ?
Let 's go DOMA . Supreme Court lets make history & stand for MARRIAGE EQUALITY ! # GetItDoneThisWeek # TheWhole WorldIsWatching —
[ Updated at 9:50 a.m . ET ] Here are some of the people who were n't specifically part of the cases argued before the Supreme Court but who will almost certainly be affected by the rulings . CNN 's Moni Basu profiled gay couples who are at the center of two big political debates – same-sex marriage and immigration .
[ Updated at 9:44 a.m . ET ] While we 're waiting for the opinions to be delivered , here 's Donna Brazile 's take on yesterday 's landmark ruling on the Voting Rights Act . The Democratic strategist says it 's time for President Obama and Congress to pass a new Voting Rights Act .
[ Updated at 9 : 40 a.m . ET ] A quick reminder that you can watch our reporting live on CNN TV as well as refreshing this page and staying with CNN on CNN.com and our mobile apps .
[ Updated at 9:19 a.m . ET ] Large crowds are gathering outside the Supreme Court in Washington D.C. and on social media . Right now we can see rainbow gay pride banners and blue flags with a yellow `` = '' sign that is a standard of those fighting for more rights for same-sex couples . Not in view are groups who support traditional marriage between a man and a woman , but that 's not to say they 're not there . Both sides were strongly represented when the Supreme Court heard the arguments back in March .
On Twitter , # DOMA will probably start trending soon . There 's certainly a lot of people tweeting about the Supreme Court today .
The Tie the Knot organization that wants marriage equality tweeted `` The big day is here . ''
We 've gone red to show our support for marriage equality . Read more about what 's at stake at # SCOTUS : glaad.org/marriage —
Or that the Family Research Council is backing traditional unions .

Odd : in spring , it looked like Prop 8 was the big case ; today , stakes appear higher on DOMA . # scotus # 10amtoday —
[ Posted at 9:05 a.m . ET ] It 's set to be the last public day of the Supreme Court session , and we 're waiting for opinions in three cases - two of which address same-sex marriage .
It 's widely expected that we 'll get rulings on the federal Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) and California 's Proposition 8 , and those rulings could affect the lives , rights and finances of millions of Americans .
CNN Supreme Court producer Bill Mears writes that DOMA , passed in 1996 , defines marriage as between one man and one woman for federal purposes , like taxes . `` That means the estimated 120,000 gay and lesbian couples legally married in nine states and the District of Columbia are still considered - in the eyes of DOMA opponents - the equivalent of girlfriend and boyfriend . ''
That meant that Edie Windsor faced a hefty bill for inheritance taxes when her partner of 42 years died . She claimed in court that she had had to pay $ 363,053 more than if her spouse , thea Spyer , had been a man .
But Mears points out that the DOMA issue is more than just a financial question :
The larger debate over DOMA 's intent and impact 17 years after passage has driven a wedge between the executive and legislative branches . At issue is what role the federal government should play when it comes to marriage - something states have traditionally controlled .
The other key case expected to be decided today considers Proposition 8 . `` In the 'Prop 8 ' case , the high court is being asked to establish a constitutional 'equal protection ' right . It is the kind of hot-button issue that will define our society , our laws , our views on family , '' Mears writes .","The Supreme Court issues two key rulings affecting same-sex marriage in the U.S.

And this is George Takei on Facebook:

Today marks a watershed moment in history and a tremendous victory for the principle of equality. The 5-4 decision by our Supreme Court striking down DOMA affirms the universality of love–the desire of all people not only to find, but to value and affirm, a lifelong commitment to another person. I have lived nearly four score years, and have borne witness to both the heartbreak and promise of true justice and equality in America. Today my heart soars, and my faith in the promise of our great nation is renewed. Now, if there's anything we gays know how to do well, it is to celebrate! Let the joy of this day ring out with PRIDE.

[Updated at 10:47 a.m. ET] The key couples in the California case just held their arms aloft in celebration on the steps of the Supreme Court building. ""This is a great day for America,"" said one of their lawyers, David Boies.

[Updated at 10:46 a.m. ET] So what's your reaction to the rulings today?

[Updated at 10:38 a.m. ET] It sounds like we'll be looking into these rulings for a while – Jeffrey Toobin just said the Proposition 8 case was ""a puzzling decision"" and a ""puzzling"" line-up of justices who backed the decision.

The opinion about Proposition 8 was written by Chief Justice Roberts who was joined by Justice Scalia, a conservative, and three liberals – Justices Breyer, Ginsburg and Kagan.

[Updated at 10:35 a.m. ET] Same-sex marriage can resume in California - that's the result of the Supreme Court ruling just in that dismisses an appeal regarding California's Proposition 8.

From our colleague Bill Mears:

The Supreme Court has dismissed a closely-watched appeal over same-sex marriage on jurisdictional grounds, ruling Wednesday private parties do not have ""standing"" to defend California's voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbians couples from state-sanctioned wedlock. The ruling permits same-sex couples in California to legally marry. The 5-4 decision avoids for now a sweeping conclusion on whether same-sex marriage is a constitutionally-protected ""equal protection"" right that would apply to all states. The case is Hollingsworth v. Perry (12-144).

[Updated at 10:30 a.m. ET] New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman told CNN the ruling was a ""great win."" ""“A great win not just for the gay community, it’s a great win for the American tradition of equal justice under the law,” he said.

[Updated at 10:29 a.m. ET] House Speaker John Boehner was just asked about the DOMA case, but he declined comment until he's read the ruling.

[Updated at 10:26 a.m. ET] The ruling on Proposition 8 - California's ban on same-sex marriage - is in.

[Updated at 10:23 a.m. ET] And yes, the president was watching. His Twitter account is calling the DOMA ruling ""a historic step forward,"" though it's not signed with the ""bo"" that shows he wrote it.

Today's DOMA ruling is a historic step forward for #MarriageEquality. #LoveIsLove —

Barack Obama (@BarackObama) June 26, 2013

[Updated at 10:22 a.m. ET] President Obama was going to be monitoring the rulings on Air Force One as he heads to Senegal, CNN's Jessica Yellin reports.

[Updated at 10:17 a.m. ET] Supporters of same-sex marriage waiting outside the Supreme Court cheered the DOMA decision. Reaction is also coming in from Twitter.

DNC chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said that ""finally"" all married couples would get benefits.

Finally, married couples will enjoy the federal benefits and protections they've been denied for years. #DOMA #SCOTUS —

[Updated at 10:15 a.m. ET] Of course we can't draw any conclusions from the DOMA ruling about which way the justices will decide on California's Proposition 8.



[Updated at 10:12 a.m. ET] The justices were split 5-4. The majority ruling was written by Justice Anthony Kennedy. Dissents were written by Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Samuel Alito.

[Updated at 10:09 a.m. ET] Legal expert Jeffrey Toobin puts the ruling in context: ""DOMA is gone.""

[Updated at 10:08 a.m. ET] From our team in Washington:

The Supreme Court has struck down a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act, ruling that same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits.

[Updated at 10:06 a.m. ET] This is the case where Edie Windsor said she had to pay more in inheritance tax than warranted because her spouse was a woman not a man.

[Updated at 10:02 a.m. ET] We're reading the decision to see how the justices ruled regarding the rights of legally married same-sex couples to receive federal benefits provided to heterosexual spouses.

[Updated at 10:01 a.m. ET] There is a ruling in the DOMA case.

[Updated at 10:00 a.m. ET] So it's 10 a.m. in the nation's capital and the Supreme Court should be sitting. No cameras inside the court of course, so we can only assume they are good timekeepers.

[Updated at 9:54 a.m. ET] Two days ago Lady Gaga called on the Supreme Court to ""make history & stand for MARRIAGE EQUALITY."" That's now been retweeted nearly 14,000 times. But will it have had any impact on the nine justices?

Let's go DOMA. Supreme Court lets make history & stand for MARRIAGE EQUALITY! #GetItDoneThisWeek #TheWhole WorldIsWatching —

[Updated at 9:50 a.m. ET] Here are some of the people who weren't specifically part of the cases argued before the Supreme Court but who will almost certainly be affected by the rulings. CNN's Moni Basu profiled gay couples who are at the center of two big political debates – same-sex marriage and immigration.

[Updated at 9:44 a.m. ET] While we're waiting for the opinions to be delivered, here's Donna Brazile's take on yesterday's landmark ruling on the Voting Rights Act. The Democratic strategist says it's time for President Obama and Congress to pass a new Voting Rights Act.

[Updated at 9: 40 a.m. ET] A quick reminder that you can watch our reporting live on CNN TV as well as refreshing this page and staying with CNN on CNN.com and our mobile apps.

[Updated at 9:19 a.m. ET] Large crowds are gathering outside the Supreme Court in Washington D.C. and on social media. Right now we can see rainbow gay pride banners and blue flags with a yellow ""="" sign that is a standard of those fighting for more rights for same-sex couples. Not in view are groups who support traditional marriage between a man and a woman, but that's not to say they're not there. Both sides were strongly represented when the Supreme Court heard the arguments back in March.

On Twitter, #DOMA will probably start trending soon. There's certainly a lot of people tweeting about the Supreme Court today.

The Tie the Knot organization that wants marriage equality tweeted ""The big day is here.""

Jeffrey Toobin (@JeffreyToobin) June 26, 2013

[Posted at 9:05 a.m. ET] It's set to be the last public day of the Supreme Court session, and we're waiting for opinions in three cases - two of which address same-sex marriage.

It's widely expected that we'll get rulings on the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and California's Proposition 8, and those rulings could affect the lives, rights and finances of millions of Americans.

CNN Supreme Court producer Bill Mears writes that DOMA, passed in 1996, defines marriage as between one man and one woman for federal purposes, like taxes. ""That means the estimated 120,000 gay and lesbian couples legally married in nine states and the District of Columbia are still considered - in the eyes of DOMA opponents - the equivalent of girlfriend and boyfriend.""

That meant that Edie Windsor faced a hefty bill for inheritance taxes when her partner of 42 years died. She claimed in court that she had had to pay $363,053 more than if her spouse, thea Spyer, had been a man.

But Mears points out that the DOMA issue is more than just a financial question:

The larger debate over DOMA's intent and impact 17 years after passage has driven a wedge between the executive and legislative branches. At issue is what role the federal government should play when it comes to marriage - something states have traditionally controlled.

The other key case expected to be decided today considers Proposition 8. ""In the 'Prop 8' case, the high court is being asked to establish a constitutional 'equal protection' right. It is the kind of hot-button issue that will define our society, our laws, our views on family,"" Mears writes.",www.news.blogs.cnn.com,left,DZBXaSd1W6LmGXJ6

Since when did enabling people - especially children - in their confused mental state become `` loving '' ? Much less become a vehicle to sell soda ? I know what many of you are thinking .

But these procedures and the propaganda push for acceptance of trangenderism as normal , like this Sprite commercial , come at a time when a rising chorus of doctors and psychiatrists say `` transitioning '' is destructive and dangerous for children .
Dr. Michael Laidlaw , an endocrinologist based in Rocklin , California , says medical associations themselves have been subverted with trans propaganda not backed up by research .
As ███ News has reported , Dr. Laidlaw told The Christian Post that the Endocrine Society , Pediatric Endocrine Society , and the American Academy of Pediatrics have been taken over by the most radical elements of the profession .
`` These radical trans activists were involved in writing the Endocrine Society guidelines in 2009 and 2017 . These are low to no quality evidence guidelines , and anyone can read for themselves the poor evidence they have for these treatments for children and adolescents .

But that kind of research is not what 's promoted by the trans activist ideologues in media or medicine .
In March , the United Kingdom 's The Telegraph reported that Oxford University professor , Dr. Michael Biggs , accused the National Health Service 's clinic for transgender children of hiding negative evidence about the effects of puberty blockers on children . Instead , Biggs claimed , the clinic is continuing experimental treatment on adolescents without solid evidence of its long-term effects .
Dr. Biggs ' own research suggests that after a year of treatment `` a significant increase '' was found in patients who had been born female telling staff that they `` deliberately try to hurt or kill myself , '' according to the Telegraph .
Biggs says the evidence showed that `` Puberty blockers exacerbated gender dysphoria . Yet the study has been used to justify rolling out this drug regime to several hundred children aged under 16 . ''
Dr. Laidlaw equates the `` gender affirmative '' treatment now in vogue with brainwashing young children . They are psychologically damaged by puberty blockers , he believes , and then made even more confused , depressed and even psychotic by cross-sex hormones , according to the CP .
`` The puberty blockers are a drug-induced model of not only blocking essential aspects of development but also solidifying the belief that they must take wrong sex hormones to escape from their situation . These wrong sex hormones are very dangerous and have blood clots , cardiovascular , and cancer risks . ''
Dr. John McHugh , a distinguished professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University , calls this chemical treatment of minors who are uncomfortable with their birth sex `` reckless and irresponsible . ''
`` Many people are doing what amounts to an experiment on these young people without telling them it 's an experiment ... You need evidence for that , and this is a very serious treatment . It is comparable to doing frontal lobotomies . ''
McHugh believes there could be a link between feelings of transgenderism and poor mental health .
`` I think their mental problems , often depression , discouragement , are the things that need treatment , '' he said . `` I 'm not positive about this . It 's a hypothesis , but it is a very plausible hypothesis , and it would explain why many of the people who go on to have treatment of their body discover they are just as depressed , discouraged , and live just as problematic lives as they did before , because they did not address the primary problem .

Additionally , McHugh referenced the results of a 2018 study that would indicate a cautious approach to treatment is a better option . The study was reportedly censored by Brown University in Providence , Rhode Island , after the survey 's lead researcher , professor Lisa Littman , discovered a `` contagion effect '' with transgenderism among children .
`` In on-line forums , parents have been reporting that their children are experiencing what is described here as 'rapid-onset gender dysphoria , ' appearing for the first time during puberty or even after its completion , '' wrote Littman , an assistant professor of behavioral sciences at Brown . `` The onset of gender dysphoria seemed to occur in the context of belonging to a peer group where one , multiple , or even all of the friends have become gender dysphoric and transgender-identified during the same timeframe . ''
Gender confusion among young people , McHugh said , is `` mostly being driven by psychological and psychosocial problems these people have , '' which , he added , `` explains the rapid onset gender dysphoria Lisa Littman has spelled out . ''
With that in mind , what effect will this Sprite commercial have on suggestive children ? How many will be beset by this `` contagion effect '' and suddenly think they must be transgender ?
With all the scientific reasons not to promote trangenderism in medicine or on TV , maybe it 's time to remember one more -- Genesis 1:27 :

Sprite has a new commercial coming to your TV screens. I'll tell you right up front that I found it chilling.

It is a supposedly sympathetic, loving spot where parents indulge their children's transgender fantasies that they can actually be someone they were not born to be.

A few days before , friends of the married father of two had recommended the Turkish spa as treatment for his long-term joint and muscle troubles . The nighttime visit had proved to be a disastrous mistake .
Heavily armed riot police herded dozens of terrified men dressed in just the spa ’ s checkered towels through the changing rooms into waiting trucks . Some who were wearing clothes were forced to strip half-naked in front of the TV crew that kept filming , even as the prisoners tried to cover their faces .
Mohamed found himself swept along with others in the chaos . In the corner , Egyptian TV presenter Mona Iraqi quietly recorded the horrific raid on her iPhone , photos she gleefully posted on her public Facebook page later that evening .
The Dec. 7 raid , in which 26 men were detained , was the single largest mass arrest of alleged gays the country has seen in decades . The last time there was a raid of this scale was in 2001 , when 52 men were arrested on Queen Boat , a floating disco on the Nile . The resulting trial in that case sparked an international uproar and marred Egypt ’ s human-rights record forever .
“ I ’ m not gay , I ’ m married with kids . I wasn ’ t doing anything illegal in that bathhouse , I was just sitting there , ” Mohamed told his lawyer from his prison cell . But now his life is in tatters—he is facing prison time , he could lose his job , his reputation is in ruins , and his family has been publicly humiliated .
All 26 men were in court last week charged with “ debauchery , ” all of them subjected to humiliating forensic “ anal checks ” to determine their sexuality .
Since the ouster of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013 , the authorities have launched the harshest crackdown on the LGBT community since the days of toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak , as the country ’ s “ morality police ” look to boost their popularity ratings with the conservative Egyptian public .
There have been at least 50 cases similar to the bathhouse raid in the last 18 months , human-rights groups estimate . This means more than 150 gay and transgender people are languishing in the country ’ s jail cells despite the fact that , technically , homosexuality is not illegal in Egypt .
These days the Egyptian pro-regime media are increasingly colluding with the security forces who invite them to broadcast the raids—even thought that ’ s illegal . In Mohamed ’ s case , TV host Iraqi instigated the bust : She had sent undercover camera crews to the bathhouse weeks before to spy on the men and reportedly alerted the police to what she claimed was a “ den of inequity . ”
“ She worked together with the police—it was a publicity stunt and without her the arrests simply wouldn ’ t have happened , ” said Scott Long , a rights activist closely following the cases .
The only repercussions Iraqi has faced are outside of Egypt , as she lost her place in an upcoming Swiss Film Festival , he added .
“ Internationally there has been a lot of horror and contempt for her actions , domestically very little , ” he said .
The 26 were beaten by the bailiffs as they filed into a caged dock , sobbing , on Dec. 21 . Through the chaos , as police tried to drown out the screams of the distraught families , one of the defendants said they had been badly beaten in detention and forced to sleep on their stomachs .
Mohamed ’ s lawyer , who works for the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights and has represented many other men sent to trial on similar charges , has little hope they will be acquitted .
“ It ’ s extremely frustrating—for a start , we can not defend them as we still don ’ t have the case files or know the proper charges . And it comes after several similar cases where people have been jailed on no evidence , ” Mohamed Bakir told me after the hearing .
Just last month , eight men were sentenced to three years in jail for appearing in a video the judge said depicted the country ’ s first gay marriage . In the 60-second clip posted on YouTube , two men wearing tuxedoes exchanged rings , hugged and kissed on the cheek while their friends partied in the background on a Nile riverboat .
They were found guilty of practicing habitual debauchery and inciting others to sexual deviance because of the footage .
“ There is nothing whatsoever in the video which supports the charges—it shows no criminal activity , ” Bakir said .
The eight appealed the verdict , which was reduced to one year in prison this week but it should have been an acquittal , the lawyer added .
The televised raids—broadcast on national television to dramatic cop-show music— and high-profile court cases are driving the terrified community further underground . The younger members , who , under toppled President Morsi , had felt secure enough to start a fledging gay-rights movement on social media , now say it is too dangerous to even meet online .
The police have stepped up their Internet surveillance capabilities , forcing gay dating apps like Grindr to warn their members about publishing addresses or phone numbers on their profiles . They even switched off their location service—one of the main perks of the program .
“ It ’ s terrifying and crazy—to know that you are targeted by your own government for committing no crime other than being sexually different , ” said Amr Ahmed , a young gay man who has frequently visited the bathhouse where the men were arrested .
The 25-year-old student said it was one of the few safe meeting venues left for the poorer members of the community who can not afford the expensive bars in Cairo ’ s wealthier districts , where the police are paid to turn a blind eye .
He said the new collaboration of the media with the police was the most worrying development as it meant , aside from a few human-rights lawyers , there is no one left to hold the security apparatus to account and to protect the vulnerable community .
“ Mona Iraqi is responsible for 25 families losing their lives , ” he said , speaking figuratively . “ In my eyes she killed those people… exposing a gay person like this is akin to torturing him slowly to death . ”
“ It ’ s simple , we are being hunted—and that , apparently , makes good TV . But it ’ s not journalism , if anyone has committed a crime it is her , ” said Ahmed .
Iraqi faced an enormous backlash internationally for her actions , which she justified by saying the footage was part of a series of programs aimed at educating the population on the spread of AIDS .
Egypt has a comparatively low number of HIV cases compared to the rest of Africa , with just 11,000 infected people nationwide . But according to UNICEF , there is a rising HIV epidemic in vulnerable communities , including among men who have sex with men and for intravenous drug users .
Iraqi claimed in her lugubrious “ exposé ” that the bathhouse was a hotbed for HIV transmission—a statement human-rights workers fear will misguide the public , as more than 70 percent of HIV transmissions in Egypt occur through heterosexual sex .
“ There hasn ’ t been any attempts by the Ministry of Health to distance themselves from what she said or to spread accurate information , ” said activist Long . “ It is extremely damaging to HIV education and to the cause of human rights in general , as it shows the government is willing to sell out people ’ s privacy for the sake of publicity . ”
Gay-rights activists , who risk their lives to defend the community , say Iraqi and other journalists like her should face criminal charges for breaking the law by filming the raid and for spreading false information about HIV .
“ We need to have clear rules about what is allowed to be posted on media channels—we get crazy people saying non-scientific statements every day , it ’ s dangerous , ” said Ramy Youssef , a young gay man who has bravely started an online campaign against jailing of homosexuals in an attempt to educate the public and undo the damage . The campaign ’ s most recent hashtag— “ stop informer journalists ” —encouraged participants to copy in Mona Iraqi ’ s Twitter account to hammer home the message .
Operations like Iraqi ’ s TV show will also make it harder for aid workers to reach out to the vulnerable population for testing , treatment , or awareness of HIV .
Youssef , who came out publicly on social media in 2012 , said the police are trying to “ suffocate ” all the places where LGBT community members can meet , because they are an easy target .
“ The community is very vulnerable—it is the weakest link in society . Whenever the government gets bad press , they say let ’ s go for the gays . It diverts people ’ s attention from what is really happening , ” he said .
Youssef says he believes the latest crackdown is part of the current military-backed leadership ’ s plan to prove it is more Islamic than the one that Islamists ousted in 2013 , while bolstering the popularity of the police force , which lost favor with the people after the 2011 revolution .
Jailing homosexuals accused of “ sexual pervasion ” is a convenient way for the regime to present itself as reputable and a caretaker of public morals .
Youssef said the jailings are not only driving the community underground but pushing many to move abroad .
“ Nowhere is safe for us now , ” he said , “ We have simple dreams to have a partner , a house , to be able to go to a gay bar , but none of these are options in Egypt now , ” he said .","CAIRO—Mohamed was sitting in the steam room nursing his bad back when dozens of Egypt’s black-clad police officers burst into the downtown Cairo bathhouse with a TV crew in tow and started to arrest everyone.

Heavily armed riot police herded dozens of terrified men dressed in just the spa’s checkered towels through the changing rooms into waiting trucks. Some who were wearing clothes were forced to strip half-naked in front of the TV crew that kept filming, even as the prisoners tried to cover their faces.

Mohamed found himself swept along with others in the chaos. In the corner, Egyptian TV presenter Mona Iraqi quietly recorded the horrific raid on her iPhone, photos she gleefully posted on her public Facebook page later that evening.

The Dec. 7 raid, in which 26 men were detained, was the single largest mass arrest of alleged gays the country has seen in decades. The last time there was a raid of this scale was in 2001, when 52 men were arrested on Queen Boat, a floating disco on the Nile. The resulting trial in that case sparked an international uproar and marred Egypt’s human-rights record forever.

“I’m not gay, I’m married with kids. I wasn’t doing anything illegal in that bathhouse, I was just sitting there,” Mohamed told his lawyer from his prison cell. But now his life is in tatters—he is facing prison time, he could lose his job, his reputation is in ruins, and his family has been publicly humiliated.

All 26 men were in court last week charged with “debauchery,” all of them subjected to humiliating forensic “anal checks” to determine their sexuality.

Since the ouster of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, the authorities have launched the harshest crackdown on the LGBT community since the days of toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak, as the country’s “morality police” look to boost their popularity ratings with the conservative Egyptian public.

There have been at least 50 cases similar to the bathhouse raid in the last 18 months, human-rights groups estimate. This means more than 150 gay and transgender people are languishing in the country’s jail cells despite the fact that, technically, homosexuality is not illegal in Egypt.

These days the Egyptian pro-regime media are increasingly colluding with the security forces who invite them to broadcast the raids—even thought that’s illegal. In Mohamed’s case, TV host Iraqi instigated the bust: She had sent undercover camera crews to the bathhouse weeks before to spy on the men and reportedly alerted the police to what she claimed was a “den of inequity.”

“She worked together with the police—it was a publicity stunt and without her the arrests simply wouldn’t have happened,” said Scott Long, a rights activist closely following the cases.

The only repercussions Iraqi has faced are outside of Egypt, as she lost her place in an upcoming Swiss Film Festival, he added.

“Internationally there has been a lot of horror and contempt for her actions, domestically very little,” he said.

The 26 were beaten by the bailiffs as they filed into a caged dock, sobbing, on Dec. 21. Through the chaos, as police tried to drown out the screams of the distraught families, one of the defendants said they had been badly beaten in detention and forced to sleep on their stomachs.

The trial was postponed until Jan. 4.

Mohamed’s lawyer, who works for the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights and has represented many other men sent to trial on similar charges, has little hope they will be acquitted.

“It’s extremely frustrating—for a start, we cannot defend them as we still don’t have the case files or know the proper charges. And it comes after several similar cases where people have been jailed on no evidence,” Mohamed Bakir told me after the hearing.

Just last month, eight men were sentenced to three years in jail for appearing in a video the judge said depicted the country’s first gay marriage. In the 60-second clip posted on YouTube, two men wearing tuxedoes exchanged rings, hugged and kissed on the cheek while their friends partied in the background on a Nile riverboat.

They were found guilty of practicing habitual debauchery and inciting others to sexual deviance because of the footage.

“There is nothing whatsoever in the video which supports the charges—it shows no criminal activity,” Bakir said.

The eight appealed the verdict, which was reduced to one year in prison this week but it should have been an acquittal, the lawyer added.

The televised raids—broadcast on national television to dramatic cop-show music— and high-profile court cases are driving the terrified community further underground. The younger members, who, under toppled President Morsi, had felt secure enough to start a fledging gay-rights movement on social media, now say it is too dangerous to even meet online.

The police have stepped up their Internet surveillance capabilities, forcing gay dating apps like Grindr to warn their members about publishing addresses or phone numbers on their profiles. They even switched off their location service—one of the main perks of the program.

“It’s terrifying and crazy—to know that you are targeted by your own government for committing no crime other than being sexually different,” said Amr Ahmed, a young gay man who has frequently visited the bathhouse where the men were arrested.

The 25-year-old student said it was one of the few safe meeting venues left for the poorer members of the community who cannot afford the expensive bars in Cairo’s wealthier districts, where the police are paid to turn a blind eye.

He said the new collaboration of the media with the police was the most worrying development as it meant, aside from a few human-rights lawyers, there is no one left to hold the security apparatus to account and to protect the vulnerable community.

“Mona Iraqi is responsible for 25 families losing their lives,” he said, speaking figuratively. “In my eyes she killed those people… exposing a gay person like this is akin to torturing him slowly to death.”

“It’s simple, we are being hunted—and that, apparently, makes good TV. But it’s not journalism, if anyone has committed a crime it is her,” said Ahmed.

Iraqi faced an enormous backlash internationally for her actions, which she justified by saying the footage was part of a series of programs aimed at educating the population on the spread of AIDS.

Egypt has a comparatively low number of HIV cases compared to the rest of Africa, with just 11,000 infected people nationwide. But according to UNICEF, there is a rising HIV epidemic in vulnerable communities, including among men who have sex with men and for intravenous drug users.

Iraqi claimed in her lugubrious “exposé” that the bathhouse was a hotbed for HIV transmission—a statement human-rights workers fear will misguide the public, as more than 70 percent of HIV transmissions in Egypt occur through heterosexual sex.

“There hasn’t been any attempts by the Ministry of Health to distance themselves from what she said or to spread accurate information,” said activist Long. “It is extremely damaging to HIV education and to the cause of human rights in general, as it shows the government is willing to sell out people’s privacy for the sake of publicity.”

Gay-rights activists, who risk their lives to defend the community, say Iraqi and other journalists like her should face criminal charges for breaking the law by filming the raid and for spreading false information about HIV.

“We need to have clear rules about what is allowed to be posted on media channels—we get crazy people saying non-scientific statements every day, it’s dangerous,” said Ramy Youssef, a young gay man who has bravely started an online campaign against jailing of homosexuals in an attempt to educate the public and undo the damage. The campaign’s most recent hashtag—“stop informer journalists”—encouraged participants to copy in Mona Iraqi’s Twitter account to hammer home the message.

Operations like Iraqi’s TV show will also make it harder for aid workers to reach out to the vulnerable population for testing, treatment, or awareness of HIV.

Youssef, who came out publicly on social media in 2012, said the police are trying to “suffocate” all the places where LGBT community members can meet, because they are an easy target.

“The community is very vulnerable—it is the weakest link in society. Whenever the government gets bad press, they say let’s go for the gays. It diverts people’s attention from what is really happening,” he said.

Youssef says he believes the latest crackdown is part of the current military-backed leadership’s plan to prove it is more Islamic than the one that Islamists ousted in 2013, while bolstering the popularity of the police force, which lost favor with the people after the 2011 revolution.

Jailing homosexuals accused of “sexual pervasion” is a convenient way for the regime to present itself as reputable and a caretaker of public morals.

Youssef said the jailings are not only driving the community underground but pushing many to move abroad.

“Nowhere is safe for us now,” he said, “We have simple dreams to have a partner, a house, to be able to go to a gay bar, but none of these are options in Egypt now,” he said.",www.thedailybeast.com,left,0erke60Ed7cQjZay
